               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have said that his hands were dirty? - Yes, they were dirty, all his fingers grease and oil.</p>
               <p>Had Pilkington his hat on when you took him? - Yes, I think he had.</p>
               <p>And his coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you been much accustomed to the apprehending of coiners? - Yes, I have been at the places where they are.</p>
               <p>You then know that they do not usually work with their hats on? - They work at different parts, some tie up the papers, there are generally two, one to turn the fly and the other to feed the press.</p>
               <p>The man that got away had not his hat on? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor his coat? - No, I think the coining was carried on at No. 18.</p>
               <p>Are you sure? - It was the middle house of the three.</p>
               <p>Who lived in that house? - There was a woman that was big with child, and another in her arms; the prisoner Charlton when he was brought to me, was worse than a chimney-sweeper.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Pilkington lived at No. 19? - Yes, he did, when I saw Pilkington's wife, I knew her, and was not surprised.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the breach in the wall was not secured and nailed up with boards,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220132"></xptr> so as no person could pass through it? - No, it was not, the communication was open by Pilkington's fire place, there are three that work at the stamping press, two at the fly, and one to feed it.</p>

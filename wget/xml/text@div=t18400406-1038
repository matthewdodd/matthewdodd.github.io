                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Old-street, St. Luke's. On the 12th of March, in consequence of information from Mrs. Marks, I ran out into the street, and saw the prisoner in the middle of the road, carrying something, but what I could not see, as it was a foggy night—he gate it to two boys on the other side of the street, and ran down to the City-road—I followed him—he stopped just at the turning, took off his frock, and put it under his arm—I told him I wanted him—he asked what for—I said, "Never mind what for"—he in<lb></lb>stantly ran off—I followed, calling" Stop him," and a policeman took him—I had him taken back to my house, and missed a chair—I gave him in charge, and as I came from the station-house a boy brought it back to the door, called out, "There is your chair," and ran away.</p>

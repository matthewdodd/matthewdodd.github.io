                  </hi>. I live at No. 50, Peppercorn-street, Gravesend. I have known the prisoner about eighteen months. I came up from Graves<lb></lb>end on the 10th of October, and arrived at Black wall between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day—I met the prisoner by accident—he wished me to go and take some refreshment—I went with him to the first public-house on the left-hand side of the way—he called for a glass of gin and water, which I did not see him pay for—he then called for a pint of ale, and said, "You may as well pay for this"—I took out my purse with the in<lb></lb>tention of doing so, and must have let it <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> in my lap—I put my hand in<lb></lb>to my lap, with my purse in it—there were two sovereigns, two half-sove<lb></lb>reigns, two half-crowns, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—he paid some halfpence for what we had had—he called a Jew pedlar who was there, from the garden, and wished me to have a brooch—I said it was stupidness of him, for I wanted nothing of the kind, and the Jew went away—the prisoner wished me to go to his lodgings, which I did—there was an old woman there—he offered to take me to Drury-lane theatre—I was at his lodgings with him very nearly an hour, I then left, and went to the Blackwall Railway, with the in<lb></lb>tention of going to town, and in attempting to take my purse out to pay, I found it was gone—I said to the prisoner, "O my, I have lost my purse"—he said, "It must be at home"—I said, "It can't be there, for I had no occasion for it there; we will go to the public-house, and if we don't find it there we will go to your lodgings"—we went to the public-house, and he said to the waiter, "My good lady has lost her purse"—the waiter went to the seat where I had been sitting, and I saw him pick up my purse from the floor—there was only a key left in it—I proposed going for a policeman—the prisoner said, "Don't go, I will go, for the station-house is a mile and a half or two miles off, and you will not meet with a police-man before you get there"—I said, "Well, if you go, make haste back"—the Jew, who was still there, made an attempt to go out of the room—I wished to detain him—the prisoner said it was stupidness for me to detain</p>

               <p>the Jew, for he knew nothing of it—whilst talking to the prisoner about my purse I missed my veil, gloves, and pocket-handkerchief—I had put my gloves and handkerchief on the table—as I was going to the door, to detain the Jew, my veil became unfastened, and I put it on the table by the side of my handkerchief—I told the prisoner they were missing—he said it was all right—he then went away, as he said, to fetch a policeman, and never returned I have since seen the veil, gloves, and handkerchief—there is a mark on the handkerchief—the gold I lost was new gold.</p>

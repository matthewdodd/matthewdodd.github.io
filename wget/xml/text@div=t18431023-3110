                  </hi>. I keep a brewery at Camberwell-green. The prisoner was in my service as drayman for about two years, up to last May—he had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—it was hit duty to receive money on my account—he was to account to me on the same day when he came home, or, if late, it was booked the next day—he did not account to me for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Clark on the 6th of May for a cask of porter, nor for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mrs. Chandler, about the 23rd of May—I had sent her an account by the prisoner of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was all made out in items of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is it—the first item is At. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he did not account to me for that—the prisoner did not account to me on the 1st of August for St. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. or Mrs. Matthews, for a cask of beer.</p>

I gave him into custody—he had not gone into the employ of a rival brewer—there is a person of the name of Osman in my neighbourhood—the prisoner told me he was in the employ of Mr. Bailey, a brewer, in Wyndham-road—he did not tell me he should go into the employ of Osman—he has never been three days without accounting—I made the entries in a book which the prisoner saw—I have the whole of my books here—I do not know that he ever kept any book—he had sometimes ten or twenty customers to go to in a day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In addition to his wages, was he entitled to a certain sum of money in the event of his obtaining new customers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that has been dropped above twelve months—I used to give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a customer—I do not owe him any money—when he called at my house, about a fortnight after he left me, he left word that he took 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and got drunk with it—I went down to his wife, and after that he called upon me—he did not say, as I owed him 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. it</p>

               <p>would be all right—he never said at any time that I owed him any money—I did not account with him last Christmas for any money—when I went down to his wife, I said he had been round with Bailey and Osman's cards to solicit my customers—I had had the cards handed to me from the customers when I went round—I think I had told the policeman of this charge before I had been to the prisoner's wife, but the policeman could not catch him—after I found he had taken up the hills, I went to his wife's to see him, and I told her of this, as I considered I had a right to do so—he had been in my service upwards of two years—it might be an hour or two after I went to his wife that he called upon me—he was taken into custody on the 23rd, which was about a week after.</p>

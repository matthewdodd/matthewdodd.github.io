                  </hi>. My husband is a ginger beer dealer at 31, Greek-street—my son keeps a tobacconist's shop down stairs in the same house. On 28th December I was in my son's shop—the prisoner came there about 8 o'clock in the evening for half an ounce of tobacco—it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him; he gave me a shilling—I gave him change, and put the shilling in the till—there were two or three other shillings there—this one was on the top—the prisoner came again at near 11 o'clock the same evening, for half an ounce of tobacco—I served him—he gave me another shilling; I put that in the till, and gave him change—he came in again in a few minutes for a penny pickwick; I served him and he gave me a shilling again—I gave him change for that—it remained on the counter—I found it was bad, and I opened the till and looked and found the other two shillings were bad, and were on the top of the other money—I tried the two as well as the one, and found they were all three bad, and they were precisely the same date—I saw the prisoner again about a quarter past 11; he came for half an ounce of tobacco—I weighed it, and he put a good sixpence on the counter—there were two gentlemen in the shop, and I said to one of them whom I knew, "This is the man that has given me this bad money"—the prisoner denied it, and made an attempt to rush out of the shop, but he was stopped by one of the gentlemen—the sixpence was still lying on the counter, and if he had gone away it would have remained there, and the tobacco too—I had not given him the tobacco—the policeman was coming by at the moment—I gave the prisoner in custody and gave the</p>

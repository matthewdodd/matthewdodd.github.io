I am sure the prisoner is the man - I saw his face clearly; I saw him six days after, at Worship-street, and picked him out from several others, immediately.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer of Worship-street; the prosecutrix came to the office about an hour after the robbery, and had a description of the man entered in our book. On the 27th of October, I apprehended the prisoner, in consequence of that description; he denied the charge; the prosecutrix was introduced into the tap-room, and immediately picked him out. She did not see me bring him in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can prove I was at a public-house at the time.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BODEL. I am pot-boy at the Weavers Arms, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner used our house-he came in at six o'clock that night, as he usually did; it was last Tuesday week; I am certain that was the night - He had a pint of beer, a pipe of tobacco, and a glass of gin and pepper; he had the beer first - He staid there till after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you sure - A. I am kept to wait in the tap-room - He was ill; my mistress asked him how he came to look so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you called upon first about it - A. Saturday morning-his wife enquired about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How do you know what o'clock it was - A. I looked at the clock in the tap-room when he came in; I go out of the room sometimes-my mistress gave him the gin and pepper. Perry was there also - He sat opposite the fire-place; there were seven or eight people in the room. I am positive it was Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER PERRY. I work at Billingsgate. I know the prisoner - last Tuesday week I was at the Weavers Arms, at half-past six o'clock and staid there till nine, the prisoner was there all the time; the prisoner came in a little before seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure he was not there when you first went in - A. Yes: when he came in, he put his hand to his stomach and said it was bad; he had two-pennyworth of pillicotia made into pills; Bodel went out for it - He had nothing to drink - He swallowed the pills without any liquid. A young man applied to me to be a witness here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner came in about a quarter before seven; there was no clock in the tap-room, by which I could tell the time. I knew the tap-room very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the landlady recommend him to have something for his pain - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

I am a grocer—I have known the prisoner some years—seven years back he made an appointment to meet me in the Waterloo-road, between the bridge and the Church—I wept there, but I was half an hour or three-quarters of an hour after the time—I went into Waterloo Church, and saw the prisoner and a, woman kneeling at the altar and the clergyman reading—I do not know who the woman was—I was asked to be a witness—a party there said, "I am in a hurry, you may as well sign for me;" and I like a fool did so.</p>

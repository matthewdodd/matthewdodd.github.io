               <p>Q. On the 23d of April last how many watches had you in the house. - A. I had three, but she only took two.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house were these watches in. - A. The silver watch with the gold chain and gold seals were hanging up against the window frame where I work, the other watch I do not know where it hung that afternoon, it commonly hanged against a screw by the fire-place in our bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was that. - A. It was a silver watch with a brass cap, it had a scarlet ribbon and a gold seal.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see these watches. - A. On Tuesday the 23d of April, I last see my watch in the room where I work, I had been to work there about an hour and a half before I missed it. I cannot say particularly when I see the watch in my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You rent the whole house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MRS. GOOZEE. Q. You are the wife of the last witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing these watches on the 23d of April. - A. I hung my watch with the scarlet ribbon and one seal by the fire-place, it was a watch that I generally wore, it hung up there in the morning, I went out about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had you seen it. - A. The moment before I went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see your husband's watch in his room, did you. - A. No, that was two pair of stairs higher than mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss the watch. - A. As soon as I returned, near eight o'clock at night. The prisoner slept in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you. - A. Not above three weeks I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any character with her. - A. My father was overseer of the parish, and most of the commissioners knew her, my husband knew her from a baby. I took her by the recommendation of the commissioners, most of them knew her. She applied for relief. I went immediately and searched after my watch to a great many pawnbrokers, at Mr. Matthew's in the Minories I found the watch with the gold chain and seals. I went to Mr. Hill and Sowerby's, Rosemary Lane, and there I found the watch with the scarlet ribbon and seals. He produced two gowns, I knew them immediately. I found these two gowns missing, and also a gown that I had on before I went out. I missed a guinea that was in my drawer in my bed-room, and the gowns were in another drawer. I missed seven pence in halfpence, a cap trimmed with a broad lace, a tablecloth, and nine napkins. The pawnbrokers have them here.</p>

I saw no more of her afterwards, when my master came home I told him Johnson was then gone.</p>

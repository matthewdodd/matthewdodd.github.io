                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live at Greenwich. I had some beds and quilts in a stable at the back of the house—on the 12th of April I missed these two beds—the prisoner had helped me put them in—he had no right to take them—he took one, and then I said if he would bring it back I would say nothing about it, and about a fortnight after he took the other.</p>

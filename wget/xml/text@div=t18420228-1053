                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Duncan, a provision-merchant, who had a warehouse at No. 5, Lower East Smithfield—he has moved—on Tuesday, the 24th of February, I was at the warehouse—I locked it up I think about half-past six, or from that to seven o'clock, in the evening—there was a cask of butter, lard, and different things in it—I did not go to the warehouse again till Thursday morning—I then found every thing disturbed—I got in with a key—the door was locked—I missed nothing but the butter—I was shown some by Wakeling on Thursday morning—it was the same sort of butter that was in my master's warehouses—there is a passage out into East Smithfield by going through the warehouse—two windows from the counting-house look into the passage—you must go through the warehouse to get to the counting-house—one window opens with a small sash—a person could get in there—I found the window the same as I had left it, shut down, but there was no fastening to it—I found a little of the crumbs of the butter about the window—I traced the butter the footsteps had gone from the cask to the window, and they had scat<lb></lb>tered a little about.</p>

I live at No. 353, Wapping, and am a provision-agent to Thomas Clarke and another—the warehouse was at No. 5, Lower East Smithfield, in the parish of St. Botolph without Aldgate—it was their warehouse, but I have since given up possession—I saw the cask of butter there a few days before the robbery—it weighed 1cwt. and 7lbs.—the butter the constable has is the same description as was lost—I have weighed the cask since, and there is about 63lbs. deficiency.</p>

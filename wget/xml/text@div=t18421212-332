                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Grant, a greengrocer, in Monmouth-street. On the morning of the 23rd of Nov., the prisoner came for a halfpenny-worth of onions—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him four sixpences—I was then counting the halfpence for the remainder, and he asked me to oblige him with larger change—I went into the parlour, and got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he met me at the door—I gave them to him—I was counting the half<lb></lb>pence—he said, "I have a halfpenny in my pocket," and gave me the half-penny—I gave him back his half-crown—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and left before I had time to look at the shillings—immediately after he left, I looked at them, and they were not the same I had given him—one was bad—I put it in to a drawer by itself, where no other was kept—my husband gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames policeman</hi>, 72.) On Wednesday evening, 15th Dec., I saw the prisoner in Broad-street, Ratcliff, carrying a bag—I watched him into a marine-store shop—I went in, and asked him what he had got there—he said, "Iron"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said he bought it of a man in the street, and gave him a shilling for it—I told him I did not believe him, I should take him into custody—I was taking him towards the station, and he said, "Let me go this way, my cart is here"—I went that way with him—there was a cart with "William Cubit and Co., Gray's-inn-lane," on it, loaded with iron similar to what the prisoner had—I went round to Mill-wall with him, to Mr. Cubitt's factory—I told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself for robbing his employer—he said, "I am sorry for it."</p>

The prisoner was their carman for two years and a half—on 15th Dec. he was sent out with a cart to Euston-square, and to bring back a load of iron of this sort from the factory in Gray's-inn-road—it is the property of william Cubitt and others.</p>

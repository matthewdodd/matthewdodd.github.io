                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich—I joined my corps on 13th February—a short time before that I had a set of military belts made for me—I received them from Messrs. Hunt and Guthrie—I had them in my accoutrement case for the first month when I was lodging on the Common, because I could not get any quarters—afterwards I got quarters, and moved into them, and then the belts were in my drawers—they were safe then—I do not remember the exact date when I moved into quarters; I think it was about the middle of March—I missed them on the night of the ball given by the Marines at Woolwich—I think that was about 6th May—I had seen them, in packing up, in the third week in March—I do not know the prisoner at all—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) resemble the Belts I lost—there is no particular mark on them; but when I was trying them on, the waist-Belt was rather loose, and the outfitter, in giving it a sudden pull, made a scratch here, and sent the Buckle the wrong way, which he could not get back again—I see that—they are perfectly new—I gave 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold-lace artist—some time since Christmas we made a set of Royal Artillery belts, for Messrs. Hunt ad Guthrie—the pouch was returned to us, as not being according to the regulation, and we made another instead—I believe the one produced to be the one we made—the first was silver, and this is gold—it is a particular shape, made especially to order—it is the only one of the kind we have made—I know it is one of our make.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a military outfitter, at 32, Argyll-street—I knew the prisoner as servant to a medical officer in the Artillery for about four years—on 17th April last I met him at the railway station, London-Bridge—he said he was about proceeding to my place, that he had got a day's leave, for the purpose of disposing of a set of dress belts which he had, and would I purchase them, or direct him to some persons in London who would purchase them—I said I thought he would not be able to sell them so well in London as in Woolwich, because in London they would give little more than they would burn at, which would be about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but at Woolwich he might get a trifling advance upon that price—he said, "I should Be very much obliged if you would take them of me; I should Be quite satisfied with 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I have lately disposed of a set in Woolwich for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so I can promise you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if not a little more"—he said, Very well"—I took the parcel from him, suggesting that we should adjourn to the waiting-room to examine whether the Belts were as he represented them to Be, as good as new, having only been worn two or three times—the train was near starting, and he said, "There is not time for that; I will leave them in your possession"—I was going to Eltham, and said I would be in Woolwich about 6 in the evening, and appointed to meet him there, and give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or return the Belts—I got to Woolwich about half-past 5, and sold them to Mr. Hart, an old neighbour of mine, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot swear to the Belts—there was a mark of this description on the Belts I sold Mr. Hart—the prisoner said he had had them locked up in a Box for a considerable period, and he thought they belonged to an officer who had gone on the Chinese expedition—I had not then examined them—I did not see anything in their appearance calculated to excite suspicion.</p>

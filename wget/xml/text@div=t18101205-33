               <p>Q. Did you see the person go up stairs. - A. No, I saw her come down.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this. - A. On Wednesday last, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come down stairs. - A. Yes, she wanted to rush through the passage, to get away from my son, and I called to an old man that lived in the two pair, to come and detain her while my son went for a constable, the old man came down, and then she ran into my parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What the prisoner. - A. Yes, I saw her put her right hand into her pocket, she pulled out three keys, and chucked them under the parlour grate. The officer tried one of these keys, it unlocked the room where the prisoner came from, she exclaimed when I took up the keys from under the grate, that she was guilty, and said,</p>
               <p>"pray do not hurt me."</p>
               <p>Q. You had not promised to forgive her, or any thing of that sort. - A. No, I told her I saw her take the keys out of her pocket. The officer brought down the clothes which she had put into the bag. They are here. There was a pair of sheets worth 10 s. three shirts, worth 5 s. three neck handkerchiefs, worth 1 s. a hat 3 s. a pair of boots, half a crown, and a great coat, 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how she got in your house. - A. She came in at the street door, it stands open in day-light. The door up stairs was locked and I had the key.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon her. - A. Nothing, upon her, I found all these things put up in a canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. The things in the canvas bag would not amount to forty shillings. - A. No, when the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, I found ten false keys upon the chair on which she had been sitting, and one of them keys opens the front garret door, out of which I was robbed about ten weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. We must not hear that. You say your street door was open. - My street door was open, the one pair door was locked and the key in my parlour. She stripped the bed, and took some dirty things which were laying about the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room locked in which the goods were. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You say the outer door was open. A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And when she came down she had no bag. - A. She was in the room with the bag. My son saw her in the room.</p>

They were all removed from the place where they was left. I left the hat on the table by the foot of the bed, the sheets were taken off the bed. I went up stairs between 2 and 3 o'clock after dinner, to get my hat off the table to go out. I took the key off the nail in the parlour where it usually hangs. I went up stairs, put the key in the door, unlocked it. I could not get in, this woman resisted inside, and pushed inside. I saw her came out of my room, she ran part of the way up the second pair of stairs, she came down again directly, rushed into the passage, and appeared confused. She took nothing away.</p>

The prosecutrix said, that was the person who had robbed her. I searched the prisoner, and found on her a pipe-key; after that, the prosecutrix gave me these three keys, the keys that the prisoner threw away. I took Mrs. Dean's son up with me.

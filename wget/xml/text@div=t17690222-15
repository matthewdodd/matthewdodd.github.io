There was a young man stood with a box on the top of a post, he asked me what it was o'clock, I answered him as nigh as I could guess; he said, Pray, young man, which way are you going? I said into Bishopsgate-street; he said, if you will be so good as to lend me a hand with this box, I'll give you a shilling. I took the shilling and came with it; he walked with me, sometimes before and sometimes behind me. When they came to take hold of me, I looked round to see the person that gave me the box, and he was gone. I am innocent of the fact. I am a <rs id="t17690222-15-deflabel94" type="occupation">plasterer</rs>

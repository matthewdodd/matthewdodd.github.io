            . I was at the skittle ground - I did not see the prosecutor put his hat down - I did not tell the magistrate that I did, but I saw the prisoner take a white hat, and try to put it inside his own, but he could not - he then put his own hat on, and put the white hat under the front of his coat - I pursued him with a friend - I said to him, "Young man, it is no use your attempting to make off with that hat; I know what you have got" - he said, "It is nothing but a boy's hat" - I said, "It belongs to a gentleman in the Bedford Arms, you had better take it back" - he said he would not - we went about one hundred yards further, and one of the young men who was with him said,"If you take it back, you are a b - y fool" - the prisoner said he would take it back, provided one of his own party would go back with him - a policeman came by, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were looking at him when he was putting the hat under his own? A. Yes, I was looking at him - Matthews saw it - I did not call out, "You have got a white topper" - I do not know what it means.</p>

             (police-constable S 186). I took the prisoner with the hat - I heard the witness say, "I insist upon the gloves being returned to the owner" - I found the gloves in his pocket.</p>

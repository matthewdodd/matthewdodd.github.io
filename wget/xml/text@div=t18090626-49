I should get over the paling and take the gun away from her. She then asked the servant what fellow that was; the servant who was with her said she did not know; she then said she would take the liberty of firing at me; I said she might if she liked, I should not move. I did not move, she presented the gun towards me in a direct line, and snapped it three times; it did not go off; she then took the gun from off her shoulder, she had forgot to prime it; she asked the female servant for the powder horn, the servant gave it her, she poured out of the powder horn into the pan of the gun some gunpowder, and shut the pan down again.

             was at the side of me, he begged me to get behind a tree, or else she would shoot me: I got behind the tree, and after I had been there a few minutes she held the gun towards me in a direct line, I poked my head out and looked; she discharged the gun as soon as she saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. All the time you were in Kempton park - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Rolfe - A. I understand he is her uncle. I got over the poles then, we went up to her and took the gun from her; we then went to the place where the ball came through, and she followed us.</p>
               <p>Q. You went back to the place where you thought the ball had come through the paling - A. I am positive the ball came through the paling, because there was a hole in the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. That might be made before - A. I do not know; I did not see the ball come through. I told her that I should go and get a warrant: she said I might go if I liked; if she had the gun she would as leave shoot me as not; I went down to Mr. Cowey, he was not at home. On the Monday morning I came down to Bow-street to get a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gun go off when she pointed it at you when you stood behind the tree - A. Yes; it did go off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the tree afterwards - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You only saw her put the powder into the pan to prime it - A. There were shot in the gun; I saw her put them in; she asked her servant for the shot belt; she poured them in without measuring them. That was when I was talking to her, before the gun was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with the prisoner since she has been apprehended with this warrant - A. No, none. I never saw the prisoner before nor since. (A model of the spot produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now Mr. Coombes, you are a fishmonger, are you - A. I am. My father is a housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. You carry fish about to sell with a horse and cart - A. Yes; every day.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you played more than you worked - A. No, sir; I have to work to support my aged father.</p>
               <p>Q. So you were taking a walk in Kempton park - in Kempton park there is a fence like this, is there not - A. Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>Q. That fence is five foot six, is it not - A. It is not so much. I never measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will prove that it is four foot nine inches; the close part of it, and the other railed part is five foot six - were there any trees - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up to miss York was not she in Mr. Rolfe's premises - A. Yes. I was on the other side, where there are large trees.</p>
               <p>Q. The place where you say the ball went through was three hundred feet off - A. No; I think it was about ten yards round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. I will prove that it was two hundred and forty feet off; she was on Mr. Rolfe's side of the pales, and Mr. Rolfe's servant with her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She put the powder in the gun - A. I did not see her put the powder in; I saw her put the shot in.</p>

               <p>Q. And up she put it to you - A. She said she would shoot me; I said she might if she liked.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you got behind the tree - A. Yes; after she snapped the gun three times at me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not offer to run away - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that tree from the place - A. Which I stood behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes - A. I never measured it. About three yards and a half from the pales; she was about six yards from the pales; I think I was about fifteen yards distance from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are quite sure that you saw her take a powder horn and put powder in the pan - A. I am sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as correct in that as you are in the rest of your evidence - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, the next day you went to Bow-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the next morning you sent Parker to her - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you and Parker meet on Monday morning - A. Parker and I went to Bow-street together; we met at the George, public house to come together to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came to Bow-street did not you send Parker to her to tell her that if she did not give you some money you would go to Bow-street - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you do not know that he went - A. No; if he went he never told me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. That same evening after this was passed you got over and took the gun from her and struck her - A. No, I did not strike her; I took the gun from her, and went away with the gun to Mr. Cowey's.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the gun to the George public house and sat there drinking and smoking, and Parker with you - A. Yes; I came back and took the pale down which the ball came through and put a fresh one in its place.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the pale where you said the ball came through - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you used no bad language - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not throw something at her - A. I believe I took down a piece of the paling and threw at her; in order to prevent her from loading the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow-street the next day, Monday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was she taken to Bow-street - A. Tuesday morning. We were to appear afterwards on the Friday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260040"></xptr>Q. On Friday you came to town - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And I understand that something passed, you went away - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you did not go before the magistrate on the Friday - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You got some money of somebody not to go - A. No, I did not; I never received a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Your companion, Parker, got none, I suppose - A. I do not know; I am sure he never received any while he was in my company.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go home - A. Through Hammersmith, and Hounslow Heath.</p>
               <p>Q. In your going home, did you quarrel about the money - A. No, we had a quarrel; I did not want any money; I did strip to fight, but not about the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray do you ever lay wagers - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much have you laid about hanging Miss York - A. I did not know that ever I laid any thing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an odd sort of an answer, I should know if I had or had not - A. I laid a wager with Mr. Harmer, the shoe maker, I have laid a pot of six-penny with him, that if Miss York was found guilty of the capital, that she would be cast for death.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh, you laid a wager that if she was cast for a capital offence, she would be guilty of a capital offence - A. I laid a pot of six-penny that if she was found guilty, she would be east for death.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the interval from her loading the gun and firing it off - A. As quick as she could, after her priming of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. When she presented to you three times, how came you to stand exposed to her as you did; why did not you seek for some shelter, after she had snapped it once - A. I do not know, I was not frightened at the time particularly; I would sooner lose my life than be frightened by a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Why it makes no difference to you, whether you are shot by a man or a woman - A. I would be sooner shot, than run away from a woman firing at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what made you run behind the tree - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Miss York - A. Yes; when I saw her first, she was holding a gun to her shoulder; she took the gun from her shoulder afterwards; her servant maid then came up to her with something in her hand, I did not know at the time what it was; she then seemed to be priming the piece; she then put the gun to her shoulder again. I went to walk down by the side of the road, to see what the lady was at, and the piece went off; the ball came through the pales about two or three spaces before me. I then saw the ball strike the gravel road, at least the dust flew from the ball falling on the gravel road. I went up to the boys that were standing at the pales, I asked them who the lady was, they told me it was Miss York, that she was firing at them. I asked Miss York who she was firing at civily, she told me it was no business of mine; I told her she had like to have shot me on passing the road. She was loading the piece again, I saw her put the powder in; she said if I interrupted her in her private walks, she would fire at me. A great many people were coming up after the alarm of the first fire; I holloaed out for them to go back; she catched the piece up in her hand. I directly left the lady, and went behind the tree; she put the gun down again, and asked for the shot belt; upon which the maid came to her again with the shot belt; she poured the shot out of the shot belt into the muzzle of the piece; I still stood behind the tree, she seemed to be in a great passion.

             came up, and told her that if she fired off in that careless way again, he would get over and take the piece from her. She asked her maid who

             was, her servant replied that she did not know. She then said that she would take the liberty of firing at him however; he told her to fire if she liked; she took up the piece, and snapped it at him three times; the piece did not go off. She took it from her shoulder, and asked her servant for some powder. She primed the piece and put it up at him again; and levelled it at him again. I said, for God Almighty's sake Robert move, she will certainly blow your brains out; he then moved to the next tree to me; he was in a great rage on seeing the gun pointed at him; he made a bit of a move, she then presented and fired at him directly; upon that he went and got over the pales, and took the piece from her. In his getting over the pales, a piece broke off; he took it up and threw it at her. I asked him for the piece, he gave it me. I asked her why she fired the gun at people, she told me she fired the gun at him for tresspassing. I would have given the lady her piece back again, but she still threatened that she would do it again, if I gave her the piece back again; when I found her so rash, I kept the gun, and left the lady. I then went and applied to Mr. Cowey, the magistrate of Sunbury.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen her two or three times since - A. I have seen her twice at Bow-street. Mr. Saunders came to me to see about making the business up; I went to her, she asked me what I would do in it, I told her I could not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she come to you - A. At the Nag's Head, Covent-garden. We went to an inn at the top of Bow-street, by the theatre, I did not observe the sign; we went into a back room; she asked me if I would make it up, I told her she should have done that before; she said, do not tell me of before, tell me what you will do now; I said I could not give any answer at all, she must apply to Coombes, the prosecutor. Mr. Saunders called Coombes into the room; I did not hear what passed; I went and stood at the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Then after you and Miss York at this house in Bow-street, could not come to any accomodation, Coombes was fetched - A. He was fetched in the room while I was there; I leaving the room while he and Mr. Saunders was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When this happened, were you walking with Coombes - A. No, I was not; I was on Mr. Hill's side, where the trees were; she was putting the shot in before Coombes came up.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a carpenter, you can pretty well tell me what is the height of this paling - A. About four feet five inches from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the dimension of the trees, are they not three feet diameter - A. I cannot say; they are large trees, large enough to protect a man of the size of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260041"></xptr>Coombes, if he stook behind it. She was about twelve yards from the paling, and Coombes three yards from the paling on the other side; the shot went above a man's height to a tree, it may be forty yards off. I had the bows that were shot off in my hand, the people were there and saw them fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect pointing out to Mr. Rolfe, the tree were Coombes stood - A. I did; I have examined it since, not with Mr. Rolfe; I did not see any shot in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the paling - A. I did, with Mr. Rolfe. I found no shot in that part of the paling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this young lady say that she would not have fired if it had not been for his expressions - do you recollect Coombes calling her any bad names - A. Certainly there were such things passed, that was after the piece was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there on the Monday morning to Mr. Rolfe's house - A. I did; I saw

            , she asked me to see Miss York; I went in after by her invitation. Miss York asked me what I wanted, I told her I understood from her servant, that she accused me last night of robbing her fish pond; she begged my pardon, and said if I was not the person she was very sorry for it. I went to her to take the piece, thinking it was a rash action; thinking she would take the piece, and think no more of it. I told her that Coombes had taken a chaise to come to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, and unless they would give a sum of money, he would come to London - A. No; I went to Bow-street; I told Coombes on the road that I had seen Miss York.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went on Friday, were you examined on the Friday - A. We went to Bow-street on the Friday; I was not examined, Mr. Saunders sent a person to baulk us. I will swear that I took no money at the time, nor no other time; the money was sent to my wife; I would not take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you receive a sum of fifteen 
pounds - A. I did not; I refused a note.</p>


               <p>Q. You and Coombes did not go before the magistrate that day - A. I did not go because of this business, I would not agree with what they would give us. Mr. Saunders wanted to give a draft upon Mr. Rolfe, to pay our expences; our expences were calculated by a person that pretended to be a friend, and who was not a friend.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who stood upon the highest ground when this piece was fired off - A: Coombes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the tree that was struck was forty yards off you - A. I think it was, I did not see the shot strike it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish where the tree had been hit, supposing it to be hit by the shot - A. Sixteen or eighteen feet up the tree. The tree stood upon rather higher ground than where Coombes stood.</p>

I was in Kempton Park at the time this happened; the first that I saw was the report of a gun; I ran up and saw Miss York, with the gun in her hand; Coombes asked her if she was going to fire again, she said she should take the liberty of firing at him if he insulted her; several words passed; she loaded the gun, Coombes made his escape behind the tree; she put the gun up to her shoulder, it would not go off; she put it down by her side, whether she primed it or no, I do not know; Coombes looked from behind the tree, she fired at him. He went to jump over the pales, it came down. Coombes took the gun from her.</p>

Coombes popped out from the tree, and said she could not fire, it had nothing in it; she said if he would stand she would show him; she pointed towards the tree; I was a little distance of one side, I could not see so well as though I had been level with her.

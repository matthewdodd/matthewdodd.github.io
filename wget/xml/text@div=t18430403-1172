                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live at Knightsbridge. I had a truck, which I saw safe on the 8th of March, at five o'clock in the evening—I missed it about half-past six—I know Cranfield and Dare—they were at my house that night at five o'clock the first time, and the second time about half-past—they came for two separate halfpenny-worths of apples—on Friday, the 10th, I went to Smithfield to look for my truck, but did not see it—I went again on the 17th, and then saw the wheels—I knew them, and am able to swear they belonged to my truck—the prisoner Jones had them—I looked at them several minutes—a person sitting by the side of him said, "Do you want to buy a pair of wheels?"—I made no answer—he called to Jones to look out—Jones asked me if I wanted to buy a pair of wheels—I said I did want a pair, but they were too heavy for me—I asked the price—he said 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I walked away—he hallooed after me, and asked what I would give for them; he could afford to take less—I got a policeman, who came up to Jones, and asked how he came by the wheels, and where the owner of them was—he said he was there a few minutes before—we took him to the station, and went to look for the man who he said he had to take the money to after he sold the wheels—we could not find him.</p>

The prisoner at the bar and two more men came in and called for a pint of beer, on the 18th of July, on Thursday, at five or six o'clock in the afternoon, they drank to the amount of three pots of beer; they called for more, but I told them I did not mean to draw them any more, for I was in doubt whether I should get paid for what they had drank or not, and when I refused to draw them any more the bell was rang for me to get my reckoning, while I was trying to get my reckoning, the man the prisoner at the bar went backward, and he soon returned from backward out of the yard, and he past through a little area where the candlesticks all stood, he went out at the door, I did not notice him going out, but he presently returned with money to pay for the beer; while I was disputing one of the men that were left behind wanted me to take a silk handkerchief in pledge; I told him I never did any thing of that sort, he was got into a wrong house; soon after the prisoner returned and throwed down six-pence, and he says to his companions, sure you can raise the other four-pence halfpenny; they said, no, no, he had managed well, and he could pay for the whole of the beer, and he paid for the whole of the beer, and when I had got my money I left the room and went into the bar, and they called for a quartern or a quartern and a half of gin, and had it, and paid for it; then after he went backward into the yard again, he stopped some little time, and I was sitting in the bar; I got up to see what he was at, and there I saw him fumbling something in his pocket, under the shelf were the candlesticks were, and he had got two high ones in the left hand pocket, brass candlesticks; I took two out of the right hand pocket myself, and I called out for assistance, and I had assistance come to me, and he went to the necessary and dropped two down, the second we heard fall, but the first we did not; the second we took out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear them to be your's? - I can, those that I took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your name on them? - No, it is not; they have been at the office Hatton Garden ever since. I missed seven in all, and found these four; three are totally gone, which I suppose he took at first to go and get the money to pay for the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had these candlesticks? - I have had them for seven years. One of the small ones, which I took out of his pocket, I think it is marked, pattern on the bottom; I can swear to them safely being my property.</p>

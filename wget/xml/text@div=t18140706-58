               <p>Q. On the 6th of July what happened - A. I was the first up in the house; when I went down stairs the back door was standing wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. What people are there in the house - A. There is my wife and five children, no servant. I have a lodger. I rent the house myself.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of July, who went to bed last - A. We all went up to bed together. I bolted the back door myself; I saw the front door was fast; the windows were all fast; the washhouse window I did not fasten myself, it was fastened by my youngest son. I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock; I arose next morning about seven o'clock; I came down stairs first; the back door was standing wide open; that was what I had fastened myself the night before. I first went into my parlour; I found all my drawers open, and my desk open. There is a desk and book-case in the back parlour, and the little door within the desk was cut and opened, and all my papers were strewed about.</p>
               <p>Q. What other things were taken - A. Various articles of wearing apparel; the drawers were not entirely stripped to be sure. I lost eight shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them - A. About two pound the eight shirts; nine pair of silk stockings and three pair of cotton, they were worth about three pounds; I lost seven waistcoats, they were worth about forty or fifty shillings; two coats, one was quite new, the two worth about six pounds; five silk handkerchiefs, worth about ten shillings; a tablecloth, two shillings; two watches, about two pounds; there was a gold chain to one, and four gold seals; the chain and seals, about two pounds; and two boxes, two shillings. I believe that was all I lost. One half of the washhouse window lay in the garden; one half of the sash removed, and the shutter, there was a hole cut in it. I presume the entrance into the house was opened that way. I have seen my watches again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know your watches again - A. Yes, I saw them at the police office about eleven o'clock the same day. I saw all my property there, and the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of those things put altogether - A. About twenty pounds I should think. That is all I know of it.</p>

I sprung my rattle; Mr. Partridge came up to my assistance. We took him to the watchhouse with the two bundles, and delivered him into the officers hands. That is all I know about it.</p>

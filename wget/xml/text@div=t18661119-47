                  </hi>. I am a sub<lb></lb>warder in the Middlesex House of Correction, Coldbath Fields—on 16th October last the prisoner was there, undergoing a sentence—some time that morning I reported him to the governor, in his presence, for talking on the day previous in the tailors' shop—the prisoner made some observation to the governor—the governor admonished him at first, and after he made the observation he ordered him a day's cell and bread and water—after making my report I returned back to the tailors' shop—a number of prisoners work there, and the prisoner had been em<lb></lb>ployed there; it was about a quarter to eleven when I got back—when the prisoner came into the shop he came up to me and made a spring on me, I turned round and caught hold of him by the collar—by that means he fell down or threw himself down—at the time he made the spring on me I was walking down the shop; he was in front of me—I did not see anything in his hand when he made the spring; he made a rush at me; he did not turn round; he was facing me, coming towards me—he had got his hands loose, he attempted to strike me; he struck at me with his clenched fist, and I caught him by the collar; he aimed at my face—he did not strike me, he struck at me—when he threw himself down I had got hold of him by the collar, leaning over him, and I found a stab in my chest with the scissors directly I was down leaning over him—it was under the fifth rib on the left side—I did not see where he got the scissors from—I saw them in his hand after I was wounded—he was making a second blow at me, and a prisoner named Driffield came up and prevented</p>

               <p>the second blow; in doing that he was wounded in the hand—I did not hear the prisoner say anything when he wounded me—an officer who is present was in the shop at the time, and he came up to my assistance—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the scissors used in the tailors' shop—they belong to the prisoner and bear his number—I did not see them taken from him—I have been off duty ever since—Driffield was the only prisoner that came to my assistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in the House of Correction under<lb></lb>going a sentence—on 16th October I was in the tailors' shop about eleven o'clock in the forenoon—I heard a noise, a scuffling in the middle of the shop—I looked round and saw the prisoner and the officer scuffling together—the prisoner was just falling on his back—the officer was forcing him down—he had him by the collar with his right hand, and the prisoner had the officer by the collar with his left hand—I then saw a pair of scissors in the prisoner's right hand—as he was falling he had them in his hand—he struck once or twice, but could not hit the officer—he struck short—he then rose himself as well as he could by the right shoulder and succeeded in hitting him a violent blow somewhere in the left breast—I then got up to them—as I went to the officer's assistance he was striking another blow—I put my hand between the officer's breast and the prisoner's hand as he was striking the blow, and he cut me with the point of the scissors on the left hand—I could not tell what was done afterwards, I was so severely wounded—in two or three minutes I knew what was going on again, and I was taken to the hospital in the prison and put to bed and had my wound dressed, and a doctor was there directly.</p>

               <p>from the report office, where he had been reported by Batten, and went to the tailors' shop—the prisoner had no business there then—he passed me—I called him by his number—he took no notice—I went up to see where he had got to, and he was then close on to the officer, about two yards from him—he drew a pair of scissors from out of his breast, went up to the officer, and aimed a blow at him from behind, but whether he struck him or not then I cannot say—the officer's back was towards him at the time—with that I called out, and the officer faced about—the prisoner had recovered his arm then—his arm drew back, and he made another thrust at the officer and struck him in the breast—I can't say whether it was right or left, but it was in front that he struck him; then the officer closed with him, got hold of him by the collar of his jacket, and tried to put him down to take the scissors from him—by that time I got up to them—the prisoner had the scissors in his right hand then; he had them in this fashion (<hi rend="italic">points downwards</hi>)—that was the way he took them out of his breast, and he was trying then to stab the officer as he was down—the prisoner was down on his back—the prisoner's number is 100, and that is the number of the scissors he had—these are the scissors he should have had at his employment in the shop—I did not take those scissors from his hand—I took another pair, No. 83—those were not his own—his scissors, No. 100, were brought down to me out of the shop afterwards—no doubt he had them about him all the time he was up at the office; I saw him take them out of his breast; that was not the pair I took from his hand—the pair I took from his hand was a pair he took from the board as we were bringing him from the shop to the report office—he <hi rend="italic">col<lb></lb>lared</hi> those, and I took them from him—I can't say how he came to have his own scissors upon his person—he ought to have put them on the board before he went to the report office; they were taken from him immediately after the blow was given—I did not take them from him—No. 83 scissors I took from his hand after the first pair had been taken from him—those were not the scissors he struck the officer with, those were No. 100; the others I saw him take off the board after the scuffle—he made no remark when he aimed the blow—I was present when he was reported to the Governor—he was admonished for talking—he told the Governor there was a higher one than him one day, then bread and water would be all over—then the Governor ordered him bread and water.</p>

I am surgeon to the House of Correction—I exa<lb></lb>mined Batten—I met them coming out of the room, and took him and Driffield up to the infirmary immediately—Batten was bleeding freely from two wounds on the left side of the chest, from the two points of the scissors, I believe—his nervous system seemed very much shaken—I put him to bed immediately—I dressed the wounds, which bled freely—all his under-clothing was saturated with blood—the wound was on the left side, just over the heart, over the fifth rib—the rib stopped the blow—if the blow had been between the ribs it would probably have proved fatal—he is a very fleshy man, which mitigated the danger—it was a deep wound, down to the rib; I probed it—he has remained off duty and under my care up to the present time—the wound in itself has not turned out to be dangerous—I examined the hand of Driffield; he had a deep cut in the palm, in the fleshy part, dividing the tendons—it bled very freely, and was a dangerous wound—it is now nearly healed, but I have no doubt the first two fingers will remain in some degree stiff for life in consequence of it—it was a wound that might have been inflicted with a pair of scissors.</p>

I have been in that pain and faint that I have not known how to walk round the yard, and it was all because I reported an officer. This is what they call worrying a poor man. I was told by a prisoner who had been in there before that they would worry me for it, and would not put my number down when I wanted to go to the closet, and they have kept their word. No man could suffer more than I have by these fiends, that call themselves men; I am ashamed of them. I would not use a poor dumb animal as they have treated me, as God is my witness. Not satisfied with sending me for two years unjustly, they must hunt me up like this. I have no witness. Where could I get a witness? I leave it in the Almighty's hands.

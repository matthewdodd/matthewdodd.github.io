                  </hi>. I live with Mr. George Alexander Tulton, who keeps the Green Gate beer-house, Tottenham—I am his wife's sister—on the 27th August the prisoner came in with several other persons about six o'clock in the evening—I served the prisoner with beer, I should think, seven or eight times—four times he paid me with a half-crown—it was paid for separately after each pot—I put the half-crowns on the table in the bar parlour—there were no other half-crowns there—I afterwards showed them to Mr. Tulton; he tried them in my presence, and found them bad—while the prisoner was there a man with whom he was drinking paid a bad shilling—that raised my suspicions—I saw Mr. Tulton give the half-crowns to the police-con<lb></lb>stable, and the prisoner was given to him also.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Green Gate beer-house, West-green, Tottenham—on 27th August the prisoner was at my house and two others whom I knew well with him—they were drinking there three or four hours—one of them tendered a bad shilling, and the last witness called my attention to these half-crowns, which were lying on the bar table—I looked at them and tested them with nitrate of silver—I found them all bad, and I marked them and gave them to the constable, Ince, with the prisoner—I could recognise the other man.</p>

On 27th August, I was sent for to the beer-shop kept by Mr. Tulton—I found the prisoner outside the door—he was given into my custody—I searched him and found on him ten shillings in good money; there were two florins, five shillings, two sixpences, and fourpence half penny; and I found a bag in his trousers with a bad shilling in it tied up in a corner—I received these four half-crowns from Mrs. Tulton.</p>

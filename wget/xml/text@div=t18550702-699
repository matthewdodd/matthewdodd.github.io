I knew the deceased Hannah Bell, for about two months—I lodged in the same house with her for three weeks, at No. 2, Five Bell-alley, Limehouse; it is a bad house—on Monday evening, 11th June, I went to that house with two men, be<lb></lb>tween 5 and 6 o'clock—the deceased was at home—she kept company with one of the men down stairs, and I went up stairs with the others—I was talking to the man just inside the room door when the prisoner followed me up, took hold of the man and threw him down stairs, and cut his mouth—I do not think I had ever seen the prisoner before that day—I do not think he was very drunk, he did not seem to be drunk, he was able to beat us very well—after he had thrown the man down stairs, he commenced beating him; I begged of. him not to kill the man, and he caught hold of the hair of my head, threw me down, and began to kick me—the deceased came to my assistance; we were then down stairs, I had come down after the man; she endeavoured to prevent the prisoner from ill using me, and he took hold of her two arms and struck her with his fist on the breast or stomach, I do not know which; she fell from that blow—I believe she fell down side-ways, I do not think she fell partly on her knees—he then lifted his foot as if to kick her, I do not know that he did kick her—I then left the room, went outside the door, and the prisoner followed me, took me by the hair of my head, pulled me down, and commenced jumping upon me before the door—I was saved from him, and went in doors, and he then went away—in a very short time the deceased came into my room—she then had a big lump on her jaw—Mrs. Slaughter, who lives in the same court, came in with her; she was struggling to walk, she walked with difficulty—when she came in she got faint, and fell back on the boards—she told Mrs. Slaughter to bring her some vinegar—she fainted—Mrs. Slaughter and I laid her on the bed, and she got some vinegar and bathed her head—T did not hear her speak any more—I laid down on the bed with her—I was not long on the bed before Mrs. Slaughter came back, and told me that the prisoner was coming back, I then went out—I think that was between 8 and 9 o'clock—I left the deceased on the bed <hi rend="italic">in a faint</hi>—I came back at a quarter past 12 o'clock—I went in with a policeman, and found the deceased dead on the bed.</p>

I was at home on Monday evening, 11th June, between 5 and 6 o'clock, and heard screams from the other No. 2—I went there; the door was shut, I pushed it open, and went in—I found the prisoner there in the lower room, and saw him strike the deceased in the chest—it did not seem to have the least effect—she fell down on her knees—Macaulay was not present then—the prisoner was beating her out of the alley at the same time—the deceased's head and face did not touch the floor—she then went into my house—she was able to walk by herself—she remained in my house, I dare my, nearly an hour; she was sitting on the step of my door, and the prisoner came back and gave her two kicks; one on the left side of her face, and one on the jaw—they were very hard kicks—I did not notice what sort of shoes he had on—she went in, and sat in my chair—I after<lb></lb>wards saw her to her lodging—she told me to go and get her some vinegar, which I did, and bathed her—as near as I can guess, it was about 8 o'clock when I left her; she seemed rather faint then—I went back about 9 o'clock, or between 9 and 10, she then seemed as if she was asleep; she said to me, "God bless you, and God will bless you;" that was after I had bathed her face—I remained till the prisoner came in again, that was about 10 o'clock, or a little after—he was drunk at first, but he was pretty sober when he came in the second time; he was quite aware what he was doing at first—he said nothing when he kicked her the second time—he said, "You b——w——, I mean to have your life"—that was when he gave her the blow in the stomach, on the first occasion—he was not to say over tipsy when he said that; he knew what he was doing—I did not know of any quarrel between them that night, or at any other time; I believe she was always afraid of him, by what I heard—she did not keep company with him—I did not remain with her till she died—I went in about 12 o'clock, and then she was dead—the prisoner was in the place by himself.</p>

I knew the deceased—on Monday evening, 11th June, I was passing through Five Bell-alley, about a quarter or half past 6 o'clock, and saw the prisoner beating the deceased up against the wall, about three or four yards from her own door—he had got hold of her by the top part of her dress behind, with his left hand, and was beating her with his right hand over the back part of her head and neck; her hair was all hanging down disordered, and her cap too—from the time I first saw them till I got out of the alley, I saw him strike her seven times—I did not interfere—I spoke to one of the neighbours at the next house; I do not know his name, but he is an Irishman, and he said, "You had better get away for the safety of your own life; if he rips you open with a knife, who is to give you redress?"—he advised me to go away, and let them alone, and I did so—it seemed all quiet, there was nobody about in the alley—I had known the deceased about three years and a half—she did not keep company with the prisoner to my knowledge—he did not lodge in the alley at that time, he did about eighteen months ago—</p>

               <p>he was not acquainted with her to my knowledge—about 8 o'clock I was passing through the alley again, and saw the deceased sitting on the step of Mrs. Slaughter's door with her elbows on her knees, and her hands up to her head—I said to her, "Halloo, mother, how do you feel now?"—she used to go by the name of <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi> Robinson in the alley—I heard Bay that she was about thirty-six years old—she said, "I feel very bad, my head is very bad; I think I am dying."</p>

I was called to No. 2, Five Bell-alley, a few minutes after 1 o'clock, on Tuesday morning, 12th June—I saw the deceased lying on the bed dead—I should Bay she had been dead about an hour, the extremities were cold, but there was warmth about the trunk—I found a contusion on the left cheek, which had evidently occurred from a kick, for there were five nail marks on the cheek—I found on the left half bf the lower jaw a very extensive contusion—it might have been occasioned by a violent blow equally with a kick, but most probably by a kick; I could not say with certainty, there were no marks of nails there, it was on the bone—it could not have been done by a hammer, because the hammer would cause fracture—on the Thursday follow<lb></lb>ing, assisted by Mr. Pritchett, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on opening the head, immediately upon removing the skull cap, I discovered a rapture of the longitudinal sinus, a large blood vessel that runs across the head from front to back—the blow on the cheek might have occasioned that rupture—on the anterior part of the brain I found a solid clot of blood, measuring four inches by three, and weighing four ounces and a drachm, that represented a larger quantity of blood, because some serum would have oozed away—I have no doubt that the blow was the cause of the rupture—in a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, or where something unusual occurs, and great excitement is the consequence, more blood is sent into the head than usual—so severe a kick, or kicks, as the deceased appears to have had, might have ruptured the sinus—it might also be caused by pressure on the jugular vein—the pressure of the blood upon the brain was the proximate cause of death—if that blood had resulted from disease, it would have been either in the substance of the brain, at the back of the brain, or in the ventricles; I saw no other cause of death—I saw no trace whatever of the use of a hammer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. Might not the rupture of the sinus be caused as well by a fall as a blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must have been a very heavy fell, I think not—I do not think a violent fall, and the head coming in contact with the floor, or a hard substance, would be likely to produce the rupture I found—I should say it was impossible for a fall to do it, considering how dense the sinus is, and how severe the injury must be to rupture it—it is impos<lb></lb>sible for a simple fall on any hard substance to cause a rupture of the longi<lb></lb>tudinal sinus in a person of her age, and to have so large a quantity as four ounces of blood effused—I have never been engaged in a case of man<lb></lb>slaughter from a pugilistic encounter'—I know that in such cases it requires very nice discrimination to say whether death resulted from a blow or a fall; in those cases the blood is always in the substance of the brain, the ventricles, or the posterior part of the brain; you never get a large clot of blood of four ounces under the frontal bone—there was no fracture of the skull—</p>

               <p>the extravasation in this case must have been rapid, the vessel ruptured being so large—I think I can positively say that the rupture was not caused by a fall; there was more than an ounce of blood effused between the skin and the cheek bone, and the swelling was about an inch and a half in thick<lb></lb>ness; it must have been something more violent than any fall—we dissected the scalp from the cranium, and took the brain entirely out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I assisted Mr. Giles in the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have heard his evidence, and concur in it—I have nothing of importanfce to add to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. Is there not a difficulty in deciding positively whether the proximate cause of a rupture of the sinus id a blow or a fall <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As an abstract question, I think there is some difficulty—I have heard the evidence to-day—I heard the first witness state that the deceased had a fall, that was subsequent to her having the big lump on her jaw—if she had fallen violently on the boards, the rupture might have resulted from that.</p>

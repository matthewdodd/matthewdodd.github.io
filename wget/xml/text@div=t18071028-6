On Friday morning the 9th of this month, between the hours of eight and nine o'clock, a labouring man came and asked me if I had lost any sheep; I told him I did not know; he said if I would go to the field he would shew me the remains of some sheep that had been killed. I went with him, and he took me to one of my own fields, where I found three sheep skins, three heads with the wool on, three plucks, and the whole of the entrails but the cawls, and two sets of ribs of two sheep; they had the meat off all except three of the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the sheep been kept in that field. - A. No, they had not; they only came to my house the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the night before put into that field. - A. They were not; they were in a field that joins the bridge that goes over to Paddington canal; it was close to the other; nothing but the hedge and ditch parted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in the field where they had been kept, to see whether there was any blood in that field. A. No; they were killed in that field; there were three places in that field where I found the remains.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they must have been caught in the other field. - A. Yes.</p>

             thus depos'd. I saw the Prisoner married at the <placeName id="t17260425-39-crimeloc214">Elephant in Fleet-lane</placeName>

               <p>Dorfille's Landlord thus depos'd. That for 2 Years while he lodged at his House; the Prisoner sometimes came to him, and brought him Money from the Commissary, for which she us'd to take his Receipts, and she sometimes would dine with him, but I believe she did not love him so well as to bed with him, for he was a poor weakly Thing, and she had rather go to Bed to Thomas Bishop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith thus depos'd. Dorfille's right Name is Brookman, but when he was married to the Prisoner, he went by the Name of Dorfille and Defonelle. Another Witness thus depos'd. When the Prisoner was 14 Years old, she went to live with Dr. Letart, to be his Interpreter, he took her to Hammersmith, and there be debauch'd her, and she proving with Child, he threatned sometimes to kill her, and sometimes to send her to Bridewell, if she would not marry his Man, but promis'd her if she'd be contented, that he would maintain her handsomely, tho' he never took the least notice of her afterwards. - Her Husband was a poor Tool, he was always a lying upon her, and never did any Manner of Business, but took away what she had got, so that she was left in a bad Condition.

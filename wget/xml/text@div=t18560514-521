                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside at Keppel-place, Brompton. On 3rd April, about 20 minutes before 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I got into a Royal Blue omnibus in Billiter-street—I was going to Pimlioo—the prisoner got into the omnibus after I was seated—he sat next to me, on my right side—I had my pocket on my right side—the omnibus was crowded—after the prisoner got in I was annoyed by his pressing against me—I endeavoured to get from him, but he still followed me, and pressed against me—he raised up my drees on my right side, and picked my pocket of my purse—I had my purse safe when I got into the omnibus, at the bottom of my pocket—I carried the money to pay for the omnibus in my hand—there was in my purse a Post-office order far 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after the prisoner had taken up my dress I wished to leave, and I desired a man to stop the omnibus, and the moment I was going to leave, the prisoner had fastened his hand in my pocket, and tore the gathers out of my drew—I said, "You have picked my pocket"—he has a very large hand, and he dropped the purse at the right side—I did not see him throw it down, but he had his hand in a position to cover the purse—I was considerably agitated, and so I am now—the prisoner ran away, I ran after him; he crossed the road, and went between the coaches—the conductor pursued him, and he was taken—he said, "Pray don't give me in charge; look at me, look at me"—I did not wish to give him in charge, but a gentleman desired me to do so, for the benefit of the public—this is my purse, the one I had in my pocket—my son Charles had it all the time he was in Calcutta, and I covered it with a piece of my dress.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 493), I was on duty on that day in Cheapside—the prisoner was brought to me by the omnibus conductor, and given into my custody for stealing a purse—I took him to the shop where the lady was; she said, "You villain, you have robbed me"—he said, "Mother, what do you mean?" in broken English or French—she said, "You know that you did"—he seemed to wish her not to give him into custody, but he spoke such bad English I could not understand him.</p>

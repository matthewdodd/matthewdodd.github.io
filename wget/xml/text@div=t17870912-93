               <p>To Tomkinson. Look at the two iron chissels; the iron chissel, and the rabbit plane, you describe to be your own, what marks do you know them by? - I know the chissel by the handle being turned in the lathe, and the mark it has upon the face of it; it is a dent upon the face of the chissel; it is not common to every chissel to have such a dent in it as that is; I have had it four years; I had been working with it in this house.</p>
               <p>Have you not many chissels rounded in the lathe as you call it? - No.</p>
               <p>Now look at the rabbit plane, is that your's? - Yes, I know it by the colour, and the wood; there is a particular stain in the wood.</p>

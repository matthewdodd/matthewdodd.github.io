                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 21, Union-place, South Wharf-road, Paddington—the deceased, John Stafford, was my brother—on 4th February, between 9 and 10 in the morning, I was at work at the arches of the Great Western Railway—I was employed by Lester at the second arch from the one that fell—my brother was in the arch that fell—we were ex<lb></lb>cavating the soil on both sides, and the carts were taking it away—I never worked in the arch that fell—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a model of it—I do not know whether there was any coal in the bunkers; I never heard either of them say that there were coals there—about 7 in the morning Dowse, one of the men who got killed, came and spoke to me, but not in the prisoner's presence—I then went and looked at the arch, and saw the second pier, the iron stanchion lying on the ground after it fell from the roof—that was the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186304060044"></xptr>
               <p>hind one—one of the drivers, who is here, tied it to his cart, and drew it out of the way—neither of the prisoners were present then—we were authorized by Mr. Edwards to draw the first stanchion on the Tuesday, about a quarter to 4 o'clock; the second was drawn out of the way, between 7 and 8—only one "Eight strut" was put up on Monday night before we removed the first stanchion—this piece of wood represents the strut—after the second stanchion was drawn out, I saw Mr. Edwards there, who told me he was in the place from a quarter to 9 to 9 in the morning, on which it fell at 7—he came into the arch where we were working, but I did not see him in the arch that fell—he told me he had been there, but he did not tell me on the same day; it was when the Coroner came to look over the place—the stanchion was drawn out at 7, and the bunker fell at a quarter to 10—the men were working all the while—when the first stanchion was put away a strut was put up, but when the second stanchion was taken away no other strut was put up; there was no support at all—I do not know who ordered the first strut to be put up, but I believe Mr. Barnes put it up; he is here—I cannot say whether I saw Edwards there after the second stan<lb></lb>chion had been taken away—there was plenty of room for two struts to be put up, and plenty of time; it could easily have been done—Lester ordered us to go to work, and paid us—I heard the bunker fall—I was in the next arch but one; it covered four men, two of whom were killed—the coals smothered them up—I should say there were fifty tons of coal in the bunker—I cannot say whether Lester did or did not order any struts to be put up.</p>

SERGEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen Lester in the neighbourhood of the arch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when he said that he was there I understood him to refer to his having been at the works—the first stanchion had been taken away under orders, and a wooden sup<lb></lb>port of considerable thickness put up before the stanchion was removed—there is no doubt that a wooden stanchion ought to have been put up before the other stanchion was removed; any labourer would understand that—this stanchion was removed when the labourers were working round it—if I had been aware that there was anything above it, I would not have remained under the arch when the stanchions were removed—this support is of wood, and these are walls with stone pillars where it projects.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 102, Star-street—on the morning of the accident, Wednesday, I was working down at the <hi rend="italic">goot</hi> shed at the well—Lester employed me—I know that there were coals in the bunkers on the Saturday previous, when I was working under the arch that was empty, with Charles Levey, the second arch from the one that fell—when I was at work Lester came up and down a dozen times—I called him, and said to him, "What are you going to do about this iron column?" (that was the upright which was up in the second arch from the one which fell, for the purpose of supporting the bunker, but there were no coals there—some bunkers were empty unless there was about a sack in them, and some were full—this is the model of one arch; there are two iron columns in it)—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186304060045"></xptr>
               <p>Lester replied, "Down with it, and let us have the b—y muck in the cart"—the muck was the ground round the column—the ground I was excavating did not interfere with that arch at all—I turned round and said, "Look here, Lester, recollect there is a lot of coals under that arch"—he said, "Coals be d—d; let us have the muck out"—this referred to another arch, and I do not believe that foundation would interfere with the one that fell down—he was speaking of the stanchion supporting the arch under which I was working—Lester paid part of my wages, and part was paid out of Messrs. Smith's office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of the art of construction at King's College—I have examined the scene of this accident at the Great Western Railway—the cause of the accident was the weight of the coals after the removal of the columns—the proximate cause of the fall, was the removal of the support—I can only assume that the bunkers fell from the absence of support under them.</p>

Lester said that he was there at half-past 9, and did not observe that the second pillar was down, or he would not have worked under it, and had given orders, for it not to be taken away; that he never heard that there were coals in the bunkers, and did not use the expressions to him.</hi>

The prisoner came to our house on the 16th of March, in the evening, about seven o'clock, and asked for a glass of gin and respberry - he paid me a good half-crown; I gave him two good shillings, and 4d. in copper; I am certain the shillings were good - I sounded them when I gave them to him; on my giving them to him, he gave me a shilling, saying, "I will thank you to change this shilling, I don't like it;" and I did change it - he went away, and as soon as he was gone, I looked at the shilling, and perceived that it was a bad one; I put it into a back place in the till, separate from all other money; I showed it to my husband, not a minute after the prisoner was gone - I saw Coulson, the officer, the next day, and gave him the shilling - my husband marked it in my presence.</p>

Yes; I rang them on the counter when I gave them to him - I thought he returned me one of them at the time; I looked at it before he was gone, and was convinced it was had then, but gave him a good one for it - it is impossible I can be mistaken; I had other shillings in my till - I do not know that I ever took a bad one before; I did not see him change it, but am convinced he did - I think I saw him pop it into his mouth to change it; I was aware he was imposing a bad one on me.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you saw three on the counter, you did not feel certain whether he had taken up the two? A. I did not, but from what passed afterwards I was convinced he must have taken up two; if I had been certain of it before, I should not have given him another.</p>

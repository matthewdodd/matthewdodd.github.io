             (police-constable N 144). On the 9th of July, I was on duty on Stamford-hill, at a quarter before eleven at night. I met the prisoner, who had fast hold of the little boy by the hand - the prisoner was a <rs id="t18340904-122-deflabel695" type="occupation">sweep</rs>

               <p>CORNELIUS SANDS. This is my son - his name is Jeremiah - I came home from work about half-past eight o'clock that night, and he was lost - we went to several station-houses, and had no rest - the next morning the officer brought him - he goes to church, and knows good from bad.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH SANDS. I saw the prisoner sitting on our stairs, and he said, if I would go with him, I should have a good master, plenty of shoes and stockings, and plenty of victuals - and I should be a good way off, so that my father and mother would not see me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he was willing to go if I would take him to a good master - he should like to be a sweep. Witness. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master persuaded me to come to London to entice a little boy away, to come and be a sweep, and he would give me a sovereign - I came from Stamford, in Lincolnshire.</p>

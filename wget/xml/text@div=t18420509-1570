                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live in the country—I was stay<lb></lb>ing with my sister, who is in service at No. 22, Finsbury-square. On the 25th of April, I was at a public-house in Worship-street, Shoreditch—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184205090114"></xptr>
               <p>had in my pocket two sovereigns, some silver, a discharge paper, and a prize-ticket—I was rather in liquor—the prisoner was at the house—I had never seen him before—as I was stooping to get my bag in the house I found his hand in my pocket—I missed the sovereigns out of my pocket, and the silver shortly afterwards—I said nothing—I shook him off, and some of the silver dropped on the floor—I cannot say the sign of the public-house, as I was never there before—he took me from one house to another—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pot-man, at the Baker and Basket, in Worship-street, Shoreditch. On the evening of the 25th of April, the prosecutor and prisoner were in my master's tap-room—the prose<lb></lb>cutor was sitting at a table drunk, and the prisoner was sitting oppo<lb></lb>site to him—the prosecutor put his hand into his pocket, took out some silver, and put it on the table—the prisoner was reading the paper at the time—he passed it over to the prosecutor with his right hand, picked up the money with his left, and went out at the door with it—he afterwards returned and drank some beer, and went out again—I followed, and asked if he knew the prosecutor—he said he did not—I asked where the money was which he had taken off the table—he said at first he had not got it—he then took out 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and threw them down on the tap-room table, and said that was all, and he had picked them up—the prosecutor took them up and put them into his pocket—the prisoner was searched in the tap-room, and some silver and halfpence found on him, but no sovereigns—I am sure I saw him take up some silver—there was more than 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the table—I saw half-a-crown amongst it.</p>

I was at the Baker and Basket on this oc<lb></lb>casion—I saw the prosecutor sitting in a box, and the prisoner facing him, reading a paper—the prosecutor took a tin box out of his pocket with some money in it—it dropped on the ground—he put his hand into his pocket again, drew some more money out, and put it on the table—the prisoner handed the paper over to the prosecutor with his right hand, took the money up with his left, and walked outside the door—Reeve asked the prosecutor if he knew the man—he said, "No," and Reeve followed him outside the door, and asked him where he was going—he turned in again, and Reeve said, "What have you done with the money?"—he said, "I have only taken 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. away from him.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for—I asked the pro<lb></lb>secutor who robbed him—he pointed to the prisoner—I said, "What has he robbed yon off?"—he felt in hit pockets, and said, "I have lost two sove<lb></lb>reigns and some silver"—I said to the prisoner, "You must come along with me"—he said nothing—I saw the ends of the tobacco sticking out of hit left waistcoat pocket—the prosecutor said that tobacco was his—the prisoner said, "He has given me that"—the prosecutor-said, "No, I have not"—I found two sovereigns in the prisoner's fob, and two half-crowns, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., two penny pieces, and three halfpence in his breeches pockets—the pro<lb></lb>secutor had previously told me he had lost two sovereigns and some silver, but the amount of the silver he could not tell.</p>

On Friday night, the 7th of August, my street door was double locked, by my son - when I came down in the morning the box was broken off and the lock was double shot - these gold mouldings which had been on the landing of the stairs were gone; they had been rolled up in a green baize as they are now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When was this? A. On Saturday morning, the 8th of August - I did not call a constable - I know a man of the name of Smith, who came half drunk to examine the door, after the prisoner had been examined two or three times - he said he came to examine the door, but he did not - I certainly was taken into custody on this charge myself, and my son; I believe that was the only charge ever made against me - I have no recollection of ever being taken up on a charge of felony; I do not recollect that I was ever taken up; if I ever was, I have forgotten it - I cannot swear to a thing I do not recollect - I have been on a Jury, and I have been a constable - I cannot give any other answer; I have known Smith but a short time; I do not know that he is a constable - I have not received any money for the evidence I am to give - I borrowed some money of Mr. Edwards; I expect the reward according to the hand-bill as I took the prisoner with the property, and if it belongs to any body, I suppose it does to me - I did not say to Edwards, "You may as well let me have some money now, as it will be part of the 5l.,; and I am sure of convicting him;" I had about 2l. which I borrowed, and the boy's wages; the boy has seven shillings a week - I had seven shillings on that, and I think I borrowed four times ten shillings of him - I believe the prisoner has a high shoe, but he can walk as well as I can - I believe I received 1l. of Mr. Edwards, on the first or second examination - I did not borrow it to get my clothes out of pawn, that I might be a respectable witness - some of my clothes were in pawn, and very likely I might take some of them out with that money - I was kept in custody from Saturday night till Monday, and was examined before Alderman Ansley - I did drink a glass of gin with the prisoner when we were looking after the moulding - I did not know him before; but when I heard where the mouldings were, I went to him politically, as I understood he had offered them to Fairbrother - I went to the Spotted Dog, and found the prisoner; I called him out, and said,"I want to speak you; but we won't go into the taproom, as there are some people there" - he made no objection to go into the parlour; he said, "I thought you were coming to tap me on the shoulder for a bill of exchange;" I said, "No, Ward, I am nothing in that way; but Fairbrother says you know a person who has some mouldings to sell;" he said, "They are as far off as Mile-end-road;" I said, "I don't mind going as far as that;" he said, "You can't see them; a friend of mine took them for a bad debt, but if you will give me 3l. 10s., I will go and fetch them;" I said, "No, but call in the landlord;" the landlord came - I said, "I will put two sovereigns in your hand, to bind the bargain; and if Ward brings the mouldings, and they are what I want, I shall have thirty shillings more to give;" the prisoner then called a man named Nelson from the tap-room, and went out to fetch the mouldings; in fifteen or twenty minutes Nelson and he brought in these mouldings; he said, "Now, here they are;" my son was present, and I believe the landlord - I looked at them, and I said, "Mr. Ward, last Saturday morning my front-door was broken open, between five and six o'clock, and you are very much like the man that came out with these mouldings;" I gave charge of him - he said he thought I had behaved very bad to him; I said, "You need not think any thing of that, as I was taken up, and was forty-eight hours in hold;" the officer said, "You had better tell who was with you;" he said, "I will have my b-y neck broken before I will split;" the reason I called him Ward was, because his wife went with me, and she called him Ward - I might have been in the same room with him before, but not to my knowledge - I have not drank gin with him before or since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined Q. How many whole windows are there in Hough's house? A. I think very few; there are very few panes of glass whole - it is very much dilapidated; I know Smith - he is a gilder; he is not a constable now - Hough has had 2l. from me by three instalments; I do not recollect when he had the first, but he said it was to enable him to appear respectable at Guildhall to give evidence - he asked for it for the purpose of taking his clothes out of pawn; but before the second hearing he sent for some more money I would not let him have it - he came in his former dishabille; whether he asked for any more then or no I cannot say - he did ask for it on the ground of what he should receive on conviction, but I said I was so little acquainted with those things, that I did not know whether he was the right man to have it, but at any rate he could not have it till after the conviction - he has made no proposition to me to quash this prosecution; he is glad it has happened, and wanted to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100146"></xptr>make as much of a job of it as possible - after I refused to let him have any more money, he was ungenerous enough to serve me with a writ for false imprisonment, and I was taken up.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Edward's employ, and received this property to take to Mr. Moore's, in St. Martin's-lane, but I took it to my father's house, as I have done before - I double locked the street door, and the next morning the box of the lock was off, the lock double-shot, and the door broken open; I ran out into the street very much alarmed, and a young woman said she saw two men, one in a fustian dress, a tall thin man, and the other a short stout man, with a blue frock coat and black apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of house is your father's? A. A very large house - I was quite surprised at finding the door open; I had locked it - the windows are nailed up all but one; there are not above two or three panes broken - my master has said before, that if I felt myself tired I might leave my work at my father's; I was taken up, and so was my father; we have served a writ on Mr. Edwards - Smith came to examine the door; he did not examine it very attentively; he came tipsy with another man - I do not know whether he examined the door - he was standing on the steps; I suppose his eyes were three quarters of a yard from the door.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You thought, from your master's practice, you might leave these at your father's? A. Yes: I was to have received some more in the wood at Mr. Moore's, and he said if I was tired I might leave them at my father's.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARDS. I went out about dinner time, and told him I wished him to leave work at seven o'clock, and take them.</p>

The prisoner came to me about the 10th of August - he called me down stairs, and said a person at the end of the court had something to sell in my way; he did not know exactly what; I went to the end of the court - a person there pulled out a piece of moulding, and said he had some hundreds of yards of it for sale; I said I did not want any of it - the prisoner was at the opposite side of the court; the mouldings were similar to these - I told Mr. Hough of it, and he asked if I could tell him where the person lived who offered them; I took him to the prisoner's house, in Star-court - he is a very respectable man; he is lame - no one can see him walk without knowing it; he goes very much on one side.</p>

            . I received the prisoner on the 11th of August. In taking him to the watch-house, I said he should tell where he got them - he said he would suffer his neck to be twisted, or something, before he would let any one into it; they were found at the Spotted Dog, in Clement's-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the word he used, that he would sooner have his neck twisted than peach? A. That might be the word - I understood sooner than implicate another person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He spoke rather angrily, I believe? A. Yes; I cannot charge my memory as to whether I spoke to him about my being in difficulties, and had got over them - I might have said it, or I might not; I have been tried, but I really do not know whether I said so to him or no - it was an attempt at a rape charged against me - you pleaded the cause for me, and I was honourably acquitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Rack, of the King's Head, Upper Thames-street. On Whit-Monday, 20th May, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoners came—they had some gin and water, and asked for a place of convenience—I let them go up-stairs; the bagatelle-room was opposite where they wished to go to—they came down in about two minutes and went away together—I went up directly and missed the bagatelle balls, which I had seen safe two minutes before they went up—I afterwards saw Whitelock in custody for something else—Sidney came in and said, "Are you come about those bagatelle balls, sir?"—I said, "Yes"—she burst into tears and said, "I hope you will be as merciful as you can, for I never knew him to do the like before."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of No. 13, Bedford-row, and reside at No. 3, Camden-terrace, Camden-town. I am one of the trustees of some property in which my mother has a life interest—the amount is 6,975<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols, and 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Reduced Annuities, but that is not the real amount transferred to my name; a previous trustee had dealt with one of the funds, and in consequence I, as one of the family, took the trust in 1850 under that amount, but that is the amount in the deed—the actual amount of stock is diminished—that reduction had taken place without any act or concurrence of mine—William Wood Davis, my brother, is my co-trustee—the defendant became connected with our family in 1843 or 1843, by marry<lb></lb>ing my sister—his wife has an interest of a one-sixth portion in the rever<lb></lb>sion of those two funds—the sum invested in the Funds is diminished by about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know whether the prisoner was aware of that—on 31st October I was at my residence, No. 3, Camden-terrace, at a little after 11 o'clock, when the defendant came—(I am always to be met with at my office in the day time)—I had some friends at my house that evening, which was well known to the defendant, and we were just sitting down to supper in my dining-room, when I was informed that a person wished to see me—I said, "Let him send in his name"—no name was sent in—I heard a con<lb></lb>fusion in the passage, went out, and met a policeman outside my dining-room door—I saw the defendant a few minutes afterwards on the step of the door, just outside—he addressed himself to the policeman, and also to my solicitor, who was in the house and is a friend—he is not here, he is en<lb></lb>gaged and unable to come—the constable said "Are you Mr. Slack Davis?"—I said "Yes"—he said "You must consider yourself in my custody on a charge of embezzling funds," or words to that effect—I believe the defen<lb></lb>dant was not within hearing—I asked them to allow me a short time to prepare, to put on a coat and a pair of thick boots—he allowed me a very few minutes, and hurried me out of the house—there were two policemen in the house—I accompanied them to the Kentish-town station—the de<lb></lb>fendant walked a few steps after us—I heard him make the charge at the station—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Consols, and 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Reduced Annuities"—the inspector inquired more closely into it, and the defendant said a few words to satisfy him, I cannot say what—something was written down in writing, and he was called upon to sign it—after that, I was locked up in a cell all night—I am not prepared to swear whether the charge was read over to him or to me—it was not on a sheet, but in a book—bail was proposed by my solicitor, but the inspector said that it was a charge on which bail could not be taken—next morning I was taken to the station in Albany-street, and then to the Metropolitan Police Court, where I saw the defendant—he said "I charge Mr. Slack Davis with having fraudulently sold out," or "removed,</p>

               <p>a sixth portion of" the amount just mentioned—I heard him sworn, and heard him repeat the charge to the Magistrate, and he further stated that he had me arrested in the middle of the night because he was apprehensive that I was about to leave the country—the Magistrate said "This offence being committed in the City, I can have no jurisdiction!"—I was then taken to the Mansion House by the police in a cab—I was locked up some time till I was taken before the Lord Mayor—the defendant appeared, and repeated the charge in the same manner—the case was adjourned, and I was remanded on my own recognizance to appear on the Monday following—that was on Saturday—I appeared on the Monday, and the defendant also; but he made no statement, because the Lord Mayor began by deciding that it was a case on which, he could not decide—it was then dismissed, and I was discharged.</p>

               <p>of the whole family she has realised her life interest, and the amounts have been paid—my mother has a power over the fund to realise any portion that she pleases—it is a power which would naturally accrue; the tenant for life has realised her own interest—she had the power of dividing the same into whatever shares she thought proper among her children, and she exercised it for the benefit of Mrs. Brymer, in paying Mr. Brymer's debts—I and my co-trustee are authorised to invest this money in real security—these sums that we took out of the Bank of England, we invested in houses, and have obtained four per cent, on the freehold, and five per cent, on the leasehold—that was done with the full consent of my mother—the other parties were consulted about it, it was done with the knowledge of the whole family—it was considered by me and my co-trustee to be a beneficial act; the object of it was to increase an income which had been impoverished by the defendant, by his extravagance in incurring debts—I commenced busi<lb></lb>ness as a solicitor about five or six years ago—Mr. Noakes is my solicitor in this case; he told me about the security of the trustees, considering that they had the discretion to do so—as trustee I consider that the securities I have obtained, are perfectly good and valid securities; the property has been surveyed by a respectable surveyor—my mother the tenant for life, and all the other parties, are satisfied with the arrangements that I and my co-trustee have made—I have the surveyor's reports here; they were perused by me—I am aware that if I deal improperly or dishonestly with the funds, I am liable in a Court of Equity—I and the defendant have not been on good terms until this time; we had been on bad terms for some time, and I had not spoken to him—Mrs. Brymer's age is about thirty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Peacock tavern, Islington—I have known the prisoner for two and a half years, and was engaged to be married to him for about 10 months, up to July 1876—at that time matters came to my knowledge which indisposed me to many him—I lost sight of him then—I saw him again at the Peacock in the beginning of January—I asked him to keep away, that I did not wish to see him again—he said if the engagement was broken off something very serious would happen—he came there several times afterwards and wished to have a conversation with me; that he had something particular to tell me about his imprisonment—I declined to hear him—on 14th January, I received a letter in his handwriting, and on the 18th February, I received this, it is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This letter contained the expressions</hi>: "I have made up my mind to be revenged upon you. I will buy a large hammer and will wait for days, weeks, and months, to see you; I will then smash in all your pretty teeth and your little pug nose; I will be revenged upon you, you d—d cat; I will spoil your beauty; I will settle you and your bully, &amp;c.") (<hi rend="italic">The letter of the</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th was also read and contained the expression</hi>: "It would not take me long to take all the bounce out of you, and I could make you as the dearest of your spooney men would sicken at the very sight of you.... I should think no more of shoot<lb></lb>ing you than of drinking three penny worth of brandy, &amp;c.")</p>

I mean to say that I am afraid of you—I never saw you with a revolver, or any weapons—during the 10 months of our courtship we were on most affectionate terms—I have received presents from you and met you by appointment—I wrote to you after receiving these letters, once on 19th February and again on the 21st—if you had been steady, and my father had not interfered, I might have been willing to renew the engagement—you have advised me to leave the Peacock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Peacock—the prosecutrix was barmaid there before I became landlord—I have seen the prisoner there on several occasions since the early part of January—on one occasion he was in a very excited state, and said if Miss Rowe did not renew the engagement he would shoot her and blow out his own brains at my bar.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 25). I apprehended the prisoner at Manchester, on 27th February—I told him it was for threatening to kill Lucy Rowe—he said he was very sorry, he did send the letters to her, and he would shed his heart's blood for her; he loved the girl, and he would not see any one else have her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. You were very surprised when I apprehended you—you said you had not the slightest intention of harming the girl; that you had been a fool for writing such letters, and you ought not to have written them; that you loved her too dearly to harm her; you also said that Mr. Gillard had got this up for you—you did not seem to think it was anything serious; you said that you thought it very strange that Miss Rowe should think you meant anything as you had made it all right before you left London; that she had shaken hands and given you a kiss—her father said at the station something to the effect that his daughter had nothing to do with the affair; that she was under his control, and he had com<lb></lb>pelled her to prosecute.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in his defence, stated that his only object in sending the letters was to frighten her, and induce her to leave her situation, where she was exposed to temptation, and that he had not the slightest intention of doing her any injury</hi>.</p>

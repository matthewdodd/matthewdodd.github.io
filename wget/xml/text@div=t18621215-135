                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer of the City—I was employed by Messrs. Pawson on the morning of 3rd December, about a quarter to 10—I saw the prisoner leave their warehouse, 9, St. Paul's Churchyard, with a brown paper parcel in his hand—I followed him to two or three places, and ultimately to Mr. Wood's, a pawnbroker, in High Holborn—he went in at the sidedoor—I went in at the frontdoor, saw what the pawn<lb></lb>broker took from him, spoke to the pawnbroker, and left—there is a parti<lb></lb>tion between each box which prevented the prisoner from seeing me—I waited a minute or two till he came out, and after he got a few yards from the shop I stopped him—he had the same brown paper parcel with him then, with this pair of trousers in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "What have you got in that parcel?"—he said, "Well, I have got a pair of trousers"—I then told him I was an officer, and asked him where he had brought them from—he said, "From Messrs. Pawson's, in the City"—I said, "Did they give you any authority to offer them for pledge?"—he said, "No; they did not"—I said, "I must take you back"—he said, "For God's sake, don't take me in custody"—I told him my duty compelled me to do so, and I took him to Fleet-street Police-station—he gave his address there, "3, Blenheim-terrace, Kingsland"—after I got him remanded before the Magistrate, I went there and found these four coats and nine flannel shirts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the cloth department at Messrs. Pawson's—we have missed property from the stock in that department—these trousers are of the description we missed—I know them by the make—they were part of our stock—they have never been sold—the prisoner has been in Messrs. Pawgon's service—he was there about twelve months, this last time—he was a traveller about town, calling on shippers and merchants—he had an occasional account with our firm—when he wanted to purchase things he might do so for ready money—I can state positively that the trousers were not sold to him at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Mr. Pawson or either of the partners here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I have had the management of this case—I am not a member of the Society for the Prevention of Shoplifters—the case is prosecuted by a society—I am only toting as a witness—I don't know who the attorney is—I have not seen him about it—I gave him no authority to act for me—these would be sailor's trousers if a sailor had them—they are made for a sailor—I can't say how long the prisoner had been in Mr. Person's service—he was in the service some time ago—he was town traveller—he took out samples of things, similar to these which I have here, to get orders.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner take out samples similar to those you have there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was allowed to go and offer them to merchants, and return them the same day—be was allowed to take out two or three things, and leave them if necessary at the buyers; supposing he had taken out some shirts and had not returned them that day, I should have inquired where he had left them; if he said, "I have left them with a merchant; "I should let it off for a day or two, and then inquire again—in his former employment he did not fail to return anything that I am aware of—he had no account with the house that I am aware of—supposing he had taken out a coat and not returned it, and said that he had put it ou because it was a wet day, and he would keep it, in that case he would have to get a ticket signed by one of the partners, and make a ready money account of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you not deduct it from his salary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is very seldom we do that sort of thing—we first missed goods from our stock on 28th Novem<lb></lb>ber—we have about ten travellers altogether in the firm—there was only the prisoner in this department—his salary was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, with board in the house—he slept out.</p>

            ; on Saturday 27th of July last, within a few minutes of ten I was standing behind the compter, and heard a smashing of glass, I found the window broke, the corner of the wire was cleared of every thing that lay there, there were two cards of lace, which I had laid there myself about three o'clock in the afternoon; I had a pen in my hand for the purpose of marking them off, these laces were then gone, and a parcel of stockings which lay in that corner which I cannot identify, the two young men run out and brought in the prisoner at the bar, he had a handkerchief which he was dabbing his hands with, he had cut the fleshy part of his hand and all his knuckles, which were then all bleeding (the handkerchief produced, all bloody) I found nothing upon him at all, I never saw him from that time to this. Two or three people were passed by, but I had not the presence of mind to lay hold of them.</p>

               <p>I was in the shop on the 27th of July, between the hours of nine and ten, I was standing close to the window, and heard the window smash, I cast my eyes to a corner of the window, and saw an arm thro' it, I had time enough to have laid hold of the arm, but I was so struck: we found the door fastened with cord, we broke the cord and pursued the prisoner, and never lost sight of him; when he found we were pursuing him, he made a full stop, and looked at a silver-smith's shop, Mr. Dickey clasped him in his arms, when we took him to the watchhouse we examined his hand, which was cut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I stopped to look at some buckles in a window, and immediately some body came up to me, and took hold of me, and put my hands behind me, and told me I had broke a window and taken some things out of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any shutters or any thing of that kind in the window, to prevent his seeing you in the shop? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. DICKEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I was standing in the shop at the side of the counter, I heard the glass break, clapped my eyes on the prisoner, and saw his face from the reflection of the candle, and his arm dragging out the stockings: I run and saw the prisoner running, he made a full stop, and turned round to look at some buckles, I caught him in my arms, we did not observe the blood till we came to the watch-house.</p>

Could you observe whether any body was by, that he could give the things to? - I did not observe; his knuckles were cut and bleeding, the blood is on the handkerchief now, it was a darkish brown great coat which he had on: on the Monday we asked him, how his hand was cut? he said, it was our pulling him about.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not observe any person near him? - No Sir.</p>

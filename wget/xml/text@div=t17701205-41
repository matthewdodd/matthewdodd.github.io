               <p>Q. Do you remember going any time last summer to the house at Hoxton belonging to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bond. I went there to search the house for some stolen goods that were taken out of Mr. Scott's house where I live.</p>

               <p>Bond. The 6th of October.</p>

We had a suspicion of this rang the bell, a little girl came and opened door; as soon as the door was opened. the prisoner's, wife; I said to Mr. Halliburton we are very right. I believe: Mr. Halliburton and Scott were just behind me; they went the room and told Mrs. Lee they had a warrant to search her house; she said, very With this, Mr. Lee, who was at the other end of the second room, looked to see who it was he said, Very well, and made a run to garden; Halliburton pursued him and brought him back. When he was brought back, an made a spring to the fore door, and got upon the first stair; I brought him back again. Mr. Scott assisted me, we had a struggle for about ten minutes I believe. At last we got the better of him, and tied his hands; then I staid with the prisoner whilst Halliburton searched the house: they went down into the cellar and brought up this engine and these two dyes (produced in court.) Halliburton searched the prisoner's wife and found a bad half crown and shilling upon her.</p>

            . I searched this house along with the last witness. We found the engine fixed upon a square piece of timber, tied upon a post, about two foot over, and the square piece of timber was fixed upon that, the large fly was upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. In a back cellar.</p>

               <p>Halliburton. There were many other things which they call dies and dabs and bolsters; I am unacquainted with that trade: here is some sort of metal that I found which has been stamped, and here is a great deal of solder (producing it.) I found this bad shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other engines found?</p>

               <p>Halliburton. I can't tell what part, I did not believe then that it was a die.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it loose upon the ground, or where?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. I cannot tell that: I did not know the use of any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that it was Lee's house, did you?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. I can't tell that he was in the house when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your warrant?</p>

               <p>Q. Look if you can find any thing among these things used in the watch-case or key way?</p>
               <p>Winter. Here is nothing that can be of service in the watch-key way.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the prisoner before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Winter. I believe it might be two months before; I had never been at his new house.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the difference between a press and a stamp for that purpose; which is made use of?</p>
               <p>Winter. There must be both; they can't be made by a stamp without a press; it is impossible; you cannot make the case without the thing is as large as this.</p>

There came a tall thin man in the forenoon, and asked for the key; I said, there was a key, but I would not give it him; in the afternoon the little man came, and I delivered the key to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Lewis?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I have seen the man they call Lewis along with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if Lewis was at Lee's house at any time?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. Yes; I believe he used to be at Lee's house, at No. 2; they came into the house last quarter day; I have seen him at the house when I have went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business Lewis was?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I do not; I never saw him work.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you ever employed to search this house for any thing?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. After Mr. Lee was in trouble, Mrs. Martin sent for me to come to her; that was the person that lived with him. I went to her in Bridewell; there she delivered the chest that was taken out of the house, which Sir John had returned to her; I found that thing in searching the house [it appeared to be the face of a button.]</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Who bid you look at this particular place?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. I moved every thing; I was not desired to look in any particular place.</p>

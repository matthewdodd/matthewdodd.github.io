                  </hi>. I am a banker and money lender, and carry on business under the title of the National Deposit Bank, at 17, Russell Street, Covent Garden—I first became acquainted with the de<lb></lb>fendant about two or three years ago—on 13th December, 1873, he executed a bill of sale for 430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that document was destroyed when another one was signed—it was secured on a mortgage of his stock and crops on the farm called Crow Hall, Denver Felt hall, in the county of Norfolk—that loan was to be repaid by four monthly instalments of 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he made three payments of 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one on 16th February, "' one on 27th March, and one on 8th September, 1874; that left 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due—on 16th January this year he came to me and said he wished to borrow 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money and the remaining 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that was due on the previous loan to be included in it, making 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no one was present at that interview—I gave him a promissory note to take with him to get his son's signature to it—he took the promissory note away on the 16th, and on the 19th he came to me; on that occasion Mr. Thompson, the chief cashier, was present and witnessed the bill of sale—I then said to the pri<lb></lb>soner "Is your property still unencumbered beyond the bill of sale I hold dated December 13th, 1873, is it absolutely your own"—he said "Yes, it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030022"></xptr>
               <p>is"—I inquired of him whether he had full right to assign it to me, because in that inventory they could not be the same crops as were in the inventory of 1873—he assured me that the whole of the property was unencumbered—I am sure that he said that, otherwise I should not have parted with the money—I did not make inquiry about any other bills of sale—I asked him generally whether his property was unencumbered; I then advanced him the money—I wrote the inventory down in his presence from what he told me, and he signed it; this is it, and this is the bill of sale—it was given to him to read and was fully explained to him—he signed it before I gave him the cheque—I should not have given him the money unless he had signed it—after he had signed it I made out this cheque and gave it to him,. and I also released his other bill of sale; it was cancelled, torn up in his presence, and a receipt given to him for the money—I gave him 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I held a previous promissory note of his for the 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I gave him that back and took the new bill of sale to secure the 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable in four monthly instalments of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—the first instalment was due on 9th February—I was induced to part with my money upon his representation that the property was unencumbered—if I had known that Mr. Stevenson had a bill of sale of March, 1874, I should not have advanced the money—neither of the bills of sale were registered—I got a notice from the Bankruptcy Court about eight or nine days after I had advanced the money; I think on 4th February, as I had advanced the money on 19th January—my cheque has come back from my bankers paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a banker—I do not take deposits from customers upon which they draw cheques—I could issue cheques, but I am simply a deposit banker—I am a banker in precisely the same sense as Coutts and Glyn—I am a money-lender as well as an ordinary banker—I advertise every day in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, and have done so for a considerable period, seven or eight years, at 5 per cent, interest—I have not been all that time in Russell Street; at the time I advanced this money I was at 87, York Road, Westminster Bridge Road, and 33, Bloomsbury Street, Oxford Street, my name is Alexander Serjeant Cochrane—that is the name I have always gone by—I used to advertise in the name of Alexander Serjeant in all the papers, the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>—the reason why I adver<lb></lb>tised in that name was because I was then my own manager, and in paying a farmer a cheque if I had signed it Serjeant and he paid it to his banker they would know that he had been to a London banker to borrow money, and that would have injured his credit—I signed my cheques in the name of Alexander Cochrane, then they would not know where he had been to—I have never been convicted, of course not—I was never convicted in the name of Serjeant—the defendant knew me as Mr. Serjeant Cochrane—I may have written to him in the name of Serjeant—he may have applied to my office for money when I advertised in that name—I did not say at the Police Court that I had some thousands of bills of sale running of this character; a thousand I dare say I might have—I have only been in Russell Street since July last—I advance at 5 per cent. where money is borrowed for ten years on mortgage of house property—I think I charged the defendant 15 per cent., certainly not close upon 90 per cent.—I gave him 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan—the book only shows the 430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not the amount I gave—I had to pay the expense of going down to his</p>

               <p>place to make inquiries—before negotiating the first loan I wrote to him to say he must pay my second-class fare to Norfolk—that was prior to this loan—the loan was secured by four promissory notes of 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable in one, two, three and four months—he borrowed the money for four months, and we always reckon the interest on the length of time—the 15 per cent. was for the accommodation—the first three instalments were met, the fourth was not—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a month for that while it was running—of course if a person wants it to stand over they pay in proportion—it went on up to 19th January—in December, 1873, his son was security—he was security for every one of these notes—I did not know that his son could deposit security to the extent of 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never heard of such a thing—I required the son's security on each note—I asked him about security and he said his son was a man of some considerable property and he would ask him to be security—I then made out the pro<lb></lb>missory notes and said if his son would sign them I would lend him the money—Richard Parnell is my manager—I have several clerks; I have one named Henry Isaacs, we call him Mr. Henry—I am not aware that he rings the changes on his name—he does not go by the name of Mr. Henry as a rule—I did not know that he signed for the bank in the name of Henry till you told me so the other day at the Police Court—I know now that he did sign "I. Henry," he is here—it was on the 16th January that the defendant called; I had written to him to say that I must have his loan settled up; I did not keep a copy of the letter—I did not ask him for more interest; he did not say when he came that he had come to pay the interest—he did not have a conversation about breeding-horses for me—I wanted a carriage horse and asked him if he had one for sale; he is a breeder of horses—I did not say to him "Do you want any more money—the proposition came from him; would I let him have some more, and I said I would do so on condition that his son signed a fresh promissory note and this bill of sale would then have to be cancelled—I did not let him have the money on the 16th, because he had not got his son's signature—I would not have let him have the money but for his son's signature and the bill of sale—I had a bill of sale on the son's goods as well; he never deposited with me 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of security, not a farthing—it is true, as I said before the Magistrate, that I refused to let the defendant have any more money till the promissory note was signed by the son, I waited three or four days till he brought it, and then I advanced the money—I had not shown him the bill of sale on the 16th, it was simply a copy of the original one; it was not prepared then—I spoke to him about it then, I swear that; no one was present—I am not aware that a prisoner on his trial cannot <hi rend="italic">give</hi> evidence—this is only the second time I have been here, I was here about six years ago when I prosecuted a person; I know nothing of criminal matters—the prisoner owed me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for inte<lb></lb>rest after he had signed the bill, and after I had received the son's promis<lb></lb>sory note, the costs made it 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there was the cost of the bill of sale, the cost of inquiry into his responsibility at Stubbs and Perry's, and the stamps—we always have fresh inquiries, to see whether there is any other bill of sale registered—at that time the son also owed me 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for an advance of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not have that by driblets; he had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week by his own desire—he has paid back the whole of that and he gave me 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to release his liability to these promissory notes; he was liable for the whole 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but a few days prior to my receiving the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. his solicitor called and told me if I did not receive the money he would file a petition for liquidation, and under</p>

Goatley is a com<lb></lb>missioner for administering oaths; he is my solicitor in this matter—Mr. Abrahams, his representative, acted for me at Bow Street, I don't know whether he is a solicitor; he examined the witnesses for me; he went with me into the Grand Jury room yesterday—Mr. Stevenson was not examined before the Grand Jury, only me and Mr. Abrahams—Israel was before the Magistrate but was not examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have the cheque here that I gave him on 13th December, 1873; it is for 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—up to 8th September I had only received 322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and interest for arrears—that came to 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the interest on renewals would be more than on the loan, because, if you cannot depend on a man's money coming back, you must charge more, because you have not the money to work with—I had to pay five guineas out of pocket in sending to Norfolk, and my surveyor has two guineas a day—I did not get back the 430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lost 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of that promissory note—the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I received from the son relates to the second loan—the money I lent in December, 1873, did not come back till February, 1875, and then not the whole of it, and I should not have got it unless I had written to him a great many times—I should not have parted with my money upon the promissory notes without the bill of sale—if he had refused to sign the bill of sale, I should not have parted with the money; it was on the bill of sale and the promis<lb></lb>sory notes that I parted with it; the bill of sale was the only security I had—the son's loan was 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I gave him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—that loan was granted on 23rd September, 1874—he is of full age and a well-educated man—that loan was between the two loans to the prisoner—he was only too pleased to borrow the money on the terms; he took away half of it, and requested me to send him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to pay his men's wages—that was entirely his own wish, and I was at the expense of registering the letters every week—I should not have parted with the 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner but for his statement that there was no encumbrance on his property beyond the residue of the old bill of sale.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a scrivener, of No. 3, Bond Court House, Fallbrook—I know the defendant—on 27th March, 1874, he called on me and wanted to borrow some money—I let him have 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on three farms, Crow hill Farm, Poppy Lot Farm, and Shrub hill Farm, near Down ham, Norfolk—I asked him if he had any bill of sale or any encumbrance upon. his property—he said he had not—I advanced him 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have the cheque here—before I parted with it he signed the bill of sale and the inventory; I produce them; it is to secure 475<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be repaid by three instal<lb></lb>ments on 27th of May, June, and July—he did not pay any of them; he only made one payment of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in September, about six months after the time:—he still owes me 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went down to Norfolk; I was there nearly two days. with the defendant—I found him in the occupation of a large farm there; I went over it with him and his son—I have no idea of the number of acres, it was a very large place; he told me it was near 2, 000 acres alto-gather, but I have no means of judging at all of that—I saw a great quantity. of turf—I took a second bill of sale on' 26th January, 1875; that was in reality to secure this—this was unregistered—the reason I took the other was that on 23rd or 24th January, or perhaps the 25th, Mr. Mitchell tele<lb></lb>graphed to me that he had got an execution in, and I went down with my, solicitor to see what it was about, and then the second bill of sale was taken to secure this, because he thought he might have other executions put in—when I went down there I looked very carefully round the farm—I don't know much of growing crops, but other things I know pretty well; I think what I saw was worth between 4, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not hear till I went down the second time that he was engaged in a heavy law suit last year; I read an account in the London papers that he had an arbitration case with Canon Sparks, of Ely, his landlord; I believe all this trouble was occasioned by the failure of that law suit—I don't believe he would have had any reason to call his creditors together but for the execution that was put in by the clergyman.</p>

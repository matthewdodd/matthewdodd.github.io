                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Devonshire-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road. On 4th Feb., I went to the play with Simpson, and came out—we went into a public-house—Simpson was tipsy—I had a glass or two, but I knew what I was about—we were in the public-house three quarters of an hour—the prisoner and some more came up—I had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my hand, which Simpson gave me to take care of—I was going to pay sixpence out of it, when the money was snatched out of my band—they ran off, and I ran after them, and hallooed "Stop thief!"—some said I should have the money back again—I then turned back, and found Simpson waiting outside the public-house for me—I saw the prisoner strike him, and he knocked him down and kneeled on him—I said, "John, you had better get up, this is one of them that got my money"—I saw the prisoner take the watch out of his waistcoat-pocket, and try to break the guard—I told him to let him go, he was stealing the watch, and if he did not let it go, I would call the policeman and give him in charge—with that he struck me two or three times, and kicked me—I <hi rend="italic">sung out</hi> for the policeman, and saw the watch in his hand—he ran away—I pursued him, and saw the policeman run after him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you any drink before you went to the theatre? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was rather overcome afterwards—it was one of those who was in company with the prisoner who snatched the money from me—I was not quite right—we had had three pots of ale—I could not see whether the guard was broken or cut, but when he ran away the watch was gone, and the guard was left—the others all made their escape—a good many persons came when I made the alarm—it was between twelve and one o'clock—I believe the night was a little wet—the prosecutor was afterwards taken to the station—I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

On 19th Jan., in consequence of information, I went on board the schooner <hi rend="italic">Seabird</hi>, which was lying in St. Katherine's Dock—I saw John Hughes there in the forecastle, he was appa<lb></lb>rently in a very bad state—he had his arm in a sling, with an old handerchief and a piece of old canvas over his elbow—neither of the prisoners were present—I did not remove the sling so as to examine his arm—he pulled up the leg of his trowsers, and showed me a wound on his shin—I took him to Mr. Ross, the surgeon—I went on board the schooner again next morning—I then saw the mate, Wilson—I asked him how it was that he did not let the man go ashore when he asked him—he said that the captain had given him orders not to let him go ashore, but to give him in charge of the police-Hay man was the captain—Wilson said he did cut the man with the cutlass, because he would not come to the pumps when the ship was in a sinking state off the Caskets—I saw Hayman that morning; I told him I had got a warrant to apprehend him and the mate, for ill using John Hughes—I said to him, that Hughes had been cut about a good deal—he said, I know nothing about his being cut at all—I saw the body of Hughes after his death, in the museum, on board the <hi rend="italic">Dreadnought</hi>, on 14th May—I was before the Magistrate when he was examined, in the prisoner's presence—I saw him make his mark to his deposition—this is it.</p>

               <p>11th Jan., between eight and nine o'clock at night I went below with my watch to supper; after I had been below about fifteen minutes, the mate (the prisoner Wilson) came down and said, 'Come, come, come on deck.' I was, standing in the forecastle and said, I wanted to get an hour or two's rest, as I had been on deck so long; the other people did not say anything, they had had a rest before; then the mate went on deck. In about an hour afterwards he came down with a sword, he again said, 'Come, come, come on deck.' I told him I was just getting ready. I was not in bed. He said,' I can't wait any longer,' and he cut me underneath the arm with the blade of the sword. I bled very much, and ran on deck towards the galley. The captain (the prisoner Hay man) took hold of me and commenced kicking me, and the mate struck me first with the flat of the sword, and the captain said,' Kill him, Wilson;' and the mate cut me with the sword on the elbow, thigh, and shin, while the captain was holding and kicking me. They saw me bleed<lb></lb>ing, and sent me to lie down. I was unable to do any work afterwards. The mate came to me and dressed my arm; and while he was dressing it he said he could kill me by the law of England, because I did not go on deck. I had had no words before with either the captain or mate. I had no knife about me. I never lifted my hand to the mate or the captain; it had been blowing hard, and I had been at the pump; my clothes were wet, and I had no others to put on; when I went into the forecastle, I told the mate I could stand it no longer. After the ship arrived in the St. Katherine's Dock 1 told the mate I wished to go ashore, to have my wounds dressed; he said he had got orders that I should not go ashore. I have been suffering ever since from the wound I received in the elbow; I have been in the seaman's hos<lb></lb>pital ship, to which I am to return; it happened at sea; the <hi rend="italic">Seabird</hi> is a British ship.")</p>

                  </hi> I am a seaman, on board the ship "Bullfinch," lying in St. Katherine's Docks—on 24th Nov., between ten and eleven o'clock I came on deck and saw the prisoner come out of the forecastle—I said, "Halloa, scamp, what are you doing here?"—I did not know him before—he said, "I have come for a letter"—I knew there was a letter lying to be posted, with 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. attached to it—I went down and found my cheat open, which was in the place where the prisoner was coming from—my things were all turned over—I missed a hat—in the evening, going home from my work, my shipmate recognised the prisoner—I laid hold of him, and gave him a charge—he had my hat on—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I only knew him by seeing when I saw him, but I had no notion then of its being mine.</p>

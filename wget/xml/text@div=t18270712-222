I got a candle, and Newman pointed out a broken window, which has no shutter; a hand could be put through the aperture, and unfasten the screw, which keeps the sashes together; there was no line to it, and when that was out the top sash falls; we looked further, and found the prisoner concealed between some loose paper and the wall - I gave him in charge, and saw him searched at the watch-house; some money was found on him, which I cannot swear to - we found a paper of six pairs of silk stockings in a room, where some carpenters had been at work - he must have passed the door of that room to get to where he was. I believe them to be mine, but have no mark on them.</p>

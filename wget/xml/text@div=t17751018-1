On Saturday the 16th of September, the prisoner served a warrant upon the deceased for using a woman ill that he had lived with. The prisoner used the deceased very ill, in dragging him up and down the street, before he carried him to the justice. They quarrelled; upon this, after he had served the warrant, Justice Sherwood had him put into the watch-house upon the deceased's complaint of his ill treatment, and behaving ill to the justice himself. He continued in the watch-house from Saturday till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any warrant?</p>
               <p>Rosmanson. I did not see any.</p>
               <p>On Monday he was brought before Justice Sherwood at his own house. I was there from ten o'clock in the morning. When the prisoner came in, he asked the justice's pardon; the justice said, he would forgive him if the deceased would; the deceased said, he would forgive him, provided he would go on board a ship with him, that he might come into no more trouble. The deceased was going to sea, and wanted to take him with him. They were common seamen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they ever gone together before?</p>
               <p>Rosmanson. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner agreed to go, and then the prisoner was carried over to the Virginia planters, a public house, in which they confined people, and locked up, till he could find money to discharge the justice's warrant, and such like. I fetched for that purpose, five shillings first, and four afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that money paid to the justice's clerk?</p>
               <p>Rosmanson. It was given into the deceased's hand, and he went over to pay what demand there was.</p>
               <p>The deceased made the prisoner promise before the justice, that he would go with him; I saw him kiss the book upon it, and he made his compliments to the justice that he would go to sea with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned from the justice to discharge the demand, as you call it, where was the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Rosmanson. He was locked up there, in a lock-up room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober, or in liquor?</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's wife there?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Not at that time. We went into the lower room; the prisoner threw himself upon the bed again; the deceased said, Ellick get up and go on board a ship; you know I have given my affidavit for you to go on board a ship and you are not to be seen here any more; he would not give any answer whether he would go or no; then the deceased said to me, go down and see if any of the justice's runners are at Mr. Winn's, that is, the Black Horse, and fetch them up here; he said, he would have the prisoner carried to prison again; as soon as the prisoner heard those words he ran up to the chimney and took down a cutlass, he drew it, and said to the deceased,</p>
               <p>"go out of my house directly." The deceased took up a quart pewter pot, and the prisoner cut him on the head with the hanger; the deceased held the pot up as if he was going to throw it at the prisoner, but he did not throw it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it bleed?</p>
               <p>Salmon. I did not stop to see; the deceased then put both his hands upon the prisoner's shoulders and said, see what you have done?</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in a friendly manner or a struggling way, or how?</p>
               <p>Salmon. He wanted to get the cutlass from him I believe, the prisoner made a second stroke,

               <p>Salmon.

            . I am a weaver. I never saw the deceased before that day; I was with one Faulkner and the prisoner and the deceased at Mr. Winn's, the Black Horse, in new Gravel-Lane, in the afternoon at about three o'clock, which was about an hour and a half or two hours before the accident happened, Faulkner and I called for a pint of beer, the deceased said, make it a pot and I will join with you; that was agreed upon, and we had a pot; after that was drank the prisoner got up and struck<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180006"></xptr> Faulkner; soon after that the prisoner went out and the deceased with him; when the prisoner struck Faulkner the deceased said, it was a malicious thing to strike a man without provocation; the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"he would serve him worse if he said any more."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any other threat ening expressions to the deceased?</p>
               <p>Orange. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not been quarrelling before, had they?</p>
               <p>Orange. Not as I know; they came in there together from the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Tate in point of sobriety?</p>
               <p>Orange. I believe he had been drinking a little, but was sober enough to know what he said and did: then they went out together very agreeable. I sent after the deceased for the money for his pint of beer: not knowing him, I did not know whether he might come back again: he sent me three halfpence. I went up after that to one Downes's, in New Gravel-Lane. I had not been there above ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, before I heard Ellick Tate had killed his brother-in law. I had staid about three quarters of an hour at the Black Horse after they went away, to drink out my beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased his brother-in-law?</p>
               <p>Orange. Yes. I ran down directly after him, and asked the people which way he had taken. We found him about two hours after among some cabbages and raddishes behind Vauxhall: he was lying upon his face; we turned him upon his back, and tied his hands behind him. While I was tying him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Jack, what have I done! I have done</p>
               <p>"murder!" Parker said, he had done so. I said he had not, in order to get him along quietly. Then he said,</p>
               <p>"Jack, I am sure my</p>
               <p>"hands are bloody, wipe them for me." I said, Ellick, they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to be in great agitation at that time?</p>
               <p>Orange. Yes; we brought him to the justice.</p>

            . I am a surgeon: I was sent for to the deceased upon the 18th of September, about half after five in the afternoon. I found him to every appearance dead, and I imagined he must have been dead half an hour. Mr. Calve, a surgeon present, opened a vein before I examined further. He is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it bleed?</p>
               <p>Walley. Very little, as is common with people soon after their death just a spirt or two. There was a wound upon the side between the fifth and sixth rib: we examined it as accurately as we could: it had entered two inches and a quarter in an oblique direction, though not into the cavity of the thorax, but superficial.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend that wound to be the occasion of the death of the deceased?</p>
               <p>Walley. No, I found a large wound accompanied with a fracture upon the head. The substance of the brain was wounded by the instrument: it must be some instrument very sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a cutlass have made such a sort of wound?</p>
               <p>Walley. Yes; it went into the substance of the brain about two inches and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What length?</p>
               <p>Walley. About two inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his death?</p>

               <p>Walley. The wounding some principal vessels in the brain by that stroke.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that occasion an instantaneous death; or would death come on by degrees?</p>
               <p>Walley. I have known the substance of the brain wounded where a person has lived thirty days after.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you distinguish between the cerebrum and the cerebellum; the cerebrum may be wounded; and the party live?</p>
               <p>Walley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The other is instant death?</p>
               <p>Walley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the cerebellum lie?</p>
               <p>Walley. In the front of the forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great effusion of blood?</p>
               <p>Walley. There had been; it oozed out at the time I came.</p>
               <p>Q. After receiving this stroke at first, he continued struggling with him upon his legs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180007"></xptr> for a minute or two, and then afterwards fell down?</p>
               <p>Walley. I imagined the deceased to be falling.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, you have no doubt but the wounds were the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Walley. I am fully convinced within myself.</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse. The prisoner and the deceased came into my house that day they were both in liquor: the deceased insisted upon taking him on board a ship: the prisoner was much in liquor: he made a slip and fell upon some people in another box. I desired him to go home about his business: he went away directly. The deceased missed him: he had been gone about one hundred yards out of the house, when the deceased missed him and went after him: he went away without paying his reckoning; a person went after him, and brought back some halfpence. I went up to his house; I saw this cutlass lie in a closet close to the fire-side; there was some blood upon it then.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I only know him by sight; he always<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180008"></xptr> behaved with good manners as far as I saw.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner make use of no bad language?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. No, he only begged him to let him alone; the worst word he said, was, pray let me take my rest, and I will go with you any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the two girls?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I cannot say I know much of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is their reputation?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I fancy them to be no better than they should be; their general character is to be bad people about the street.</p>
               <p>Court. What character does Mills bear, you called her a good woman just now?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. She is a good woman as far as ever I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she keep company with?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I don't know; she has an old man that she calls her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she keep company with the prisoner or not?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I am not able to say.</p>

            . I unlocked the door for the prisoner; the deceased caught hold of the skirt of his coat, and came in with him; the prisoner flung himself upon the bed in the kitchen; this was at the prisoner's own house; the deceased said, the time draws on, you must go down to the ship; the prisoner made no answer. I said, Bill, for Christ's sake let him have a couple of hours sleep, then he will go, for what can you do with a man in liquor; he said; Buggor my eyes, he shall go, for there is no time to make any delay, and he pulled him off the bed upon his backside upon the ground. Ellick jumped up, and took him by the hand, and said, Will, I love you well, but if you will use me so ill as this, I will suffer imprisonment. The deceased struck him in the face, and Ellick struck again; then the deceased took a quart pot off the table to strike him, but I cannot say I saw him strike him with it; I saw him lift his hand as high as his head; then after the pot was taken up by the deceased, the prisoner took the cutlass; I saw it, and I cried murder immediately; I thought it was improper to be, I went between them, I tried to prevent the mischief; I pushed my hand against the cutlass, and got cut a lit-little, but not to hurt me.</p>

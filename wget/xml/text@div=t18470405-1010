                  </hi> I live in Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner Gayton has lodged at my house about seven months, as a single man—I do not know the female—on 23rd March, I was awoke about two o'clock in the morning, by a disturbance in the house, and being called by name by one of the lodgers—I got up, and found the noise was in Gayton's room—he had come home after I went to bed—I had heard him go up stairs a few minutes before, with somebody—I went to the room door and heard a female's voice, and asked Gayton to turn the women out, and to be quiet—he refused—they were evidently quarrelling—I said, "Then I shall go and fetch a policeman"—he said, "Very well"—I got a policeman, who went up and demanded ad<lb></lb>mittance—Gayton refused to open the door—at that time they were quarrelling as before, but I could distinguish no words—the policeman put his knee to the door and forced it open—when he got in, Gayton struck him—he had not been in the room above two or three minutes—when I went up stairs, King, the policeman, was struck—I went down and fetched Lumb, another policeman—he went up first—when I got up he had hold of Gayton—I saw the woman throttle Lumb, and in the act of striking him—Gayton was struggling with him—I went down and sent another policeman up, but I did not go up again.</p>

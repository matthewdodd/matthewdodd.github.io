             was clearing the forecastle, I saw the two pieces of Russia duck in the shot locker; this bag was underneath the two pieces of Russia linen in the shot locker. About eleven o'clock in the forenoon I saw it again in the same place in the shot locker.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you saw it first - A. A little after breakfast, and I saw it again between three and four in the afternoon in the same place. I saw part of it in the same place; part was gone; about half a piece apparently was gone.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it you saw a half piece - A. On the 19th, the next day. I perceived a piece and a half was left, and that half a piece was gone. On Wednesday I saw the other half piece underneath the bed cabin. It was about one o'clock I saw it underneath the bed cabin. I first saw a piece and a half, the next day I saw the half piece.</p>
               <p>Q.About what o'clock did you see the half piece - A. About one o'clock I saw the half piece underneath the bed cabin in the forecastle; that was a few yards from the shot locker. On Wednesday I mentioned it to Blanch; the other prisoner was on shore. I told him on Tuesday I saw the two pieces underneath the shot locker, that it had been removed. Blanch said Brennan was on shore; we should tell him of it; he added that it would be better to tell the captain, and we should not be blamed, and then they would make a seizure of it. He said there were two boys who had run away, it might be imputed to them, and they would be transported for it. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160014"></xptr>waited till Brennan came on board; Brennan came about twelve o'clock; then Brennan sent a man to call me in the cabin; I went into the cabin; I found the two prisoners in the cabin. Brennan said they would take the two pieces of Russia linen; they would give me a few shillings out of it, and they would do the best they could with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you miss the Russia duck out of the place where you saw it - A. Directly after this conversation I went to the place where I had seen it, and found it was missing.</p>

            . I am mate of the Lord Harlington. I was informed where the Russia duck was; I was directed by the Captain to watch who should take it away from that place; for the purpose of seeing that, I placed myself close to the bulk head, forward; I then commanded a view of the sleeping place of the two prisoners; they were in bed at the time I was stationed there. I saw Brennan get out bed. I saw one of the prisoners take the Russia duck from under the bed cabin; he placed it in the clew of his hammock. The other was by at the time. Then Brennan got on his back; he was partly dressed. I cannot say which of them laid it on his back; they were both together. Blanch tied his breeches with rope yarn; the waistband would not meet.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the Russia duck was in the waistband of his breeches - A. Yes. I then went on deck, and sent for a police officer; the officer came, and found the duck on his person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Smuggling is done as secret as possible - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARK. I am a Thames police constable. The captain came for me. I took this piece of Russia duck from Brannan's back; it was fastened round his waistband with rope yarn. This is the half piece I took from his back; the other has not been found. When I found it upon Brennan he said it was the first thing he had done ever since he had been in the employ.</p>
               <p>Q. to Captain Hall. Was that the Russia duck that was on board your vessel - A. Yes; it is ten yards.</p>
               <p>Blanch's Defence. This piece of Russia linen the two boys that run away from the ship, they said they bought it in Russia; they asked us to buy it; we gave them twelve shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Brennan said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Brennan called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

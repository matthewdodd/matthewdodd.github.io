               <p>Q. Does he in the Post-office arrange the letters that he is to carry for delivery - A. He does, he does that at a table.</p>

               <p>Q. Does he make that assortment in the Post-office at a table there - A. John does.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he doing that on the 20th of August at the same table at which the prisoner was arranging his letters - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had John occasion from time to time to go from the table and deliver the letters which he had sorted to the letter-carriers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he did so, I presume, the remaining letters were left on the table - A. They were.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. This letter would not be for the prisoner to deliver in the course of his delivery - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Those persons who perform the duty of sorting the letters, have they a writen appointment, or whether they are appointed verbally - A. They are directed verbally by the inspector; they are hired by the appointment of the Post master general.</p>
               <p>Q. Those people that carry out letters are appointed by the post master general. Do you mean that the prisoner has a written appointment from the post master general. Confine yourself to the question I ask you who is the person that employs him, who gives him the direction to act - A. I was the person who gave him the direction that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who orders him to come there - A. I order him to come there.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the person from whom he receives his immediate direction - A. I do. When I am there he has no written appointment that marks to me the particular duty that he is to perform.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any paper by which he is appointed by the post master - A. No such paper is directed to me, they are frequently appointed by personal application. I have no right to employ them without directions from the secretary.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he perform any particular duty, only the delivering letters at the water-side, or is he the general servant of the post office - A. It is his particular duty to deliver letters on board ships in the river Thames.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had ordered him to carry letters within London in any of the twelve divisions - A. I should not have directed him to any other part of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose act is it to appropriate that - A. In consequence of previous instructions from the secretary I appropriate this duty to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever employ persons who are specially appointed upon special service to carry letters within London - A. We do, occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have your pleasure or have directions from the post master that a man is to be employed upon such particular service, how came he to be employed in delivering letters on board the ships - A. That was in consequence of his father having been a waterman, and he succeeded this business at his father's death.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose appointment. What had you to tell you that he was to deliver letters on board of the ships - A. I had verbal instructions from the secretary or a a written order which I do not know. He has been employed about two years. Besides delivering letters on board the ships he has occasionally delivered letters between there and London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he occasionally sorted letters - A. Yes, he does what we order him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. And he received pay during this time for carrying letters - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not see him in the act of sorting that day assisting John - A. I do not recollect seeing him that day. On other days I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then sorting is part of his duty under your immediate order - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether he is a sorter or a deliver of letters is under your command - A. Yes, I could not remove him from delivering letters on board the ships because I had no other in his place.</p>
               <p>Q. But it rests with you to sort letters or to deliver - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. That day it was his function to deliver - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. He would assist any day that he was there from a general order that was given him to assist in sorting or any duty in the eleventh division, according to the general order that you had given him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if he did assist this man in sorting letters it would be in obedience to your order for that purpose - A. It would.</p>

               <p>Q. 259 B and 693 A - A. They were paid on the 25th of August.</p>

               <p>Q. How were they paid - A. Another gentleman will prove that; I am able to say they were paid on the 25th of August, by posting the notes on the ledger, the notes came to me in the regular course of business in an interior office, as being received that day.</p>
               <p>Q. These two notes appear to have been paid together - A. They do, according to the manner they are posted; they follow each other. There is a possibility that they may not have been paid together, but they follow each other; I suppose them to be paid together.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the afternoon of the 25th of August; two twenty pound notes being paid - A. I remember a note or notes of Mansfield, Miller, and Company, being paid on the 25th of August. I remember a 40 l. bank note; it was paid on Mansfield, Miller, and Co. but whether it was a 40 l. or two 20 l. s, I cannot say. I merely put the account in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Sir, be so good as to look upon the back of one of these notes; you see 40 written upon one of them. A. Here is 40 l. written upon the back of the second note; it appears to be my writing; if the two notes came to me in the course of business. I should write the figure 40 l. on the back of the other; if it had, been a single note that I had paid, I should not have wrote any thing, but merely have put it on a file. Suppose twenty times twenty had come to me, I should have wrote 200 l.; that 40 l. wrote indicates that it was one transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the bank-note that you paid. - A. 3 m 88, 16th August, 1810.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say the marking of 40 l. shews that it was a transaction of 40 l. - A. It shews that I paid for it a 40 l. bank-note, and that it was one transaction. I have got the original entry made by myself. I paid a banknote, 40 l. 16th August, 1810. The bank note tallies in number and date exactly.</p>

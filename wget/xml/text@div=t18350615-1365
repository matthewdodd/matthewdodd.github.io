                  </hi>. I am a married woman. I have for some time past lived with the prisoner—I left him, and returned to my husband, on the 25th of May, which was on a Monday—I saw the prisoner again on the Thurs<lb></lb>day following, against Bermondsey Church railing—I told him I had brought away two or three things of hit which I did not know I had—it was a working frock, two collars, and a stock—he said he did not want the things—he had got me now, and that was what he want<lb></lb>ed; and he would not part with me—he asked me if I had got any money—I told him no, I had not, but if he wanted a pint of beer I would give it to him—he laid hold of my shawl, and pulled me into a pub<lb></lb>lic-house, and said I should go with him—I went with him, and paid for two pints of beer—he accused me of going to Mrs. Saunders to get his linen away—I told him I had done no such thing—he said would I go with him to Mrs. Saunders'—I went, and Mrs. Saunders was in the back parlour—I went, and asked her if I had been to try to get any thing away—she told him I had not—I said to him, "Now are you satisfied?"—he muttered some<lb></lb>thing, but I do not know what—I asked Mrs. Saunders if she would come out into the yard with me, and we both went into the yard—and when we had been there about two minutes, he followed us into the yard—we were near the water-closet—I said to him in a joke, "You had better go there for us"—he said, "No, I don't want"—I went into the water-closet, and when I came out I went by Mrs. Saunders, and we all three stood together for about five minutes, and we never spoke—at last I made about two steps towards the yard door again, and he collared me, and threw me backwards against the hog<lb></lb>tub, picked up a piece of brick, and struck me on the head twice—I then clung very tight to his jacket, and said, "For God's sake don't"—he said, "I will never leave you until I have done for you!"—he threw that piece of brick away, and took up a larger piece, and struck me three times with that on the head—I was so faint with the loss of blood that I fell, and said,</p>

                  </hi>. The prosecutrix and prisoner came to my house between four and five o'clock—they came in about the prisoner's linen—I was asked if she had got his linen from me—I said, "No"—we went out into the yard, and a conversation passed between them—the prisoner took the prosecutrix, and threw her down violently, and afterwards took up a brick, and struck her once with it on the forehead—I ran out to see if I could see a man passing to get assistance—when I came back the prisoner had run out of the house, and she was in the passage bleeding—I saw the brick—my husband picked it up in my presence, and it was given to the policeman—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is not the brick with which I saw him strike her—it was a smaller piece—I found this piece lying there afterwards, but I did not see him strike her with that—I have not the smaller piece here—she had given him no provocation before he struck her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutrix was brought to my surgery on the 28th, I believe—it was the evening this happened—she was in a very weak state from loss of blood from the wound on the scalp, which was about an inch in length—I did not examine the depth of it—I merely strapped up the wound, and sent her to the hospital—it di<lb></lb>vided the skin and part of the integuments, I believe—it produced a great effusion of blood—I did not consider her in imminent danger at the mo<lb></lb>ment—I did not know whether she was in danger, or not, as I did not examine the wound, because I did not think I should get paid for it—I think it was a sort of wound likely to be inflicted by part of a brickbat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>.) I have been living with the prosecutrix from the 7th of June, 1834, until the 25th of May, 1835. When she brought my tea in the afternoon, she asked what time I should be done work. I told her I did not know. When I went home at eight o'clock in the evening, she had removed with every thing belonging to me and her<lb></lb>self; and I met her the next day, May the 26th, when she promised to bring every thing belonging to me on the next day, Wednesday, but we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150007"></xptr>
               <p>both got very much intoxicated on the Tuesday, and I did not see her until Thursday, when the had a few article for me. With that we want to a public-house, and had tome beer, but how much I cannot tell, having been drinking all the day. We had a dispute, and we went to where we had been living, to decide what we had been disputing about, where we had high words, and I threw her down on some bricks that were in the yard, and by that means her head was cut. I took her into the house, and sat her in a chair in my landlord's apartment, the beck parlour, when Mrs. Saunders alarmed the neighbourhood, and I went to a public-house again. Two policemen came to me, and told me they wanted me, when I told them I was at their service, and they took me to where I left the prose<lb></lb>cutrix. They never sent for a doctor, but kept the woman in her gore for two hours before she had any medical assistance. When going to the station-house, which is upwards of a mile, they took her into a surgeon's, and got her head dressed, and made her come to the station-house and give evidence against me. Had she been provided with the assitance of a medical gentleman, it would not have come to what it has; for I am cer<lb></lb>tain that the prosecutrix knew I had no animosity against her, for we had generally lived on very mutual terms together. I most humbly implore your mercy.</p>

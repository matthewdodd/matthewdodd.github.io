            , in Thames-street; He was a Stranger to me. He asked me which way I was going? I said to Stepney. He said he should be glad of my Company, for he was going the same way. We had not gone far together, when the Prisoner took hold of my Arm, and ask'd me the same Question, I answer'd as before, and he made the same Reply, as the other. They led me to the Field, in the Parish of <placeName id="t17340227-33-crimeloc153">St. George in the East</placeName>

And then he bid me strip; But I not pulling off my Clothes so soon as he expected, he cut me twice across this Hand with a Knife, - here are the Marks plain enough to be seen - then he took my Cap, Handkerchief, Coat, Waist-coat, Shoes, and Buckles, and order'd me to lie in the Ditch, which I did. Now, you Son of a Bitch, says he, If I was in your Hands, as you are in mine, you'd murder me - No; says I, my dear, I would not hurt a hair of your Head. He took me several times by the Throat, and I believe would have kill'd me, if Abbot had not prevented him. Then he order'd Abbot to bind me Hand and Foot, and so they left me, between 12 and 1 in the Morning. But my Shoes being off I got loose and call'd upon the Beadle, and so went home, for I was but about half a Mile from my own House when they robb'd me.</p>

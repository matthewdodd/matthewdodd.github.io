                  </hi>. I am a builder—at the time in question I was living at 91/2, Liverpool Buildings, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate—about 6.30 in the morning of 10th May, my wife called my attention to some men on the</p>

               <p>roof of the Temperance Hall, next door to where we lived—it was empty at that time—I went out into the open yard, saw Mr. Honeyball, and told him of it, and he got on the roof—from what he told me I went round to Baker's Buildings, and there saw the prisoner Barrett carrying some lead from the side of the Temperance Hall, and throwing it into a cellar in one of the houses being pulled down—I sent for the police—I should think there was about 5 cwt. of lead—it was folded up and thrown loosely in the cellar—Block was in the back of the premises, with Barrett and another man—it is only a small yard between the chapel and the house—about 10 or 12 ft.—the walls dividing the yards were taken down and thrown into one—the only access to the yard was from the old houses in Baker's Build<lb></lb>ings—there was no way out at the back.</p>

I am a box maker, of 6, Camomile Street—Mr. Rogers called my attention to some parties on the roof of the chapel—I got up on the parapet and got on to the roof of Temperance Hall—I looked over the parapet and saw the prisoners and two others down in the yard, and there was a lot of lead—one of them, I think it was Barrett, called out "Is there any more?"—I said "Halloa! what are you doing there?"—but being high up, and behind the parapet, they could not see me, but I saw everything that was going on—one of them was carrying the lead and throwing it down into the cellar of an empty house—they must have had a ladder to get from the yard to the roof—there was no ladder but there were two pieces of wood which would answer the same purpose, and there were marks where the lead would slide down.</p>

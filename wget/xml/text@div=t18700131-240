                  </hi>. I deal in fruit, and live at Marygold Street—the prisoner is my stepson—on the night of 18th January, I looked up my doors and windows—I cannot say whether the middle door was fastened, but it was shut—I awoke about 3 a.m., and saw the door open which I had shut when I went to bed—I jumped up and fancied I saw somebody kneeling down—I said, "Is there anybody there?"and struck a light, and saw the prisoner lying down by the side of the bedstead—I then asked my mistress to look if my watch was in my waistcoat pocket—she said it was not there; and I said to the prisoner, "Give me my watch and chain up; no good will come to you, you have got a good home"—he gave it to me out of his hand, and said, "I came after a shirt"—I awoke his brother in the next room, who went for a policeman—I found a square of glass broken in a window at the back of the house, and a wheel placed under it—the prisoner must have got over a wall.</p>

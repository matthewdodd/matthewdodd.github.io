                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living in Compton-place. I was working on a building in Grenville-square, Clerkenwell, on the 4th of November—the prisoner came in there—I spoke to him—when he was gone I missed a plane—I ran, and called out "Stop thief"—he ran away—a man was coming, and he dropped the bag the plane was in—the bag was picked up in my presence, and my smoothing-plane was found in it</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 182.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running very hard—I caught him—this bag was given to me by a man in the road—I asked the prisoner if this was his bag—he said it was—I asked him what there was in it—he said he was sorry to say there was something in it which did not belong to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. That I must deny; he did not ask me that, nor did I tell him so; there was a person who picked the bag up; perhaps he put the plane into it; I cannot say how it came into the bag.</p>

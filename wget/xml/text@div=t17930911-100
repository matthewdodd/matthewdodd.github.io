               <p>Q. Was he running when he was taken? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked up the handkerchief? - I picked it up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your's? - It was; I knew it by three or four particular marks upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the handkerchief here which you have kept from that time to this? - Yes. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the gentleman whether he felt my hand in his pocket? - I did.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter and constable; the gentleman knocked at my door, and I took charge of him and took him before the sitting Alderman; he ordered me to search him; I found two silk handkerchiefs on him; they neither of them belong to this prosecution; one of those silk handkerchiefs he desired to have about his neck, and the other I took into my custody, which I have got now; it has been marked and the name is cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Huddy leave his own handkerchief? - I had it in my possession, and gave it to him to day; I kept it till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to my aunt's, in Tumble-alley, Mrs. Cohen, and I suppose this gentleman lost sight of the other person that picked his pocket and he catched hold of me, and took me before my Lord Mayor, but I know nothing gentlemen, about it, nor never see him in my life; my witnesses have been here all day, but it is fast day now.</p>

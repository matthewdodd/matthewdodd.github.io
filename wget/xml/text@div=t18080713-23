On the 16th of June, about half past one, the prisoner came into my shop for a pair of breeches; my husband was not at home, I sent the boy for him; I went in the parlour to get a shawl to throw over my shoulders, I was ill at the time, and momentary he took these four waistcoats off the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at the time - A. Nobody but himself; he ran away immediately; my husband came home and went to the boy's mother; the prisoner said his mother sent him; his mother lived in St. James' street, Oxford road.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that when you went out of the shop he ran away with the waistcoats - A. Yes, I saw him run away with the waistcoats.</p>

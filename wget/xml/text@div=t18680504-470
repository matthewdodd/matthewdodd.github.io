                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 106). On the morning of the 19th April, I was in Star Street, Shadwell—about 2.45, I saw Tadman and Algers at the Lord Exmouth public-house, in Back Street—I stood back in a doorway of the Whitworth public-house—I heard a whistle—Tadman and Algers came within two yards of me, and I then turned my lamp full in their faces—I have known them both for years—I then went to the corner of Star Street, where I heard another footstep—I remained there thirty-five minutes watching—while there I saw Alger coming towards me—he stopped right under a lamp about eight yards from me—that is about thirty yards from the prosecutor's—I then saw and heard him give three loud stamps on the flags with his right foot—Cummings then came out of the Fox and Goose yard, and came up to Alger—they remained together three or four minutes—Cummings then returned where he came from, and Algers came towards me—I went up to him and asked what he was doing there at that time in the morning—he said, "Nothing"—I told him I had great suspicion there was something wrong, I should take him to the station and charge him with loitering—while I was speaking to him I saw Tadman at the other end of the street—after locking Algers up, I went back—I saw the window of the Exmouth public-house open—that was about eight or ten yards from where I had seen the two prisoners—there is a low wall there—I saw some recent marks—any person getting along there might force the window—I gave the alarm and woke the landlord up—I afterwards went to 118, High Street, Shadwell, where Tadman and Algens lived—I found Tadman there in</p>

I was with Beer on the morning of the 19th, when we went to Tadman's house—I searched under the stairs, and found this coat, waistcoat, and scarf, shirt, two towels, two napkins, pair of stockings, and a pillow case—I asked Tadman if he knew how they came there—he said he did not, other people had access to the place at well as him—it was about 5.30 in the morning.</p>

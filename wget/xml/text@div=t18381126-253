                  </hi>. I live in Short-street, Horsleydown, and am a lighterman. On Saturday night, the 3rd of November, as I went into the Union, in Tooley-street, the prisoner came in and asked me to give her a glass—I went home with her to Unicorn-square—I had my watch when I went there—when I was coming away I missed it, and asked her to give it to me—she said she would give it me for half-a-crown—the woman of the house came up and called the policeman—the prisoner then said she never saw it—he searched her as far as decency would allow, and it was not found, but in going to the station-house it was dropped—this is it—I had paid her one shilling.</p>

I was called—the prosecutor said, this female had got the watch—she said she had not got it—I then searched her as far as decency would allow, but could not find it, and on the way to the station-house I saw it drop—the prosecutor was quite sober, and the prisoner also, as far as I could judge.</p>

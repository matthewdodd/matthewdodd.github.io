             is my son. I do not know the prisoner - I saw him with my son at the top of the court, about half-past three o'clock on the afternoon that I missed this money. I had 44 l. in silver, in my box, which was in my bed room; it was sometimes locked, and sometimes not. On Tuesday, the 30th of July, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I missed it - I had not seen it for three weeks before, and have not recovered it. I missed my son the same night - he was found nine days after; an officer brought him to the office.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. I knew the prisoner before this - he asked me if my mother had any money; I said, Yes; I did not say how much. He told me to take it - I told him it was in my mother's box. He gave me a key to unlock the box, but I found the key in it. I went away from him to open it, and left him at the top of a court, two or three yards off - he knew I was going to open it, and get the money. He agreed to wait for me till I brought it to him; he was not to wait to give me notice if anybody was coming - he said he would stop there to receive the money. He was not near enough to hear me if I called to him. I did not come out for half an hour, he was then gone - I found him at his house, which is about thirty yards from my mother's.</p>

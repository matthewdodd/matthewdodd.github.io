I was a seaman on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Dominion</hi>—I sailed in her from Bombay—the prisoner was second mate—when we were weighing anchor at St. Helena's, four or five other seamen were engaged near me, and the rest were dispersed over the ship—those near me were Babor Khan, and Goolab, Kooda Bukhish, and Moyadeen—one of my fingers was hurt, and therefore I was pulling at the chain with one hand only, and the prisoner took a chain hook from the hands of Kooda Bukhish and struck me with it here (<hi rend="italic">on the head</hi>)—here is the blood that came out (<hi rend="italic">Exhibiting some pieces of rag</hi>)—the hook is of iron, and about as thick as my finger—it is a hook of the chain cable—it was a violent blow with the hook itself—I fell down, and he gave me a blow, which loosened My teeth, but that was on another day.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been four years captain of the <hi rend="italic">Dominion.</hi> The defendant's character for humanity and kindness has been very good since he sailed with me—I remember weighing anchor at St. Helena—I was on deck all night—we got the first up about 9 or 10 o'clock at night, and we hooked another anchor about 11 in the morning—during the time I was on deck I saw the second mate several times, but did not see him inflict a blow on anybody—no complaint was made by the prosecutor about any violence being done to him, but some few days afterwards he came to me and said that he had a mark on his head, received from the chain, but he did not say how it occurred, or mention the defendant as having struck him—none of the men were sitting on the poop stitching sails at the time the anchor was being got up—it was dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He complained of receiving a blow on the head from the chain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said it was an accident—it was only a bruise—it was two or three days after we got from St. Helena—there was matter about the bruise—a man could very easily get a blow on the head from the chain—he did not complain to anybody—he said that he got a blow in getting the chain in on the morning when we were weighing anchor—I suppose he said it was an accident—I know his language sufficiently for that—it was calm, and the ship moved but little between 9 and 10 o'clock, when the first anchor was up—we got the second anchor up between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning—the ship had then moved four or five miles—the sails were all set, and the ship under weigh, before I went down, at 4 or half past 4 o'clock—there was no stitching of sails during the whole time we were at St. Helena.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the men doing anything to the ship while you were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, cleaning her outside and painting her—the prose<lb></lb>cutor did not say how the wound was done, but he conveyed to my mind the impression that it was an accident—he did not impute it to anybody on board the ship to me—he complained to me to get it dressed—I am in the habit of dressing all their wounds—I had his head shaved, and dressed it every morning—I muster them all, and dress their sores every morning—it</p>

               <p>was a festering wound—the skin was broken, and there was matter and blood about it, as it had been two or three days before he complained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MYDDLETON</hi>. I am a sail maker on board the Dominion. I was present at the getting up of the anchor on leaving St. Helena—I went to bed after daylight, at 5 o'clock, during the time the anchor was being got up, I did not see the prisoner strike the prosecutor—the weigh<lb></lb>ing anchor was complete before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there any sails mended or stitched while you were at St. Helena? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at St. Helena—we did not begin to mend the sails till the day after the ship began to move—the carpenter's name is Edwards—he is not here—I have known the prisoner on the voyage from London and back—I am in the same vessel still.</p>

                  </hi>. I was there the night the anchor was being weighed at St. Helena—I did not go to bed till 5 o'clock in the morning, after the anchor was being weighed—I was on deck the whole time—I saw the second mate, and saw Meer Ali, but saw no blow struck—I got up about 9 o'clock in the morning to go to the wheel, and saw no violence committed by the second mate on the prosecutor after that—when I went from the wheel I went to sleep—the defendant is a good man to the men—none of the men were on the poop sewing sails when the anchor was getting up.</p>

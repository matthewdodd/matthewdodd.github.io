                  <hi rend="italic">viz., that if the 6 Geo. IV., c. 16, was in fact wholly repealed by the 12 &amp; 13 Vic., it would have the effect of reviving the provisions of the preceding Bankrupt Act, the 5 Geo. IV., which would support the present indictment. It might be contended from the words of the first section, that the repeal of 6 Geo. IV., in the schedule, was not an absolute and total repeal, but one qualified by the provisions contained in the first section; but in the same schedule, where other Acts were enumerated as repealed, (the 5 &amp; 6 Vic, c. 122, for instance,) there were express reservations. The question Would therefore be, whether the words in the first section were sufficiently clear to indicate the intention of the Legislature to except from the repeal, those parts which had the effect of repealing former Acts.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE PATTESON:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">"I do not think you can stand upon this argument at all; because the first section is, in express terms, a repeal, except so far as the said Acts, or parts of Acts, repeal any former Act. Your argument would go to show that the expression in the schedule was in effect to do away with the exceptions expressly enacted in the first section, so far as 6 Geo. IV. is concerned; and that argument you ground, I think, principally upon the circumstance, that where another Act of Parliament is mentioned in the same schedule, the 5 &amp; 6 Vic, c 122, in stating the whole to be repealed, there is an exception; that is to say, the whole is not repealed, only a part of it, and the exception; this very exception which is contained in the first section; therefore you argue that wherever that exception is intended to be applied to the particular Act of Parliament mentioned as repealed in the schedule, it is expressed m the section. But you will find that is really no argument after all, it is but an observation. I can easily account for the expression that is put in with respect to 5 &amp; 6 Vic., c. 122, because, in fact, the 5 &amp; 6 Vic., c. 122, mentioned in this schedule, is not intended to be wholly repealed, but there are parts of it not intended to be repealed, and it was thought necessary to say, by way of exception, 'it repeals the whole except certain parts,' and therefore they put in the exception already contained in the first section. It had better not have been there, because these things lead to discussion and argument; but being there, it really does no harm, and the first section must have its full operation; there<lb></lb>fore I think it is quite clear that the statute prior to 5 &amp; 6 Geo. IV. is not revived."</hi>

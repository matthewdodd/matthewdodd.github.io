                  </hi>. I live at 24, Seymour-street, Portman-square—on 24th October I was in Hyde-park—I saw the prisoner there—I had never seen him before—he came up and asked me to have something to drink—I said, No; I wished for nothing to drink—I walked on a little space, and he came behind me suddenly, and caught hold of me—he first said he would have my life or my money—I then walked on a little space—he followed me, and caught hold of me very roughly by the shoulder—I took my money out of my pocket—he put his hand into my pocket—I walked on till I came to the corner of the arch near the Duke of Wellington's statue, where I met two policemen—I was very much excited and frightened—I spoke to them but did not tell them what had occurred, I thought the prisoner would go and leave me—I called them, and they took him into custody—this was about half-past 3 in the afternoon—it was raining very hard—the policemen got me into a cab, and the cab was just going away, when the prisoner rushed after me, and jumped into the cab—I jumped out, and gave him into custody—he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Witness.</hi> He was drunk at the time—there was no one in the park—it was a storm, and was raining very hard—he took me suddenly by the shoulder, and put his hand into my pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 228). About half-past 3 o'clock on Friday, 24th October, I was on duty at Apsley-gate, and saw the prosecutrix and prisoner coming towards me—she seemed very much excited—she said the prisoner was following her and annoying her, and wanting money from her—I asked her if she knew him—she said she had never seen him before—I asked him what he wanted to be following the young woman for—he said that he knew her by keeping company with her before—I said I did not believe that, she did not appear to know anything of him, and I advised him to go away and leave her—she said if she got a cab she would get into it and get away from him—another constable called a cab, and when she got into it the prisoner made use of a very bad expression, and said he would not leave her till he had had something out of her—he ran to the cab, and attempted to get in—he opened the door on one side, and she jumped out on the other, and gave him into custody for attempting to rob her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 576). I was on duty at Hyde-park-corner with the last witness—I saw the prosecutrix coming up the Park followed by the prisoner—she appeared to be very much excited—she said the prisoner had followed her across the Park, and repeatedly asked her to give him money to get some beer, which she had refused to do—I asked if she knew him—she said, "No"—I requested him to go away—he made use of very bad expressions, and said he would not till he had money to get some ale—I called a cab, and opened the door—he attempted to get in, and said he would not leave her company—I succeeded in putting her into the cab, and it drove away—the prisoner followed it, undid the door, and attempted to get in at one side—the prosecutrix jumped out at the other door, and gave him into custody, saying he had attempted to rob her in coming across the park.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had plenty of money of my own; it is all false about attempting to rob her. If I had attempted to ill use or rob her in a place like that, somebody must have seen it; there are always scores of people about. The fact is, I was mistaken in the young lady. She is very much like a young lady that I kept company with; that was the reason I stopped her.</p>

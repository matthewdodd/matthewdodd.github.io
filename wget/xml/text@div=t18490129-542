                  </hi>. I am in the service of the East and West India Dock Company. At three o'clock, on 22d Jan., I saw the prisoner coming from the direction of the <hi rend="italic">Carnatic</hi>, lying in the West India Dock—I went to him, seeing that his cap was bulky, and asked him what he had got—he said, "A south<lb></lb>wester"—I put my hand on the forepart of it, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "A few cigars"—I took him into the dock-office, and there overhauled him—I found concealed about him a quantity of cigars—I asked him how they came in his possession—he said they were given to him by a sailor on board—I said, "Can you point out the sailor to me?"—he said, yes he could: but he could not—I found this cap and these cigars on him.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Crussell. A baker, and work at Mr. Layton's, in Castle-street, Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before; what sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Crussell. Star-light, but light enough to discern his face; I looked very hard in his face before I was knocked down. I went and gave the information in at Justice Sherwood's office; it was some time afterwards when I was sent for by Justice Sherwood's men; about six weeks after I was robbed when I was sent for; they shewed me the prisoner; I knew him; we went before Justice Camper and he committed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed when he robbed you?</p>
               <p>Crussell. In blue clothes as he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch, or seal, or key again?</p>
               <p>Crussell. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he first came in he said I was not the man.</p>
               <p>Crussell. I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him immediately when you saw him?</p>
               <p>Crussell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there other people in the room besides him?</p>
               <p>Crussell. A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick him out, or was he shewn to you?</p>
               <p>Crussell. He was shewn to me; it was at a publick house; I went there; they asked me if I knew the man in the box; there were fi ve or six there; I said yes, I should know him if I saw him; they bid me look in the box; I said that is the man. I described him by his dress and stature in my information, and described the watch, No. 2481, William and

When I was sent for by Justice Sherwood's men they shewed me the prisoner, and I knew him; he was dressed as he is now; there were about ten or a dozen in the tap room where I was taken to see the prisoner; there were five or six in the box with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he hand-cuffed?</p>
               <p>Crussell. No.</p>
               <p>Edward Hall. I took the prisoner up: I suspected him by the information I had read at Justice Sherwood's office; I did not know him before: the description of him was a tall man, in his own hair, blue clothes and jacket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was hand-cuffed at the time the man challenged me.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Was he?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; I saw him hand-cuffed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was sent to Bartholomew's hospital, by order of my Lord Mayor, some time in March; I believe I was there at the time this robbery was committed: my disorder was a bad leg and the bad distemper.</p>
               <p>The clerk of the hospital was sent for, and produced the book, containing the account of the admission, &amp;c. of patients, by which it appeared the prisoner was taken into the hospital, by his lordship's order, on the 24th of March, and was discharged on the 27th. The fact was committed on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury to the Prosecutor. Was you quite sober?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, very sober: here is a woman in court whose house I went to as soon as it was done; her name is

               <p>Q. How long did he stay?</p>
               <p>Beard. Till he wrote out what he had lost; about ten minutes; and then went away directly, and said he would go to Mr. Sherwood's; he came back to our house in about half an hour.</p>

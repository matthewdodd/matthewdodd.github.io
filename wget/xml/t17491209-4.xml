Upon this I took up the Prisoner, Harrison not being there; this was on the Thursday morning. I told him it was for a robbery on the highway, he said he knew of no robbery. I told him I had got Harrison in my custody, adding, he wants to be admitted an evidence, said I, the first that comes before the Justice may be admitted for ought I know. I had not got Harrison, but made use of such words to come at the affair; said the Prisoner, I went to drink some hot, I got a pot of hot, and after drinking a little of that he confessed the robbery; then he asked me where Harrison was ? we got out of him where Harrison was to be found, and we took him the next day, and he was secur'd in the Savoy, and before Justice Manwaring, he confessed about 20 robberies he had been in.</p>

            . I live at the sign of the Ship near Ratcliff-Cross, the Prisoner was billited on me about twenty days, or a month. On the 15th of October I was at church, when I came home, I saw the Prisoner and four more together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been constant in that house o'nights?</p>
               <p>Cleghorne. He had then been out three or four days, and he told me he had been upon duty; these soldiers had called for a half crown bowl of punch, my wife did not care to make it, fearing they had no money; said one of them. are you afraid of your money, come give me change for this moidore? she took it, and said it was a 36 s. piece, said he, no it is not; from this I had a suspicion they had been robbing somebody. I went and acquainted the constable directly, he came with me, and found them a little quiet, said he, let them drink on, you'll see more by and by; at last they called for a pot of flip, and our servant went in, and saw Harrison give Good something, and said, give me two guineas; when I went in, I saw the gold lying on the table, they began to renew the discourse about the thing again which I had heard before: Harrison said to Good, d - n you, if you will not let me have the thing I'll draw my sword upon you; says he, either give me two guineas or the thing : I said, what thing is that? says he, nothing at all. After some words said Harrison, by G - d it is a watch, said I, I insist upon your delivering the man the watch or money, he delivered the watch, and Harrison gave him half-a-crown. I pulled out my watch and said to him, what o'clock is it by yours, said he it is down, said I, let me wind it up for you; I took it, and likewise the name and No. as before-mentioned, and returned it to Harrison again; after that, fearing I should mistake, I said I had not set it, so I took it again, and look'd at the name and No. then I sent to the constable, but before he came they were all gone; Harrison had the watch, I told the constable about it, and I said I'd go to the watchmaker and see if he could inform me who bought that watch of him, but as my wife was not very well, the constable proposed to go.</p>

            . I cannot positively swear to the Prisoners, but I believe them to be two of the men that robb'd Elick Bull and I. They robb'd him of a watch and 11 s. and three half-pence, and me of a watch and 9 s. they were all dressed in soldier's cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How arm'd?</p>
               <p>Belsham. With long swords; they put their hands to our pockets, and took out our watches and money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light?</p>
               <p>Belsham. Light enough to discern their cloaths, and see them rob us.</p>

             he took the other things from the other witness, but the watch that Good took, he never own'd to us he had taken; we ask'd him if he had taken a watch from him, but he said he had not; then we all went together that night through White-Chapel, to a house in Shoemaker-Row, the Black-Boy, and sold the watch taken from Elick Bull, for 16 s. and a full pot, and divided the money.</p>

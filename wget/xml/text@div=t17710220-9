               <p>Court. Describe the gelding.</p>
               <p>Stock. It was a black gelding with a star upon his forehead and one white heel: he has been rowelled behind; but he is a remarkable horse, about fourteen hands and an half high, rather better. The stable was broke into through a brick wall, and then he had shot the bolt of the look back and left the door open: I heard of it between eight and nine o'clock: the stable was about a mile from my house: I went to Smithfield about three o'clock: I had had no intelligence of my horse: I suspected he would bring him there: I had not been in Smithfield above ten minutes when I saw the prisoner come riding upon one horse and leading mine: a man asked him the price of my horse; he asked nine guineas: the man asked where he brought the horse from; he said, from Waltham Abbey: the prisoner tied my horse up to the rails: the man asked him how long he had had the horse; he said, ever since the Monday se'nnight before: I told the man that asked the price that the horse was stolen, I told several people to take care the prisoner did not get away, whilst I went for a constable: I charged a constable with him: he said, at first, that he bought the horse at a sale at the White-horse at Chigwell the Monday was se'nnight before: this was on Friday: I told him it was my horse, and that I saw him on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your horse?</p>
               <p>Stock. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any bridle?</p>
               <p>Stock. No, I lost a sack with the horse, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200004"></xptr> no bridle nor saddle: I found the sack with my mark upon it at the prisoner's lodgings.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Stock: I locked the stable door the night before the horse was stolen: the horse was safe then: the next morning I found the door open and the horse was gone: there was a hole broke in the wall of the stable: there were four in the stable: the other three were left.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the horse?</p>
               <p>Horsley. Black; the off heel behind is white: he had a star in his forehead, and there was a rowel in each thigh. I saw the horse in the stable at the Greyhound in Smithfield: I knew the horse as soon as I saw him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 727). On 22nd June I was on duty in Lower Thames Street at about half-past three, and Goodens called my attention to the prisoner as having assaulted him—I endeavoured to persuade him to go away—he said, "You b----, if I cannot get at him lean at you," and struck me in the mouth and kicked me on my ankle—I fell, with my legs doubled under me and the prisoner on top of me—I was taken inside Messrs. Baker's warehouse and found my ankle severely injured—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there seven weeks—I then had leave for four weeks, and am now on reserve duty; my ankle is dislocated and the small bone broken—the prisoner started off and was pursued; he was taken on 10th September—I was in uniform and on special duty—he had been drinking, but perfectly knew what he was about.</p>

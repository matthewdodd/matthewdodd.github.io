               <p>When the man was taking the prisoner to the watch-house, I missed my handkerchief; I had it when I went to Westminster, and when I was at Charing-cross I had it.</p>
               <p>Was it about your neck or in your pocket? - In my pocket; they went down stairs to search the man, and they brought up two pocket-handkerchiefs and a rule; and I said one was mine; there was W. T. at one corner; and they looked and found it.</p>
               <p>What passed between him and you before? - He had got hold of my neck by my handkerchief when Mr. Smith came out; and he struck me several times.</p>
               <p>You do not know when you lost your handkerchief? - No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Had you your handkerchief then? - I do not know; I did not know I had lost my handkerchief till I got into the watch-house; I lost nothing else.</p>
               <p>Had you any money in your pocket? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100031"></xptr>Yes, I had some halfpence in my waistcoat pocket; the handkerchief was in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the watch-house this handkerchief was found in his pocket, with his own and his rule? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In the scuffle he had changed hats with your fellow servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your handkerchief was not worth stealing? - It was of no great worth.</p>

               <p>I was coming by at the time the people were in the watch-house; I knocked at the door, and went in; we shoved him in the hole; in about three minutes I looked, and saw him looking through the bar, and I thought he was going to put something through the bar, and I searched him, and found two handkerchiefs and a rule; this is the lad's handkerchief, the other was very ragged, not worth a penny.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that found in the same pocket with the rule and the other handkerchief? - One handkerchief was in each pocket, and a rule in his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief product and deposed to by T. W. in the corner.)</p>
               <p>It is one that my mother gave me; her name is Martin; I do not know how it came to be so marked.</p>

               <p>If you will let me give my opinion. I do not think the man is guilty of it, because there was a scuffle at the door, and here is a man that picked the handkerchief up, and put the hat on the man's head; and he says, he put the handkerchief in the man's pocket, and I do not think the man is guilty.</p>

               <p>I was present at the time of this affray; the boy was running up St. Martin's-lane, and the prisoner after him; the boy crossed over the way, and ran into a publick-house, and the prisoner ran after him; the boy laid down a light-coloured handkerchief, I cannot say this was it; he took it up, and put it in his pocket; the prisoner took up the handkerchief off the ground, and the hat laid in the kennel; the prisoner had no hat on; I took the hat and put it on the prisoner's head, then the boy said, why did you rob my fellow-servant; I saw the handkerchief picked up.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, you see, with respect to this, it was a suspicious circumstance; in the scuffle it some how got out of the man's pocket, and this young fellow took it up; he had lost his hat, so that it seems very little probable that he should be committing a highway robbery for the sake of such an handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Peter-street, Westminster. I have known the prisoner for twenty years - I had seen him about a year and a half before. On Monday morning, the 6th of April he came to me, said he had a mare to sell, and asked me to buy her; I said it did not suit me. He said she was at Langley's, the Bricklayers' Arms. I do not know what he asked for her. He said he had rode her a great many miles the day before, when he brought her up; he did not say from where - He said he brought her seventy miles. I put the mare in my cart, and recommended Langley to buy her - He swapped another for it, and some money to boot-(looks at the receipt)-this is the receipt, I witnessed it; it is dated the 3d of April, the prisoner wrote it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am sure he said he rode it above seventy miles-it looked in a very bad condition. The prisoner bore an honest character. A man named Batton was before the magistrate at the same time.</p>

            . I keep the Bricklayers' Arms, Westminster. On Wednesday morning, the 6th of April, the prisoner put the mare up in my stable, he offered to sell it me. Next day I made an exchange with him - He valued it at fifteen guineas. I gave him a horse worth ten guineas, and 4l. 14s. 6d. in money, and took his receipt, which he wrote himself. He staid with me for a fortnight after that. On the 28th of May Mr. Stride came with Norris, and claimed it-it was the same that I bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I gave too much for it. The prisoner told me he had sold the horse that he bought of me. I once saw Batton at my house with Norris and Stride-(Receipt read.)</p>

            . The horse was lent to me; I saw it at the stable to-day-it is the one that was lost. I saw it in possession of Langley, she is still at Langley's. Batton gave information where to find it. He was a shoemaker, and lived at Romsey. He was a prisoner in the King's Bench, and bought the rules.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Stride lent us the mare - We were not to pay anything for it.</p>

The prisoner nursed me during my confinement, which took place on the 28th of December; she left on the 18th of January; while she was with me I missed some silver spoons, a table-cloth, and other things - while she was with me she had my keys to get whatever was wanted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you miss them while she was with you? A. I missed the spoons; I had seen them in the morning, and am quite sure she had an opportunity of taking them the same day - I was not then confined, and I kept my own keys, but the spoons were not locked up; Elizabeth Smith was in my service at the time - she is not here, she left just after the prisoner did; I was given to understand that when we went to the prisoner's house Smith was there, and she got over the palings and ran away; she never returned to me - I was not on terms of intimacy with the prisoner; I had a pair of stockings of hers, which she lent me because I got out of my confinement too early to buy a pair which were warm enough, and she lent me a handkerchief which was more convenient than my own - I offered to buy it of her; after she left me, my children called on her occasionally; but I do not recollect their going at any time in a thin handkerchief, and her sending them home in a shawl.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 6th of February I went with Mrs. Ayris to Nelson-street, Bethnal-green. I found the prisoner there - I asked if she had any thing belonging to Mrs. Ayris; she said No, and denied it strongly - I took her in charge, and searched the drawers, where I found these two remnants of lace; I asked if she had any duplicates; she showed me some, and among them I found one of this table-cloth; I then asked if she had any more property; she said No, but we found these two caps wet in the front room, and this Belcher handkerchief was round her neck - the prosecutrix claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know whether there was a girl there, washing, who left the house the back way? A. I have heard so, but I did not see her.</p>
               <p>MRS. AYRIS. I know this table-cloth by the cutting of it; it was a larger one, and I made it into two - I know all these articles.</p>

No; I swear this was not left there, my little girl had a spencer on; these caps had been put away to be repaired - when I owned them at her house she said I had given her them to wash, which I had not; I had never employed her to wash but once, and the things were all returned.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there any articles missing which you have not found? A. Yes; I am quite sure I had not given her these things to wash.</p>

            . I am a french-polisher, and live in Turville-street, Bethnal-green - I have known the prisoner six or seven years. I recollect seeing the prosecutrix at a quarter past nine o'clock last Thursday morning - I met her, and she stood talking with me for a moment or two; she said she had found her silver spoons; a female was passing on the other side of the way, and the prosecutrix called her over and asked if her mother could swear to her spoons, as she had cleaned them many times, and she said she thought she could; I made the reply -"Can you not swear to your own property - are they not marked; or have they no initial on them?" she said No, she could not.</p>
               <p>MRS. AYRIS re-examined. Q. Did you ever ask a female whether her mother could swear to your spoons, because she had often cleaned them? A. I said that she had cleaned them many times, and I thought she could swear to them - I said, "I do not stand in any fear, though they are not marked, for others know them as well as I do;" I never said I could not swear to them - I was stating how old fashioned they were.</p>

               <p>I am beadle and headborough of the hamlet of Ratcliffe. I saw the prisoner, between ten and eleven at night, with a load upon his back; I crossed over the way, and he passed me; I followed him, because I suspected him. I said, My friend, what have you got here? He said, Nothing at all. I said, I must see. He put the butter off his back, on the ground. I asked him, how he came by it? He said his father had sent it to him out of the country. I said, it was odd for his father to send it out of the country at that time of night. Then he said, he took it from Cumberland wharf over the water. I took him before Justice Sherwood.</p>

Upon the 31st of May, just before eleven o'clock in the evening, a little boy came to the watch-house, and said Mr. Trappett wanted me at White-Horse-street. I went, and found him with the prisoner and the butter. He then said, he had not stole it; but in the morning he confessed, and impeached two others.</p>

               <p>To whom does Cumberland-wharf belong? - It is rented by the commissioners of the victualling-office. It is on the other side of the river. They came the first of June, in the morning, and said there was a person they had taken with some butter; that he said he took it from these warehouses; and requested I would attend Justice Sherwood. I went to Justice Sherwood's, and the property was there produced; which property has the mark of

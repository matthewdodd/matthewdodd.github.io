(Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. There was nobody between you and him after he came out of your shop? - A. I never lost sight of him after I came to the shop door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you got out how far was the prisoner from you? - A. About four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. I should suppose, if he was the same person, he must have got farther than that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any marks in the hats? - A. Yes; I wrote Mr. Combes's name in it, it was bought by Mr. Alderman Combes's brother; I had been at work upon it not five minutes before.</p>

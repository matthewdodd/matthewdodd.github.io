I told her I would have nothing so do with her; so I went from the door up the street in order to get rid of her. In turning down the street again about ten yards from the door, she came and took hold of the tail of my coat; the men came out and bid me give them four-pence, or they would knock me down; so I gave them four-pence and went into the house again and called for a pint of beer. The woman came again into the house, and set herself in the box opposite me; she took up my pint of beer and drunk; upon that Eastman came up, took me by the collar and struck me. The landlord came up and took him away, and told him, he should not abuse any body in his house, and desired I would get out of their company. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120024"></xptr> went to another box and called for a pint of beer to myself.

             and three men came and set themselves down by me. Some people in an opposite box told the landlord that the woman had got her hand in my pocket. I got up with an intention to go away; one of the men laid hold of my coat, and said, I must pay for the pot of beer. I paid the money and went out of the house immediately.

             and the three men followed me out: the men kept about twenty yards behind me. I went to Bateman's-Row. I thought I walked faster than they. As soon as I turned the corner the men run after me. Eastman knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. As it was dark, how could you tell it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Woodifield. I eyed him all the way from the house; he had a red jacket on, the same as he has now. When he had knocked me down, he got my head between his legs; then he pulled the handkerchief off my neck, and Freckleton took out of my pocket half a guinea, a quarter of a guinea, and four shillings in silver. The other two men each of them held one of my legs; one of them took the buckles out of my shoes, and my hat off my head; one kicked me on my left side and made me lame. A woman looked out at a window, and asked them if they were going to murder me. Freckleton replied, No, d - n you, you b - h; this is my husband, and I can't get him home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Woodifield. Yes. I had nothing but two glasses of gin, and two pints of beer.</p>

               <p>Freckleton's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was drinking in company with six or seven people at this house. The prosecutor beckoned me out. He asked me if I was willing to go with him. I went with him to a tenter-ground. He lay with me there. Whilst he was lying with me, there came a man with blue clothes, with a pipe in his mouth. He said, Well my friend, keep at it, don't get up. I said, for shame get up. After he had got up, he said, What do I pay my money for nothing? and lay down again. As we were going out there were three or four men came out of skitlle-ground, and asked him if he would not pay socket-money. The prosecutor put his hand into his pocket and took out a shilling; I bid him give it me, and I would give them a some money. I took the shilling, and gave them a pot of beer. I said let us go out another way. We went and had a glass of gin a-piece. I gave him his change, and never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Eastman's Defence.</p>
               <p>I came home about nine at night. I went into Mr. Price's house for a pint of beer. I was going to get a pipe; as I went by, the prosecutor kicked me on the shin. I asked him what that was for; he said, he would give me another. I laid hold of him; Mr. Price came and showed me away. I went out of the house, and went home to bed. The next night they took me up. The prosecutor told Justice Fielding he was very much in liquor; and that a watchman found him drunk in the road asleep.</p>

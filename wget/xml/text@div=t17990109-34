             sworn. - I am a corporal in the first regiment of Foot Guards: On the 15th of December, as I was going along King-street, Westminster, about a quarter before two o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Gerard's shop with a till under his arm, containing a quantity of silver and halfpence; there are four steps from the shop into the street, his heels slipped from under him, he fell down, and the till fell from his hand; he fell across the path, which occasioned me to stop; he got up, snatched up the till, and without stopping to pick up what money had fell from it, he ran away; I followed him, and when he had got twenty or thirty yards from the door, he threw the till over his head, seemingly with an intent to strike me, it came very near my head; he ran so fast, that I found I was not able to catch him myself, and I called out, stop thief; there were three grenadiers coming out of Gardeners'-lane, two of them endeavoured to lay hold of him, but he bassled them, and was caught by another man; I took him back to the house, a constable was sent for, and he was taken into custody.</p>

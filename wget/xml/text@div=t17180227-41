This was confirm'd by other Evidence, who added, that she would go out and leave the five Children for half a Day together, and sometimes stay out all Night a drunknaing , and use the Children cruelly; and that when the Child Richard Pugh died, one Evidence deposed she went in and found the Child wrapped in a piece of an old Rag and laid under the Dresser; but none of the Evidence did say that she used any violent Methods to make the Children away. The Mother likewise added, that when the Child was dead, all the back Parts of it were in a sad Condition, locking like an Ox Liver parboil'd. And on the other ha nd , she on her side produced some Persons who said that when Gallimore was out she left them Victuals &amp;c. and that she had used to feed them, turn them dry, &amp;c. And although it did appear she had been negligent , yet there was not Evidence to support the Indictment, which was laid for Murther.

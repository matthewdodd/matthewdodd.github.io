            . I keep a haberdasher's shop. The prisoner came to my house the 9th of June about nine in the morning for some children's apron strings. She bid me half price, after which she went out of my shop into Mr. Finch's. I went to see what she wanted to buy, having a mistrust of her, and made an excuse to change a guinea. I saw her take up that parcel and go out. I went after her and took it from under her arm, and led her back.</p>

               <p>I went into that gentleman's shop for a pair of stockings; going out of the shop I picked the parcel up. I took them to be a piece of paper bundled together; and that gentleman owed me a particular spite, so he brought me back, and says this against me.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of March, at a quarter past four o'clock, I went there and found the gates open; a fishmonger had gone out before I got there, and left the gates open - I saw a man with his face to the wall, on the left-hand side, about twenty yards from Mr. Cuttell's door; I knocked at his door, and told him some person was in the stable - he went and got an officer; I went back with the officer, and missed my bridle, which I had left there over night - I found it about thirty yards from the stable, laying in the yard; the prisoner was found in the yard.</p>

I found some harness in different parts of the yard - the prisoner was in the yard, and no one else; nothing was found on him - he was behind a rubbish-cart; five of us were nearly two hours looking for him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not your gates open at all hours of the night? A. No; there is a fisherman goes out every morning, at half-past three o'clock, and he leaves the gates open - the premises are extensive, and persons might get into the yard; there is a hole in the back of the premises, which leads to the barracks - two of these stables were locked; they got a ladder and got up in the rack.</p>

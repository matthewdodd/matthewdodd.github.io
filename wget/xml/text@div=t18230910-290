On the 6th of August, a cutler marked all the money in the tills on the head side, opposite to the face. About eleven o'clock at night, I gave 17 s. to a witness to put in the till, having myself first counted it; there were five half-crowns among it. The shutters were then shut, but the drawers not closed - no more customers came. It was his duty to empty the till at night - he did not know that I had done it. He came and separated the halfpence from the silver as usual - and in three or four minutes I came from outside the door with the witness, and immediately counted the silver, and found a half-crown missing. I accused him of taking it - he denied it. I found it in his pocket with other silver, and after some time he acknowledged taking it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you know what the till contained - A. I might have left 1 s. in it, among the copper. I found only four half-crowns left. I said if his friends came forward, I would let him go. I wanted to know how much he had taken, as he acknowledged he had been robbing me ever since he came. I bought his friends might persuade him to tell me.</p>

Between ten and eleven o'clock, Mr. Brown gave me some money, which he said was marked - I put it into the till, when the silver was taken out at night; the prisoner was not in the shop at the time. The 17 s. consisted of half-crowns, and other coin. The shop was shut, and no customer came afterwards. The prisoner came in about five minutes after, and in three or four minutes the half-crown was missed. My master searched him, and found it on him among other money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did your master say he would let him go if his friends came forward - A. He said, if he would say where his friends were, he would send for them. I saw no violence used to him. I saw him laying on his back, he was handcuffed before the officer came.</p>

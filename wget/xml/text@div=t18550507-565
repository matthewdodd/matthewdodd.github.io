                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Gosling and Sharp, bankers, in Fleet-street On Thursday afternoon, 29th March, the prisoner came to our house—he presented to me this letter, which contained this cheque—having read the letter and cheque, I asked the prisoner whom he received it from, or words to that effect—he said he received it from a gentleman in Onslow-square—he said more, for he was some time in the room—he said he was prepared to take notes, if more convenient, to that amount—I detained him, sent for an officer, and gave him into custody—this was about 10 minutes before 4 o'clock—he mentioned the number in the square—my own impression is it was No. 2—I cannot remember the exact words he used about this gentleman—I understood he was a friend of this gentleman—we have a customer named Edward Hartop Cradock, of Brazen Nose College.</p>

Gosling's, in Fleet-street"—I asked him if he knew what the letter contained; he replied, "I knew it was for money"—he said he then took it to the bankers—I asked him if he ever read the newspapers—he said, "Yes;"—I asked him if ever he had read the canes where gentlemen's ser<lb></lb>vants had been sent with cheques; he said, "Yes"—I said, "There was Mr. Wrangham's servant, who was sent with a cheque a few day's back"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "That ought to have roused your suspicions, I think"—he said, "I did not think anything was wrong till I saw the bankers examining their books"—that was all that passed—I was at Mr. Mullens's chambers on 2nd April, when the prisoner was there—he was not in custody, he was liberated on bail—I was present when he made a statement to Mr. Mullens—I heard him describe the route by which he went from Onslow-square to the bankers—I have since that gone over that ground which he described—I was not present when it was measured—I asked the prisoner what he was to have for carrying that letter—he said he was not aware, he had made no agreement.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the mother take his things away almost immediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—more than a week afterwards—he sent for nothing himself during that time, nor did his mother come for anything—I saw him—he came on Friday to the outer door, but we did not let him in—at that time this box was in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he call for on Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He wanted his money out of the pantry—he asked the housemaid if his mother was there, and she was not—his mother works there as a charwoman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is your clock at all fast? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, either ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—it was a little past 3 by our clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">BASE</hi>. I received this box on the 7th of April—this half sheet of paper was in it, and this other paper—the prisoner was allowed to go after the first examination—he came to our office on the Monday follow<lb></lb>ing—I took down in writing a statement of his account of the transaction—I handed it to Mr. Mullins—this is the statement I took down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This box was handed to you by Mr. Burgess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—these papers were in it and this bit of wax—I opened these things at the police court—except that they have not been opened, I kept them in my possession—I can swear to this bit of wax being in the box—I kept it in my drawer locked up—no one would have access to it.</p>

I am solicitor for the prosecution—I have compared the signature on this forged cheque, with the signature on the genuine cheque, by holding them up to the light—the signatures exactly correspond—they seem to be copied—I trace nothing on this blotting paper; this was only used to wrap up the other—I attended the first examination of the prisoner; he was allowed to go at large—he came to my office, and Mr. Base handed me this statement—the prisoner came in my room, and I went over the statement, sentence by sentence, with the prisoner—I asked him questions where I thought the statement required a little explanation—after it was done I read the whole of it over to him, and asked him if he wished to say anything more, or had anything to add—he said no, he did not think of anything more.

                  <hi rend="italic">read the prisoner's statement as follows</hi>: "I was walking along from Knightsbridge, on the Brompton-road, on a Friday; I think it was last Friday fortnight; say Friday, the 16th of March; in the evening, after 8 o'clock, I should say between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was out for a walk alone; I was about opposite St. Michael's-place, going towards Fulham; a man accosted me; he met me; he asked me if I was not Mr. Burgess' servant; I told him 'Yes;' he asked me if I wanted to buy the duplicate of a watch; I told him 'No;' this was all the conversation at that moment; he asked me if I would have a glass of ale; he offered me the duplicate for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I refused, having a very good watch of my own; I was not struck with this as being inconsistent with his being a gentleman; I am not quite certain whether I did or did not take a glass of ale with him; we stood by St. Michael's-terrace together about ten minutes, in conversation about the watch; we separated, I turned round and went home to Mr. Burgess'; the person also turned away, as though he was going back again towards Ful<lb></lb>ham, but I did not take notice how far he went; a week elapsed after this, and I was in Brompton-road out for a walk, between 8 and 9 o'clock; I was going towards Brompton and the party coming towards the park; we met again casually, and not by appointment; I am near sighted, and he stopped me; I was at Middle Queen's-buildings, in which our baker, Jobbins, lives; I had not got so far as Jobbins's shop; I seldom go much further than that when I go out for a walk; he said, 'How do you do? I looked at him and recognised him by his voice and general appearance; he asked me if I would have a glass of ale; I refused; this second occasion was Friday, the 23rd of March; we stood talking not more than five minutes, and he asked me if I would go to his house on the following Thursday, No. 2, Onslow-square; I asked him if he would favour me with his name; he said he had no card, his name was Burguess; I then asked him how he spelt it, and he said, "Bur<lb></lb>guess;" it struck me at the moment as being singular that it was similar to Mr. Burgess; he did not give his Christian name; he said if I would go to him on Thursday afternoon, at half past 3 o'clock, to his house, No. 2, Onslow-square, he wanted to see me, but he did not state the purpose he required; I said probably I would come, but I did not promise; he had in appearance all the style of a perfect gentleman, I took him for such, and asked no questions; on Thursday afternoon I went to No. 2, Onslow-square, according to the appointment, at half past 3 o'clock; I was two or three minutes past the half hour; I did not ask permission; they have lunch at half past 1, and finished about half past 2 o'clock; we in the kitchen dine at that time; before I went out I cleared up the luncheon things and put them away; this took me about half an hour; I went to Mr. Vaughan's, No. 45, Sloane-square, with an umbrella; Mr. Vaughan is clerk of Mr. Burgess' church; I asked him to give me change for a sovereign, which he did; I went from Sloane-square down Seymour-street, along the Marl borough-road, round by the Admiral Kepple, along there to Sydney-street; Onslow-square is up Sydney-street; I had left No. 10, Cadogan-place, before a quarter past 3 o'clock; I then went to No. 2, Onslow-square, and I met the party just coming off the steps; he said, 'Good day,' and we walked together; we went along the Broad-road, Brompton-road, Knightsbridge, and Piccadilly, as far as the Circus, at the top of Piccadilly; while walking by his side he asked me if I knew Gosling and Sharpe's; I told him 'No;' he said, 'Very well;' he said he wanted me to take a letter, containing a cheque for 598<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., upon Messrs. Gosling and Sharpe, drawn by—Cradock, Esq.; he told me it would be paid in gold; I was to take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to No. 2, Onslow-square,</p>

               <p>when I received the money; I wanted to go to Capper and Waters, No. 26, Waterloo-place, and told him it was to order some skirts for myself; no one knew of my going there; I had never had my shirts made there before; he said, 'No, you had better not, the bank will be closed,' and he required the gold that evening to meet a large demand; I cannot tell the exact spot this conversation took place; it was oh the right hand side of the Circus, on the same side as the Haymarket, near the Spread Eagle; I left him there in the Circus; I cannot say which way he went; I recollect that he said he could not take the cheque himself, as he had a very particular appointment, which he must keep; he seemed to be in a very calm and collected way; I went from thence to the bank; I went along Coventry-street, and turned down and came to Trafalgar-square, and kept the left hand side up the Strand, through Temple-bar, then I crossed to No. 16, and found it was a hosier's shop; I then asked an old gentleman which was Messrs. Gosling's and Sharpe; ho told me it was a little further up, and pointed to the door; it happened to be three doors from where I inquired; the letter was directed to Messrs. Gosling's and Sharpe, No. 16, Fleet-street, City; the real number being 19 led me to inquire of the gentleman in the street; I got to Messrs. Gosling's and Sharpe about a quarter to 4 o'clock; I took it to the counter and presented it; I was told to take it in to an inner room; the letter was opened in my presence; my suspicions were aroused by the gentleman who opened the letter questioning me on two or three points; when Messrs. Gosling's and Co. asked me where I got the cheque, I told them it was given me by a person named Burguess, who said he was well-known to Mr. Borrow, No. 21, Onslow-square; I think that was all that passed, as near as I can recollect; when the party gave me the letter in the Circus he said, 'It is all right,' and mentioned, 'I am well known to Mr. Borrow, of Onslow-square;' I have a knowledge of Mr. Borrow, he dines with Mr. Burgess occasionally on his birthday; it was on the evening of the birthday party that Mr. Burgess was robbed; from the time of my leaving Mr. Vaughan till I got to Onslow-square I did not call anywhere, nor did I call anywhere from the time of my seeing the gentleman till he left me in the Circus; we walked as quick as we could, side by side, between the Circus and Messrs. Gosling's; I did not call anywhere; I decline to say what became of the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the change I received from Mr. Vaughan; it is a private matter, and has nothing to do with this case.—Burguess: well look<lb></lb>ing, rather thin, genteel appearance; aged thirty, forty by appearance; height, five feet eight or nine, tall and upright in his carriage; complexion, lightish, no colour in his cheek, pale looking, but natural colour; hair did not observe, never saw him with his hat off; whiskers not at all bushy, dark (trimmed close) brown; moustache full, quite black, had all appearance of dye being used, as it did not correspond with his whiskers; features, regular, open countenance; dress—one of the evenings in question I met him with a frock coat; on the last occasion be had a sack over coat, very loose; always dark clothes, and buttoned up.—I have had conversation with the man on three occasions; besides this I have observed him in and about Cadogan-place, of an afternoon generally, between 3 and 5 o'clock; the time I am up in the dining room he has always been walking in Cadogan-place; I knew him by sight before the evening of 16th March, perhaps for a fortnight before we spoke; I suppose he had a slight knowledge of me by seeing me at the windows and door of Mr. Burgess' house, as when I met him on the first occasion I had on my livery hat; I recollect when he came up to me in the Brompton-road, he said, 'Adieu,' just the compliments of the day, and I</p>

               <p>recognised him as being the person who passed in and about Cadogan-place, but the conversation occurred about that."</p>

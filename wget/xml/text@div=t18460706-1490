                  </hi>. I was going down the Kent-road about two o'clock in the morning, on the 19th of June—I was on the foot-path—the prisoner stopped me and asked me to go home with her—I refused—I was going to move on, and found she had her hand in my pocket—she took it out, and put it into her own—I had one shilling in my pocket, and I missed it—I accused her of robbing me of the shilling—she said she had not any silver about her, she could not rob me of a shilling—the policeman was coming, and she took out the shilling and put it in her mouth—there was no shilling found on her.</p>

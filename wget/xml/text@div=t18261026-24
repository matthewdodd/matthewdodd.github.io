I heard that two men were taken to the watch-house, which is very near the spot - I went there, saw them both, and knew them - the rule and handkerchief have been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they talk together while they were doing this?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260016"></xptr>A. Yes, and I saw Mansfield give Parker the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you said that you did not see Parker previous to the robbery? A. I did not see him till I felt the blow on my arm - I never said I had seen him before, and watched him - I was not in liquor, I never said I was - Mansfield was an entire stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He called you Bill? A. Yes; I am not called Bill. I looked at him as I walked along, and did not like him at all as he kept pushing up against me - I observed his face several times; it was not a particularly dark night, I did not particularly observe; I went up Snow-hill straight into Peter's-lane. There were no other prisoners in the watch-house; I said directly they were the men; they were not pointed out to me; I knew them instantly. I am certain it was Mansfield who put his hand into my bosom - I was knocked down in rather a dark place, but a light came across from the lamp at the Queen's Head public-house, and I saw him give the handkerchief to Parker plainly.</p>

            . I am a constable. About twelve o'clock on the night of the 10th of October, I was in St. John Street; in Peter's-lane I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoners running together in a direction from the cry, very fast; I heard them speak together at the bottom of the street, where they separated, but I did not hear what they said - I ran nearly close behind them; I told the patrol to follow Mansfield; I followed and overtook Parker down a place which is no throughfare - I went up and collared him; he asked if I was going to eat him. I took him a few yards, another patrol came up into the passage, a light was brought from the watch-house, and on the spot where I took him we found this handkerchief, which I have had ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he in the watch-house when the handkerchief was found? A. Yes, I returned directly, and found it - the spot is very little way from the watch-house. I am quite sure of Mansfield, for I had known him two years - I have frequently seen them both together, and know they are acquainted.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain of Parker? A. I am - I saw the rule fall from him. Directly I took him into the watch-house, the prosecutor said, "That is one of the men who robbed me." He was not out of my sight after he dropped the rule - the prosecutor was sober.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY to MR. LAYTON. Q. Have you ever said to any body that you were drunk when this robbery was committed? A. No, I never told Mrs. Doveton so - she came to my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did she come about? A. She came and said she hoped I would be merciful to her brother - she was talking to my wife some time before I came home; and Newby came to my house, and said, if I would not go on with the prosecution, but make a flaw in the indictment, the watch would be produced, if it was between heaven and earth - he said he was a relation, and that Parker had robbed him, and he was afraid to touch his life.</p>

            . I live at No. 40, Devonshire-street, and am Parker's sister. I have seen the prosecutor - I went to him and asked him, about this, as my brother would not tell me: I said, "Was not you tipsy?" he said, No; he owned he had been drinking, but knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say you hoped he would he merciful to your brother? A. No; the first time I went I said, if he was guilty, I hoped he would suffer, but if he was not, I hoped he would recommend him to mercy. Newby is a distant relation of mine; he married my mother's sister; he is my uncle.</p>
               <p>NEWBY. I do not know that I am any relation to her; I lived with her aunt, who died about six months ago, but we were not married.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed as their uncle, and that woman took your name? A. Yes, we lived together six years. I went to the prosecutor's house, and said I did not know whether I got the truth from the sister, but had come to him to get the truth; that I understood the watch had been overvalued at 3l.; he then said he would not take 4l. for it, and sooner than lose it he would do any thing, and if he had the watch he did not care. I said, all I looked for was the lives of the men, and if the property was his only object, I would endeavour to make a search - that money should not be an object, and I would go home and make every exertion for the purpose of recovering it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of Tread way Street, Hackney—I have been a solicitor's clerk—about the end of last September Daw spoke to me, and I in consequence proposed a deed—he supplied me with the names of these seventeen creditors—I understood G. H. Poole to be a builder—I had had no transactions with him—I saw him at Hadding-ham's house, and told him I had got a list of Daw's creditors, and asked him if he would sign the deed—he said, "It will be a great loss to me; I had better put up with the loss and take what I can get"—I got his signa<lb></lb>ture to the deed—it was for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was the amount given me by Daw—saw him once at his house, 19, Harrogate Road—I saw him not more than twice between both October and 5th March—I did not know that he used any name but Poole till he was tried for misdemeanour, in the other Court, in the name of William Austin (<hi rend="italic">See vol.</hi> 1 xix., <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 451)—I saw Garner at the same time—I did not act for Austin or Poole; but I was asked to watch the case, to see that counsel was in Court, and I did so—I saw Miles Smith in reference to signing the deed, and when I asked him if he would consent to the composition, he said, "Oh, yes "—I asked him if he would sign the deed of composition, and he said that he did not see any necessity—I did not get a written assent from him or from Shortland—I went to Edward Mann, and asked him to sign—he said that he would not; he had already got com<lb></lb>position, and had given Daw a receipt—I did not ask him for his assent in writing; I thought that was sufficient—I know Milton, Silley, Richards, and Pillion—I saw them all, and was present when Hicks certified the com<lb></lb>position deed—I appear for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not notice that he spells my name Weld instead of Reid—when I wrote my name as attesting witness, I did not notice that my name was spelt wrong—I do not think I prepared the affidavits to the accounts—I find Daw's signature to the statutory affi<lb></lb>davit, and there is his signature to the accounts—I prepared his preliminary statement; this is my signature to it—I acted for him in the bankruptcy, so far as making my affidavit of service, and am acting for him now—I did not act for Poole.</p>

               <p>whole matter was done in great haste—the prisoner told me that Miles Smith was secured, and Mann had already got the composition, and given a receipt for it—I took them to be accepting creditors, and put them down assenting creditors on my own responsibility—the prisoner said nothing to me upon the necessity of "getting assent in writing; so far as I know these transactions have been <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> on his part—this "Three fourths in value," is in writing—there was undue haste when the affidavits were sworn; it was all done in an hour and a half, the whole of the accounts and all; there was no time to look into anything—there was not time to read over the affidavit and to get it registered—in the whole of my transactions with the prisoner no part that he mentioned to me turned out untrue—I observed no attempt to conceal the real state of his affairs from his creditors—I did not know that he had paid Shortland, till I was examined at the Police Court—I have known Daw five years—he lost a great many horses—I do not think I was present when the affidavit was sworn, I think I sent Anderson; I was com<lb></lb>pelled to employ two or three people that day—the accounts and the affidavits were attended to in the same hurried manner—they have passed the Court unchallenged hitherto—I had seven or eight people's business to attend to on that day, I was locked in the office till 5 o'clock, and they would not let anybody out or in after 2 o'clock—I do not think any expla<lb></lb>nation was given to Daw; they were taken up in that hurried way, and he was compelled to sign his name.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, K</hi> 13). On the night of 3rd May. I was on duty in High-street, Bromley, Middlesex. I saw a crowd in High-street, two men were fighting; I went through the crowd towards them, and the prisoner, Howlett, rushed upon me, struck me on the top of the head with some instrument, and felled me to the ground—I got up, and the blood flowed from my tread in a stream—I had not spoken to him—I was seized hold of by three women, and beaten about the back of the head; I cannot say</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Bromley, within twenty yards of where this disturbance took place. I heard it, and went into the street—I went into a house and found Curtis, partially insen<lb></lb>sible and covered with blood—I bad him removed to my place—I found a deep wound on his head, two inches long, on the frontal bone, the skin was torn from the skull—that wound might have been inflicted either by a severe blow from a blunt instrument, or from a sharp instrument; it was a clean cut—I do not think it could have been done by a man's fist; nor by the man falling on the ground, from the situation of it, and from the fact of the hair lying over it undisturbed—if he had fallen, his hair would have been torn away, and not beaten into it—my nephew, who is the divisional surgeon, attended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why should not it have been done by striking against the edge of a kerb-stone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was too much on the top of the head; the way in which the man fell might regulate it—I could detect no fracture of the skull, there was concussion which he did not recover for an hour, or an hour and a half—that would be indicative of a fall as well as a blow—I know that by the intermittant pulse; I had to administer ammonia—I do not think Curtis was at all intoxicated—I smelt his breath, and could not tell that he had been drinking at all—he might have had a glass of wine or ale, but was not under the influence of liquor in any degree.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and was potboy at the Victoria on 3rd May; but since I have come up to speak the truth my master has discharged me; he discharged me last Tuesday night; his name is Mr. Philcox. I remember serving some beer outside the house that night—William Sullivan paid for three pots of ale; William Shielwood for one; and Daniel Fitzgerald for one—it was at the corner of Peter-street, near the Victoria—Sullivan paid 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for three pots of sixpenny ale—I did not take the ale out—Shielwood took out the pot he paid for, Sullivan what he paid for, and Fitzgerald what he paid for—the two policemen helped them to drink it—they had the last pot just as I was putting up the last shutter—they came down by the side of the house—I cannot swear to the policemen, because the light was put out—they had their uniforms on—they had some of each pot—one was a short policeman—they have not spoken to me since—a policeman spoke to my master outside the door when I was putting up the shutters—I was discharged when I went home from here last Tuesday—I had no warning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Park-street, Bromley. On 3rd May, about 12 o'clock at night, I was speaking to James Sullivan and James Nicholson in the road in High-street, when George Reading came from the direction of the Coventry Cross—James Sullivan is a brother of William—Reading put one hand in my neck, and the other in my backside, and said, "Go on"—I said, "All right, master; we are not drunk, and we are not kicking up any row"—he seized me by the handkerchief, and said, "If you don't go on, I will turn you over"—I said there was no cause for it, and we had not been there more than a minute—he left go of me, and I told him if he did it again, I would give him a smack on the nose—he walked four or five yards, came back, renewed his hold of my handkerchief, and we both fell into the road—I got up, and went away—Howlett was not there at the commencement of it—there had been no row before that.</p>

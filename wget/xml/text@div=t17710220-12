               <p>Q. You was appointed, I think, to go abroad in the East-India company service?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. Yes, to Madrass; the ship did not sail: I returned into the country again on the twenty-seventh or twenty-eighth of December: I saw the prisoner next day, but had no conversation with him: I was out a shooting with some company on the twenty-ninth: I observed the prisoner following us about, among the woods, all day long: I had no suspicion of any thing of this sort then: I went to the Bull inn at Brompton about six or seven in the evening: I had observed him following me all day long, but I had not spoke to him: the prisoner came in after I had been in about five minutes: I sat by the kitchen fire; he sat at a distance: we staid till about three quarters after eight: I went out once to the door; the prisoner followed me out and in again: nothing passed between us then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you in the house?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from home?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. Pretty near a mile and a half.</p>
               <p>Council. Please to tell the court where you went and what happened to you: be particular.</p>
               <p>Parkinson. When I was about to pay my reckoning, the prisoner went out about five or six minutes before me: I went up two fields homewards: I came to a gate that opened into a grove; there I saw the prisoner standing just by the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. Yes; it was a remarkable moonlight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200005"></xptr> light night: I passed him about ten yards: he followed me and forced a conversation with me: he asked me if there were many hares and partridges about: I was not fond of talking with him; I said yes or no to him, and so on: when I came to the style at the end of the third field, I thought I heard something like the snick of a gun: I was quite surprized: I turned round and said, God, I thought I heard something snick like a gun; why, yes, says he, I thought so too: I repeated it several times, and so did he; at last, says he, I believe it was only an owl in the tree; the style was nailed to a tree: I walked up the fourth field and he followed me: I was going to open a gate at the end of the field that went into another grove; the prisoner fired at me: I reeled a little: I looked up and saw the pistol in his hand: he had turned and was going to strike me with the but end of it: I was stunned with the firing of the pistol, so that I don't know whether he hit me or not; if he did, I did not feel it. As soon as I recovered myself I set out and run; the prisoner followed me all the way: I got into a labouring man's house, one

               <p>Q. Do you recollect any particular expressions that he made use of as he followed you?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. He said, as soon as I turned round, being wounded, There, d - n you, take that, and swore many more oaths. There was a light in Cawdell's house, and I believe a man was up; Cawdell and another man went home with me to my father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you wounded?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. Yes; I have the coat in court that I wore at the time; the pistol was loaded with shot; some of the shot were extracted: he was quite close to me when he shot me: my father sent for Mr. Baker the surgeon, and then they went to take the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the surgeon here?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. No; he is a quaker, and won't take an oath.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. How long had you been at the public house?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. About two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite sober?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. Yes; we had but three pints of beer among us; I had drank nothing before all day, (produces a light coat) this is the coat I wore at the time, (the coat has a great hole upon the shoulder near the top and is very much discoloured with the powder.) I have several of the shot now in my neck (he shows his wound to the jury.)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman; K</hi> 381). I am stationed at West Ham, in Essex—I was on duty yesterday morning at half-past 1 o'clock in North Woolwich-road, and heard a disturbance in Nelson-street—James Wayland, No. 103, was with me—on getting to Nelson-street, the prisoner was making a noise and using abusive language—I requested him to go away several times, and he refused—Evans came out and I told him to get him away—I got him to the top of the street—he came round and said, "You b----take that," and whipped a knife into my head just above the left eye, and sad, "Now I have done for you at last"—I did not see the knife till it was picked up—I called out, "Oh, my God, I am stabbed! "he was close by and threw himself down, saying that I was done for at last—he was taken in custody by the other two policemen—I bled most fearfully and went to Dr. Muggleston, who dressed my wound—the prisoner was sober, but had been drinking a little—he was very noisy and used very bad language.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I deny the last statement. Nelson-street is my home, No. 7; I had been out and went to see if I could get in to get my things; I was excited by not getting in, and kicked up a piece of work, but there was not a soul in the street. When I got to the top of the street, two policemen knocked me down, and I have got seven wounds. I do not say that I did not strike with the knife; in the excitement I do not know what I did. My wife died, and I sold a room full of goods, and that person was my housekeeper; she got many of the police to knock me about and I had my ribs broken, and when I was laid up they stole my goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had there been a disturbance before with the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; eighteen months ago he had been living with a woman—he had been making a disturbance, and I got his clothes for him—I did not see any policeman knock him about on this night—no policeman struck him before I was stabbed—he was outside a door in Nelson-street, calling the people b----s, and everything that was dreadful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was not disturbing anybody. As soon as I got to the top, the policeman said, "I will soon see you out of here," and he kicked me and knocked me down; as soon as I got up he gave me another, and in the scuffle I might do this to him; I will say the truth. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not do it—I had hold of him by the collar, and said, "I do not want you to go to the station if you will be quiet—I had not got three yards before he said, "You b----, take that," and stabbed me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 103). I was on duty on the next beat, Victoria-dock-road, and heard a noise in Nelson-street—I went there with Sharpe, and saw the prisoner there using abusive language in front of the door—I spoke to him as well as Sharpe, and several inhabitants came out and requested us to remove him—Sharpe attempted to remove him gently, when he turned round and struck Sharpe, who called out that he was stabbed—I took the prisoner, and he fell down—I raised him up, and in the act of raising him he endeavoured to bite my hand, but I saved myself and took him in custody—he was very violent on the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I know nothing about that policeman, only that he came up afterwards and beat me with his staff. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not—some labouring</p>

               <p>men came out of their houses and said that they could not rest for the disturbance, and begged that he might be removed—I am sure I did not strike him, but he fell down twice, and Sharpe did not strike him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> They kicked me along; I have marks of it; he took the truncheon and beat me like this, as if he was beating a haystack. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is not true—I never used a truncheon, nor saw Sharpe use one—nothing was done but catching hold of him—I had hold of him by the hand all the way to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 248). I was on duty yesterday morning, at North Woolwich road, with Gay another constable—I heard a disturbance a little distance off, went to the place, and saw the prisoner lying on the ground—just as I came up he threw himself down, and Sharpe halloed out that he was stabbed—I ran up as quick as I could, and assisted in taking him into custody, and by doing so, I got a wound on my hand, either a kick or a blow—I cannot say whether it was the prisoner who did it—there was another man there, but he was a little distance away—I went a little way with him till we met a constable—I then turned back to look for the instrument, and close to where the disturbance took place, I picked up this knife with a little blood on the hilt of it—I did not strike the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Maryland-point, Stratford—about a quarter past 3 o'clock yesterday morning, Sharpe came to my house—I found a wound on his forehead, above the inner angle of the left eye, rather more than an inch long—all injuries to the forehead are not so severe, unless erysipelas supervenes; but being a clean out, there is less likelihood of that—an inch in a different direction would have sent it into the eye. and into the brain if struck with any force—it seemed to be struck with force—this knife would be likely to produce a wound of that kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I had a needle in my cap? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not he to say whether it was done by a knife or a needle—the needle was nearly as wide as this. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here made an examination of the prisoner, and stated as follows</hi>:)—There is a contused wound on the back of his head, which is recent—it might have been done by a blunt instrument, such as a truncheon, or by falling on the ground—he has several small recent bruises about his shoulders and elbows—a blunt instrument would produce them—he does not look as if he had been severely beaten—he looks as if he had had several blows with some instrument, or fallen on some hard substance—if he had been belaboured with truncheons, I think he would look worse than that, because it would have been more diffused over the body, and there would be echymosed spots under the cuticle—that is what I call a bruise—the elbows may strike the ground when a man falls—there are bruises on the blade bones—the small of the back is not bruised, nothing that would be curved—they are on the prominent parts of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have no witnesses, as there was only one in the street at the time; I do not recollect seeing Sharpe, but when I saw his head cut, Ldo not deny that he might have been in the fray; there were five policemen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Ferris, of Great Portland-street, St. James. The prisoner, Holditch, came there on the 26th or 27th of May, and brought a sample of hair, and I agreed, on behalf of Mr. Feris, to purchase 344 lbs. weight—he sold it for him<lb></lb>self at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, which was the marker price—I had dealt with him for eight years on his own account—I knew he worked at Jones's but he was still doing business for himself, as I understood—he had been liv<lb></lb>ing with Jones about four years, and I was still dealing with him—he did business for himself as well—the hourse-hair came to Mr. Ferris on the 29th and I paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the time, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the following Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed by Richard Holditch to ma<lb></lb>nufacture horse hair on Mr. Jones's premises, while Jones was out of town—he directed me to take this hair to Woodhatch while I did—he told me to take it to Mr. Ferris—I saw nobody but jim at that time, but Smith came down afterwards out of the warehouse—the hair was brought out of the warehouse and delivered to me—it was lowered down by the crane into the street—I did not see who by, but just as it was put on the truck, both the prisoners came down stairs—Smith said nothing particular—he might have spoken about typing stairs—Stairs said nothing particular—he might the ropes—I am sure of that—t was packed up in bags, as usual.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live in Old-street-road. The prisoner Smith came to me on a Sunday in July, about ten days before I was examined, which was on the 4th of August, and said his father wanted to see me down at Brewer's-quay-his father is Holditch—he is his father-in-law; and when I went down, Holditch was drinking a pot of porter—he asked me to make out a bill and to date it on the 28th of May, which I did—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a bill</hi>) this is my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You made it out under Holditch's directions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Smith merely said that Holditch wanted to see me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

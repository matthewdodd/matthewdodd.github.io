                  </hi>. I live in Pleasant-cottage, Clapham-common, and am a milkman. On the 16th of Oct.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184412160131"></xptr>
               <p>I wrote an answer, and put it into the Post-office, addressed to Mr. Long, 4, commercial-place, Finsbury-square—I did not keep a copy of it—on the 3rd of Dec. Tyas brought me this other letter—both the letters were open—I had some conversation with Tyas, and after that I went with him to a broker's shop, in Trafalgar-row, Walworth-common, and there I saw my chaise, which I had lost, not the barrow—I did not see the prisoner then—next day Tyas brought him to within 100 yards of my house, and the prisoner said there was a misunderstanding between us about the barrow, as we could not find it the day before—we were talking about the barrow going along the road, and he said Mr. Tyas, his friend, would point out the barrow to me—lie did not say whether he himself knew where it was—the prisoner then left us—I went with Tyas to Carley and Sons, at Walworth-common, and saw the barrow there—Tyas went with me, but the broker took me in to find the barrow—the policeman took posses<lb></lb>sion of it—I paid sixpence to Mr. Tyas the day he brought the prisoner—I afterwards gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I suppose the prisoner meant the misunder<lb></lb>standing was between me and him—he used the word "us."</p>

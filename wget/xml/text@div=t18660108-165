                  </hi>. I live at 30, Tunbridge-street, Euston-road—I have been a soldier, and have three Indian medals and four bars—I have since been a labourer—on 27th December, about half-past 12, I was in a public-house in Tunbridge-street, with Ann French, who is a friend of my wife's—as I came out I saw the prisoner and five or six others—the prisoner stood on my left, about two yards from me as I came out—I stood still, and he said to a man, "Jack, you be on to him, and, God blind me, I will not miss him this time"—a man in a lightish coat then came up and struck me on the eyebrow, a sharp blow with something sharp, I cannot say whether it was his fist—I have the mark still—it bled furiously—the prisoner then came up and made a grasp at my medals—he only left me this one bar—they were silver—he ran off the roadway, but the female who was by my side seized him, and a man seized me at the same time, who held me, and prevented me following the prisoner—I had never seen the prisoner before—I am sure he is the man—the medals were dropped into my area last Wednesday week.

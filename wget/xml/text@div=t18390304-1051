On the 19th of February I missed some tools which I had seen safe on the 15th, in the shop over the hay-loft—the lamp and glass were not lost at the same time, but the other articles were—I spoke to the prisoner on the 20th, about the pro<lb></lb>perty being missing, but did not suspect him—these are them—(looking <hi rend="italic">at them.</hi>)</p>

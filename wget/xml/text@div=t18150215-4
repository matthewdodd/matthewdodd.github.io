               <p>SECOND COUNT. They stood charged, that they three round blanks of metal, each of them resembling a shilling, falsely and traiterously did colour with materials, producing the colour of silver; and also one other blank of round metal as and for a sixpence, did colour with materials, producing the colour of silver.</p>

               <p>JOHN RAY. I am a constable. On the 18th of January, I apprehended the man prisoner in Aldgate High-street, just as he came out of a stationer's shop, I had been watching him; I saw him go into Mr. New's shop, who is a stationer, I saw him go in there, and come out; when he came out, he had a sheet of brown paper and a pen in his hand; I went in the moment he came out, and gave information<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150005"></xptr>there; I followed him, and apprehended him; I took him into the Blue Boar Inn, Aldgate; I searched him; I found upon him a quantity of good money, twelve or fourteen shillings in good money, a quantity of good copper, and sixpences; there was no more bad money upon him; I have the sixpences here. I then brought him back to the shop from whence I saw him come out; a shilling was produced by the person that took it, the shop-woman said the prisoner was the person that she took the shilling from; the prisoner made no answer to that. I have got that shilling. I then took the prisoner to the watch-house. I asked the prisoner who he was, and where he lived, and his name; he told me he lived down a lane near the Red Lion at Ilford. I asked him what business he followed; he told me he had nearly enough to live upon, he now and then dealt in a little corn to make things comfortable, and to make all things meet. I know he lived at No. 12, George-street, Stepney Fields. When he told me he lived at Ilford, I told him, he told me a story; I told him I was going to a house in George-street, Stepney Fields, that I knew to be his lodging; he made no answer; afterwards I left him in the watchhouse, and I went with William Kennersley, the officer, to No. 12, George-street, Stepney Fields, when we got down there it might be a little after two o'clock; I knocked at the door, being a small house, I heard somebody run up stairs; the woman that stands in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her name - A. Jennings; she gave her name in then, she is the wife of the man prisoner. She throwed up the one pair of stairs window, looked out of the window, and asked me what I wanted; I told her there was a mistake in some taxes, I wished to speak to her. I left Kinnersley at the front door. I got over the wall backwards, I got into the house; I observed the two women very busy at the fire-place in the kitchen, as I was out of doors upon the wall, I had to get upon another wall, and upon the tiles: at last I got into the house; I found the two women prisoners in the kitchen down stairs; I let the officer, Kinnersley, in at the front part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of the women - A. After Kinnersley took and secured them, their thumbs and fingers were dirty, as if they had been rubbing of metal, the same as coiners hands are; I searched upon the shelf, in the kitchen; I observed a quantity of base metal; these are them.</p>
               <p>MR. NICOLL. Q. You are one of the moniers of his Majesty's Mint; look at the money produced by the officer, what are they - A. Base, and counterfeit, thirteen base and counterfeit sixpences; they all have been coloured except one, that is a blank.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shillings are there in that parcel -</p>
               <p>Ray. The shillings were found upon another shelf, in the same room five shillings, and six sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. They appear to have been coloured, they are counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Ray. I examined the saucepan on the fire; this parcel was found in a drawer in the front room, there are six shillings and a half crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. They are all of them counterfeits, part coloured, and part not.</p>
               <p>Ray. I found these thirty-five blanks in the same room; I took the saucepan off the fire, which had peas soup in it; in that saucepan I found one hundred and ninety-two shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. The one hundred and ninety-two shillings are all counterfeits, they are coloured, and fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Ray. I found by the side of the fire-place this ewer with some liquid at the bottom of it; I poured that liquid into this bottle, in the presence of the two women, it is a solution of aquafortis, in another pot in the same room was some cream of tarter, which the middle woman got hold off, Mrs. Jennings, otherwise Lacon, she got hold of that, took it into the front room and threw it in the fire place; I scraped part of it up, and this pot with backing in it; here are two pieces of blankets very much stained with aqafortis; these were on the top of a table in the same room. I then went up stairs to a room with two beds in the room, and under one of the beds on the floor, was a quantity of good silver, near two pounds; Ward owned the handkerchief and the silver, she said she slept in that bed with her child, on that bed under which I found the good money; I returned the good money to her, there was no bad money found up stairs. The prisoner Ward said she was a servant out of place, she was in the habit of lodging there. I took the two women into custody. Mrs. Lacon acknowledged to living there, she put on some things that were there, and said the house was her's, I had seen

             four or five times before, I have seen him feeding his fowls, and go in and come out of there, I supposed that was his house. I got into the house at the window, and when I came down into the kitchen, the women they were standing up near the fire; I laid hold of them one with one hand and the other with my other hand as they were standing up near the fire.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM KINNERSLEY. I am an officer. I went with the last witness to apprehend the coiners: I never was at the apprehending of coiners before. Mr. Ray shewed me their hands; their thumbs and fingers seemed very much daubed; I know no more than what Mr. Ray has told you. Ward's thumbs and fingers were the same as Lacon's; their thumbs and fingers had the same appearance in both of them, their hands were coloured as if with a liquid all over, but there was a difference between the thumb and the finger to the rest of the hand.</p>

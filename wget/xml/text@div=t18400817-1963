                  </hi>. I live in Upper St. Martin's-lane. M'Donald was my errand-boy for six or eight months—I have missed some brass cocks—about half-past six o'clock, on the 22nd of July, I went into the counting-house, and observed a metal cock lying down in one corner, knowing it should not be there, I requested the prisoner to sweep the counting-house out, which was his business, he did so, while I walked up and down the front shop—I then found the cock moved from one corner and hid behind an old almanack board—nobody had been there but him—I set him to mind the front-shop while I went up stairs—I returned in about five minutes, and then missed the cock—I called M'Donald to me, and he said he had not seen it—I told him it was gone, and nobody could have taken it but him, and requested he would show me what he had done with it—he then showed me that he had put it in a part of the shop where the shutters are kept—he stooped down, took it up, gave it to me, and fell down on his knees, and begged my forgiveness—I left him in charge of my clerk, and fetched a policeman—in consequence of in<lb></lb>quiry which I made my attention was drawn to a marine-store shop in Queen-street, Seven Dials, kept by the prisoner Mancer—I went there with Ashman, the constable, and saw him find a brass cock of mine—M'Donald said, in the presence of Mancer, "That is the cock I sold him last night for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Mancer said, "I never saw him before in my life."</p>

I accompanied Mr. Pontifex and M'Donald to Mancer's house, and asked him if he had not bought some cocks of that boy—he said he had not, and he had no cocks in his house—I asked if he had any brass cocks—he said he had not—I searched his shop, and found one cock on a shelf in a corner of the shop, under some rags—M'Donald said, "That is the cock I sold him yesterday for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."</p>

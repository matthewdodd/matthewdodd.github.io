                  </hi>. I am a chemist of 131, Brick Lane, Bethnal Green—I have known the prisoner for about eight years—I employed him as a stockbroker to buy and sell stock for me from time to time—I changed my investments as the market changed—I did not consult him about it, I only gave him orders—early in June, 1870 I had some Egyptian stock which I desired to change for Peruvian stock; he was to buy 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Peruvian stock for me—I saw him personally for that purpose—I desired him to sell some stock, after the lapse of time, I could not say exactly what, and buy me Perus in their place—he was to pay for them out of the proceeds of the other stock—I afterwards received from him by post, this contract note—I know the prisoner's handwriting; this is signed by him. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated June</hi> 6, 1870, <hi rend="italic">and stated that</hi> 1,810<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">worth of Peruvian stock, less commission, was bought by the prisoner for the witness, of Messrs. Baker &amp; Sturdy</hi>). He had previously bought for mo some Turkish Stock—this is the contract note for it signed by him, it is for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated May 13, 1870; he had also purchased for me 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Peruvian stock—I ordered him personally to buy it—I always did my business personally with him—I have not got the contract note for that, I don't know what has become of it, I have looked for it and cannot find it—it was signed by the prisoner—a few days after the purchase of the last 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I went to his office; I did not see him, I never saw him after,—I saw his brother Harry—I called there repeatedly, and insisted on having the stock, and his brother gave me the numbers instead—the office was open when I first called—on 6th July I called and saw his brother, and directed him to sell all my stock because I thought that war would break out and prices go down—he went to a box and made some statement; it was something very unsatisfactory—I was never able to get ray stock—on 15th July 1 went again to the</p>

               <p>office and found if, locked, I was not able to find the prisoner; I did not know what had become of him, I had had no notice from him; it was a blow to me that day; when I went to the office I thought I was worth that amount of money, and I came out penniless—on 20th July I obtained a warrant, and issued bills to endeavour to stop the sale of the Peruvians—I got a list of my bonds from Henry Bland—I gave it to the printer to print the bills from, and he has failed and gone away; I was unable to get the original list; I got the bills and had them stuck up in the Stock Exchange, and about town—in April, 1873, I received this letter from the prisoner; I have not got the envelope. (<hi rend="italic">This letter was without date or address, it contained expressions of regret for the wrong he had done, the prosecutor, and expressed a hope that he might be allowed to return to London, when he would take measures to pay back the money by cash and bit s, and asked the prosecutor to insert an advertisement in the</hi> Times <hi rend="italic">in reply</hi>). In consequence of receiving that letter I, by my solicitors advice, put this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, on 8th April, "To E. B.—State more fully what you propose to do as to cash"—several weeks after that I received this letter, not through the post, it was brought by some one to my office. (<hi rend="italic">This was also without address or date, it expressed regret that he was unable at present to make any cash payment, but if allowed to return he would do his utmost to make a settle<lb></lb>ment</hi>). I declined his overtures altogether—I heard nothing more of him until early in August in the present year, when I arrested him myself—the actual value of the bonds was about 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was in the habit of keeping my bonds at his office—part of the money belonged to my sister and sister-in-law.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent—I was formerly clerk to the defendant, who is my brother—I knew Mr. Swire, and knew that he had business transactions with my brother—I knew that he purchased bonds for him, I can't remember what they were—my brother had them in the office—they were sold on 30th June to settle the account—I said to him at the time "These are Mr. Swire's bonds," he said "Oh, it is all right, whatever I do I must not break faith with Mr. Swire," they are entered in this book on the 6th, but they were actually sold on 30th June; I can't re<lb></lb>member exactly what bonds they were, they are entered here as 2,300 Perus, and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Turks, sold to Dale &amp; Stevenson—they were delivered and paid for on the 30th—I remember Mr. Swire afterwards coming to the office, and giving me instructions to sell the bonds, that was about 6th July—I did not go to any box, I never had the key—I knew at that time that they were already sold—I did not tell Mr. Swire so, I did not say anything at all about it, I simply said my brother was not there—I can't recollect when my brother was last at the office, I think it was about a day before the last making up day of the July account, which was on the 13th—he then went away as a defaulter—I knew nothing at all about his going away, I was totally ignorant of it; he did not tell me that he was going, and I had no idea of it—when I found he did not return the office was shut up, and the books were handed over to the assignee of the Stock Exchange—I gave Mr. Swire the numbers of his bonds, and all I had in my power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The material was ready to my hand to give him all the information he wanted—my brother brought me the bonds on the account day, and said "Deliver these"—the next account day would be on the 15th or 16th July—on 30th June he was expecting money from clients, other<lb></lb>wise</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187510250005"></xptr>
               <p>he would not have parted with the bonds—he had on that day given cheques to various persons to a considerable amount—I know that he expected a large sum to be paid into his account on the 30th—of course I was totally ignorant of what; I was only his clerk—war had not then been declared between France and Germany; it was declared before the next account day—I believe there were about seventy failures on the Stock Exchange in consequence—amongst them were Shaw, who owed my brother 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Partridge, who owed him 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Newton, 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Pacherie, 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and Quick, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had reason to expect quite 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after the settlement of 30th June he was married, and went to Calais to spend the honeymoon—on his way back he learnt that war had broken out—since then he has been away from this country until his apprehension—he bad been about twelve years on the Stock Exchange; he bore a wonderful cha<lb></lb>racter—there are some gentlemen here to" speak to his character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He had been speculating the last two or three accounts—on 30th June he was expecting money, and did not get it—he sold these bonds to tide over his difficulties—before the next account, war having broken out, matters became worse—before the 30th there were only rumours of war.</p>

On 4th August last I went to Croydon and found the prisoner there—I told him I was a detective officer, and had a warrant for his apprehension for stealing these bonds—I read the amounts to him—I told him there was the Peruvian Stock, and the Turks of 1869 and 1865—Mr. Swire was with me—the prisoner said it was quite right; he was a penniless man; had he been allowed to come over to this country he had money owing to him that would have satisfied Mr. Swire—I brought him to Bow Lane station," where he was charged, and he made the same statement there—I found on him a bill of exchange for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Brewer-street, Somers-town. This piece of bacon is mine—I lost it on the 7th of this month—here in my ticket on it—I had placed it on a pile of cheeses, on the cill of my door—a customer came in and told me something, and I missed it.</p>

I was on duty in Brewer-street on the afternoon of the 7th of Feb.—Dickinson came and told me something—I went to Denton-street, and found the prisoner sitting by the kitchen fire, in a house there, and this bacon by the side of her, with this ticket on it—I asked where she bought it, but she was so drunk she made no reply—I took her to the station—she there stated she bought it of a woman in the house I brought her from—she had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Dickinson—I live in the kitchen of No. 16, Denton-street—on the 7th of Feb. I was in our back premises, talking for three or four minutes, and when I came down I found the prisoner, whom I had never seen before, sitting in my kitchen, with this lump of bacon on my table by her side—I asked what business she had there, and told her to go out—she said she would not, and ordered me out of my own place—I then got the policeman—she was rather the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. It is very false—the bacon was not there before I saw her—she brought it there—she had a half-crown, one penny piece, and two halfpence—that was all—the dropped that, and I gave it her back.</p>

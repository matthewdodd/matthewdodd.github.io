On the 14th of November, I had a carpenter repairing the corn room and hay lost; the carpenter put the lead weight out of the room into the hay lost; the carpenter came to me and said the lead weight was gone, and there had been nobody in the hay lost except the prisoner and Old Will; I told him to finish the loft, we should find the weight; he found the sash weight in the course of the day between the hay and the hay hands in the loft; I told him to look out at night; the carpenter went to work below; when the men came down, Keef went into the hay loft, and then he came into me to set down his time; I waited till he set down his time. I then told him he had got a sash weight of mine; he said me, sir; I said yes, you have you scoundrel; he said I have; I immediately called the carpenter out of the yard to take him to the watch-house. The constable found the weight on him.</p>

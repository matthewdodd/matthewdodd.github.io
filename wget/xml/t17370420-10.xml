               <p>Defence. I was going along the Strand with another young Woman, and we went into this House to drink a Pint. My Companion went up Stairs to enquire for a certain Person, and I went up to enquire after her; when I came to the Top of the Stairs, the young Woman met me, and screamed out so, that I was terribly frighted: the Gentlewoman is welcome to say what she pleases, but I had nothing upon me; she did not see me drop any Thing. When the Gentleman came up Stairs, I told him I was an Acquaintance of the Witness.</p>
               <p>Line. She said no such Thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I mean'd, I was an Acquaintance of the Woman that went up Stairs, and I only went up to look for her, and the Witness cry'd out, and frighted me, as well as her self: - pray, Madam, what Cloaths had I on?</p>
               <p>Cattle. I told my Fellow Servants she had a Hat on, and a Velvet Manteel; but it prov'd to be a Scarlet Cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not another Woman with her?</p>
               <p>Line. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Cattle. 'Twas very Moon-light; and there's a Sky-light on the Top of the Stairs, that I could see very plainly.</p>
               <p>Line. There was a Man and another Woman came in with the Prisoner, and the Woman did say, she knew something of her, but the Man did not.</p>

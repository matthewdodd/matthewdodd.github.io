            . The coachman brought my things into the room where we were. We had a pint of hot, and a pint of porter. The coach brought a hamper of fowls, as Wise told us; he said he was to see the hamper shipped. When I set out to go to my place, he told me he would carry my things for me. I told him I did not want any of his assistance. He said the hamper was going to London Bridge, by a porter, and my bundle might go with the porter, along with it. Wise would carry my box. We were but a little way from the Bull-Head Inn when we met Groves. I was going after my other things. A tallow-chandler from Stratford came up accidentally. Wise told us he had a hill of five pounds to pay the tallow-chandler. They went across the road to a public house, and had two pints of hot. Wise had my box under his arm. I was very uneasy, because I was going to my place. Wise offered me a coach, or would see me to my place on foot, which I said I was much obliged to him for, but would not accept it. When we went out from there, he insisted on

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120016"></xptr>M. King. The place that I was to go to was in Wapping. Groves took my box. I was entirely a stranger to that end of the town; I had lived in Well-close-square, and in Shadwell, some time before. I thought they were going to London-bridge, as they kept walking along. I said, Pray, are we going to London-bridge? His answer was, Pray, Madam, come along. Groves walked behind with my box; he said he would go no farther; he was drest in a livery. Wise told me he was a footman to a Gentleman. Wise had his hand cross my back. I said, I was afraid we were wrong. He said, Madam, come along. I said to Groves, I should be obliged to you if you will tell me whether I am going towards London-bridge? Groves said he knew Mr. Wise lived somewhere here. I had staid behind to speak to Groves, as he staid behind. This was after he had delivered my box to Wise; and they whisper'd to each other. I was at that time somewhat behind; I can't tell what they said: after that Wise gave Groves my box again; and Groves kept on the right hand side for some time, and at last he cross the road, and ran away with my box; and Wise walked a great pace, and at last he set to running; then he cross the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were you then?</p>
               <p>M. King. This was by Cheapside, at the end of Bread-street. I ran after Wise; a gentleman stopt him; then I went up to him, and laid hold of his coat, and asked him where my box was gone. He was taken in at the Bull-Head, a public-house in Bread-Street. The gentleman heard what I had to say. A footman, that lives in the Temple, heard the account I gave; he stept forwards, as he told me afterwards, and saw Groves on Ludgate-Hill; he brought him with my box in at the Bull-Head to us; I was then in strong sits. The next day I went before my Lord Mayor, and gave the same account I have here, as near as I can guess, word for word; and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you made an appointment to go with Wise that night?</p>
               <p>M. King. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you in London last, before that?</p>
               <p>M. King. I had not been in London four months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Wise ask you to go to a play with him?</p>
               <p>M. King. He did, but I did not agree to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had some fowls to carry to Dunn's wharf?</p>
               <p>M. King. He did, they were in a hamper. The porter did not bring them in as I saw. Wise hired a porter to carry them; the porter went before we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go to Dunn's wharf to see that the fowls were deliver'd?</p>
               <p>M. King. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at the Bull-Head Inn, in Whitechapel?</p>
               <p>M. King, I believe we staid there an hour and half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not drink plentifully?</p>
               <p>M. King. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not to meet at a public-house, by agreement, somewhere by Ludgate-Hill?</p>
               <p>M. King. I was to go to my place, and no where else; and not to any place along with him. I knew nothing where he was going.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear Groves and he talk about going to a public-house, after you left the tallow-chandler?</p>
               <p>M. King. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there was not a little quarrel between Wise and another person coming along?</p>
               <p>M. King. Yes, that person is my witness; upon that dispute I went up and got hold of Wise's coat; if it had not been for that, I should not have catched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Wise make str ong love to you coming up?</p>
               <p>M. King. I don't think he did; there was something with him, but not with me; he did propose to make love to me, but I refused him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not walk arm in arm?</p>
               <p>M. King. No, he clapped his arm behind me, and in a manner dragged me along, when Groves was behind with my box.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Groves?</p>
               <p>M. King. I don't know; we seemed to meet by accident.</p>
               <p>Humphry Bradshaw. On the 14th of December I was going along Cheapside, opposite Bow-church. The prisoner, Wise, ran against me, and knock'd me almost backwards; his elbow came against my stomach. This was about four in the afternoon. I recovered myself a little, and an elderly gentleman came up, and said to me, Sir, he has shoved me, and two or three more the same; then said I, I will ask him his reason for it. He had cross the way, I ran after him, and catch'd him just by the corner of Bread-Street. I took hold of the cuff of his coat, he was in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120017"></xptr> blue and white livery, laced. I asked him the reason for running against me, and several other people; he swore, and call'd me all the scoundrels and rascals he could think of, and abused me in a terrible manner. Said I, you are a very impudent fellow; I have a mind to send you to the Computer. Said he, You! I can buy 20 such scoundrels as you. Mr. Armiger came; and immediately, at the same time, came the girl; there were a number of people there; the girl catched fast hold of him, and said, Give me my box; what have you done with my box? I said, What do you mean by that? she said, he and another man had taken her box from her, and the other man had run off with it, or to that effect. Upon which I said, I was determined to take care of him; and Mr. Armiger said the same; we took him in at the Bull-Head, in Bread-Street, and sent for a constable. He abused every body in the house most grossly continually. I was obliged to go upon business and leave him there. The girl fell in fits soon after she got into the publick-house. I was before Alderman

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in liquor or not?</p>
               <p>Bradshaw. He might be a little in liquor. After the girl was in fits, that night, about half an hour after we were there, a man came in and said, Has any body here lost a box? I told him there was.</p>

            , one of the directors of the East-India company; he lives in the Temple. On the 14th of December, I had been in the city, about some business for my master. I was walking home in the afternoon, and at the corner of Bread-Street, Cheapside, I saw a concourse of people assembled together. Wise, the prisoner, was in the middle of them; and the young woman was accusing him with having given another man her box, who had run with it; and that he had proposed to see her home to Gravel-lane, Wapping, and had brought her out of her way. Upon this I walked on, as there were some gentlemen that said they would take care of him. When I came to the Rose and King's Head, on Ludgate-Hill, at the end of the entry stood Groves, with a box under his arm, in the street, looking towards St. Paul's, as if he was looking for somebody coming: upon hearing the girl's declaration, I imagined this must be the man that had her box. Upon which I asked him, if he was waiting for any body coming out of the city? He said he was. I asked him, whether he was not desired by that person to bring that box somewhere, and to wait for him? He told me, he was. I asked him if it was not a servant in livery? He said it was. Then I thought this was the man that was represented by the girl. I told him that man was in hold, that had given him the box, and that he had better go into the house, or go back with me, and give me an account of the box: upon which he went forward into the entry, and began to equivocate. Some gentlemen hearing this, desired me to follow him, and take him in charge.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it he said in answer to you?</p>
               <p>Harford. He said, I had no business with the box, or to challenge him, and he would go and carry it into the house. I went into the house after him, he laid the box on the table where the landlord was sitting, and then said, we had no farther business with him, as he was desired to leave it there, and he would go about his business. He wanted to go away. I asked the landlord and landlady, whether they knew any thing of that box being directed there, or knew any thing about it. The landlord said, I had better send for a constable. He still wanted to get to the door. A man that was drinking a pint of beer with the landlord said, We had better keep the door fast, and he put his back against it. I told him, if he was an honest man, he would stay till the constable came, and give an account of the box. He said, I had nothing to do with him, and he would go about his business. At last, he went into a little room, where the landlord had been drinking, and sat down. The landlord went for a constable, who came, then we took him away to the Bull-Head, in Bread-Street, and the constable carried the box; there we found the young woman in fits; and there was

Wise asked the constable, what authority he had to take Groves into custody; the constable took out a paper, his deputation, and gave it into Wise's hand. Wise gave it to Groves, and said to him, Do you take this Jack, I warrant you, we will cook him; or something to that purpose. They brought the young woman down, to see if that was the man; as soon as she saw Groves, she gave a squeak, and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120018"></xptr> that is the man, and fell into a fit immediately.</p>

            . On the 14th of December, in the dusk of the evening, Groves and this last witness came into my house; Groves had a box under his arm. I keep the King's Head and Old-Rose on Ludgate-Hill. Groves said to me, How do you do, landlord? I said, You have the advantage of me, I cannot recollect you. He said, he was ordered to bring that box and leave it there. The gentleman's servant said, he believed he had taken that box from a young woman in Cheapside, by the description he had heard. Then I said, it was necessary that a constable should be sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received any notice that such a box would be sent, and left at your house?</p>
               <p>Cowell. No, I had not. Groves said, he should not stay, but would go home; he had a wife and children in Petticoat-Lane. I desired an acquaintance of mine to take care of him while I went for a constable. I went and brought one, and the gentleman's servant gave him charge of the prisoner, on suspicion of running away with that box. He was taken to the Bull-Head, in Bread-Street. I went with him to see if it was as the young man had said. Groves went up to the prisoner, Wise, I found they knew one another. I enquired where the young woman was; they said, she was up stairs. in fits on a bed; we carried the box up stairs. She took the key out of her pocket and opened it, but went into a fit again. She shewed us what was in the inside, when she came to herself again. We brought her down stairs, she fixt upon Groves as the man that run away with her box.</p>
               <p>Wise's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming to town from Chigwell. This girl was coming upon the box with me; the landlord at Chigwell had a hamper of fowls, which was to be sent into Yorkshire; he told me he should be very much obliged to me if I would see them safe to the wharf. We drank two or three glasses of brandy to keep the cold out. It snowed all the day. We came to the Bull-Head, in White-Chapel; as we came, I desired the coachman to stop at a tallow-chandler's at Stratford, that I might pay him a bill, but he would not stop. Then at the inn, I asked the girl to go into the tap-room, she was very cold; I called for some hot, and sat by the fire an hour, or an hour and a half. I asked her if she would go and see a play; she agreed to go. A porter was called to take the fowls. The porter said, Madam, let me carry one of your bundles. She gave the bundle to the porter, and the box to me. I met

            , and in shaking hands with him, who should come by but Mr. Duffel, that I wanted to pay the bill to. I desired the porter to walk on. We went into a house, and had a pot of brandy hot, and after that two more; I believe, we staid in that house three hours. I found afterwards, the porter had delivered the hamper, and her bundle to the book-keeper. We agreed at that house to go to the play. I having not ate any thing, when I came into the air I could hardly walk. When we went on, the girl held by my arm sometimes, and sometimes my arm was round her waist; we came as far as the Royal-Exchange. I desired Groves to carry the box on to such a house; I mentioned no landlord's name. When we came to Cheapside, she was sometimes a little behind me; there that gentleman accused me with running against him. I did not recollect it till they told me of it the next day. There I was taken in custody, near the corner of Bread-Street, and the next day Mr. Alderman Harley committed us both.</p>
               <p>Groves's Defence.</p>
               <p>I keep a house in Petticoat-Lane, and do business in the India-House. Coming by the church to go home, I met Mr. Wise and this young woman. He said, there is a porter gone on to some wharf. Then came Mr. Duffel. Mr. Wise said, he had a bill to pay him; they went into a public-house. Mr. Duffel asked me to come in and drink. I went in. I staid drinking part of two pots of hot. Mr. Wise said to me, You may as well carry this box, as another man. I did not know,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120019"></xptr> but he was going to the other end of the town. I went home and returned. Then Mr. Duffel was gone. Mr. Wise and the girl were sitting there: we went out; he had the box under his arm; we went to Leaden-Hall-Street; then he turned round and gave me the box, and they two went arm in arm, till we came to the 'Change. I had not opened my mouth to the girl. There he let the girl go. Then I went to her. She said, Where are you going? Said I, Pray where are you going? She said, To Wapping. Then I went to Wise, and asked him where he was going. He said, Go along. I was going away. He said, take. This box, and carry it to the house the corner of St. Paul's Church-Yard. I took the box, and walked to that house, the Rose and King's Head, and waited about a quarter of an hour. I was going in, when I saw that gentleman's servant. Said he, Are you waiting for any body? I am, said I. Said he, There is a man taken up in Cheapside, and the girl is in fits. Then I went into the house, and put the box upon the table, and said, Now I believe, I may go. He said, No. I sat down about half an hour: then I said, I shall not stay here without you send for an officer. I staid a quarter of an hour after that. After that, they brought one of my Lord Mayor's officers. They took me to

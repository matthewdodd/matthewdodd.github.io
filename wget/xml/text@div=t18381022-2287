                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the morning of the 29th of September, about five o'clock, in Lewisham-street, and beard a noise on the stairs of a house, as if somebody was coming down stairs—I found the street-door open, went in, and saw the prisoner on the stairs, about half way up, standing still—he had a Bible in his hand—I went up, and asked what he did there—he said he had got there to deep a little while—I asked where he got that book from—he said he had picked it up in Park-street, yesterday—I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found a psalm-book, and a pocket-book containing du<lb></lb>plicates, a tin canister, and a tobacco-box—I asked him where he got them—he said he had picked them up also—on examining the tickets, there was the name of Elizabeth Masters on them—that led me to Eliza<lb></lb>beth Masters, who lodged at No. 68, Tothill-street—(there was nothing missing from the house I found him in)—I showed Masters the things—I examined the door-post of her room, and found a mark close to the lock of the door, where a chisel or something had been used to praise the bolt of the lock back—I found no instrument on him.</p>

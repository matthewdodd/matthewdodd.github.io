                  <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD STEPHENSON</hi>. I am a fly-driver, and live at Richmond, in Surrey, On Saturday night, the 14th of Nov., I had to take a fare from the Richmond Railway station to Teddington—in passing through the Cross Deep, near Pope's villa, by the Branch road, I was stopped by the prisoner—he asked for a toll of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I refused to give him—I asked him what it was for—he said, "For the corporation of the lord of the manor of Twickenham"—it was the second day of Kingston fair—another fly came up about the same time—that fly did not pay—I went on to Teddington, put down the gentleman, and received half-a-crown—I bad an opportunity of seeing the prisoner at the time he stopped me—there is a gas-lamp right opposite, in the middle of the Branch road, where the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was demanded—it was a little after nine o'clock—when I got back to the same place it was about ten, and about thirty yards from the place where the man bad first stopped me a man caught hold of my horse's head and stopped it, and the prisoner jumped up on the splinter bar, caught hold of my collar, and pulled me off the box down to the ground—I laid right on my back—while I was laying so, he said, "Deliver up your money, or I will blow your b—y brains out"—he did not mention any sum, but while he was saying that he put his hand into my pocket, and took out 2 shillings and the half-crown—he and the other man walked away up the Branch road—I had not seen that man before—the prisoner was in liquor both times—at the time he demanded the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I saw a horse there—it had a collar on it—no one was riding on it—I gave information at the Rich<lb></lb>mond station—I did not get the money back—a police-constable was sent with me to Twickenham, to try to find out the person—we went into the tap-room at the Horse and Groom—that was very near twelve o'clock—the prisoner was there, with his head on the table—I recognised him by his dress, and when I saw his face, I knew him again to be the same person who demanded the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the first time and took my money afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stock-broker. On Saturday, the 14th of Nov., I went by the Richmond Railway—I engaged a fly of the last wit<lb></lb>ness to take me to Teddington—when I got past Pope's villa, an altercation took place between the man and the prisoner—I had an opportunity of seeing him—he is the man—he demanded 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "toll for the corporation of the lord of the manor"—I thought he was drunk, and told him so—we refused to pay the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I got to Teddington, I paid the prosecutor half-a-crown—when the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was demanded I saw a dark horse there, with something on it—I cannot say it was a collar—it had a sack on its back, apparently strapped on—the prisoner called two or three times for <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> somebody—I did not see anybody come.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella-maker, at Brentford. I know the prisoner—he was employed by me on Kingston fair-day—he took the tolls of all cattle coming out of the fair-field, both on Friday and Satur<lb></lb>day—it was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each on all horses, all locks, and cattle coming out of the fair that were sold—they do not pay coming in—it is a fair toll—carts coming out with calves and sheep would have to pay it, but not flys—on Saturday, the 14th, I sent him to my father's at Brentford, for a horse—it was about six o'clock when he left me—I said, "William, if you do not bring my horse, bring my father's, and bring a collar, get a cloth, or something to put on his back to ride on"—he was to bring the horse to me at Kingston—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to spend for some beer on the road, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay the turnpikes—he did not bring the horse, or return at all on Saturday night—I did not see it at all till I found it on the Monday, about eleven o'clock, at the King's Head. Inn at Twickenham—it was a dark bay horse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell him what to do if the people refused to pay the tolls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I told him not to let them pass—the fair is a mile and a half from Pope's Villa—I did not station people at Pope's Villa to take the tolls—we have no control over them after they have got out of the town—the nearest way from Brentford to Kingston is to pass by Pope's Villa.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Charles Meeking and another, drapers, at 62, Holborn-hill. I was in the shop on Saturday afternoon, 28th June—all the other shopmen were there—the prisoner came about half-past 2 o'clock—she spoke in English, so that I understood her, and she appeared to understand me with difficulty—she asked to look at some French cambric—she looked at several pieces—I told her the prices of different articles—she bought six yards at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—she looked at some French cambric handkerchiefs—she bought half-a-dozen at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—she looked at some gentlemen's silk pocket-handkerchiefs—she bought six at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 111/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and one at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she did not pay for these articles, but told me to send them to No. 15, Strand, to Mrs. Duport—they were to be paid for on delivery—I sent them by our porter—the porter brought back the parcel; he could not find the person—the prisoner was in our shop a quarter of an hour altogether—I did not miss anything after the prisoner was gone—I have since been shown some articles which—I believe to be my master's property—here are six cambric handkerchiefs, one yard and a quarter of French cambric, and one yard and three-quarters of French cambric, and two silk handkerchiefs at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

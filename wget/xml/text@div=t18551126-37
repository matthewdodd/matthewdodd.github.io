                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, and live at No. 17, Hertford-place, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. The prisoner worked for me for nine months—he had left me about three weeks, for drunkenness—being in my service, he was well acquainted with my premises—on 21st Oct. I left my house, about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock at night—before I went out I fas<lb></lb>tened up all my premises, and left two gas lights burning, one in the parlour, and one near the staircase door—my wife left with me—I fastened the front door when I got outside—I had fastened the staircase door before I went out, and put the key on the parlour mantelpiece—I returned about 10 o'clock, or a few minutes after—I opened my front door, and found all my back premises open—there was a passage door and gates—they were both open, and the staircase door was open, and the key in it—I went up stairs, and found about fourteen marks of something which had been trying to force open my bedroom door, which was double locked—the panel of the door was broken, and a portion of it broken out—I went into the kitchen, which is up stairs, and found the curtain torn down, the window open, and marks of feet on the end of the sofa, as though somebody had been on it—I imagine the person must have got in by getting into ray back yard, on to a shed, and to a small office between the privy and the passage, and they would then enter my passage—when I went out, the passage door was closed—I cannot say whether it was latched.</p>

               <p>to 10 o'clock when I left them in the public house—it would not take me more than a minute, or a minute and a half, to get from the Black Bull to Mr. Batey's—I did not pass Mr. Batey's—I passed through a court at the side of Mr. Batey's, and I heard the hue and cry of "Stop thief!"—the neighbours were saying that it was a man came through an empty house—I heard several say that—the street was all in alarm—I was on my way home—it was not more than a minute from the time I left the Black Bull—I came straight along Haggerstone, and through the court—I had known the prisoner from his bringing things to my house from Mr. Batey's—the next morning I went into Haggerstone, and heard that Mr. Batey's house had been broken into, but I did not hear who it was till the middle of the week—I heard that it was a young man that used to live at Mr. Batey's—I heard it on the Tuesday, and that he was to be brought up on the Monday following at the police court—I went there, but was prevented by Mr. Batey from going in to give my evidence—I was going into the door when I found he had not had his hearing—I said, "I saw that young man, I do not think it could be him from what I saw of him "—Mr. Batey put up his arm and said, "Keep that woman back"—that was to me—the officer was letting them in at the gate at the time—I believe it was Mr. Charles Batey told the officer to keep me back—I have been here three days to give evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live fourteen doors from the Black Bull public house; my husband is a shoe manufacturer. Mr. Batey's house is very nearly facing us—I recollect somebody got into his house on the night of the 21st—I went to the Black Bull that night for my supper beer—when I got there it was 25 minutes before 10 o'clock exactly—I know the time—I had been asleep—I got up, and put my bonnet on—I have a clock in my house—when I awoke I looked at it—it was half past 9 o'clock—I put my bonnet on, and went directly to the Black Bull—when I went there I looked at the clock, and it was 25 minutes to 10 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there, and spoke to him—Franklin was with him—I did not notice any other person—when I had got my supper beer I left—I did not stop any time—I left the two together there at the bar—I did not hear till the next morning that somebody had got into Mr. Batey's house—I knew the prisoner before, by his bringing coals, and other things, from Mr. Batey's to my house when I had them—I did not ask him any questions about his family—when I heard of this on the Monday, I mentioned to a neighbour facing, that the prisoner was at the Black Bull—no one asked me to come here—I did not go to the police court—I came here to-day of my own accord—I knew the prisoner was to take his trial—I have been here three days—I have no interest in giving evidence, but telling the truth.</p>

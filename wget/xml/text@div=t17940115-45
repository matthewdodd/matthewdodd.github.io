             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Wainbridge, in Cornwall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you an officer in the excise there on the 20th of June last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in that part? -  About two years and a half at Wainbridge, or near to that.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day you had information, I believe, of a cutter being on the coast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you? - Mr. Haynes, an officer of Port Isaac.</p>
               <p>Q. An officer of the excise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Hawkey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you set out for the coast? - About ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way did you see any body that you knew? - I saw a person that Mr. Haynes told me to be Mr. Hawkey.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him at that time? - This happened in the night; I tried to be undiscovered to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the Beech what did you observe? - Five horses loaded with anchors farther out. The Beech is a large place. There were other horses nearer the Sea, these five horses we attempted to seize.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way were they loaded with anchors? - The anchors had ropes so fastened on each side of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you attempted to seize these five horses, what happened then? - Mr. Haynes ordered one of them, a man that he knew, one Skiller, to drive them on; he said he should wait for his copartners; with that they gave a shouting. We were together at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there? - I suppose there must be fifty at least, a large number of men and horses. Then they began to throw stones at us, one of these, a large stone, struck me on the side of the head, and nearly fetched me off my horse, it broke my head; we then rode off, we were obliged to turn about to the right, and they kept throwing stones all the while till we got out of their reach on the top of the hill, where we saw the boat plying to and fro from the cutter; as soon as they came in they gave three shouts; we stayed about an hour; I do not immediately recollect to a few minutes, watching the cutter, to see if any single horse should come up, and we be able to seize them; in the mean while two persons came creeping up to where I was, and I thought it was proper then to ride off, and I rode off; we then rode off to about five hundred yards; we saw a quantity of men coming down a field, we thought they were running after us; instantly, there came a cloud of stones, such as they cover the houses with, flat tiles, a stony slate. I made a little longer turn than Mr. Haynes, I was nearly caught by one of these people; but by one means or another, I escaped; the stones were throwing all this time; we then got off to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150119"></xptr>distance of two miles for this place, I don't say exactly to a few yards, where we lay in a ditch for the course of an hour, till at length we saw five and twenty horses come by; I told twenty-five horses, to the best of my knowledge and belief; and we stayed till they were gone past us, we thought it madness to make a seizure among twenty-five.</p>
               <p>

            Were they laden? - Yes, with anchors, and men on them; as soon as they were gone by, we thought it proper to go a little nearer, to see where they would deposit the goods. As soon as we came to the distance of about five hundred yards, I don't know exactly to the number of yards, I imagine that distance. We saw a quantity of persons coming back and horses not laden, galloping back towards the wreck; we tried to make our escape, by some accident, Mr. Haynes's hat slew off, consequently, he was discovered. I, at this time, got into a ditch to conceal myself, because they should not see me; and I saw, I suppose, ten or a dozen of these persons riding after Mr. Haynes, saying, blow his brains out, riding as fast as they could after him; they followed him, and I saw no more of Mr. Haynes; then I laid in that ditch for about it might be half an hour, or something thereabouts; then I thought the road all clear of smugglers; I got out, and went a little way on the road after the smugglers still, further than where Mr. Haynes and me were before, expecting to see where they had dropped the goods. In the mean while, Mr. Hawkey, the person at the bar, and some other person came galloping on the road from the beech; these two persons had no goods with them; as soon as I saw these two persons, my idea was, that it was to look out where the officers were. I went into a neighbouring field adjoining the lane, expecting to get out of their way, that I would not be discovered; Mr. Hawkey, by some means or other, saw me go in, and followed me into a ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you out of the road? - I went out of the road as soon as I saw these persons, they followed me out of the main road into the field, and into a ditch. I ran into the ditch as soon as I saw them follow me; as soon as Mr. Hawkey came up, he had a pistol in his hand, saying, that he would do something, blow my brains out, or something to that purpose; so I desired him to spare my life, then he immediately put up his pistol again into his left-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you when he presented his pistol to you, and threatened you, did he give you any reason for threatening you? - He said, he would teach me to look after brandy, that was the expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him before he pulled his pistol out? - I was trying to conceal myself in the ditch. I did not see him pull the pistol out, he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. After he put up his pistol, what did he do? - With a bludgeon that he had in his hand, he struck at me, but he missed me in the ditch.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t17940115-45-person666">

                  </persName>
            Describe what sort of a bludgeon that was? - It was a large club, such as smugglers carry about, three or four feet long; a common bludgeon, that they ride with.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a stump, or was it a whip? - No, it was a club, a large stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Larger at one end than at the other? - No, it was a large thick stick, whether it was as big as my arm I cannot say, I had it not in my hand; the next blow he struck me on the head, with this same stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your head covered at that time? - I had my hat on, and my handkerchief under it. That blow almost deprived me of my senses, it was a very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150120"></xptr>severe blow, it was the severest I received; the first blow I did not receive, he sitting on his horse, he did not get off his horse at all, nor did the other person; I received the second blow after I came out of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to come out of the ditch? - Mr. Hawkey ordered me out of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed after this second blow? - Then he ordered me back into the road from whence I came, he struck me several blows in the way, but I got under my horse's neck to save myself, after receiving such a violent blow; as he was on his horse he could not come at me so well, I received one on my left arm, I was lamed in it, but as it was my left arm it did not hinder my writing, but I felt the effects for some weeks, at least I was able to hold my book on it, there was no great strain, but I felt it very severely for about three weeks, I did not decline my business on account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What past in the road? - He then struck me again, and ordered me on my horse, I was off my horse all this while.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man? - He came up and struck me also, but I did not know that person, the other person did not strike me in the road, he struck me in the field, before I came into the road; as soon as I got up on my horse he told me which way to go, towards the beech.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in a contrary direction to where the anchors were carried up? - It was; as soon as I got through the gate I turned about, and said I should find out his name, I said that to Mr. Hawkey; he then said my name is not Knapman, wishing he had Mr. Haynes, the other officer that was with me, that he should share the same fate, that was the expression as near as I can recollect; I then rode off towards the beech, I saw no more of Mr. Hawkey that day; I rode then to Port Isaac, from that place, and waited at Port Isaac till Mr. Haynes came, which I suppose was an hour or two, I cannot be positive to half an hour, to consult about the business, what we were to do in this matter, the next day I saw Mr. Hawkey at Wainbridge, there was a fair there that day, Mr. Newelling the supervisor was with me, I said to Mr. Newelling, there is the man that used me so ill yesterday, and Newelling and I went to look for him, we did not see him after that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the man? - I am confident, I had seen him before, I have not the least doubt in my mind, I am as confident of it as I stand here, because it was by day-light that this circumstance happened.</p>
               <p>Court. About what time was it this happened? - It was between three and four in the morning, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Was it light? - It was light the whole night, but it was quite day-light, as light as it is here now. As soon as we had consulted at Port Isaac what to do, I set off to Bodwin, to acquaint my supervisor of the business, he was not at home, there was a messenger dispatched for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go afterwards in pursuit of the cargo? - Yes, Mr. Newelling and myself and five others; I think it was about six or seven in all went to the place where I supposed they had dropped the goods, we then found four anchors, and at some little distance we found eleven more.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gallons did you find on this occasion? - Mr. Newelling took the account.</p>
               <p>Q. In short you made the seizure? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine what sort of spirits they were? - I left my supervisor to examine what it was, my supervisor thought it prudent to secure these fifteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150121"></xptr>anchors; I was then dispatched to Padstow for some soldiers, I rode off immediately to Padstow, while I was at Padstow I don't know what happened.</p>
               <p>Q. When the soldiers came was there any firing that happened? - While I was away I saw nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time afterward see Hawkey? - Yes, I saw him not very soon after, five or six months it may be for what I know; at Saintaff, we were talking the business over, I was saying what was their idea for trying to surround us, I was mentioning of it to the people, Hawkey was by, he said they intended the putting us on board the ship, and carrying us to Guernsey, he said it was very fortunate we got off, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he apprehended? - I don't know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you personally informed your supervisor immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. After all this story you have been telling us, I would ask you this one qestion, all this time at the beech did you see Mr. Hawkey at all? - I did not see him at the beech, he was not at the beech at this time, that I know of.</p>

            Then all that passed was in his absence as far as you know; this took up a considerable time, and you have told us the different stages of it; you was two miles from the beech? - It must be, from the distance of ground.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you saw some men with horses loaded, and there you did not see Mr. Hawkey? - He might be there, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. I am satisfied with your answer you did not see him. The first time you see Mr. Hawkey, was when all this was done, and he was coming into his own field? - It was not his own field, it belongs to the parish of St. Hugh; the hedge parted the two parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where he lived I believe, and he was going towards his own house, and not in a direction from his own house to the beech? - He was coming from the beech, whether he was going towards his own house I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from his own house? - I suppose it must be three miles I believe, I don't know exactly the distance.</p>
               <p>Q. During this whole transaction did you see Mr. Hawkey with any of these people, that you have been talking about? - I did not with the first persons with anchors, nor with those persons on the beech.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Hawkey, he is a farmer there, he is not a smuggler? - I suppose him to be a smuggler.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore of course you know to constitute this offence with which Mr. Hawkey is charged with, you must make it part of the smuggling transaction, that you have told us of? - He told me he would teach me to look after brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to separate the assault from the smuggling? - I thought Mr. Hawkey to be the master of them, which I believe he really was.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you believe so? - I heard so from a number of different persons.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you was so long before you indicted him, it was not because you could not take him out of his house?</p>
               <p>Court. It does not depend on him, when an offence against this act of parliament is indicted? - I can tell that from experience.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. However in point of fact, it was that distance of time? - What time?</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you the next day when you saw him? - The supervisor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any attempt to take him there, he was there alone? - I passed him in the street, and I said to the super<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150122"></xptr>visor, that is the person that used me so ill, yesterday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you then to take hold of him? - I did not know the rules and orders of the business, afterwards Mr. Newelling and me went to look after him, and we did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. This transaction between you and Mr. Hawkey took place not only two miles from the place, but likewise half an hour after the place was clear of smugglers? - It might be half an hour, I lay in the ditch, I expected all the men were by at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when Mr. Hawkey and the other came up, they see you concealed in a ditch? - No, they saw me in the road, I got out of the road on purpose to avoid being seen.</p>
               <p>Q. You endeavoured to escape them, and they followed you, endeavouring to hide yourself, they found you in the ditch, and then Mr. Hawkey took a pistol and told you to come out? - He had it in his hand when I saw him, I thought myself in danger, and so I ran away as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you said to him spare my life, I am doing no mischief, he put up his pistol immediately? - He did into his left hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear what Mr. Hawkey's expressions were? - It was something about blowing out my brains, and he would teach me to look after brandy.</p>

            Whether he said these words you do not know or do you know? - I do not know what he said besides, I don't know because he was talking as he came on.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any difficulty about his person? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And he must equally know that it must be impossible to hide himself from you, it being so light? - My idea told me that he supposed I did not know him, because I had never seen him before, that was my idea of the business.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an officer of the excise, at Port Isaac, was you in company with Knapman, on the 20th or 21st of December? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in consequence of some information, in company with Mr. Knapman? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was going down towards the beech did you meet any body? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who? - Mr. Hawkey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Hawkey's person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you met him on the road, as you was going down to the beech? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was coming from the beech? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down to the beech what passed under your immediate observation? - As I was going down to the beech there were several horses.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had seen Mr. Hawkey on the road whereabouts was that, as to its distance from the beech? - I suppose it might be about two miles, or two miles and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night? - About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And he past on, and you went on towards the beech, when you came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150123"></xptr>the beech what was doing? - We found several horses loaded with anchors, and a multitude of people there.</p>
               <p>Q. They were loading the horses with anchors at that time? - Yes, when we came among them, we saw five horses stood out from among the rest, and I knew the man Skiller that was with them, I called him, and told him to drive them on, but I am informed since that he was not there, but he answered to that name when I called him, I ordered him to drive the horses on, the answer he gave me was, that he waited for his copartners.</p>
               <p>Q. What said you, or did you after this? - I struck the horses with my stick, in order to drive the horses on, I thought there were so many behind that we should have no mercy; the other party see us, and perceived who we were, and they directly began to give a cheer, and after that the stones played about us, and we fled for our lives, we rode off to escape for our lives.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go before you stopped? - I suppose about five hundred yards, out of the way of the stones, we went up towards Port Isaac, where I resided, when we got up on the higher ground we perceived a vessel stood at anchor, and a boat was going to and fro, I suppose we might stay there for half an hour, or nearly an hour; while we were there we saw two men above us, in a high field, looking over a hedge, they were higher than we were by twenty yards, and we thought if they threw stones from there we should be knocked of the head, we immediately returned away, towards Port Isaac, on our return I makes a motion for Knapman, that we would see who them men were, we had not seen them before, then we opened the gate, Knapman did, and I was going to ride into the field, where these men were, when we opened the gate we perceived, I suppose, nearly a score, were on the top of the field, which was above us still, as soon as they saw me they made directly for us, as fast as they could, my partner was off his horse, I was not, I said get up, get up, we must be off again, and they were very near catching us, being above us; however we got off, and they followed us with stones to a great distance, the stones might injure the horse, but they did not injure me, we were afraid of going into the town, least the mob should follow us, therefore we went into the country about two miles off, we went and secured ourselves in a place where we should not be discovered, waiting there, we saw about twenty-five horses going along, all loaded; we lay still for a little time, till they passed us, after we made an observation that we would see when the roads led one way and another, we would see whether they would disperse, that we might follow a little party, and stand a chance of taking them, we thought also that we might stand a chance of seeing where they might deposit it; we went for about, I believe, twenty or thirty, or forty yards, I cannot tell how far, before we discovered several men coming against us.</p>
               <p>Q. Not loaded? - They were not, Knapman, he returned back and he said, here they be coming, he rides back.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you two separated? - Yes, I endeavoured to ride back too, I thought if we both were not able to stand them, one was not; in riding back the wind blew against me, my hat flew off, it was a round hat, and when it was on, it more concealed me from their observation; I dismounted my horse and got off and picked my hat up again, in the mean time while they were nearly on me, however when I got through the gate they had the same difficulty of getting through the gate as I had, I got the advantage of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you recovered your horse and got your feet? - They then followed me and swore that they would knock me down, and some of them said they would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150124"></xptr>blow my brains out, these expressions prevailed among them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away then? - I was riding for my life all the while, there were ten or a dozen, I suppose pursuing me, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you had missed Mr. Knapman before this? - I never saw him after my hat blew off, for about two hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see him again? - I suppose it was four or five o'clock, thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him in what situation was Knapman then, what appearance had he? - He had the appearance of being much frightened, and beat, I could not see any wound, but he said that he was much beat, I cannot say any more, my observations were such.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went together to the supervisor? - We went home, I being much frightened, my brother officer he went to the supervisor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met Hawkey on that night on the road had you any doubt of his person then? - Yes, I had, when I met him I thought there was some business doing on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him did you know him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I only ask you whether you have any doubt about his person? - No, I had no doubt of him then.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you frequently seen him before? - O,yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When you came where the goods were deposited did you find any arms? - We found goods in three separate places.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you together when you found the goods? - We found arms in the last place, there was a fowling-piece, and what they call a swivil, a piece that they take on board, it is larger than a blunderbuss, it had a thing to run into a part of the vessel, to keep it steady, I tried it, and found it was very heavy loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way? - I cannot say, the soldiers fired it off when we went to get carriages to take the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear loaded? - It was very heavy loaded, I tried it with the ramrod.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Knapman able to go about his business as usual? - We reside eight miles apart, therefore we do not sometimes see one another for six or seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We are to understand from your evidence that the first time you saw Mr. Hawkey was on the road that night, how far was it you saw him from the beech? - About two miles, or two miles and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe during the whole business, until you saw him and another person, when you was in the ditch you never saw him at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the time that you met him in the road till the time Mr. Knapman complained of, you never saw him at all? - Never.</p>

On Wednesday, the 19th of March, I went out about two o'clock in the afternoon, leaving my wife in the house - she is not here - I was sent for about five o'clock, and found my wife at home - I found the house had been opened, and my clothes taken away - the back-door was opened and the bed-room - whether my wife fastened the house up when she went out, I cannot tell - I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had seen the coat a day or two before in my box - I had seen the silk handkerchief on the Sunday - the trowsers I had not worn for several weeks - I cannot say they were all in the house that day - I have every reason to believe they were - I had not seen them for a day or two, as the chest was locked up - the prisoner is my son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you state positively that I took them? A. No, I did not see him take them.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Warren place, Camden-Town. On the 19th of March, the prisoner brought a coat and trowsers wrapped in a handkerchief - I knew him before - he pawned them for 5s. in the name of John Horniblew, about four o'clock in the afternoon - he said they belonged to his father, who had sent him to pawn them - I did not know his name was not John - I recollect his coming to our shop about three times before - I am quite certain of him.</p>

             (police-constable S 118). I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday evening, the 23d of March, by his father's orders - he said he had made it all right with his father.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY HORNIBLEW re-examined. I know these things to be mine - I have had the coat about six months - I did not give him directions to pawn them - the trowsers are mine - I know the handkerchief by a hole in it - my son has not lived with me for some time - he has been a good deal out of employ - I did not turn him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I sat in-doors, my father and mother were eating their meals; they used to see me sit there, and not give me a mouthful; and so, when he went out, my mother said, "You had better take these things and go and pawn them - and that will learn your father to give you victuals another time."</p>
               <p>ANTHONY HORNIBLEW re-examined. I did not turn him out of doors - I do not recollect his stating this before the magistrate - my wife had nothing to do with it - she went out after I did, and while she was gone it was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was but a few months ago that his wife took the things and pawned them, and kept away from him for three months - he did not exactly turn me out, but he said I should not come into his house - there are seven brothers of us, and two girls, and he hates me the worst of the lot - he told me to go and get my living where I could - he has told everybody not to come near me.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY HORNIBLEW. My present wife is not his mother - it is all false; I have half kept him for months, and have sent him things to the prison, and this morning, I gave him all the money I had but 1s. - I am sorry I am obliged to appear here.</p>

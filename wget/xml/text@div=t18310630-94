               <p>THOMAS CAREY. I am a constable. I saw the prisoner run past my shop door in Bell-yard; he was stopped forty yards higher up, and given to me - this is the handkerchief; I have made inquiries and I believe this is his first offence.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman cannot swear I took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

             sworn. - On the 2d of November, I was in a boat with Hill, the Trinity-officer, at some distance from the Bushy-park; I noticed some lumpers coming from on board the Bushy-park, among whom was the prisoner; they called for a sculler, and Smith rowed along side the lighter, and Hill jumped out of the boat into the lighter and laid hold of Dalton, and close by him I saw this bag of sugar lying, close to Dalton, on the deck of the lighter, and Hill called out, he had dropped the bag, and I took him and the bag into my possession; it was close by his foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it drop from any body else? - A. I believe not, I don't know; Dalton denied it before the Magistrate; it contains about nine pounds of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other lumpers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I understand you, that he was in the boat before you saw the bag? - A. Hill called out that he had dropped the bag, I looked over and saw the bag.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There were a great number of lumpers on board the lighter? - A. There were four of five.</p>
               <p>Q. He was so near the edge of the lighter, that he might have thrown it into the water? - A. If I had not prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you jumped into the lighter, he had time to throw it over-board? - A. Yes, if he had known who we were.</p>

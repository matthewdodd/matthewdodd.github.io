On the 12th of August I saw the prisoner at his shop window; she then came in, and asked the price of a piece of bacon - I said 61/2d. per 1b.; she said, "Can't you take 6d.?" and I said No - I was going to weigh it, and she said, "Don't weigh that, weigh this other piece - can you take 6d. for that;" I said No - she said, "I'll wait till your master comes down" I went to cut a piece of cheese, and cut my finger - while my attention was engaged with that I saw her going out of the shop with a piece of bacon under her arm; I pursued her, and took her with it - she said she had bought it up yonder, but I knew it to be my master's, and it had been in the shop while she was there; I found two pieces of bacon in her lap, and one under her arm.</p>

             I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found three pieces of bacon on her - she said she had paid the boy 1s. - he denied it; in going along she said a gossip of her's had given her two pieces, and she had bought the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's son, and am nine years old—I live with my father and sister at 52, Tate Street, St. George's—one Saturday night, my father came home when I was in bed—my sister was out at place, and my father was in a long while before her—my father was drunk, and had a few words with my mother, he gave her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and wanted her to get some tea, she said she could not get him any, and he turned her down stairs; she was going down stairs; she had hold of the banister, and he knocked her in the back of the ear, and pulled her by the hair of her head—he was standing on the stairs—when he got up stairs, he hit her on the forehead with his fist, and then he put his two hands round her throat, and she could not speak—I was in bed crying—he held her by the throat about half a minute, and then he let go, and she went down stairs halloaing out "Oh my head.",?</p>

I am seventeen years old, and am the sister of the last witness—on 1st June, I came home at 11 o'clock at night—I did not go up stairs; I opened the door, and saw my father on the stairs, very drunk, dragging my mother up stairs by her hair—I said "Father, what are you doing?" and with that he let go, and she came down stairs—a woman up stairs then came in, and asked her up into her room, and my father stopped up stairs in his own room—I went up to him; he was sitting down; he asked me where my mother was—I did not tell him; I told him I did not know—I afterwards saw my mother sitting on the side of the bed in the woman's room, vomiting—she was put to bed in that room, and re<lb></lb>mained there till her death, on Thursday morning, at about 9.10—I was not with her up to her death; I was occupied at my place—her Christian name was Charlotte—she was not sickly, or in bad health before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 23, Colet Place, Commercial Road—on 2nd June, between 6 and 7 o'clock, p.m., I was called to the deceased and found her unconscious, comatose—I found no external marks of violence—I attended her up to her death on Thursday—I told the prisoner he had killed his wife; he seemed very much put about, and said he would give himself up—she remained comatose till her death—vomiting is a symptom of injury to the brain—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found on the back of the head an external bruise, between the skin and the <hi rend="italic">occipital bone,</hi> and a smaller bruise behind the temple, on the left side of the head—on opening the head I found a quantity of coagulated blood, clotted, and the menbranes very much congested and inflamed; the brain was very much congested and the vessels full of blood—the clot of blood was all over the brain, not more in one place than another—the menbranes which cover the brain were congested and the vessels filled with blood; there were no other external bruises with the exception of a small bruise on the right thigh, about the size of a half-crown—I found the left lung quite adherent to the wall of the chest from old pleurisy, and the right quite congested, and there was matter in it; the right lung was healthy—I found fluid in the pericardium and a great deal of fat on the outside of the heart on the right side—I found coagulated blood in the left cavity of the heart—the spleen was very congested and easily broken, I could hardly take it out, it broke in my hand—I found fat in the kidneys—my opinion is that the woman</p>

               <p>died from the injuries she received, and in the state I found the heart lungs and kidneys, and there being fatty disease of the heart, she was more likely to die from a slight injury—the external marks on the head, indicative of blows, were sufficient to produce the extravasation which resulted in death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the kidneys were of less consequence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the fat in the kidneys was of great consequence—she was not a healthy woman—from the fat on the heart and in the kidneys there would be likely to be fat in the arteries, and they would be more liable to rupture—unless there had been an injury there was nothing to account for immediate death—the two bruises on the head were between the skin and the skull—there was no mark externally, it was on the pericranium, the upper surface of the integument covering the head—there was nothing to show that the skin had been cut, or to ruffle the skin—it was only as if it had come down on a soft substance, contused the woman's head; bumping on the stairs for instance would cause it.</p>

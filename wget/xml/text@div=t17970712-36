             sworn. - On the 10th of June, I met the prisoner upon Saffron-hill; she asked me to give her something to drink, she intreated me very hard, and took me up a passage, and said we could get some down there; I went merely with intent to get something to drink, I thought it was a public-house, till I found myself mistaken; it was between eleven and twelve at night; I put my hand in my pocket, and took out a guinea and a shilling, and she snatched it out of my hand and knocked down the candle; I asked her what she did that for, she said, what was that to me; and there was a man in a smock-frock, the whispered to him to get away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You fly you went merely to give her something to drink; will you swear that? - A. Yes.</p>

             M'CARTHY sworn. - I am a watchman: I heard the watch called, and I went upon the call, and met a man in a smock-frock, he told me I was not wanted; the prosecutor called again, I went, and he gave me charge of the prisoner; they had no light, and she said, she had no money but sixpence; I took her to the watch-house, and searched her, but found nothing upon her but a sixpence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a petition, stating, that she had been early seduced from the paths of virtue, deserted by her seducer and her friends; that she was under the necessity of seeking a precarious subsistence; that on the 9th of June, she met the prosecutor; that he asked her to take a glass; that she accepted his polite offer; that he asked leave to see her home; that he took no liberty whatever with her; that suddenly rising, he said, you b-h,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120029"></xptr>I gave you a guinea and one shilling instead of two shillings that I meant to give you; that she then received a violent blow from him, begged he would not murder her, and said, if he had lost such a sum it must be upon the ground; that during her cries the watchman interfered, that she readily went with him, and that, during her walk, though she was under the protection of the watchman, he kicked and beat her violently; that he searched her and found nothing; that she was, notwithstanding, committed, and, however innocent, was now an humble suppliant at the bar of that honourable Court, for a crime that she never was, or could be, guilty of; that she was innocent of the charge as well as of seeing any man in a smock-frock; that she solemnly afferrs, that no man entered the room, except the watchman, during her stay; further, that the prosecutor begged her to give him a guinea to shew his wife, and a week should not go over her head without its being madeup; that she throws herself upon the mercy of the Court, whose mercy and benevolent compassion she humbly implores; and, as the only atonement for a life-ill-spent, she means to throw herself at the feet of her deserted friends for pardon and protection.</p>

               <p>Archer. It was the 25th of May I turned her out of my Apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing about that Time?</p>
               <p>Archer. I had a Trunk stood in my Room, and I found my Trunk broke open the 25th of May; I went before Justice De Veil, and got a Warrant, and searched her Trunk, and found the Gold Ring, a Silver Girdle-buckle, one Yard of Holland, two Yards of Lace, a Cap, a Pair of Stockings, some yellow Silk, four or five Pair of white Stockings, about an Ounce of Silk, and a Frock; all these were in the Trunk, the Sheets were not, my Lord; the Sheets she had made off, I got this Silk I found upon her, and this Pair of Stockings, and this is my Callico she had made into a Frock for her Child. She had broke open the Box three or four Months before; I being a Servant, she got to the Constable before me, and got her Discharge; and Yesterday was three Weeks I got a Warrant and took her up; I found this the 26th of May, I found that Frock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a Frock when you lost it?</p>

            , my Lord, it was in loose Callico, the Prisoner had wore it two or three Months before I knew any thing of the Matter - This she had left in the Trunk. About March last I went to take out something I wanted, which was a Piece of Holland;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050034"></xptr> when I went to put the Key into the Trunk, I said I was hurt. She goes by several Names.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live?</p>
               <p>Archer. I lived with Mr South, a Brewer; the Room she was in was my Room, that I had let to her for ten Months.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you observe your Trunk was first broke open?</p>
               <p>Archer. As near as I can remember, it was in March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any Thing upon the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Archer. I found the Ring upon her in her Box in my Room, this Frock, this Silk, and Stockings; which, when I claimed, she said they were her Husband's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss the Callico?</p>
               <p>Archer. It was the 25th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to take her up before November ? You say you did not take her up again till November.</p>
               <p>Archer. No, my Lord, by reason I was in Place, and could not have Time to attend such a troublesome Affair.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she been committed?</p>
               <p>Archer. I think the 14th of November.</p>
               <p>Q to the Prisoner. Would you have me ask the Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, she says she found that in the Room in my Box; my Lord, I had no Box there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Archer. The Box that you found the Things in, was it the Prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Archer. She borrowed it of one Mary - .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that Person might not put the Things in?</p>
               <p>Archer. My Lord, if she can prove that; my Lord, when the Constable was there, she threatened me, and asked how I dared to take her Box, and threatened to hit me a Slap in the Face.</p>

The Prisoner told my Wife, that she was a Wet-nurse, that her Husband had took the Child she had put to nurse out, and would not let her know where it was.

Her Husband comes the next Morning, and asked if the Prisoner was come there, and said, when she comes, I must beg of you to stop her, because I have got three or four Persons to swear a Robbery against her; he said, a d - d B - h, if I can get her hanged or transported, she cannot trouble me any more.</p>

The next Morning I goes into my Father's Room to lock the Door where my Mother lay; when she came down Stairs, she desired me to lock her Door, next Door to her's.

               <p>Q. Well, what past then?</p>
               <p>Welch. He called her B - h, &amp;c. she said he had taken away her child, and if he would tell her where it was, and allow her 4 s. a Week, she would not trouble him; he said she had cost him 30 l. within these three Years; he took away all the Furniture of her Room for three Weeks; he said he had only entailed a Chamber-pot upon her, or some such Expression; she owned she had about 18 l. of his Money within two Years, with Apothecary's Bills, and Illness: she appealed to my Wife, my Wife said that she had cost me twice as much in half the Time. So he went home with her about a 11 o'Clock, yesterday was three Weeks; the next Morning he asked if she was come there, I said no, so he said when she came, he desired I would stop her; he said if he could but hang her or transport her, he should get rid of her, so I desired that he would get out of the House, we did not desire such Company. It has cost me near 3 l. purely to serve the Woman, as we believe it to be a Prosecution set on Foot by the Malice and Wickedness of her Husband.</p>
               <p>The Court expressed the utmost Indignation against the inhuman Wretch of a Husband, for his base Conduct, as attested by two very credible Witnesses, and most honourably <rs id="t17461205-24-verdict108" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t17461205-24-verdict108" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"></interp>
               acquitted
            </rs> the Prisoner: and proposed ( without being asked) to grant her a Copy of her Indictment, that might be an effectual Security against any such like Proceedings of her wicked Husband; and if she thought sit to be a Scourge to those who have fallen in with his base Advice. The Court told the Prisoner they hoped she would make a prudent Use of it, but she might sue them for a Conspiracy or Perjury.</p>

                  </hi>. On 11th Dec. I was in the Mile-end-road, about a quarter-past three in the afternoon—I saw the two prisoners in company, three doors from Muldarry's shop—I saw Smith give to Fitz<lb></lb>gerald a piece of white paper, and then Smith went into Muldarry's shop, and Fitzgerald walked slowly on—in a few minutes Smith came out and joined Fitzgerald, and they went on together towards Bow, in the direc<lb></lb>tion of the White Swan—I saw them brought back by the policeman.</p>

Smith came for a cigar—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him change, and put the half-crown in the till; there was no other there—he asked me the way to Whitechapel, and I directed him, but he went in an opposite direction—I then went to the till, and found the half-crown was bad—I went to a neighbour and gave information—I pointed out Smith, who was then going towards the White Swan—I gave the bad half-crown to the policeman.</p>

On 11th Dec, from information, I went on towards the White Swan with another officer—as I was going I saw the prisoners in company—Fitzgerald caught sight of me and turned round and left Smith, and went into the White Swan—I went in after him, and saw him sitting in front of the bar, between two other men—he called for a pint of porter—I told him he must come out with me, there was a person wished to see him—when I came out I found Smith in custody of my brother officer—we went towards a stonemason's yard—I and Fitzgerald went first—when we left the yard I turned round and saw Smith put his right hand in his right-hand trowsers pocket, and thrust it down his leg, and immediately something fell down like metal—it was picked up—I went on with Fitzgerald to the station—I found on him 3 shillings, 5 sixpences, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper money, all good, half an ounce of tobacco, and some sweet stuff—I received this half-crown from Mrs. Muldarry.</p>

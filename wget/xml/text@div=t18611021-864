I am the son of Samuel Walker, an ornamental painter, of 32, Sale-street, Bethnal-green—my mother keeps the shop—on 14th September, about half-past 10 or 11 o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—he tendered a sixpence—I gave him the change and he went away—I tried it with my teeth, thought it was good, and put it in the till, where there was only copper—my mother came into the shop about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and I went to bed—she gave me a sixpence next morning, which I recognised as the one the prisoner had given me—on 2d October my mother called me into the shop, and I saw the prisoner there—I said, "Are not you the same man who passed the sixpence on me before?"—he said, "Why, I <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi>, seen you before"—I said, "If you have not seen me before, I have seen you"—my mother showed me a sixpence, and said, "I have taken another sixpence like you took two or three Saturdays ago"—the prisoner said nothing to that—I went over to the beer-shop to my father, but he was not there, he I brought a constable back with me, and he was given in custody.</p>

I am the mother of the last witness—I came home about a quarter past 11 on this night—my son was in the shop—he went to bed, and I afterwards found one sixpence in the till—there were two mil brown marks under the crown, which may have worn off by now—it in bad, and I put it away, thinking the person might come back again—no one but me served in the shop that night after my son went to bed—I took the sixpence out and was going to give change, but I found it out—on 2d October, about half-past 10 or 11 o'clock, the prisoner came fort a penny<lb></lb>worth of Dutch cheese—he gave me a bad sixpence—I said, "Have you got any more like this about you I"—he said, "I do not know what you mean"—I said, "It is a bad one"—he said, "I got change for a two shilling-piece in a public-house"—I said, "I cannot let you go till I fetch my husband"—I called my son, who said, "Mother, what is the matter?"—I said, "I have taken another sixpence like you took two or three Saturdays ago; go for your father"—he looked at the prisoner, who said, "Why, I have not seen you before"—my son said that he had seen him—the constable came and I gave the prisoner in charge, with the two sixpences.</p>

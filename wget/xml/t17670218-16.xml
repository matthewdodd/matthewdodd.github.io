On the 24th of January I was in my kitchen adjoining my shop; I heard the window break very loud; I ran out, but could see no body; I was informed, the person that had robbed me was at the Justice's. I went there, and saw my breeches on the prisoner; he had his irons on, and the Justice did not order them to be taken off; he has them on him now; I know them by a mark on the inside the flap to be my property.</p>

               <p>Dickerson.

               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. I saw her with a tea-kettle in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she by it?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. Buy it? she did not buy it; she carried it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Out from where?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. From out of the workhouse. I asked her what she had got there? She said the teakettle. I said, where are you going with it? She said, to carry it to pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pawn it?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. I don't know; the pawnbroker is the best judge of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found again?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. It was.</p>

               <p>M. Williams. At the pawnbroker's, with other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she one of the poor?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. She was one of the matrons.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had a quarrel with her?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. No, never, till after we missed the things.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I never give you strong liquor?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. We might have some in the house at washing time, but never at any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was not there a quarrel ensued, because I would not gratify you with liquor?</p>
               <p>M. Williams. No, never.</p>

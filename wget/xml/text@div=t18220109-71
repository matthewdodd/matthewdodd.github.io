            . I am in Mr. Collins's office. On the 11th of December, I heard he had been robbed; I went to the shop of one Bailey, Holywell-street, near Shoreditch turnpike; between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, and saw the two prisoners in the shop, they had a small round close basket. I had previously told Bailey, my suspicions, he was to buy the four pigeons that they had brought; I waited in the shop till they were bought, and then examined, and knew them to be Mr. Collins's property. I went out and returned in about half an hour; while I was there with one of the pigeons in my hand, the prisoner came again with the same basket, and a larger one, which was full of pigeons, I think about seven or eight pair, and the smaller one had about four pair, I knew them to be Mr. Collins's. When they came in, I put the one I had into another basket, that they might not suspect; Gascoigne looked at me, and said to Green,</p>
               <p>"The gentleman has got one of the pigeons which we brought this morning;" he said to me,</p>
               <p>"That is a fine pigeon, it is so tame, it will go about the house." I asked if it was one of his, he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes," and pointed to the two baskets which he had brought; I lifted up the lid of the small basket, and saw four of Mr. Collins's pigeons. I got a constable, and asked Gascoigne how he got them; he said, he bought them of a neighbour, who kept pigeons. I said, it was strange, he should buy of one dealer to sell to another, he made no answer; Green said, he knew nothing about them, he only assisted in carrying them.</p>

            . I am under gardener to Mr. Collins. On the 10th of December, at seven o'clock at night, I saw the pigeons safe in the house, there was twenty-four in all; next morning, at six o'clock, I found only three, they never fly at night - I know them to be my master's; I found a ladder thrown down in the yard, which was taken from under the hay-stack; it was a wet morning, there were three or four foot-marks by the gate. When they were brought home, they were let loose, and flew into their own place.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Gascoigne's lodgings, and found a pair of boots very wet and muddy, it was about one o'clock, on the 11th of December, he lives in Hoxton New Town, nearly two miles from the prosecutor's, Green said, he lodged on Saffron-hill, I went to the house, and found a person named Green, but not the prisoner, I could learn nothing about him. Gascoigne said, If I would come to his house at seven o'clock at night, two men would bring some more pigeons and live pigs; I went and stopped till nine o'clock, nobody came to it.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS. I am certain the pigeons are mine.</p>
               <p>- BAILEY. I live in High-street, Shoreditch. I never saw the prisoners till they brought the pigeons; I have the four they brought first, Mr. Rippingham's account is correct.</p>
               <p>GREEN'S Defence. I worked for Gascoign, he said, he had bought some pigeons, but must sell them, as his wife would not let him keep them.</p>

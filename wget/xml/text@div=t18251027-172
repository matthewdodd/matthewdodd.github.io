            . I live in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles'. Patrick Doyle was my nephew - he lodged in Church-lane. On Friday, the 30th of September, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was at the >Black Horse, public-house, at the corner of George-street - Doyle, Frank Smith, and I were taking half a gallon of beer in the tap-room - I was there half an hour; the prisoner, (who had lived with the deceased as his wife for twelve years) came in, looked round, said nothing, but went to the bar in about two minutes, and brought a half-gallon beer can under her cloak; she appeared sober; Doyle and Smith were talking together; Doyle was drunk - he turned his head towards her; she raised the can, and struck him with it near the temple, and ran out as hard as she could; he stooped his head down, and it bled very much; he remained in the tap-room about two hours, and then went out with Smith. I saw no more that night. They had seven children, and sometimes lived sociable together. On Saturday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw her coming out of her place where they lived - she said, "Good morning," and told me to tell my sister's son to keep clear of her - she would be his bl - y butcher, and the end of him. I went to his lodgings on the Sunday night - he was sitting on the side of the bed, very ill - she was in the room; he said he was very ill, and asked what was good for the head-ache; I said I always dipped my head in cold water; she was kind and attentive to him. He lived till the Tuesday week following, and died at the hospital.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not he strike me at the public-house? A. No, I never saw him strike her, nor kick her. I know nothing of his head being fractured before.</p>

            . I am the deceased's brother. I was at his lodging, four weeks ago yesterday - he and I went out that morning, and earned 5 s. 10 d.; he gave the prisoner 4 s. out of it, to get some supper; they lived together - we returned at six o'clock - she would not get it and we went to a cook's-shop. I my brother, and another man had had four pots of beer at five o'clock that afternoon; we came home, without having any thing at the cook-shop; the prisoner was sitting on the bed-side - her two children were in bed - one is seven, and the other four years old, and she was pregnant. I had a separate bed in the same room; there was a fire, but no candle; the deceased wanted to go to bed - the prisoner said he should not live there; he laid on the floor, with his clothes on: the prisoner got up, and said she would not lay where he did, and was going out - he said she should not go out at that hour, and gave her a violent push with one hand, and pushed her over across the bed; he did not strike her. I cannot tell on what part of her body she fell; the moment she got up he put his hand under his head, leaning on the table, and sitting on a chair - she got up, and went to the chimney-piece, laid hold of a hammer which laid there, and struck him on the head five times - one blow was very heavy; I could not see with which end of it she struck him; (I had laid down) I got up, went between them, and he knocked me down three times - he was in a violent rage, and she also; he laid hold of me, and said, "Oh! brother, I am undone!" she went out, and did not come back till day-light. A good deal of blood came from his head - I did not tie it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not he in bed? A. No - she sat on the bed-side with her clothes on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you not said she was in bed, and got up and dressed herself? A. No. I wiped his head with his shirt - one blow felled him to the ground; he laid on the bed after she was gone. I got another lodging, but saw her two days after, and told her her husband's head was cut - she laughed, and went off. I was sober when this happened.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see your brother strike her except when he pushed her? A. No. I have heard that my brother received an injury in his head at Liverpool twelve months ago; he gave the prisoner a violent push.</p>

            . I am apothecary of St. Giles's parish. On the 24th of October the deceased was brought to the Infirmary; he was extremely ill, and complained of great pain in his head - he was slightly convulsed. Early next morning he became extremely convulsed, but not altogether insensible - he complained of being sick. There were wounds on his head; he complained of being stunned. The sickness is a proof that his brain was very much injured. I had him removed in the evening to Middlesex Hospital. I should think the blows which caused the wound must have been severe; five blows given with this hammer were undoubtedly sufficient to produce inflammation of the brain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come to the work-house to see him? A. She did, and felt great anxiety about him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of Middlesex Hospital. The deceased was brought in on Tuesday night, the 25th of October; he was quite insensible - his head was shaved, and found considerably bruised all over - there was an incised wound on the right side of his forehead; the wound was almost healed and must have been an old one - he was trepanned in my presence, but it was ineffectual, and he died at half-past one o'clock</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270079"></xptr>in the morning; his head was opened - I found the pericranium was detached from the skull, and part of the skull was undergoing the process of exfoliation. On examining the brain I found an abscess in the anterior lobe to contain pus, which is quite sufficient to cause his death - these appearances were the natural consequences of heavy blows - if attended to in the first instance they might not have been in that state - the hammer would have given the external bruise.</p>
               <p>Q. If this had been the consequence of a blow a year ago, could he have continued in that state for a year? A. No. my Lord - he might have lived three weeks after.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in her defence, entered into a long and unconnected account about a quarrel with the deceased, respecting a dog, and stated that he had struck her several blows, on the evening in question, that he came home late afterwards, and attacked her so violently as to break four of her ribs, when she struck him with a file, but not with a hammer.</p>
               <p>MR. TUSON. A file could not have inflicted the wounds.</p>
               <p>LAWRENCE DOYLE re-examined. My wife slept in the room, but was out when this happened; I did not strike my brother when he knocked me down.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, the 14th of October, in the morning, I was in company with Mr. Armstrong in Bishopsgate-street; I had information in the morning that there had been some robbery committed in the roads, and Mr. Armstrong and me saw the two prisoners standing in New-street, by Bishopsgate-street; we looked at them and thought they seemed very suspicious, one of them had boots on, and one of them had white stockings covered with country dust; I saw one of them with a watch string hanging out of his fob; one of them parted from the other; this went out into the middle of the road to see which way he went, and I had lost him in a minute; Armstrong run into Petticoat-lane, before he came back Rayner came out of a pawnbroker's shop, the other then came and joined him; I followed them down Wormwood-street, they were discoursing together; the shortest gave the watch to the tallest; then Armstrong came running after me, we took them into custody, we brought them the office, and took them before the magistrate; Armstrong took Davis and took away the watch; I saw the string hanging out of his pocket: they told where their lodgings were, we went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250029"></xptr> and searched their lodgings, and this coat was upon the bed, and in the coat pocket was this knife (a broken case knife), and this stick was in the room (a stick that might be taken for a pistol); but when they were committed and going to gaol, I believe Armstrong said, you have got a very bad knife in one of your pockets, we had like to have cut our hands; they answered aye, that is the knife we used to have on the roads, and there is a stick in the room, that is the pistol we used to have; says we, it is a wonder the patrols never got hold of you; they said the patrols could not have hurt them, for if they had come up they would have dinged the knife, and then they could not vagrant them; because your Lordship sees if they had pistols or cutlasses about them, they would have been vagrants; they said it was an old codger; that he had nothing but a stick with him, and they never pulled out the knife or stick to him; on the Monday they were brought up before the magistrate again; and the magistrate asked which of them had that knife; the prisoner Rayner said he had that knife when they robbed the gentleman; the tallest said he had the stick.</p>
               <p>Court. They seem to have been very frank with you, what induced them to tell you all this? - My Lord, they told it going the road; there was no manner of promise made to them; Armstrong had taken the watch from Davis's pocket before this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Did not the father of one of these men attend at the magistrates? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>He is a Quaker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not this Quaker father use a great deal of persuasion with these young men, and tell them it would be much better for them? - No, upon my oath he did not, I am sure of it; I heard him say to his son you have done this, and you must abide by the consequences of the law.</p>
               <p>Had not somebody used such persuasions?</p>
               <p>No, Sir, I swear they had not.</p>
               <p>Had not the father of Rayner conversation with him before this? - He talked to him, but there was nothing of this sort mentioned.</p>
               <p>ARMSTRONG sworn.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the robbery, I was with Shakeshaft.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you first saw? - The first seeing of them was at the corner of New-street, both in company together; and Shakeshaft giving the information; he is a jailor belonging to New Prison; seeing one of them in boots, and the garb not being so decent for boots, I suspected them; one of them separated and stood looking at the other; Shakeshaft said he had missed the other, I went after him, and took Davis in Petticoat-lane, and Shakeshaft took Rayner; I saw Davis coming out of a pawnbroker's; I asked Davis what he had been pawning, he said nothing; I took the watch out his pocket; says he, it is mine; says I, where did you get it; he said, he was a midshipman on board the Southampton frigate, and had it before he left that ship; I then asked him the number; he differed in the number; and I told him then I suspected he did not come honestly by it; he said he had, and he would tell me where it had been left so long; I said if he did I would not keep him long, but I would go and see it was so; then he replied, he would not have me go high his friends on any account whatever; Mr. Harper was in the room when I took this watch from him; I took him to the magistrate and searched him further there, and in his waistcoat pocket I found this seal; then we asked them where they lived, and we received this answer, in Vine-street, St. Martin's-lane; I asked him with whom, he gave me the landlord's name, and Davis gave me a key out of his pocket; I went to the landlady to know which was their room; she at first did not know them, I shewed her the key, she knew that; we opened the door, and on the bed was this coat; in putting my hand into the pocket I run it against the knife; we then returned to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250030"></xptr> office, and in that time the prisoner Rayner had sent for his father, and they were both committed to New Prison; I heard Rayner's father say to him, for the love of God whether it be good or bad tell me the truth; what he said to his father I cannot say, he persisted in knowing about it at that moment; his father desired then to see the magistrate, and the magistrate told him, in my hearing, they were committed, and he had nothing further to do with them; as we were going down to gaol the little one said, it would have been happy for us if I had been boned by myself with the watch, but two of us could not tell a story alike.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the meaning of boned? - Apprehended; it is a cant word; they were a conversing with one another about different things; but perhaps your Lordship will not think proper for me to mention them; when they were brought up on Monday Mr. and Mrs. Rutt attended, and the Justice asked the prosecutor, which he thought was the man that robbed him, he said the tallest; and he said he was the man; and the little one said, he was the man that robbed the woman, without our speaking at all.</p>

               <p>I live in Cross-street, Hatton garden; I am an enameller and watch-maker; have known him these three years; I always understood his general character to be a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250031"></xptr> very good one, I have seen him at his business, and he has worked for me by consent of his master; I took him to be a very valuable lad, and so much so, that had I known of any controversy or any dispute with his master, I should have had no objection to take him to my house, and have given his master a valuable premium for him; I did not know till within a very few hours of this fact.</p>

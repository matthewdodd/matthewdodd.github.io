                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, living at Harford Row, Skelton Street, Greenwich—up to the 8th January I had been living with the prisoner, between four and five years—during that time I had often maintained him—on 21st January, from 6 to 7 o'clock in the evening, I went into the Dover Castle public-house, Church Street, Greenwich—the prisoner was there, in a different box, drinking with a lodger of mine—I asked the lodger for the key of the house, and then left—I met my baby's god<lb></lb>mother, and returned with her to the public-house—we went into a different division to the prisoner—I called for two <hi rend="italic">three's</hi> of port wine—on doing that the prisoner came round into the box where I was—he asked if I had been talking about him—I said "No, Charley, I am not; I am talking about my dear baby; this is my baby's godmother," and upon that he hit me twice with his clenched fist, which made my head go against the wains<lb></lb>cot, and with the third blow, I remember no more; from that blow the sight came out of my eye with the blood; I found my eye was out; all the <hi rend="italic">lightning</hi> came out of both eyes—I went to the Seamen's Hospital—they would not do it—I was then taken to my own house—I went to Dr. Creed, and afterwards to the Eye Infirmary, where my eye was taken out—after being there for a week, I remained in my own house until 22nd March; between 9 and 10 o'clock that night I was going to my lodging, I had given up my house at that time, and when I got near it I saw the prisoner Standing against my palings—he said "Here, I wants you"—I said "Oh, it is my murderer!"—I knocked at the door with great violence, and when he found I was going in, he caught hold of the hair of my head and dragged me, which caused the socket of my eye to bleed—I put up my hands to save the other eye, and he struck me violently on my blind side, and I became insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Harry Thornton, 3, Prince of Wales Cottages, Greenwich—on the evening of 20th January, I was in the Dover Castle public-house, with my husband—the prosecutrix came in with another female and called for some port wine—the prisoner came up and said "Are you talking about me?"—she said "No Charley, I am talking about my dear baby"—he then struck her once on the side of the head, and a second blow on the head, and knocked her head up against the wainscot and the third blow caught her under the right eye.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CREED</hi>. I am a medical man, at Croom's Hill, Greenwich—on the evening of 20th January the prosecutrix was brought to my surgery, I attended her for two days; she afterwards went to the Opthalmic Hospital, and her eye was taken out—the feelings she speaks of, that her eye was out, was the shook from the blow—it was not knocked out, but it was no doubt destroyed from the effects of the violence received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not strike her three times, the first time I missed her, and the witness and her husband hustling about caused be to hit her when I should not have done; the second time I did hit her, I admit, but I did not hit her to cause her to have her eye taken out; she has been blind from childhood—I was regularly drove to do it from her aggravation.</p>

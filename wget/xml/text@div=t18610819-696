                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I was formerly a clerk, in the employment of Messrs. Bryant and Hodges, sugar refiners of Fieldgate street—I went into their service in March, about three years ago—I know Cooper, he had a grocer's shop in Aldgate—I first became acquainted with him in the latter end of 1858, but did not become intimate with him at that time—he was aware that I was a clerk in Messrs. Bryant and Hodges service—he has called there two or three times on week-days, and once or twice on Sundays—he called twice on a single Sunday—I lived on the premises—he did not come in when he called on week-days, I saw him out<lb></lb>side the door, but he did on Sundays—Messrs. Henderson and Constable, of Great Tower-street, are customers of Bryant and Hodges—before the writ<lb></lb>ing was on this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I took the blank form from the rack in the sale-room, at Messrs. Henderson and Constable's when I was there on business for my employer—I knew at that time that Henderson and Constable had purchased some sugar of my employers, which was not delivered, a few days before the 24th May—after I had taken it I saw Cooper at a public-house in Whitechapel—I do not think it was by appointment, I cannot say—I do not know the sign of the house, it is opposite Whitechapel church, and is kept by a man named Morton—it is not quite half a mile from Cooper's premises—I had met Cooper there several times before—a person was with him on this occasion, whom he introduced as his brother-in-law—he is a foreigner—his name is Belio—we were there between 12 and 1 in the day—pen and ink was called for and brought—we were in a small back-room at the back of the house—I produced the blank form that I had taken from Henderson and Constable's—I presented it to Cooper, he gave it to his brother-in-law, who filled in the writing that is now on it—previous to that, he had said that he wanted the sugar; and when it was filled up, he said, "If the order is presented, will the goods be delivered?"—I said that they would be—it was an order to deliver to Henderson and Constable—Cooper took it and went away—nothing was said at that time about my receiving money for the sugar—everything on the face of the order was filled in by the brother-in-law—Cooper had told me previously that if the sugar was</p>

Budget—I was not charged with stealing the sugar; but my father had to pay for it, because Cooper issued the order on Mr. Brown's sugar—house and had the sugar—that was in May, 1860—my father paid about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Messrs Budget, who are large wholesale grocers—I was with Bryant and Hodges at that time—they did not charge me with stealing the sugar, but my father paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, because Cooper had the sugar for an order he had no business to have, and because Brown's bought a hogshead of sugar, of which Cooper had some—the money was paid to Messrs. Budget, because they had bought sugar of Brown's—Cooper forged the order, and I was a perfectly innocent party—my father paid the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because Mr. Brown would have been robbed of it if he had not paid for it—I cannot say whether I should have been given in custody for stealing it—it was not in my writing—it was to prevent my being prosecuted with Cooper, that my father paid the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not charged with stealing it, but I was aware that Cooper had the two hogsheads from that warehouse—I was not aware that Mr. Brown would prosecute me.</p>

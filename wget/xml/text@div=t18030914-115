            , and was employed as a letter carrier in January, February, March, and beginning of April, 1802; I had no Sunday duty, Chalfont had; he delivered letters to me many times on Sundays, which he brought from the Post-office, as he told me, and I knew it by the post marks; he put them into his pocket when he was sorting them on Sundays, as he told me; I was to cause them to be delivered on Monday in the regular course of other letters; they were not all in my district, and I delivered those that were in my district to whom they were directed; those that were not in my district I transferred to the carriers of the districts to which they belonged, and they accounted to the charge taker of the division, and he paid me the money; letters are frequently missorted, and these were treated as such; the money received for them, Chalfont had half and I half. I at that time kept a tallow-chandler's-shop; Chalfont bought soap and candles of me, and I have a book of the sums of the moiety of each in my own writing at the time - (produces his day-book.) On the 13th of January, 1802, I find a dozen of candles charged 10s. to him; on the 17th W. C. cash 1l. 7s. 6d. being half of the postage money of letters Chalfont brought on that Sunday; on the 1st of February<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140093"></xptr>17s. 4d. is placed to his credit as a moiety of the postage he brought from the Office on Sunday; on the 8th, 19s. 6d. also a moiety; on the 16th, 19s. 10d.; on the 22d, 15s. 9d.; on the 8th of March, 14s. and 15s. 6d.; on the 22d, 18s. 4d.; on the 30th, 12s. 4d.; on the 5th of April, in my ledger 2l. 14s. all moieties; I paid him five guineas at one time, and 4l. at another, and he had goods from my shop, which are entered in my day-book; I paid him the money towards settling the account of the letters; Chalfont's account is drawn out from the day-book to the ledger by my order by one Berridge; I gave an account of these transactions in May last to the Post-office, near a year after it took place.</p>

               <p>Q. In plain English, you might steal it if you were so inclined! - A. I certainly might, but I defy any one to bring such a charge against me.</p>

               <p>Q. They were present when you accounted to Chalfont I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was all secret? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you some receipts? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear that on any given day you delivered any letter to any particular individual of those letters which were embezzled? - A. I know letters have been delivered at Mr.

            , the witness, was employed, but had no Sunday duty. Buxton Webster was not in the Office in January, 1802; but previous to that he had Sunday duty; he was discharged the 5th of April, 1801. Any person employed on Sundays could take letters. The letters are sorted in twelve letter-carriers divisions, and are then sorted in to walks; mistakes are frequently made, and they hand them over to the charge-taker, and he gives them over to the others. Webster in January last made a disclosure after he was dismissed from his office; in consequence of his disclosure, Chalfont was sent for; Mr. Freeling, Mr. Parkin, and myself were present. Webster produced his daybook, and accused Chalfont of fraud in the course of his Sunday duty, saying, that he had taken letters for London delivery to Webster's-house, where they cast up the amount, and divided it on the Monday; such letters as were not in Webster's own delivery, he passed to the charge-taker, and such as wore he delivered himself, or by the persons under him. Items were read from the ledger and day-book, as sums Chalfont had credit for in respect of the amount of these letters, and was explained to be one half of the amount of the postage of letters taken away on the Sunday. Chalfont being confronted without any promise being made him, and being asked what he said to the charge, acknowledged he had participated in postage in the manner stated, but said the amount was not so great.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. Is there any situation of subsorter? - A. Yes, the defendant was a sub-sorter, which is perfectly distinct from a sorter; sorters are often employed in charging the number of letters that come on Sundays, which are told, and we know the amount of postage, and any deficiency would be discovered on the Monday upon the retelling the letters; we have no account of the number sent from the different places; they are first told, and then sorted. Webster was a discharged servant when he made the disclosure, and I have a recollection of his being suspended before.</p>

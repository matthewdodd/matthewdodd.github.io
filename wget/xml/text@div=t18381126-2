                  </hi>. I am an apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Whitby Barque</hi>, which lies in the London Docks—the prisoner was one of the crew, from Calcutta to London—he left the vessel, in the West India Dock basin, about five weeks before we arrived in the London Docks—I remained on board, and the day after he left I missed these things from my chest—I have seen some of them since, and know them—some are marked "W. W. B.," and some, "W. Blake"—I had seen them safe about a week before he left—I did not give any of them to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-surveyor. In consequence of information I went on board a ship, in the West India Docks, with Parsons, and found the prisoner—I had some conversation with him about a watch, and after cautioning him how he should answer, I said, "You are also charged with stealing several articles of wearing ap<lb></lb>parel, do you know anything of them?"—he said, "I do not, except a shirt, which was lent to me"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "I have no lodgings—I slept at a public-house last night"—I knew where he lodged, and took him to his lodging, in Penny-fields, Poplar—there were two chests in the room—I asked him which was his—he pointed to it—I found eight shirts, marked, two pairs of drawers, and a variety of things—I took out one shirt—he said, "That was lent me"—I took out another—he said, "That was lent me"—as I proceeded to take things out, he was very much affected, and called for a glass of water—some things were marked "W. W. B.," and others "W. Blake."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Robert-street, Limehouse.

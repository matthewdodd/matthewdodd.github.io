                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Adams, of 30, Bangor Street, Notting Hill—on Saturday night, 10th January, about half-past 11, I was coming from Acton from my work, and crossing Bangor Street I saw two women and a man standing at the corner—the prisoner was one of the women—I had my purse in my hand with 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—the prisoner caught hold of me and asked me whether I had any money—I said, "Money, no, 1</p>

I am the wife of Henry Allison, of 42, Crescent Street, Notting Hill—on 10th January, about half-past 11 o'clock, I was passing the Bangor beershop, at the top of Bangor Street—I saw the prisoner up with her fist and strike the prosecutrix as she was passing on the side of the face, and as she fell she kicked her in the side of the head and stunned her; then she clung to her 'bosom and tote her dress and her flesh—the prosecutrix called for assistance—I went to her—as the prisoner got up she had a woollen waistcoat on her arm, and she ran down Bangor Street—she was some minutes on the top of the prosecutrix—I assisted the prosecutrix to her door—I picked up a shawl and part of her dress, and gave to her—I saw the prisoner grab at the basket which the prosecutrix had on her arm and break the handles—I picked up her parcel, a frock with a towel round it, and I kept it as there was a lot round.</p>

Mary Nunn. I live at 28, Bangor Street—about half-past 11 on 10 January I was standing on the step of the door—I saw the prisoner coming across the road and the prosecutrix behind her, and I saw her knock the pro<lb></lb>secutrix down into the gutter—I did not know her before—I have seen the prisoner a great many times; I knew her by sight and by name—I was afraid to say anything because she is such a violent person—I saw her</p>

               <p>knock the prosecutrix down in the gutter, and have her down about ten minutes—I could not say what she did to her, but she had her head close to the pavement, and when she had done what she had to do with her the prosecutrix got up and crawled to the other side, and the prisoner up with her hand and hit her again.</p>

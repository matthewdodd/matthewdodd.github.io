               <p>COURT. Q. Is the upper part of the bill your writing or not? A. Yes, the top part is my writing I must say, but not the receipt, nor is it written by any person in my employ, nor by my authority; when the prisoner came to me first, he said her Ladyship was very good pay, and that she paid every three weeks.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone Office. I took the prisoner into custody on the 7th of October, in Williams'-mews, Devonshire-street, Portland-place; I said I had a warrant against him, and asked if he knew what it was for - he said."I suppose it is for not giving my livery in;" I said No, it was for felony - I said there was a case of felony against him: I neither threatened or promised him any thing - he said he did not know what it was; I asked if he had ever received money from Lady Nepean, to pay for corn and hay - he said Yes, he had received it from Lady Nepean; I asked if he had ever paid Mr. Swain any - he said he had not, except the first bill, that he paid the first bill, but never paid any afterwards; I asked what he had done with the money - he said he was very much involved in debt, and made use of it for himself and family; I asked him who receipted those bills - he said he receipted them himself; I had not got the bills myself at that time.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN SWAIN, JUN. I make out my father's bills; Lady Nepean had about 30l. worth of oats in the year, and about 30l. worth of hay, 60l. in all. (Receipt read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - being called on to say a something in extenuation for my guilt, at the same time well knowing the awful situation in which I am placed, allow me to remark, that had I wished to have robbed my prosecutrix, I had other opportunities besides what I am charged with, having on one occasion been sent to her Ladyship's banker's, where I received the sum of 100l., which her Ladyship, I am sure, will not attempt to deny, having had an undeniable character with me from my last place. Therefore, my Lord and Gentlemen, let me humbly intreat you to take my truly deplorable case into your most humane consideration, for the sake of my innocent family, being five children, one of which is now on the breast, who will be left to an unforgiving word, who are more ready to oppress the unfortunate than to relieve and forgive the faults of their unfortunate parent. I was induced, my Lord and Gentlemen, to pay my debts with the money I am charged with embezzling, thinking that if her Ladyship knew I was in debt she would discharge me from her service, and knowing that in time I should be able to recover from my difficulties; and having known Mr. Swain for upwards of sixteen years, I supposed he would have waited until I was able to pay him. I had been out of employ for a length of time previous to my being engaged by her Ladyship, during which time I was laid on a sick bed, and was obliged to dispose of every thing I had to maintain my starving family, who have no one in the world to look up to, either for instruction or support. Therefore, should your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury, think fit to find me guilty, let me intreat your Lordship to consider the awful state of my disconsolate family, whose prayers are always ascending for the protection of their unhappy and distracted father, who is well aware that his very life is in your Lordship's hands, and who is well aware that whatever the decision of this Court may be, it will be passed with mercy, for the sake of his wretched, but perfectly innocent, family, having never appeared before at any bar.</p>

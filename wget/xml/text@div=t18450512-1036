               <p>¡ <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM PENNY</hi> I am a lighterman, and, live in Luke-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road, in the parish of St. George. I kept the house at the time this happened, and occupied it—the prisoner came into my service about the 7th of May, and left on the 27th of March, she came for her keys about ten o'clock in the morning of the 29th of March—I and my wife were then going out—we left her in the passage with her things, and told her to take them, and shut the door after she came out—we left her in the house alone—two boys were waiting outside to assist her with her boxes, as she said—I and my wife returned about half-past eleven at night—the house had been left above twelve hours—I found a candle in the passage—I trod on</p>

               <p>–it—it corresponded with the candles in my kitchen—I struck a light, went down stairs, and found the back door merely on the latch—I had left it barred and bolted—the prisoner had no occasion to undo it to go out, she should merely draw the front door to after her—I went up stairs, and found a bunch of keys hanging in my bed-room door—they did not belong to the house—the drawers were open, some linen turned out, and some articles stolen—I misted a quantity of plate and other articles—I have found several knives, a coat, two rings, a necklace, and two or three other articles—the bed-room is the only room I found open—the other rooms were locked, as I had left them—I had left the bed-room door locked, and put the key in the clock, and had the key of the clock in my pocket—the plate was taken from the bed-room drawers—everything was taken from the bed-room—I have seen a pair of stockings which were found on the prisoner's legs—I do Dot know when I had seen them last, as I only wore them in the summer.</p>

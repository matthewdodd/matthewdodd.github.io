            Have you ever seen any of them? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoners with taking these things? - We were sitting at tea at five o'clock that evening, in my parlour, under this bed room, I have a bolt in the door with a wire coming down into the parlour through a round hole, and as we were sitting at tea we heard a gingel of the wire, and I was convinced there was somebody in the room; my wife said take the candle, I went up stairs, and found the door open, and Graham standing in the room, I ran away into the dark, without the candle and laid hold of him, and cried out thieves! thieves! and the stairs being next the door, we fell down both together, but I never lost my hold, and my wife made an alarm, hearing me cry thieves; by that time Mr. Manning and Mr. Hodges were come into the passage, and I never loosed him till we got him into the shop, the shop door is in the passage, when we got him into the shop my wife and I went up stairs, he was left in the parlour with the witness; I found my chest was broke open, and this coat was taken out of the chest, and all the rest of the things were laying about the room; this coat was removed out of the chest, on to the floor, this coat is in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the other articles missing from? - The others were in the room, not in the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all laid together, or separate? - My wife was in the room, and saw them last, they were all missing.</p>
               <p>Q. You had that man committed I suppose? - Yes, he was; as we were getting of Graham into the shop, Freeman wanted to make his escape through the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him make his escape? - Yes, Mr. Manning laid hold of him.</p>

            Where is this passage, at the bottom of the stairs? - Yes, facing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you fell down with the other prisoner, did you see him then? - No, not till we were in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Manning see him before you? - He may.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you first saw him rush by you, was it as you was falling down stairs with Graham? - It was after we got up in the passage, before we got to the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you saw the prisoner Freeman, that he ran, or that you only saw a man run? - Freeman rushed by me, and Mr. Manning took hold of him, he was stopped that moment by Mr. Manning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Freeman get out of the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you rent this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you pay rent for the whole house? - I do. I let out the upper part, and keep the one pair back room for my own lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a number of other lodgers in the house? - Yes, there is a man and his wife in the two pair front room, and a man and his wife in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. The street door is generally left open? - It is, it was open at the time, that is the general course, because the customers must come into the shop from the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before this matter happened that you saw this room? - My wife was up there about twelve at noon, and locked the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this struggle that you saw? - Just within side of the passage, Mr. Hodges caught hold of Graham in his hand and I together shoved him into the shop; at that instant the prisoner Freeman came along the passage and he endeavoured to pass me, I secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he passing? - He endeavoured to sculk by me without being observed, I stopped him and turned him also in, and before I got into the shop, I see Graham searching about him, and I heard something drop from Graham, I directed somebody to look for it, and they found something of a crow, we carried them then into the back parlour of the shop, and there Freeman dropped a large nail which somebody took up, I don't remember who, and the constable was sent for, and they were searched in the parlour, but no property was found on either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Knowlys. Was Freeman got to the door when you laid hold of him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had no possible opportunity of getting rid of any stolen property to any body in the street? - He certainly could not.</p>

            Freeman was not rushing by you, but going as you think, rather secretly out of the house? - He was going rather secretly, I don't think it would have been policy for him to have done it in any other way. This knife was taken out of Graham's pocket.</p>

               <p>I was in company with Mr. Manning on Christmas Eve, we were going down Princes-street, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of it than the last witness? - No, Mr. Manning see as much as I did. I heard the cry of murder and thieves, coming by the door, and I turned my head down to look, and I saw Mr. Farnham down on oneknee, struggling with the man, the prisoner, Graham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body there besides Graham? - Not at that instant, I laid hold of Graham and I had scarcely got hold of Graham before Mr. Manning said, here is another of them; I turned round and Mr. Manning had hold of the other prisoner, Freeman. They were taken into the parlour, and the officer was sent for and they were searched.</p>

               <p>I am a barber, I lodge in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what past in the passager? - I was up stairs, when I came down stairs the men were in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what sell from either of the prisoners? - No, I heard a great noise, and I came down stairs and I picked up this bit of an iron crow, I picked it up just going into the shop, between the shop and passage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There were people continually coming up and down stairs to the lodgers in the house? - Yes, the street door is always open.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people had been up between twelve and five, it is impossible for you to say? - A good many, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the Christmas eve about five o'clock in the evening, therefore a good many people coming backward and forward to the house? - I dare say there is.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What may be the value of that coat? - I would not take a guinea for it, it cost me one pound three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150163"></xptr>shillings, and I have not wore it but a very few Sundays.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is no old clothes man would give you a guinea for it? - It is worth more to me.</p>
               <p>Q. And so are these peoples lives worth a great deal to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Grabam. I am a plaisterer by trade, about a fortnight before Christmas I was discharged. Christmas time of the year the trade is slack, and so I went down in the country to my wife's friends to stay there till after Christmas, I came up at Christmas Eve to look after work, going along I bursted my shoe, and having no money in my pocket to pay for its mending I recollected I knew a person in Wych-street that mended shoes, and I was there told to go to a grinder's shop in Princes-street; I went up to enquire after this man at this house, directly as I got up to the top of the stairs the gentleman of the house came up and seized me.</p>

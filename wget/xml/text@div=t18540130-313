                  </hi>. I am the son of Henry Godfrey Buskin, he lives at Lee-park, in Kent; the prisoner was in his service. On the Friday before the 19th of Jan., my father sent for a constable; he came, and soon after I went into a room occupied by the prisoner—she was there—I saw the constable with two bottles of wine in his hand—the prisoner was taken to the station—I went afterwards, and saw some bread and butter, and flour, and candles—I only know this wine by the seal on the bottles—this bottle has on the seal, "Jones, 28, Mark-lane"—I cannot speak to the other bottle.</p>

               <p>asked her whether she would allow her box to be searched; she said, "Yes," and she took the key and unlocked it—there was a piece of bread, three candles, a quartern of flour, and some butter, and in a portmanteau, in the same box, there were two bottles of wine—she said the bread and butter, and candles, were her master's, and the wine she had bought at a public house in London, and the flour also she bought in London—the prosecutor said, "It is very strange that you should get this wine from the same mer<lb></lb>chant that I get mine"—she made no answer to that.</p>

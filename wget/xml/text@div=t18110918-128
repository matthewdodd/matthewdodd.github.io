It was getting late, I told him I did not want to go with him, I wished to go home; he took my shawl and run away. I knew my shawl when the officer shewed it me.</p>
               <p>- WRIGHT. On the 18th of August, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I heard the cry of murder; Preston and I went into a field near the Black Horse, we there saw the prosecutrix, she said she had been robbed of a shawl by a soldier, and much ill-used; I went to the King's Arms in Kentish town, I found the prisoner there; I saw the shawl in his cap, he said he had taken it from a woman in a field. I took him to the Black Horse, where the prosecutrix was, she said it was her shawl, and that the prisoner took it from her.</p>

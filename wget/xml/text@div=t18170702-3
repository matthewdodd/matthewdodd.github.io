On the 4th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I was up with the lodger's and my own wife, on the first-floor - We were not gone to bed. I have the back parlour. My mother-in-law (Grace), called me, I came down and found the prisoner in the custody of Greaves in my back parlour. I searched him, and found three skeleton keys in his pocket and one in his hat - He said nothing. I took him to the watch-house, and when I returned I found the things rolled up ready to be taken away. I had been in my parlour about half an hour before, and shut the door after me; I had been in the house two hours. When I first went up stairs I left my wife in the room.</p>

I remained in the room about half an hour after he went up stairs, I then shut the door and went up also; I saw the street - door fast about half an hour before. We were called down and found the prisoner in custody. I had made the bed before I went up stairs, when I came down I found the two quilts, one blanket, and one sheet, rolled up, and laying on the bed - I had left it quite smooth.

I went up stairs between ten and eleven o'clock, it was quite dark, Mrs. Grace had given the alarm - I saw Hayes's door open, and spoke, thinking it was Mr. Hayes; I then went in and found the prisoner in the back room-there was no light in the room. I caught hold of him, he begged pardon, and said he had come for something, and then said "is this Hart-street;" he was at the foot of the bed. I saw the keys found on him.</p>

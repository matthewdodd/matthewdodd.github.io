On the 19th of January, when I came home, I went to bed; he had a woman there at breakfast with him - He went out with her, and came home at one o'clock; he then came and took my breeches from under my head I asked him what he was doing; he said he had left something there which he wanted - I did not think he was robbing me. He went out, and soon after I missed my breeches - I found them in the room. The next day I met him, but had not then missed my money. The day after, I missed three 1l. notes, 1l. 14s. in silver, and a handkerchief out of my box. The key of my box was in my breeches-pocket. I found him and secured him. He said he had put the notes in my room - I took him there, he could not find them. I went for an officer, and he made off. I did not see him again for three months. The woman went out before I went to sleep.</p>

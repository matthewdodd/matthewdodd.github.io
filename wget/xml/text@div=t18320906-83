On the 17th of July, in the afternoon, I was in my shop; a person came, and asked if I had lost any soap; I said I was not aware of it, but I looked, and missed two cakes; I went out, and pursued another lad, whom I saw about two hundred and fifty yards from my shop - he went up Earl-street, and joined the prisoner, four or five hundred yards from my shop, and out of sight of it; they walked on together for some distance; I followed very close to them - I then saw the two ends of the soap in the prisoner's apron, and took and secured him with it; this is it; I know it to be mine by some coals on the end of it - there had been a ticket on the soap, which Mr. Hawkes found.</p>

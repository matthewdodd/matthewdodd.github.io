               <p>Q. Were they of any value? - A. No; there were twenty-four that resembled the current coin of this country; I asked him if they were of a good colour and found, and he said, they were as good as I had last, if not better; then I was for coming away; I chucked down a sixpence to pay for the reckoning; Horne said that sixpence would be a good one for a pattern; I said, yes, it was a large one; he said, it was large, but any time that I met with a sixpence, or a shilling, that I liked, to send it to him, and he would cast me the pattern; then we came out, and when we came to the door, I gave a signal, which the officers understood; Horne was immediately secured, taken back into the same house, and searched; the money that I received from the prisoner, I delivered to Armstrong, exactly as I received it from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What business had you with him the first time? - A. I went, at the request of the officers and Mr. Powell, for the same purpose that I went the second time.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Powell? - A. The solicitor for his Majesty's Mint; I had of the prisoner, the first time, some bad silver for a good half-guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. Why was there not a prosecution for that; why was that abandoned, and not followed up?</p>

I am an officer belonging to Worship Street: On Monday the 20th of October, I met Clarke, Ray, Vickery, Mason, and Lillywhite, at the Northumberland's Head, next door to the office; I took out a half-guinea, and marked it on the woman's side, by the date; I marked it with the letter A, and kept it in my own possession till we got into the neighbourhood to which we were going, and then I gave it to Lillywhite, and searched him in the presence of the other officers, and took his pocket-staff from him; he then went into the public-house, the officers being placed to watch, he having a signal to repeat, if he had purchased; he was in the Swan, I dare say, twenty-five minutes; I and Clarke were on one side of the way, two other officers placed, one above, and the other below, and Ray continually passing and repassing the window and door of the house; Lillywhite and Horne came out; Lillywhite gave the signal, and Horne was taken into custody; we took him into the public-house, and from Lillywhite's hand, I took this money, (produces it); he was then taken into a back room, and Ray searched him in my presence, and found the same half-guinea that I had marked and given to Lillywhite, and a sixpence; Ray has got it; I then returned Lillywhite his staff, in the presence of Horne; upon which Horne said, I thought I was dealing with a friend, but I find him a traitor; he asked me to give him his money again, but I had not it; here are fifteen shillings, and twenty-four sixpences, resembling the coin of this country, and four French sixpences, and one shilling.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are they of any value at all? - A. I should think none; the whole are counterfeits.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any information upon which you went the first time? - A. Yes; an information came to Mr. Powell, and it was his request, that I should find some person that I could trust, to see if such things were done, or not; in consequence of that, Lillywhite went, and then an information was taken, and a warrant granted.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>The learned Recorder having summed up the evidence in the above case, proceeded to the following effect:</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, With respect to the kind of testimony that you have heard in this case, which differs from all others, it is of the utmost importance that you should watch it with an eagle's eye: for, as it strikes me, this crime could not have had its existence, but for a preconcerted plan laid by these witnesses, as they all acted under the direction of Mr. Powell, and were all looking to the same object, of fixing this man with this crime; it is necessary, that what they say, should be very closely examined: for indisputably you cannot but feel that, having the same view, to say no more of it, they must have a very strong bias. Upon the first transaction, you find that there was a regular information taken, and why that should be abandoned to follow up another, which has been imagined and planned by those who have carried it into execution, I am at a loss of conceive. Gentlemen, this method of prosecuting, to say the best of it, is certainly novel. I think, I can recollect persons being prosecuted without the testimony of persons sent from the Mint, for the purpose of soliciting the commission of the offence, without that sort of trap, and that sort of contrivance; however, it is for you to say, whether you can have such a reliance upon the kind of testimony that has been given, as to pronounce a verdict of guilty, which might be followed up by a counter-plea; and, in that case, the prisoner would have to answer for the offence with his life. Gentleman, it happened to me, not a long time ago, to report a prisoner to the King, exactly in that situation; that prisoner had been convicted, and afterwards, upon the counter-plea, was reported to his Majesty, but it was the King's pleasure, in Council, though that prisoner was a notorious offender, that his life should be spared; I afterwards had a conference out of the Council, with the first law-officer in the country, the Lord Chancellor, who was of opinion, that it would have been a dangerous precedent, indeed, to deprive a man of his life for an offence which would not have had an existence, if he had not been solicited to commit that offence by the persons who were the witnesses against him; the Lord Chancellor requested me to take the first opportunity of declaring, that he was of opinion with me, that prisoners ought to be prosecuted for this, as well as other offences, in the usual way, and that he did not approve of prosecuting men, by traps of this sort; upon the whole, he was of opinion, though the crime was greatly injurious to society, that this mode of prosecution had better be spared. I have, therefore, not been singular in my opinion; if I was convinced I was wrong, I would instantly give it up; but it is my duty to state, that it is his opinion, and that it is mine, and if the remedy, by the usual mode of prosecution, is not sufficient, an application may be made to the Legislature; in short, if this mode of prosecution is to be carried on in one instance, on account of the difficulty of detecting the crime, it may be considered as a proper thing to be carried on in others, and the only reason that I have heard asserted, has been the difficulty of detection. It has often been said, that these sort of cases are very much like the case of servants robbing their masters, where the money is marked before the felony is committed; but I do not think it is, at all, that case; it does not fix the offence upon any particular servant; it is only the means, after the robbery is committed, of detecting who the robber is; the circumstance of the master putting it into the till, is only the mode of detecting the offender, not an inducement to the offence. It appears to me, notwithstanding all that has been suggested, that the means may be found of prosecuting upon an original information, in the same manner, that all other prosecution are conducted; it is my bounden duty to support all prosecutions that are brought forward in the ordinary and common mode; but it is not only my opinion, but that of the first law authority in this country, that these sort of prosecutions should be spared.</p>



               <p>I have now done my duty; I leave the whole case with you; if you are satisfied that, upon this evidence, the prisoner is guilty, you will say so; if you have any reasonable doubt, you will acquit him.</p>

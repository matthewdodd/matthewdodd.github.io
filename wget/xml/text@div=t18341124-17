                  </hi>. I am a shoe maker, and live in Brill<lb></lb>row, Somer's-town. I sent my boy with my donkey, on the 19th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, to Pancras-fields, to graze—I went these myself about eleven o'clock, and saw it safe—my boy afterwards came and gave me information—I went, and it was gone—it was found next morning in the City Green-yard—that was Saturday—I know the prisoner, by seeing him sell water-cresses about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On Friday, the 19th of September, I took the donkey to Pancras-fields—it was grazing there—I saw the prisoner there, with another boy, named <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Wells, both lying down—I knew the prisoner before—he sells water-cresses—he and Wells were together in company—the prisoner came up to me and asked if my father wanted to sell the donkey—I said "No?" and then the other sprung up and said, "I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—he held out his hand—there was no money in it—they both went away into another street, and then came back—one took hold of its ear, and the other beaf him out of the field—I ran after them as far as I could, and then ran home and told my father—I am quite sure the prisoner was the person—he took hold of its ears, and trotted him off—it was about twelve o'clock.</p>

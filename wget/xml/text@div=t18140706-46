             came out just as I was beating the drum, with a knife; I perceived it; I chucked the drum down on the ground. He then took hold of my collar and shook me. He then stabbed my drum twice.

               <p>Q. Were you examined by a surgeon - A. Yes; Mr. Parkinson.</p>

               <p>JOHN VIVEN. I am a drummer. I saw the prisoner scuffling with Payne; as I came up, Payne fell, exclaiming, oh, Lord, I am stabbed. Me and my comrade, Adair, got him up, and took him to surgeon Parkinson. I saw Hardy have hold of Payne; I did not see Payne have hold of Hardy.</p>
               <p>MARY THOMPSON. I live in Queen-street, Hoxton Market-place; right opposite of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this affray or not - A. I heard he was stabbed; I picked his sword up off the ground, and I went round to the doctor to bear if the wound was mortal. When I returned, I saw Hardy; I said the poor young man was stabbed; Hardy said, d - n his eyes, he had been waiting for him all the afternoon; he knew he would serve him out before he had done.</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I examined Payne's wound; it was an inch deep, hardly more; two inches would have been dangerous; a wound an inch deep is not likely to be attended with fatal consequences. It appeared to be a cut, not a stab. It might be done by Payne turning quick round, or by Hardy drawing the knife. Every thing that I saw might have occurred if there was a scuffle between the parties.</p>

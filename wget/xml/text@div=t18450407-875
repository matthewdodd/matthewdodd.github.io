                  </hi>. I live in Goodman-fields, I am in no business. About one o'clock in the morning, on the 12th of March, I was in a public-house in the City—I do not know the street—I saw the prisoner in that house—I was at the bar—I took my purse out of my pocket, and took out a piece of money, to pay for what I had had—the prisoner was then next to me, and was watching me—I put my purse back into my pocket—the prisoner asked for some relief, and was telling some tale of distress—she asked me for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and during that time I missed my purse—I saw her slipping away into the yard, and followed her—I saw her stooping and busy about her clothes—I took hold of her, and at the very moment a policeman passed—I gave her in charge—I went with her to the station, and as she was going she was endeavouring to lift up her clothes to conceal the money—I afterwards returned to the yard with the officer, and found my purse with one shilling in it—there had been nine sovereigns and a half and some silver in it—this is my purse.</p>

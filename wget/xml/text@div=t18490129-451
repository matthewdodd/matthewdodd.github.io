                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. William Brayley Wedlake. On Saturday afternoon, 20th Jan., I saw the prisoner in my master's yard, about five o'clock; he was driving six: ducks and a drake, belonging to my master—he bad no business to drive them—I knew him, and am sure it was him—I went to the top of the yard, and saw him leave the yard with something under his smock-frock—I said, "What have you got there?"—he made no answer, but went on—I went back to the yard in about five minutes, and missed the drake—I went to the privy, which is in the yard, and found there some blood and feathers—the prisoner came into my master's tap-room in about two hours and a half afterwards—the police<lb></lb>man was fetched, and he was given in charge—he was searched, and I saw some feathers under his frock, and some blood on his shirt—those feathers looked like the feathers of my master's drake—I heard the prisoner</p>

               <p>say he had had occasion to go to the privy—there was no one in the yard but him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 100). I was sent for on Saturday even<lb></lb>ing, the 21st. I went to the privy—I saw some blood and feathers—no person could have sat there without wiping off the blood—I took the prisoner in the tap-room; he had some white and black feathers under his frock, similar to those I found in the privy,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had occasion to go into the yard to feed a sow; the ducks came up, and I drove them away; I went to the privy, and there was nothing there then; I afterwards went to the tap-room again; the feathers under my frock were from a turkey cock and hen, which I had taken to a gentleman's house; the blood on my shirt was from having killed a pig in the morning.</p>

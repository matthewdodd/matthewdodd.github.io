            (police-constable S 123). On the 21st of June, at half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty opposite Euston Mews - I heard something fall - I then heard some footsteps, and saw the prisoner Charles cross the mews with a truss of hay on his shoulders, which he took into Price's stables - I called Bugden - we went down the mews to Mr. Mills' stable, but in going down we found Price's stables open - when we got to Mr. Mills we saw the mark of two trusses of hay on the ground, under the window; one was dark, the other light, corresponding with the colour of the trusses we found - the prisoner Francis was at the loft window of Mr. Mills' stable - he said, "Good morning," and asked what brought us there so early - we then went to Price's stables, and found a truss of hay uncovered, and shortly after another partly covered over - I saw Charles in a corn bin - he appeared to be asleep - I asked him when the hay was brought in - he said in the night; and it was a hard thing his master could not have hay without our supposing it was stolen - I said, "Will you swear it did not come in within ten minutes?" - he said,"No" - I then said, "Where did you get it?" - he said, from the bottom of the mews, at No, 14" - I left him in custody, and went to Mr. Mills' stable - I knocked, and Francis put his head out - I told him to come down - he came down in his shirt - I told him to go up and put on his clothes, and I followed him - in going up I saw Gission on the stairs -Francis had passed him - I asked Gission what he did there- he said he had come to call the gentleman's servant - I said it was all stuff, and told him to go up stairs - we went up, and Francis asked Gisson what he did there - Gisson said,"To call you" - Francis said he had not given him any order - Gission said, "You know you told me," and Francis said, "I believe I did" - Gisson afterwards said he had come to borrow two trusses of hay - they were then taken; and Francis said, "We have got into trouble."</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030098"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you known Francis before this? A. Yes; he had been groom to Mr. Mills for five or six months - I have not heard him say that he had been in the habit of making loans of hay to the cabman's servant - Gisson said he came to borrow two trusses of hay - I know that persons who drive cabriolets come in at all hours - Gisson left his cabriolet on the stand, and came there.</p>

             (police-constable S 159). I was called in - I recollect Gisson saying he had come to borrow two trusses of hay, and Francis said, "I have no knowledge of him."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state before the magistrate that Francis said he had no knowledge of Gisson? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But I dare say it may have happened that you have lent and borrowed hay? A. I would lend it to any gentleman in the mews, but not to a cabman- I had desired Francis not to have any thing to do with these two men - he had given me satisfaction.</p>

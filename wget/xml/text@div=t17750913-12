            . On Friday the 14th of July, the prisoner's wife came to me, and asked if I would buy a quantity of gunpowder. The prisoner and another man came at night, and informed me where he lived. After that, I went to the justices, and gave information, and had the prisoner secured. He was searched, and a pound of gunpowder was found in his pocket.</p>

            . I went with Barber to the prisoner's, I found there the bag, and the other things mentioned in the indictment, in the prisoner's closet. There were about fifty pounds weight of powder, in a box, two or three pounds of salt prunella, salt petre, black lead, and ivory black. I took him to a public-house. The landlord asked, if we had searched him. I then searched his waistcoat pocket, and found a pound of gunpowder. I asked him where he got it. He would give no account of it for sometime. At last, he said, he bought it for a shilling; but he would not tell of whom.</p>

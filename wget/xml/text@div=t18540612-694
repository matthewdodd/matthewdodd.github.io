In consequence of information, I stood behind a hedge near William Roadknight's premises, where I had a view of his shed, and about 2 o'clock in the morning, on 27th May, I saw the prisoner come and bring a horse, and put it into a cart, which had been loaded with hay on the over night—he then took the lantern, and looked amongst some trusses of cloyer hay, to see if any<lb></lb>one' was there—he then took a truss of clover hay, and put it on the top of the load of meadow hay, and went away—he went about 100 yards; I went after him, and asked what he had got; he said the clover hay was for his horses—I said I had been watching since 11 o'clock, and saw him take the clover hay—he had got the portion of hay for his horses, besides that truss of clover hay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Hillingdon—the prisoner was in my employ about four months; it was his business to take hay to London to the salesman—there was also hay which he had for his horse that was put into a sack—it was a sufficient quantity for the horse he had—he had no authority to take any clover hay at all—I have seen this truss that was found in his cart; it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had a six bushel sack full of meadow hay allowed him—I looked in that sack, and it was full of meadow hay.</p>

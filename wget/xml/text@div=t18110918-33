It immediately occurred to me that they were my keys, I turned round and saw the prisoner quilting the box, I immediately started up and followed him into the lobby. I seized him by the collar and accused him of having picked my pocket, he denied it, I took him into the box and called for a constable, the constable came up, whom I desired to search him, they found nothing upon him, but obtained a light and found my keys upon the floor. I then took him, assisted by the constable, to St. Martin's watch-house, having been previously informed that searching was useless, he having been seen to throw something away, the keys were found under the floor immediately under the seat upon which I was sitting, my pocket was cut, my pocket book was taken away and my keys fell out.</p>

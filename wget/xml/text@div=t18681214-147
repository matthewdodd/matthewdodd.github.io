I took the train about 8 o'clock in the morning of Tuesday, and went to Stratford, and walked about till 4 o'clock, and laid the child down on a doorstep. I did not do anything to the child."—I then produced and undid the clothing, and the mistress identified the bed gown, in the prisoner's presence, as being one of the two that she sent with the flannel to her in the workhouse—upon that I took her into custody—I produce a copy of the register of the child's birth, on 12th October, 1868.</p>

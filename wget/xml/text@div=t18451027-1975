On Monday, the 20th of Oct., about one o'clock in the morning, a disturbance took place in Keate-street, Spitalfields—I saw the prisoner and Moses Isaacs having a disturbance there—Isaacs called out, "Police!"—I saw the blood run from his nose—he told me he was stabbed—I then went to take the prisoner into custody—I put my left hand up and seized him by the collar—he resisted, and struck my left hand with something sharp, which cut me—I seized him—we wrestled together—he then struck me in the mouth—something entered my lip—it penetrated into my mouth as far as my teeth—with the force of that blow I was obliged to let him go—I bled—he ran away, and I lost sight of him—I followed him, and gave information to Sergeant Barker—Isaacs and I then went in search of the prisoner, and about four o'clock I saw him in custody of Barker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon to the force, and live in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. About four o'clock, on the morning of the 20th of Oct., Davis was brought to my house by Barker—he had a punctured wound upon the upper lip, extending to the teeth, and a cut upon the left hand—the wound was inflicted by external violence—I examined Isaacs, he had a punctured wound against the nostril—the wounds could not possibly have been produced by the ring—they wire done by some very small sharp-pointed instrument—it must have been sharper than the end of a tobacco-pipe.</p>

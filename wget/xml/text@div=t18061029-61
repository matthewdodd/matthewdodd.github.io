I was sent from the Cobham's Head, Clerkenwell, for a pail of yeast, when I got into Bloomsbury Square I met a journeyman baker, he had got a quartern loaf in his hand, he says will you have any thing to drink; I said I cannot stop, I have another pail of yeast to get, he says you can stop to have part of a pint of beer, my basket stands there, fetch me two quartern loaves of bread, I am only going to take this loaf into Southampton-street, accordingly I went and turned the basket down; as I took the bread out, he mentioned the journeyman baker's name that belonged to the basked, I said it is the journeyman that sent me for the bread, if you will hold the bread I will go and fetch the man, I run down Southampton-street, I could not see the man; I put the pail of of yeast on my shoulder and went on.</p>

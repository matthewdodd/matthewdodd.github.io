            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at Execution Dock; between twelve and one o'clock at night, the prisoners came ashore there, they had a parcel rolled up with a blanket, and pillow, they were sitting on a bench with the bundle; I asked where they were going, they said to Nightingale-lane. One of the waterman afterwards came up, and asked if I knew them. About twenty-five minutes after, Sherwood returned, I saw him go down to the water side, and asked him where his bed was, and where his brother was, as he had said Frank was his brother-in-law, he said the watchman had stopped, and taken him to the watch-house - I asked why they did not take him, he said, they said they would not take him, because he had not got the bed. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

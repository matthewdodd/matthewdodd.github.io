               <p>"Upon his Cross Examination, he said, that the prisoner knew he was a constable, when he claimed these things as belonging to him, for that he had then apprehended him; that at first the prisoner denied any property in these things, but after a little discourse, he said, they were his, and asked for them as his own."</p>

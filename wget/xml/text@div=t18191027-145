            . I am a market gardener, and live at Brentford, in the parish of Isleworth. On the 17th of August, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was going by Gunnersbury-lane, and saw Smith and Wilson, (who were convicted last Session), in a cart with the prisoner. I am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak with certainty - A. I have not the least doubt of his being the man - they were in a green open chaise cart, in the main road, about one hundred yards on the London side of Gunnersbury-lane - I noticed them in the cart; Smith and Wilson jumped out, and one got on each side of the cart; I, myself, was in a cart at the time, and saw a large bundle in their cart, in a large bag. They appeared to get out to do something to the harness - the horse's head was towards London; the prisoner remained in the cart; I stopped just opposite the cart, and noticed them; one of them came round to me, and I touched my horse to go on, but still observed them. I went on to Mr. Streams, and spoke to him; when they saw me stop there, they got up into the cart, turned round, and went up Gunnersbury-lane, towards, Hanger-hill - they turned to the right instead of going over the hill, still keeping their pace. They turned to the right, down a place where there was no thoroughfare, but finding they could go no farther, two of them got out, and took the large bag with them. The prisoner remained in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing before they took the bag - A. As they went along I saw them cut a little frail-basket, and throw it into a ditch, in the lane; I had not called out to them, but only pursued them. I saw Smith and Wilson return from the field with the bag, and get into the cart again - I stood at a distance in the lane. I was afraid to go up to them by myself, as Wilson and Smith had threatened to murder me if I came near them. They got up into the cart, turned, and came towards me to the top of a bye lane; four or five of us tried to stop them, but could not - a young man with a reaping-hook tried to stop them, but they struck him with a stick, and cut his cheek, which made the blood run very much. They then went over Hanger-hill, and I followed them by myself, for two or three others would go no farther. I followed them up the hill, then Smith and Wilson got out, and came after me, swore they would murder me, and said so to several others - I went over the hill after them. Three or four reapers at the top of the hill, followed with their hooks in their hands; we pursued, and secured Smith and Wilson, but the prisoner remained in the cart, went on a few yards, and then stopped; Smith made use of very bad language. I sent for Streams, who said the man was dangerously hurt, and they were fearful that he would not live.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He went on with the cart, turned round, passed us, and kept before us until we came to the Ealing Arms - we left him there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him - A. We did not then know any thing had taken place, but their having done mischief to a man - we did not then know any thing was stolen. The prisoners were in my sight near an hour and a half - I have not the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you observe the things that were taken in the field - A. I described the bag to Piper, and saw it nine days afterwards. I saw the frail-basket about eight days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. In this Court, when Smith and Wilson were tried. I then recollected him, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You was passing in the road, going to market - A. Yes, I heard they had assaulted a man, and pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe the prisoner to be the man, and, perhaps, will die with that belief in your mind - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Since he has been committed, have you not said it was a hard thing to swear to a man, and you should be sorry to swear to him - A. I told Mr. Burgess, when he came to me, that I should be sorry to swear to the young man. Burgess said I had sworn to an innocent man, and was to go and see another man, named Ingram, to see if he was not the man. I did not go, because I had no occasion so to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270079"></xptr>Q. The man you took to be the prisoner sat the greatest part of the time in this Court - A. Yes. He was dressed in a fustian jacket. The Bell, public-house, at Ealing, is near half a mile from where I pursued the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You refused to go to see Ingram, believing you was correct in the man you spoke to - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

In a few minutes I heard some blows; I got up, left my house, and went towards Brentford, and back again, before I could find the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Tyler - A. About three o'clock, before I got into Brentford; I afterwards saw him beyond Gunnersbury-lane, he spoke to me; I then observed three men in a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of them - A. I do not think he was - I cannot positively swear to him. I took the man in the cart to be smaller than him - I think the prisoner is not the man. I did not pursue the cart. Tyler brought Smith and Wilson to my house; I had pursued them up Gunnersbury-lane - the cart drove very fast. Smith and Wilson were taken before I got up to them; I had seen them come out of the lane. People attempted to stop them but could not - they struck a person on the cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were taken, did you see the man in the cart - A. Yes; I had been in sight twenty minutes. I believe the prisoner is not the man; I thought the man considerably taller. I did not see him on the ground - I was on horseback.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you afterwards see the third man at the Bell, at Ealing - A. No, I was not in Court when the prisoner was taken, nor did I see him at the office - I did not see him until yesterday.</p>

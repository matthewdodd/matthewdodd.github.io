               <p>money advanced by me, on account of the society; the entries are prin<lb></lb>cipally in my writing—on May 9th, 1846, here is an entry of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ad<lb></lb>vanced to Barrett—here is another on June 4th, but there is no amount, and another on Oct. 24th, of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Sept. 12th, 1846—these entries are all in my writing; they are memorandums of bills given—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill included the two other sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no particulars of the bill, except the name and number—I only enter the name and number—the number is always written on the bill-head; here is 637 on the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—bills are drawn by me alone—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill) this is not the bill that was given on that occasion; there was another given at four months.</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the treasurers of the Caledonian Loan Society. Mr. M'Gregor was treasurer before me; when he left he gave the whole of the bills and securities to me and Mr. James Wadsworth—I took them home and examined them—I had been connected with the society before—Mr. M'Gregor generally drew bills when the society required security—there was no one else specified to do so—I have done so as treasurer; it is now part of my duty—the prisoner was secretary—I handed these bills to him on the very night M'Gregor gave them up—he saw me examine them—they were only one night in my keeping—I did not examine them till I got to Mr. Wadsworth's with them—I then examined them one by one—I cannot say how many there were—I gave all that I examined to Mr. Wadsworth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this bill among the documents M'Gregor gave you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is not the same bill—I cannot swear to it, it is so long ago—this is Barrett's writing, and this is Wadsworth's—I have not the slightest doubt that this is Barrett's writing—I have seen his writing often—when Wadsworth drew the bill I believe M'Gregor was making use of the society's money for his own purposes—I did not see him draw it—it was not arranged that he should do so—there was no person specified—I was not aware he had drawn the bill till after these bills were given up—I then learned it from Mr. Wadsworth—he is still the secretary—I have known him three or four years—he has borne the character of a trustworthy, honest man—I represent 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this society—that is the actual amount of money I introduced myself, or from other resources—the bill was due on the 15th Dec.—Barrett came to the office in Charles-street on the following Saturday, to state that he could not take up the bill, and begged I would not put him to the expense of a new stamp—he had accepted two other bills—there was only one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to my knowledge—the bill was due on 15th Dec.—if it had been a four months' bill it would not have been due till 15th Jan.</p>

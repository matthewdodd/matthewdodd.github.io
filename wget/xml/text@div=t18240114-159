            . I am shopman to Mr. Jones. On the 8th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and bought the articles stated in the indictment; she told me to make out a bill, and take them to No. 9, Bidborough-street. I took them there, and she told me to make a separate account of what was for her mother, which I did. She said she would shew her mother the goods, and bring me up the money. I was up stairs; she took them down stairs, and absconded with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. She bought some for her mother - A. She said she would shew them to her mother, who was down stairs, and would bring me up the money. They were worth nearly 10 l.</p>

            . I live in Bidborough-street. The prisoner came and took my first floor, the parlour, and kitchen, for herself, her mother, and servant; and said she must go and enquire the respectability of my house; she returned in a short time, and said it was all right, and wished to come in immediately. I asked for a reference; she gave me one, at Clapham. I said I could not go there that night, and she could not come in that day. She said there was a death in the neighbourhood, which would occasion a hurry, and she wished her servant in on that night, but I would not consent. She then said she would go out and order some things; she came back, saying she had bought some, and when the young man brought them, to shew him into the drawing-room: and in a few minutes the witness brought the goods, and soon after I found the door open - she was gone. I have never seen her mother. She was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had she not paid you a deposit - A. Yes, 7 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Mr. JONES. I took her a few yards from the lodgings, and asked if she had paid for them; she said if I would go back I should find all right.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never intended to defraud him; I was going to shew them to my mother, who was at a friend's close by - I offered to shew him where I was taking them.</p>

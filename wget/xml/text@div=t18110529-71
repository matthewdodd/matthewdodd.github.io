               <p>Q. Where did he stab him - A. In the belly. Day had a stick in his hand, after having stabbed him Day immediately struck him over the head, and Day and me endeavoured to to get the knife from him; I said, Day, for God's sake let him go he has got a knife, he will kill you; Day endeavoured to pinion his hands back; Day grew faint, his hold got loose, and the prisoner rushed out of the house; Day could not hold him any longer, he was bleeding so fast; I ran after the prisoner, I called out stop him; there were fifty people about him; he kept cutting with his knife, so that every one was afraid; he had a bandage round the wrist that held the knife, so that you could not discover the knife hardly, at last, by running about and the people after him; he fell, some man rushed upon him and held him down; I put my foot upon his wrist, that made the point of the knife come out; the point of the knife went against the curb-stone, that made it bent as you now see it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that Day did not speak or do any thing to provoke him - A. I am quite sure he did not.</p>

            . Q. Did you go with Mr. Gole for the purpose of apprehending the prisoner - A. Yes. Mr. Gole entered the room before me, I followed him, and as he went to speak to the prisoner, the prisoner was behind the table, he was coming round; I was going to take him, he stabbed me through the coat and breeches, in to my belly, I was sixteen days in the hospital, and it was eleven days before they would suffer me to get out of my bed. I am not well now, and I am afraid I never shall; I cannot strain at any thing, or walk fast.</p>

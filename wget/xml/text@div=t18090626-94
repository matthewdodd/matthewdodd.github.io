               <p>Q. Was this man quartered at your house - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose two bottles of wine - A. I did, on Monday the 12th of June; being quartered with us, he assisted us, and we treated him as one of the family. In the evening he was there drinking; he went down to the privy, I supposed, he could have no other purpose of going down there, he was gone some time; we went down, he was not in the privy; we concluded he was gone. Some little time afterwards the cellar door opened; it goes with a pulley, it made a noise; my wife heard the jink of the bottles, she called to me; I was sitting in the parlour adjoining. I immediately jumped up with two others, and secured the prisoner with the two bottles of wine in the street,</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any marks on your bottles or your corks - A. No, not then; I have marked them since. They were in a hamper of wine. I happened to send for half a dozen of sherry wine, it was in the cellar; I looked at the hamper, it was deficient three bottles; I cannot account for the other bottle; he acknowledged that he had robbed me of the other bottle three weeks before. I said when I caught him, Dick you are the last person that I should have thought would have robbed me; he said he hoped I would forgive him, he had never robbed me but once before; he and his comrade that has gone off with the expedition; he confessed it upon his knees: afterwards he ran away; he was taken by the people that are here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

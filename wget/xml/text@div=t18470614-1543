                  </hi>. I live in the New-cut, Lambeth, and am a printer. The prisoner was in my service as lately as the 20th of April—a person named Snelling was indebted to me for some work done—it was the prisoner's duty to receive money on my account—the course of business was for the money to be entered in the cash-book by the person who received it, the day of the month, and what sort of money was received, and to put the money through a crevice into the desk—I asked the prisoner if Mr. Smith had paid him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said I should find it in the book—I have examined the book, and I do not find it entered—the prisoner has not accounted to me for a sum paid by Mr. Snelling.</p>

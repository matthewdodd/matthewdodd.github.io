                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Nunn, an iron-bolt plater, residing it 3, Bridge-place, Greenwich—Captain Baker lodges with us—on Tuesday afternoon, 3d February, about a quarter to 4 o'clock, the prisoner knocked at the door, and asked if Mr. Baker was at home—I said, "He is not"—he said, "Oh! I was to bring him this," referring to this piece of paper, which was folded into a note—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mrs. Nunn, please send me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the crew, by the bearer. W. Baker")—I opened it, read it, and saw it was not in Baker's handwriting—I asked him in—he said, "I will be back in five minutes," and went away—I went in pursuit of him with a man, but saw nothing of him till about a quarter-past 7, when I saw him in Bridge-street, near the Beehive public-house—he crossed the road, and I crossed also after him—my intention was to give him in charge, when he turned round by Lovibond's public-house, struck me in the back, knocked me down, and got away—I was all over mud, and insensible—Mr. Baker sent for me on 4th February, and I saw the prisoner then on the Wood-walk at Dept<lb></lb>ford—I did not speak to him until I gave him in charge—he was dressed in moleskin trousers, a short monkey-jacket, and a hairy cap when he came to me first—when I afterwards saw him he had a dark cloth cap; but, with that exception, he was dressed the same as before—his features were quite familiar to me—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I am a master mariner, and reside with the husband of the last witness—I made it a practice to pay the crew in advance on the arrival—this note was produced to me on 3d February, I believe, between 4 and 5—it is not my writing, nor written by my authority—I have known the prisoner this two or three years—I never authorized him to go to Mrs. Nunn, or to any one, for me—I never gave him any request for money to take to Mrs. Nunn—I saw him on Tuesday, the 3d, in Bridge-street, Green<lb></lb>wich, but did not speak to him.</p>

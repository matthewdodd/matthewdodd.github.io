                  </hi>. I keep a dining-room in Bishopsgate-street, On the 8th of October, Dixie came and asked for a 1/4 lb. of beef to be cut all lean, as he wanted it for a gentleman at a public house to eat with some ham—he gave my wife a shilling, and she put it into the till—there were two other shillings there—the officer came in before the prisoner had the change—In con<lb></lb>sequence of what passed, I looked into the till and found two shillings which I had left there, and a bad one besides—I am positive that previous to the prison<lb></lb>ers coming, the two shillings in the till were good—I had looked at them three minutes before—I bent the bad one, and gave it to Pamphlett the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman, On the 9th of October I saw the prisoners together at the corner of New-street, within three doors of Bun<lb></lb>dock's shop—I watched them for three quarters of an hour—I saw Dixie<lb></lb>pull off his coat and give it to McIam, he then went several times towards Mr. Bundock's, and then went into the shop—I followed him in, and asked Mrs. Bundock if it was a good shilling the man had given her—Mr. Bun<lb></lb>dock came forward, looked into the till, and said, "No, it is a bad one"—he gave it to me—I got Sessions to assist me, and took Dixie to the station-house.—I</p>

               <p>locked him up, and came out, and just by Bishopsgate church, saw McIam with a coat under his arm—I said, "What have you under your arm?"—he said, "A coat; I have just picket it up, I have not stolen it"—I took him to the station-house—he dropped something from his hand—we picked it up, and it was a paper with three shillings in it—I am positive he is the man I saw with the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McIam.</hi> He did not see me in company with the other; when he took hold of me, he said, "Halloo, what is that?"—I did not know what they meant—they stooped down—another gentleman came up and pretended to pick up something and give him—they said, "It is all right, come along," and they took me to the Compter—I never saw the other prisoner till I was at the station-house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is quite false—I watched them for a quarter of an hour, and took off my coat, not wishing to be recognised.</p>

                  </hi>. I went over to Bundock's shop, when I saw Dixie go in and took him to the station-house—I came out with Pamphlett, and asked him if he should know the other man who had escaped—he said he thought he should—I said, "That is the man, over the way, I dare say, for he looks very shy at me"—Pamphlett went over, caught hold of McIam, and said, "This is the man, with the coat under his arm—as he walked about five yards I saw him throw the three shillings down by the side of the curb—I stooped to take them up—a boy took them up, and put them into my hand—there was a small piece of paper between each of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McIam.</hi> It is false—he did not see me drop them—I had not had them—a gentleman picked something up, and gave to them. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am positive I saw him throw them down—Dixie said the coat was not his, but, on putting it on, it exactly fitted him—when his mother came to the Mansion House, she said to him, "What have you done with your coat?"—he said "I had no coat, it was a jacket"—he said he had left it at the public-house, but we could find no coat there—he said a man was waiting for him, with some turpentine to clean it, but we found nobody there—he could not tell the sign.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Dixie's Defence.</hi> I never saw this prisoner before—it was a good shil<lb></lb>ling I gave the lady—I had come from Acton, and was going to America—I had a new fustian jacket on, and got some paint on it—I went to a public-house with a man, took off my jacket, and shows it to him—he said, "It will come off with spirits of wine"—he sent me for a quarter of a pound of beef—I left my jacket in his care, and went over to the shop; and as the lady was giving me change, the policeman came in, and said it was a bad shilling—she pulled out a bowl with other silver, and they picked out this shilling.</p>

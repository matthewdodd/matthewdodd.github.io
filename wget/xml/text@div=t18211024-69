On the 11th of September I missed five blankets from a room with five beds in it, over where he slept, one off each bed. He came, in at six o'clock, and in consequence of information, I asked him if he had brought back the blankets which he took out. He said he took none. I sent for a constable who took him. I have not found them; nobody but him was in the room that day. He was making matches there.</p>

On the 20th of May I was at a public-house in Orchard-street, Westminster. I came out at half-past nine or ten o'clock, and was going home to Berwick-street, and at the corner of the first street I found myself sick - I was rather intoxicated. Three young men came up, and said it was a pity that I should stand there; I said if they would procure me a coach I would give them a shilling; they said they would, and told me to follow them, which I did, but don't know along what streets, for I was never there but once before. I asked if that was the nearest way to the coach-stand; they said it was. We came to a house in Duck-lane; they said I had better step in, and one of them would fetch a coach directly; I went in - the room was quite dark - I felt for a chair - could fine none, and sat on the bed; they said I had better stop there for half-an-hour, as it might be that time before the coach came; I said I could not. One of them helped me to take off my coat, which I consented to - I held it in my hand - one of them dragged it from me, and then seized my waistcoat, another my boots, and pulled them both off at once, and all three set off and locked me in; there was the duplicate of a watch in my coat pocket, and a purse containing 8 s.; I called out of a window, as square of glass was broken, but nobody came. In about an hour and a half some persons came into the room, and said if I did not come out they would take me to the watch-house; I said I would not leave till I had got my clothes; the room was still dark, they came two or three times in the dark; I cannot say who they were; they at last brought a light; the first who came with it in his hand was the prisoner - I am sure he is one of the three who robbed me, but he was not one of those who took my clothes off. I remained in the room till daylight, then went for a female whom I knew, and she got an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay when he brought a light - A. Not a moment. I heard a number of voices after that, and knew his voice, but saw nobody; I described them to the officer, and about two o'clock in the afternoon, saw the prisoner at a public house in Orchard-street, and gave him in charge. I cannot speak positively to his being one of the persons who took me to the house. When he brought the light, two or three others were with him; he told me to leave that house; he had a white hat on, and I believe one of the three had a white hat.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was fetched to Duck-lane, and found the prosecutor in his shirt and trowsers; he described three persons to me, and in the afternoon, I apprehended the prisoner, who denied the charge; he lodged at the house once, but I cannot say whether he did then.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at Vauxhall on the evening of the robbery, and left at eleven o'clock, and slept at my father's - three men who had hired the room, and had been missing ever since, were taken.</p>

There were no more but these people in the back room that day; there were some company in the front room: the chest stood in a corner of my room. When I talked with the prisoner about the particulars, he told me the exact quantity of money that was in this chest, how it was hid in a glove, and the manner in which it was broke open, and every other particular relating to it.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I will state to you what I take to be clearly the law upon this case; that the value of the things must not only be in the whole such a value as the law requires to constitute a capital offence, but the things must be stolen at some one particular time, and no particular acts of stealing must amount to that value; for the law will not permit the value of things stolen at different times, which are in fact different acts of stealing, to be added together; because as no number of petty larcenys will amount to a grand larceny, so no number of grand larcenys added together will amount to a capital charge; it seems to me that there is no direct evidence before you of things taken at any one time, of the value of forty shillings; and though there seems to be no ground for lessening the value of the things which has been put on them by witnesses, yet I do not think a jury is warranted against a prisoner to extend the value; the sword is valued by the witness at twenty shillings only, and by that value I think in such a case you ought to be bound; whatever your opinion upon the view of it may be, you should not, against the prisoner, depart from that; and no value you put on the black silk stockings and shirt, will bring it to 40 s. the pistols he says were under 40 s. there are two others who both speak to other things pledged on the same day, now it would not be a strained inference to say that they were taken at the same time, but they both added together do not amount to the value.</p>

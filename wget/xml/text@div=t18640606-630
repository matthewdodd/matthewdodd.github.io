I reside at 2, Ranelagh-mews—on Saturday, 21st May, I went out with the deceased about half-past 9—we went to the Manor-house, and had a pot of porter there between four of us—after that we went down the mews to look at some cattle, and had one pint more beer between three of us—we then went to the Old England public-house, and had a pot of beer there between four—we then went back to the Manor-house, and there had two pints between three—we then came back outside the Old England public-house—there was an oyster-stall there; I and the deceased had some oysters, and a man named Bacon treated him to a shilling's worth—when he had had a few Healey asked the fishmonger how many he had had—he said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth, and we had only had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth—Healey said the fishmonger</p>

               <p>wanted to cheat him—the prisoner was there, and he replied that the fish-monger would rather give him half a dozen than cheat him out of one—Healey said that he knew more about him than he did; he had known him longer—after that the prisoner and Healey commenced quarrelling about driving—Healey had a bottle in his hand; he handed it to me—I told him not to go and kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he said he was not going to, he was only going to shake hands with the prisoner—he went round to Bacon, and spoke to him, and while he was doing so the prisoner came up and hit him in the face—he fell backwards on the ground, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> out his arms—I went to him and found he was dead—Bacon and I picked him up and took him into the mews—he was perfectly sober.</p>

I reside at 36, Delamere-crescent—on this Saturday night, about twenty minutes past 12, I was standing at the oyster-stall outside the public-house with the prisoner—Healey came over to me; he was sober—through speaking to him the prisoner asked him to drink with him, which he did, and I asked him to have some oysters—I put down a shilling, and then left for about ten minutes—when I returned Healey came to me, touched me on the shoulder, and said, "What do you think of that man? he wants to fight me," and pointed to the prisoner—he had a pipe in his mouth—the prisoner pulled off his coat, threw it at my feet, and knocked him down there and then—I looked at him when he was on the ground; he never spoke or moved afterwards.</p>

I am a fishmonger—I sell oysters at a stall outside the Old England public-house—on Saturday night, 27th May, about two minutes to 12, Bacon came to my stall, and while he and the prisoner were there Healey and Fisher came up—Bacon put down a shilling for Healey to have some oysters—I opened them—there were some words about there not being the proper number—the prisoner said, "I don't think George would wrong you of an oyster; I have known him for some time, and I think he would rather give you half a dozen than wrong you of one"—Healey sad, "I dare say you know a b——y lot about it"—after that they got into words about coachmanship—Healey look at the prisoner up and down, and said, "I dare say you are a b——y fine coachman; it would be about your style to be kept to feed the pigs"—he had put a bottle on my</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 10, Delamere<lb></lb>crescent—on Sunday morning, 22d May, I was called in to see the deceased at 2, Rane-lagh-mews; he was dead—I made a post-mortem examination—on ex<lb></lb>amining the mouth there was a bruise inside the upper jaw, just beneath the nose; it was about the size of a shilling, externally—there was no dis<lb></lb>colouration—on removing the scalp there was a quantity of effused blood, and there was a bruised spot, about the size of the palm of the hand, between the scalp and the bone at the back of the head—on removing the calvanium there was a quantity of dark venous blood, which, in my opinion, was the cause of death—the other arteries of the brain were healthy—I could dis<lb></lb>cover no smell of alcohol in the stomach, nor any appearance as if the man had been drinking to excess—the cause of death was extravasations of blood on the brain—a fall would cause that; it was not done by the blow—the mark on the lip might have been caused by the knuckles of a man's hand; that blow must have been sufficient to knock a sober man over.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> Supposing you had heard nothing of the circumstances of the case, were the post-mortem appearances such as would be found in a case of apoplexy without violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, taking the appearance of the bruise alone—the bruise at the back of the head might have been produced in a fall from apoplexy—it is probable, but not possible, that apoplexy might have arisen from passion, and from his having partaken too freely of porter—there was very little blood in the right cavity of the heart—in apoplexy you generally find the right cavity full and the left empty.</p>

               <p>presence, by William Martin (<hi rend="italic">the bill and cheque were read</hi>)—he came to me again on the 19th of December, with a bill for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for two months, to discount, for which I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper money (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:)—I see by my banker's book that that cheque was paid on the 19th—the bills were presented and dishonoured—the prisoner lived close by me, and kept a luncheon bar, at 15, Basing hall-street, which he gave up soon after I discounted the bills—I instructed my solicitors to take proceedings against him—I did not see anything of him from the time he left Basinghall-street till I saw him at the Mansion-house—there never was any agreement between me and William Martin to sue the prisoner—I never agreed that, in the event of the prisoner's paying upon being sued, to divide the proceeds with him—after discounting the bills, I placed them in an iron safe—I never parted with them for a minute until at the Mansion-house, when I applied for a summons—that was early in August—when I handed the first cheque to William Martin, a man named Quinnel was present—it was at the Catherine Wheel hotel, in Bishopsgate-street.</p>

I live at No. 18, George-street, Stepney, and am a tailor—I formerly lived at No. 3, Lambeth-street, Leman-street, White-chapel—these two bills of exchange I took from Alfred Martin, and took them to Mr. Suffolk, who discounted them for me—he gave me 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I cannot say when it was, but I suppose it was a week after they were drawn—the prisoner is my nephew—I drew the bills, and he accepted them—these acceptances are in his hand-writing—I saw him accept them—I have had business dealings with the prisoner for years—he was owing me money, and I took the proceeds of the bills—I never saw anything of these bills from the time Mr. Suffolk discounted them till they were produced at the Mansion-house—I never had any agreement with Mr. Suffolk that he should sue the prisoner, and if he paid the bills that we were to divide the proceeds, nor to pay the costs if he did not pay them—I never offered to give him up the bills if he would pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never had them in my possession after they were discounted, I never saw them.</p>

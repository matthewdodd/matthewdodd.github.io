               <p>Q. On the night of Sunday the 15th of May, what time did you come into your master's chambers? - A. A little after ten; I went out about five minutes before eleven; as I went down the stairs, Mr. Kilner was standing, leaning upon the iron rails, outside the staircase; as I passed him, he fell - into a fit of laughter, but said nothing.</p>

               <p>Q.How soon did you return? - A. I was not gone more than five minutes; when I returned, he was leaning on the bannister of the staircase, near Mr. Talbot's outer door; I opened the outer door and went in, and bolted it; I had not been in the chamber above two minutes, when I heard a violent rattling against the door of the chamber, which induced me to open it; Mr. Kilner then went rather back towards his own door, and presented a pistol at me; Mr. Kilner's door is up in the corner, upon the same landing as Mr. Talbot's, upon which I attempted to get in, but before I closed the door, the pistol was fired.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time the pistol was so fired, was it presented at you? - A. It appeared to me to be presented right at me, I was very much frightened.</p>

               <p>Q.How far was he from you? - A. He might be a couple of yards from me.</p>

               <p>Q. How were you able to see him? - A.There was a lamp upon the landing-place; I then opened the window and called the watch, and two watchmen came; Mr. Kilner had then got his own outer door open; I told them that was the man, and they went into his chambers, I saw the bullet had gone into the wall, at some distance from the door.</p>

               <p>Q. It had not passed into the chambers? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.How far from the door? - A. It might be more than a foot.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. The ball was very near the floor, was not it? - A. It was near the skirting board.</p>

               <p>Q. So that it would have hit your legs? - A. It would have hit my legs if I had not gone in.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060043"></xptr>Q. He was laughing when you passed him? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any reason for that laughing? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Were you directly opposite the doorway, or were you on one side the door? - A. I had one foot inside the door, and the other out.</p>

               <p>Q.Then his not hitting you was not owing to your going in, but to the pistol being discharged at the side of the door? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In discharging the pistol, did the ball cross the door-way? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Kilner's door is not opposite your master's, but on one side? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the ball must have crossed the line of the door-way? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. This building stands between the Middle-Temple-garden, and Middle Temple-lane? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>ISAAC BLACKBURN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a watchman in the Temple.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of either the report of a pistol, or being called by that lad, did you go to Mr. Kilner's chambers? - A. I went upon hearing the word watch called; I was not the first that went up; when I went up, Mr. Kilner was supporting himself at his own chamber door.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you go into his chamber with him? - A. No; I examined where the bullet had struck, I found it in the wall of the second staircase.</p>

               <p>Q. How near Mr. Talbot's door? - A.About three feet.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from the landing-place? - A. About two foot, it is level with the third stair upon the second flight. (Produces the bill.)</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were the first watchman that go up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you find Mr. Kilner? - A. Inside his outer door, the door was a little a-jar, he smiled at me when I opened the door.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you take him into custody? - A. No, I did not, I only staid at the door, that he should not go out nor come in; he was taken up the next day; I believe, the boy called out, thieves, and said, they are gone in there, and pointed to Mr. Kilner's door.</p>

               <p>Q. After the pistol was fired? - A. Yes; Mr. Kilner stood with the door in his hand, then Mr Raincock came out of his chambers on the same floor, in his shirt, and said, Mr. Kilner, you have not any design against me, and he said, no, nor any person else</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BLACKMAN sworn. - (Produces a pistol;) I found it in Mr. Kilner's pocket the next day, at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>DR. SIMS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Serjeant Best.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the gentleman who now stands at the bar? - A. Many years, I dare say, a dozen years.</p>

               <p>Q. What has been the state of his mind? - A. Above four years, I suppose, he has had very severe turns of insanity; I attended him at his chambers in the King's-bench, and at a private mad-house, kept by a Mr. Warburton.</p>

               <p>Q.During the time you attended him, was he insane? - A.Perfectly so.</p>

               <p>Q.Could you form any judgment of what probably was the state of his mind at this time? - A. My opinion is, that he never will be so serene as not to be liable to it, if any thing agitated his mind; and upon being applied to, to certify that he might be allowed to be at liberty, I most positively refused it, I was convinced it would be attended with dangerous consequences, either to himself or the public, it he was at large; he was then got into that state of mind, that he became very cunning, and able to conceal his insanity, except when certain subjects were touched upon; finding that I would not certity, they came again to me, telling me, that Dr. Wills, who had attended him along with me, during some of his turns of insanity, would certify if I would; I was surprised at it; I said, I would see Dr. Willis, and if I found I was in an error, I would submit; and I found they had been with him in the same manner to endeavour to get him to certify; I saw him several times afterwards, and have passed him in the street; I saw him in the spring, and could not but observe that he was deranged, and in a state of agitation; he would sometimes run, then stop, screw his face in various ways, mutter and talk to himself, I was then thoroughly convinced he was insane.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When was he at Hoxton? - A. It might be about from two to three years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. You have not attended him since his leaving that place to this time? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN KIRBY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>

               <p>Q. You have had the prisoner in your care? - A. Yes; on the 19th of November, 1800, he was with me, he received sentence from the Court of King's bench to be imprisoned eight months, for sending a challenge.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you see any thing particular in his conduct? - A. Yes, and I gave strict orders that he should not be irritated.</p>

               <p>Q. Were those orders given by you upon the idea that he was not correct in his senses? - A. Yes; I went with him in a coach, when he was remanded, and I wished him to make an apology to the Court, and he said, he would not; he appeared to have a deranged mind all the time he was with me; he was musing by himself, and would not speak at times.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has he been with you the last time? - A. I don't know to a day.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060044"></xptr>Q.Has his conduct been of the same nature as that which passed in 1800? - A.Much the same.</p>

               <p>Court. You say, you considered him as deranged, what were the grounds of that opinion? - A. He would not speak sometimes; when I have said, how do you do, he insisted upon it, that my man belonged to a mad-house, and was watching him; I told him he was a very decent man, and did not belong to a mad-house, and he said, he knew better.</p>

               <p>The Jury pronounced their verdict NOT GUILTY,</p>

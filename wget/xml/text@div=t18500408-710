                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Old Park-farm, Enfield; the prisoner was in my service. On 22nd Feb. I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to fetch thirty-nine bushel sieves—the sum to pay for them was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for the turnpike-gate—he was to bring only thirty-nine sieves, because the man had made a mistake, and sent me twenty-one instead of twenty the time before—on my return from town the prisoner was there to take my horse—I said, "Have you got the baskets?"—he said yes, he had paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was for one more than he had brought, because the man sent one over the last time—some time afterwards a man called on me about the baskets—I had in the meantime discharged the prisoner—he had lived with me, on and off, for three, or four, or five years—I think it is about five years since he first came—he was then a very little boy.</p>

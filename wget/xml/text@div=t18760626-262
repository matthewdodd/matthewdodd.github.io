                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 184). Michael Ryan was locked up in Coldbath Fields prison last Saturday night—I was in Victoria Street on 20th May, at 5.15 p.m., and saw the prisoner and Michael Ryan quarrelling—the prisoner wanted me to lock Ryan up for assaulting her, I told her to apply to the Magistrate for a summons—she said "If that is all I can get I will have my revenge," and she ran after him and struck him three or four times on the back of the neck—he bled—I saw something white in her hand, which she threw into the road.</p>

I was house-surgeon at the Westminster Hospital; Ryan was brought there—he had five punctured wounds on the back of his neck and one on his left shoulder and one on each hand—they were bleeding—they were not serious—they might have been caused by this knife—I dressed the wounds—I suppose he is getting on well, but I have not seen him lately—his necktie was cut through.</p>

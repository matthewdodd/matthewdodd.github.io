On the 16th of March, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour behind my shop. I heard footsteps in the shop, turned my head, and saw a tall man going out with two rolls of flannel under his arm. I jumped up, hallooed very loud, and followed him; he threw it down and ran up a gateway close to the house, which is no thoroughfare. I went up there with a crowd of people, and saw him turn up to the wall, as if for a necessary purpose, but his dress was not unbuttoned. I took him back - it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You lost sight of him as he turned the corner, I suppose - A. Yes, for the moment. The gateway leads to Mr. Johnson's manufactory, who has a number of work people - every door in the gateway was shut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say that he had come from the manufactory - A. No, my Lord.</p>

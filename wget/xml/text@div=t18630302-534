                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living in Lambeth-square—on 19th February, about a quarter-past 2 o'clock, I was knocking at the door of the Starlight public-house, Blackfriars-road, and I felt the prisoner, who came in front of me, give a tug at my watch—I had not seen him before—I halloed out to my friend, "Tom, my watch is gone"—the prisoner ran away and tripped me up, and I fell on my back; another man gave me a shove—my watch was not found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You said you were knocked down in front of the bar? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That was in the early part of the evening; this was after 1 o'clock—my watch was safe at a quarter to 2; I looked when I came out of the public-house—you are the person who took it out of my waistcoat-pocket—several persons were there, a good many of our own workmen; I knew most of those who were there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and was with him when he was knocking at the door in the Blackfriars-road—I did not notice any other people trying to get in—there were three or four of our friends that had come from the party—I heard my father cry out, and then for the first time I saw the prisoner come out of the crowd, and run off—there was another man standing outside, and I heard one of them say, "Have you got it?" but I do not know which—I ran after the prisoner, down the Blackfriars-road, and gave him into custody.</p>

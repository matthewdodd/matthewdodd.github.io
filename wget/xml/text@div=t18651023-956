On 7th October, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I went to 9, Victoria-road, to the top floor, and on the lauding, in a corner, between the bedroom-door and the front sitting-room I found a quantity of paper-ashes—the landing was wet, and a corner of it was charred from burning—Mr. Morris's door was very much burnt—I had a lantern with me, and saw on the landing a heap of light paper-ashes, which! I brushed away with my hand, and underneath I found a quantity of burnt paper journals, All the Year Round, and other journals, partly burnt; part of a <hi rend="italic">Domestic Magazine</hi>, and part of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>—I was in company with a fireman, and there were several people in the house—I handed the pieces of paper to Inspector Barber—one panel of Mr. Morris's door was burnt through, and the door was very much burnt, principally on the outside—I went from there into the kitchen, and there I found a cup board which had been very much burned, more inside than out—I also found a few pieces of paper there, of the same description—they smelt very strong of paraffin oil in both places—I went into the servant's bedroom, put my hand under the clothes, and found that the bed was warm—her petticoats were on a chair at the foot of the bed—I saw the prisoner in the passage, and said, "Are you the landlord of the house?"—he said, "No, I rent the house"—I said, "Where do you sleep?"—he said, "I sleep here," showing me into a front room, down-stairs—I found an impression on the bed, and turned the things back, but it felt quite cold—the. prisoner was present, and I said, "The servant's bed is quite warm, and yours is quite cold; how do you account for that?"—he said, "I suppose it is because the fire was nearer to it"—I did not feel quite satisfied, left the house, and went to the station—at 9 o'clock I went back, and made a thorough examination with Inspector Barber—I again examined the cupboard in the kitchen, and under it I found a quantity more of the same journal, All the Year Round, the thickness of five or six numbers, saturated with what I believe was paraffin—the cupboard was about an inch from the boards—these burnt papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found on the landing and under the cupboard in the kitchen—I also found some pieces of what looked like a</p>

               <p>the upper landing near the bedroom door, the bottom part of which was burnt through, also the bottom part of the cupboard in the kitchen—there I had been two distinct fires, and a portion of the debris in both cases was strongly impregnated with paraffin oil—the prisoner was insured for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the County Fire Office, of which 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for household furniture, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for working tools—on the 8th I inspected the lower part of the premises occupied by the prisoner—I made a cursory survey only, as I saw there would be no claim against the company, as the fire had been confined to the upper part of the house—I should estimate the value of the furniture at 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I did not examine the contents of the drawers or cupboards—the linen was included in the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Joseph Hartley and others, in Queen-street, Cheapside—the prisoner was in their employ. On 17th May I told him to put up the shutters—instead of following my directions, he went up to the first floor warehouse—I followed him in a minute or two, and saw him run from behind the door, and run behind a pile of woollen cloth—I saw he was endeavouring to secrete something in his coat pocket or behind his coat—I asked him what he had got, and he pulled out three or four knots of silk, weighing 1 1/4 lbs.; they were the property of Messrs. Hartley—I had been weighing silk previously—he merely said that he was taking a skein or two—he had no authority to do so—I told him we had missed a great quantity of silk—he made no reply—I told him we had missed a great quantity of staylaces; he said, "Staylaces?"—I said, "Yes"—he made no further reply—this is the silk he had, it is worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was behind his coat—he had not buttoned his coat—he was at the silk drawer when I went up—he had no right to be in the warehouse at all—he had been ordered to put the shutters up.</p>

            . I manage the prosecutor's business. I was out on Tuesday morning, the 20th of May, and on my return one of the men told me a quantity of copper was gone; I looked, and missed 90 lbs. or better; Gornall was then out, but Wilcox was in the shop - he was sent out, and when Gornall returned I taxed him with it; he at first denied it, but afterwards confessed it; I told him he had better confess, as it was the only method to induce the prosecutor to be kind to him; when Wilcox returned I said the same to him, and they then said the copper had been sold to Whitaker, in Church-street; I went there, but there was no copper there - Whitaker acknowledged he had bought copper of them to the amount of 20 lbs. or better, but said he had sold it to a person who came round to purchase metal of him, and he was not acquainted with the name or residence of that person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know, except from the boys, that there was any copper lost? A. From what the man told me.</p>

I am a baker of Suffolk Place, Bethnal Green—the prisoner lodged in the same house—I work at night—on 28th Sept., in the afternoon, I was in my bed asleep, and was awoke by the prisoner, who was on my bed, stabbing me—he had a chisel raised in his right hand, making another stab, but I pushed him off the bed—he then</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on 28th September—the prisoner and prosecutor were both brought there—Snelgrove was suffering from seven wounds, one of which went through his cheek into his mouth—another was on his scalp going down to his skull, one on his wrist, and one on his hand—they could all be inflicted with the chisel—the prisoner had a transverse wound on his throat passing into the larynx—he was bleeding freely and in great danger—I brought the edges together and strapped them, but two nights after<lb></lb>wards I found that the wound had been reopened—he said that he had done it because he could not get anything to drink—during the time he was under my charge he was in a very excited condition, and the second time he attempted suicide he appeared to be suffering from delirium, and my impression is that he was suffering from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> then, but not when he was first brought in—he had no delusions, but he answered questions absurdly, he gave answers which had no connection with the questions.</p>

               <p>he first came in—there is a great difference between delirium and <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—he said that Snelgrove came and cut his throat—in my opinion that was a delusion, but my impression is that it was not a delu<lb></lb>sion then; it was a false statement—I do not think he believed what he stated to me, I think he invented something—he was not delirious, in my judgment, when he made that statement—he made it when he was brought into the reserve room and afterwards in the ward—he was not delirious—I did not consider him delirious till the second night, when he attempted to open the wound—we had to put a straight waistcoat on him and to watch him night and day for several weeks—he was not delirious after the second night, but he was excited—there are different degrees of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—it is possible but not probable that the symptoms would go off in one day.</p>

               <p>I am a clockmaker in Shoe-lane, I work with Samuel Row, who lives the corner of Harp-alley; I am not come with a design to vindicate the conduct of the prisoner, nor do I know any thing of the robbery; I am come to let you know that I am sensible there is a man here that would not be here if it was not for the reward; a few days after the prisoner was committed, Woodward took an opportunity while I was in the shop with him, I am a shop-mate of his, to propose bringing ten pounds to me to go into the country, to be in partnership with him; this was after the prisoner was committed, he said I seemed surprised how he should come by ten pounds, he told me if I would keep it a secret he would let me know; he said he had an affair in hand that would bring in some money, upon which I promised secresy, not knowing the business; at this time nobody was present but us two; he then told me, he had stopped a thief, I observed to him I did not think it was in his power, because I thought he was so slight; he then acknowledged that Woodward took the watch out of his hand, and gave it to the owner, and that there was forty pounds reward, and ten pounds from the parish, and that he and the Irishman would have it between them, I told him that I thought it was more likely that the prosecutor and constable would have the reward; he said that he knew better how to go about the business this time than he did the last, alluding to a similar circumstance, and that the patrol and the constable, and the prosecutor would have none of the money, for they did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>How came you to think this would be at all material to the prisoner? - As I was convinced in my own mind that he was actuated by a bad principle.</p>
               <p>No bad principle at all if he speaks the truth.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Has this witness misbehaved? - He was one of those at the Pitt's head that was abusing Woodward, and called him blood-hound, and I told him yesterday that if he persisted in that behaviour in order to intimidate an evidence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140145"></xptr> I would bring him into court, and he desisted upon that.</p>
               <p>Woodward. Upon this they they have discharged me from my business.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He has been with me once or twice to get what he could out of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Was Woodward attending here upon the court when this man insulted him? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>This man knew that he was attending for that purpose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Swear Woodward to that and I will commit this man to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Woodward. Please your Lordship, he has been about to all the masters of the trade to hinder me from business.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very imporper conduct, but not within the jurisdiction of the court? - We were in the publichouse yesterday getting a little refreshment, and he came in with two or three more, and he stood up, and after that he called out of the window as far as ever he could see me, ah! you blood-hound, you blood-hound, and the people got round so, he has done all he could to hinder me from attending upon the court.</p>

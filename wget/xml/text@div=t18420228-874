About eleven or twelve o'clock at night, on the 1st of February, I was coming over London-bridge—the prisoner laid hold of my arm, and asked me to treat her—I said I had no money, and begged her to let go of my arm—she kept walking on, and said, "Oh yes, you have"—I said, "I am not going to give you any"—I begged her to let go my arm—we walked to the corner of Gracechurch-street—I felt my watch then—when we got as far as Leadenhall-market, she pulled me down one of the turnings—(I had been drinking in the course of the even<lb></lb>ing)—we walked through the market, and came to Leadenhall-street—finding I was out of my road, I felt in my pocket, and found my watch ribbon had been cut, and my watch, and a sovereign, three half-crows. and some silver gone from my waistcoat-pocket, and my handkerchief from my great coat pocket—I charged her with stealing my watch—a man came up, and said, "Friend, you must be mistaken, this woman never robbed you"—I said, "Stand off"'—the policeman came up, and I gave her into custody—a knife was found in her hand, and one sovereign three half-crowns, and three shillings, were found on her—no watch was</p>

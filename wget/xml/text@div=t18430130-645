                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Penton-street, on the night of the 2nd of February, and saw the prisoner carrying this harness under his arm—I stopped him, and asked him where he was going to take them—he said he was going to take them to a waterman named Bartlett, in Penton-street, that Mr. Wilson had sold them to him for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took him into custody—as he went along, he said he hoped Mr. Wilson would not be sent for—he said, sooner than there should be any bother made about it, and Mr. Wilson should know any thing about it, he would throw the harness away.</p>

I should say, about a quarter of an hour—I asked him several questions—he said, "You know me?"—I said, "Yes, you are foreman to Mr. Wilson"—he said, "Yes, it is all right"—I did not put more questions to him respecting the harness, after he said he was going to take the things to Bartlett—I said, "You have been some time with Mr. Wilson," and so on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Elizabeth Wilson, and keep livery-stables at Holloway—this harness is our property—the prisoner has been in our service from eight to ten years—he had no authority to take the harness—I never sold them to Bartlett, or any body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know Bartlett? A. Yes—we keep about 230 horses, and forty or fifty sets of harness, not all of the same kind as this—we have a good deal more of different sorts—we wear out a good deal—I have sold cast-off harness to Bartlett—I do not recollect doing so more than twice—I believe he has bought more at our establishment, but not of me—the prisoner has been a very good servant, we never had a better—I know this harness by the furniture—I had two sets at once—there is nothing very peculiar about it, but it is just the same as I ordered them—I have had it more than twelve months—this loin-pannier we have had about four years—I never authorised the prisoner to sell my harness—I think my sister generally sold the harness, when I did not, to Bartlett.</p>

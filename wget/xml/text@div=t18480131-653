                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. De Yonge, an engineer, at 80, Featherstone-street, Gray's-inn-road. On the morning of 9th Jan., I saw the prisoner Lee in front of his house, about a quarter-past eight o'clock—I went into the area of 79, and watched, and saw Reardon open the door of 80—Lee was against the door—there was no knock—Lee stepped just inside the door, and I saw Reardon give her a bundle, which did not appear bigger than a peck measure—it looked like a bundle of clothes, it was tied in an apron—Lee went with it down the street—I followed her, and round the next turning I stopped her with it—I said I must know what she had got—she said, "What I have got!"—I said, "Yes; I must know what you have got"—she began to beg and pray, and said it was only a few coals she had from the servant—I said if that was all she had got. she should not hear any more from me at present—there was a hole in the apron—I saw what was in it—I went home and told my master—he sent me for a policeman, and Reardon was given in charge—she said she was very sorry, she had only given a few coals away, and she would pay for them—after she was taken to the station, I went with the policeman to Lee's lodgings—Reardon gave me the direction—I did not see Lee there—I found there nearly half a hundred weight of coals, some of them of the same sort as my master was burning—there might have been about twenty pounds of coals in the bundle—next day I found Lee was in custody—I am sure she is the person.</p>

I know the prisoners; I believe they are cowkeepers, and term themselves slaughtermen—they live at No. 8, Mitcham-street, Lisson-grove, about ten minutes' walk from my premises—I have a cow shed in Burwood-mews; I had three cows there on 13th Feb.—I had bought the last two about three months ago, they cost me 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—two of them were very full of milk; one was very forward in calf—early on the morning of 14th Feb. I went to my cow shed in Burwood-mews, and found the three cows gone—they were the only cows I had—I had a servant named Robert Amos</p>

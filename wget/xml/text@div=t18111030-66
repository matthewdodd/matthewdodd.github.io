               <p>Q.Was Stephen Read in your employment lately - A. He was a hat stiffener in our employ. We searched Read's premises and found a hat finished fit for wear; in consequence of that we had Read taken up and tried at Union-hall, and Mr. Hanks went with a constable to Lowe's house.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HANKS. I am a hatter, I reside at No. 6, Broad Wall, Blackfriars-road.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an apprentice of the name of George - A. Yes. On the 17th of August I went with George and Cooper to Mr. Lowe's house in Ratcliffe Highway, he is a retailer of hats; I went into the shop, I said, Mr. Lowe, you have been buying hats in an unsaleable state of my apprentice, I am given to understand; he said he did not know that he had; I said you have bought of my apprentice yesterday, and I demand a sight of the hats, as the goods were stolen; we asked where the goods were; he said, they were backwards; the constable and he went into the workshop behind, and brought the goods into the shop; his wife then came into the shop; she said, for God's sake, what is the matter; the prisoner was so struck he could not answer; I told her that the goods that Mr. Lowe bought yesterday were stolen goods; she said, the Lord forbid, and then said to my apprentice, you wicked wretch, you knew the goods were stolen, how could you bring these things to my husband, and distress me in the manner you are a doing. The constable took the goods and told Lowe he must go with us to Union-hall I believe; he was taken to Union-hall. While I was in the coach I said, Mr. Lowe, these are good goods for the money; he said he thought he had given sufficient, he thought the hats were covered with hares wool. At Union-hall George was asked how many hats he had sold to Mr. Low, he said eight; Mr. Lowe was asked, he said he had purchased eight. We took four first and nine more in the afternoon. They were unfinished unstiffened hats, eight of them, and four were trimmed up ready for wear.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it part of the retailers business to stiffen hats - A. It is not common.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the selling price of these hats in this state - A. I should expect sixteen shillings, because we are liable to a discount of five per cent.</p>
               <p>Q. What did these hats cost the manufacturer - A. Without they know the materials that they are made of they cannot tell within a shilling or two: it is the worst state that a hat can be sold. I do not suppose I could manufacture them under thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in these hats to see if there were any marks - A. The marks were D O.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In the same state in which these hats were a person might be deceived two or three shillings - A. They might be two shillings in that state.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not occur to you that a little maker may sell at times under the price - A. Very often; they never sell to a maker.</p>
               <p>Q. They would sell to a person that kept a shop - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. At Mr. Lowe's you found a workshop behind his selling shop.</p>
               <p>Q. He is himself a hat-maker and hat-seller, and therefore is himself competent to do any work to the making a hat - A. So I am informed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you that he had been buying hats of your apprentice did not he say he did not know he was your apprentice, or any apprentice - A. I believe them are his words. I do not believe that Mr. Lowe or Mrs. Lowe from what they said, knew any thing of their being stolen hats.</p>

            . I am an officer at Union-hall. I went with Mr. Plank to search Mr. Lowe's premises. In the back premises I found four hats dyed and unstiffened.</p>
               <p>Q. You know something of the business of a hatter, I believe - A. I am a hatter by trade. I found these hats under the stall-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there in that part of the premises the necessaries for stiffening - A. Yes, to make shift to do it in a very small way indeed. It is not usual for hat-makers to sell them dyed and unstiffened, they are so likely to become damaged in the dye, they generally sell them in the grey. We found at Mr. Lowe's nine hats in all, four dyed and unfinished, and five finished, besides the four that were produced at Union-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Plank. You went with Lammond and George to the house of the prisoner - A. I did, I was present when these nine hats were found. The hats are our property.</p>

Yes, he told me to take them to Mr. Lowe's house to sell them, and to ask ten shillings, to take what I could get for them, and to bring the money to him, he was to satisfy me for going with them. I went with the hats to Mr. Lowe's, he was not at home; I left the hats there till the next day, and on the next day I went into the shop, I saw Mr. Lowe; I told Mr. Lowe that I had left four hats that a young man had sent me with; he asked me his name, I told him Read; he looked at the hats and said nine shillings were as much as they were worth, he thought they were covered with hares wool; he gave me thirty-six shillings for the four. This was two months before I was taken up. I gave the money to Read, he gave me five shillings for my trouble. About two or three days before I was taken up Read left four more hats at my lodgings for me to take to Mr. Lowe's. I went to Mr. Lowe's, I told him I had brought four more hats for sale; he looked at them and said, nine shillings was what he gave me before.

I directed a letter to be sent to him by my son - I do not know that it was sent on the day it is dated, 25th of December, 1824; but it was sent about that time - I sent in it a 1l. note of Mr. Kinner's, the bank at Newcastle, payable in London - I do not know whether I received an answer to this letter; but I think I must, or I should have been uneasy about it - I afterwards received a letter from Mr. Robinson, and my son wrote a letter in consequence of it, in which I inclosed two local notes of 1l. each, one of them was Mr. Kinner's - I believe.</p>
               <p>These letters were here read: - the first dated 25th of December, 1824, stating that a 1l. note was enclosed, and the second dated 24th of May, 1825, enclosed two 1l. notes. I did not receive any answer to this letter for some time; and I then wrote to the landlord of the house.</p>

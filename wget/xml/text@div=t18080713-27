In the manufacturing of feathers there is a large quantity of waste; Gaskin was employed by me in selling the waste. We cut open the bag and found five pounds and three quarters of the best feathers. After the discovery of the robbery Gaskin said they were some loose feathers that were laying loose about the floor; I observed to him that he knew better, as well as I, that there were none loose, that they were all in bags. I examined the bags and found some gone.</p>
               <p>Figgett. That is the same bag that I stopped; there were five pounds and three quarters of the best feathers at the bottom of the bag. The waste was on the top.</p>

             spoke to me for twenty eight pound of waste for an acquaintance of his, he said she was coming on Saturday morning about eight o'clock. About nine o'clock Grey came in with the woman, he told me there was the woman that came after the feathers; I weighed them. Knowing that she wanted waste, I took a bag which had at the bottom some swan, with some sweepings of the house; I saw they were swan feathers under when I put the waste in; I could not then unmix them when I had shot them down in the bag; the bag was to be brought back on Saturday night.</p>

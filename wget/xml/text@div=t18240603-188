I came home about nine, and missed two counterpanes, two sheets, and a blanket; they belonged to Mr. Davis - I had the use of them; I did not know the prisoner; but as I went out I saw a black man standing in the street, next door to a cook shop - I cannot swear that it was the prisoner. I saw the property again that night, at Parsons's, in Blue Anchor-yard, which is about a quarter of a mile off, and am sure they are the same. I had lodged in the room six months. I locked the door when I went out, and am certain that I left the window fastened; but on returning I found the door open; the window was shut; whoever had come must have entered at the door; the holt of the lock was not shot - it must have been opened by a false key.</p>

            . I live in Blue Anchor-yard. The prisoner took a room of me four or five days before this happened, and on the 5th of May, about ten o'clock at night, he came in in a bustle, and wanted a candle - my wife asked him for the rent, which be refused; she said she would see if the things in his room were safe - I went into his room, and saw these counterpanes, sheets, and blankets; he said they were his own - I said I should detain them till I knew further about it. I locked them inside, kept him out, and told the watchman. Bath saw them about eleven o'clock, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She told the gentlemen that she knew nothing about me. The last time I came from Jamacia I fell in with her, went to her room, and was robbed of 2 l. 4 s.; she promised to return it next day, but I could not get it, and on this night I saw a young man named William, whom she had robbed of 8 s.; he took these clothes, and left them at my place. He wanted me to take them, but I would not. I said they were mine, but they belonged to this man.</p>

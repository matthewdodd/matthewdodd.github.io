               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not request you the first time to take them back? A. No, you did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not say Mr. Stevens was our clerk; I said he was town-traveller and head warehouseman. Witness. All I saw in the warehouse was about as much horse-hair as would fill a hat, and two or three empty boxes.</p>

            . A person in the name of Stevens called on the Wednesday afternoon, and ordered a pair of boots, price 1l. 8s., to go home before four o'clock on Saturday - he left this card - (read) "Christie and Co., warehousemen, No. 60, Aldermanbury, London;" I sent the boots there with the bill and receipt, and directed they should not be parted with without the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had only been in their employ two or three days; after Bell had left, Christie came and took the boots - he said he would take them to Mr. Stevens, and told me I might shut up and leave the place; I was in their employ, at 15s. a week.</p>

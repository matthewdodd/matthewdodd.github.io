                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 233). I am stationed at West Ham. On the night of 19th March, I was in High Street, Stratford—I know the portico of the prosecutor's house—it was covered with lead—I saw it safe at 10 o'clock that night, when I went on duty—at 2 o'clock the next morning I was still on duty, and saw the prisoner and another man, and a woman together near the prosecutor's house—when I came to them, the two men walked away and the woman stood still, apparently to watch me—I went on down the street and met the other constable—I then heard a whistle, which came in a direction from the prosecutor's house—I came back—there was a wagon coming along the street, and I and the other constable went behind it and walked up the street—when we got within a few yards of the prosecutor's house, the prisoner, another man, and the woman were coming in a direction from the prosecutor's house, and I saw the prisoner had something under his jacket—I took hold of him by the collar—the other man ran away—the other constable ran after him, leaving me, and the prisoner, and the lead, and the woman, all there together—I struggled with the prisoner, and the lead dropped from him—I still kept hold of his jacket—he struggled and got away—I tore this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off his jacket—I took the lead to the station—the other man was there, but he was discharged—I went back and looked at the prosecutor's house, and</p>

               <p>the lead was-gone from the portico—I took this piece of lead there in the daylight, and it fitted the portico exactly—it weighs about half a cwt.</p>

I was on duty at Stratford, and received information of this robbery on the morning of the 20th—I have been searching for the prisoner, but I could not find him till 4th May, when I found him in his own house at Stratford—I told him the charge—he said that he knew nothing about it—on conveying him to the station, he said that he wished he had stood his ground, for he did not suppose he should get more than twelve months of it—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, that is the coat you had on when you made your escape from the policeman, and you have got another piece put on it"—he said, "Yes."</p>

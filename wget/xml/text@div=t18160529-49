            . I am an attorney. In December last, I lived in James-street, Lambeth Marsh. I became acquainted with the prisoner on the 1st of December last; he and Austen called at my residence; the prisoner said he came in consequence of my letter relative to the reversion of five hundred pounds at the death of a lady aged sixty. I asked him what he expected for it, and he said, three hundred and fifty pounds. I then stated to him that it was necessary I should have an extract of the will from the Commons, under which the lady claimed. He said, he should get it, and nothing farther passed at that interview. I think I saw him next on the 8th, he called on me in company with Austen, with the extract, and shewed it to me. On perusing the extract of the will, and observing it to be in the names of the trustees, I said, that the surviving trustee must join in the transfer; the prisoner thought not. I told him, I should apply to some one professionably, and I applied to Messrs. Ballachi and Bridges, they are solicitors in Angel-court, Throgmorton-street; I went to their office shortly after I received the extract; I saw Mr. Ballachi. I afterwards communicated to the prisoner what passed. I told him that two hundred and seventy pounds or two hundred and seventy-five pounds had been offered, and Mr. Ballachi said it depended on the nature of the stock, The prisoner said it was worth three hundred and fifty pounds; but I was to do the best I could. I told him Mr. Ballachi had said that the trustee must join, and I recommended Boyce to go down to Tasker to ask him his conset to the deed of assignment; I understood he lived at Dartford. In five or six days the prisoner proposed to go down. I think he next came on the 20th of December; he came with Austen; they generally came together; he said, he had been down to Mr. Tasker, and had obtained his consent to execute the deed, and requested that the business might be expedited. I mentioned to him that certificates of the deaths of certain parties were necessary to be produced. The prisoner and Austen came together on the 20th; the prisoner said he had been down to Mr. Tasker, at Dartford, and obtained his consent, and Mr. Walker was his attorney. Upon that, I called on Messrs. Ballachi and Co. and told the prisoner afterwards what passed at that interview. I saw the prisoner again at the latter end of December; Austen was with him. I told the prisoner I had been to Ballachi and Bridges's, and two hundred pounds was offered for this; this was at the New York coffee-house, and I said, I thought it was too little, and I recommended him not to take it. However he requested me to try if I could get two hundred and fifty pounds. I went to Messrs. Ballachi and Bridges's; Mr. Ballachi was out of Town, and I informed the prisoner after that, that they would extend it to two hundred and ten pounds, and the expences to be paid out of the two hundred and ten pounds. The prisoner said, they would take it. On that, I went to Mr. Bridges's, and told him to prepare the draft of the deed of assignment, as it would be taken. I received the draft of the assignment, I think on the 8th of January, also a letter accompanying it, directed to Mr. Walker, of Dartford. I handed that note and the draft to Mr. Boyce, on the same day, I think, at the New York coffee-house; it was then perused by Boyce, and he said, he should go as that afternoon to Tasker. That is the draft. He proposed going down with the draft and letter, and to see Mr. Walker besides. In the evening of the following day, Mr. Austen came to me, and gave me that draft; there was something written on it then which had not been written before. I saw Boyce a day or two afterwards, at the New York coffee-house, and he then merely asked if the business was going on. I said, you have been to Dartford, and seen Mr. Tasker and Mr. Walker; and he said, he had, I said, I supposed the attorney had been paid, and mentioned that a guinea was usual to be paid; and he said, he had been paid; nothing more passed. The draft was left with me, and I handed it to Messrs. Ballachi and Bridges for the purpose of being endorsed. I received the deed, accompanied by a letter, on Sunday, the 14th of January. That is it. I look at the power of attorney; I saw that at the same time. Boyce called on me the same after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290028"></xptr>noon, and I told him I had procured the deed, with the power of attorney and letter, and stated to him the manner in which it ought to be executed, and he appeared to be extremely ill, and I thought he was very ill, and I asked him, and he said, he was; and I told him, I would go down to Mr. Tasker and Mr. Walker, and see the business executed, and he said, there is no occasion for that, I will go. I then delivered the deed and power of attorney to him. I understood he was going down that evening. I was to see him the next day at one o'clock; I did not see him. Austen came to me with the deed and power of attorney, as executed; as they are now; they purported to be executed by

            . I then immediately went to Ballachi and Bridges, but it was too late to get the stock transfered that day.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was Austen alone when you met him at the coffee-house, and he gave you the papers as executed?</p>
               <p>Witness. Yes. I saw Boyce the next morning; Austen was with him then; Boyce asked whether the business was done; and I told him I had been to the stock-broker, Mr. Watts, and it appeared on looking at two powers of attorney, one signed John Tasker, 1801, and the other, the present, that they were quite different, and the transfer could not be made until that difference of hand-writing was accounted for. Boyce said, it was very extraordinary. I said, that the gentlemen of the Bank directed me to send a letter to Mr. Tasker, to account for the difference, and it must be put into the post; I did write such a letter, and kept a copy of it; I shewed it to Boyce when I had written it. I proposed to put it into the post; but Boyce said it would go quicker by a returned post chaise, which would go from the Kent-road, and I made an observation that the gentlemen of the Bank expected it to go by the post, as I thought I would take it myself, it did not make any difference; accordingly I folded the letter up in a parcel, and sealed it up, and directed it to Mr. Tasker, Boyce and Austen then accompanied me to the Bull Inn, Kent-road. On going into the parlour, I took up the paper; soon after, Boyce came into me, and said, Mr. Gill, there is a chaise at the door, and the post-boy is in the tap-room. I then went into the tap-room, and gave the parcel to the boy, and asked him if he knew Mr. Tasker, and he said, he did. I asked the boy his name, and he said, 
               <persName id="t18160529-49-person475">
                  Charles 
                  Ward

            . Boyce paid him a shilling, and I strictly enjoyned the boy to deliver the parcel to Mr. Tasker the moment he got down, and he assured me he would. I then adjourned into the private room, and the chaise drove off. Boyce did not go in with me; he came in in ten minutes afterwards. I think I saw him afterwards; but I am not quite certain.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LONG. In all the subsequent interviews, Austen was present. I am not certain as to the particular days. When the draft was brought, Boyce was not present, nor when the deed and letter of attorney were brought after supposed execution.</p>

            . I am a boat-builder; I came to Town in December last. I had occasion to see the prisoner, to whom I had written about some money from Rye. When I came to Town, I applied to him about some money in the funds, which was coming to me in right of my wife after the death of my mother-in-law. I saw Mr. Gill several times with the prisoner, After I had seen Mr. Gill several times. I received that draft from Boyce, which he had had to take to Dartford. I can't particularly say when I had received it. I took it to Mr. Gill in the same state as when I received it from the prisoner. The prisoner said he could not attend himself, having an appointment to go else where, and I took it then to Mr. Gill. I afterwards received two more from the prisoner at the Griffin, in Eagle-street, Red Lion-square; there was nobody else there but he and I; I believe it is in the County of Middlesex. These are the papers he produced. There was not then my own name, nor that of my wife. The prisoner was very ill through going to Dartford, and he said it had knocked him up; he said, I was to sign my own name and my wife's, which I refused, wishing to stop until I got to Messrs. Bridges's and Ballachi's, and the prisoner was very angry, and called me a fool, and by his persuation, I signed it there, not thinking any harm. I signed my own name, and my wife's. The prisoner said that it was lawful that I might sign it, and I, not knowing the nature of the law, did so accordingly. The prisoner told me to take them to Mr. Gill, and say that he could not attend as he was so ill. Nothing was said about my wife's signing. I took the deed and power and met Mr. Gill, at the New York Coffee-house, I delivered them to Gill in the same state as I received them from Boyce, only with the addition of my own and my wife's names. From the New York Coffee-house, I went with Gill, to Bridges's and Ballachi's; It was two late that day for the stock to be transfered, and we met again, and the next day to the best of knowledge, I went to the Kent-road. The prisoner at the bar was to have thiry pounds, and said he must be well paid, for he had a great deal of trouble with it.</p>

            . I received directions from Mr. Gill to prepare an assignment of transfer. That is the draft. I think I saw the prisoner twice on this business. He came soon after Mr. Gill, and inquired if Mr. Gill had made application for the preparation of these? I told him he had, and he was perfectly satisfied. And then he came with Austen afterwards. I made this power of attorney. The last time he came was to know how it was getting on; he thought it was not necessary that the surviving trustee should join. Nothing farther passed with the prisoner. I sent a letter with the papers.</p>

            . I am a postillion; I live at the Bull Inn, Dartford. I remember coming with my chaise to the Bull Inn, Kent-road. I saw the prisoner at the bar there, and Mr. Gill. I received a parcel from Mr. Gill at the Bull; the prisoner was with him. The prisoner first asked me, was I going to Dartford, and I said, I was. He then asked me if I would take a parcel down for him; I told him, I would. Then he went for Mr. Gill, and Mr. Gill brought the parcel, and gave it to me; Boyce then told me to be sure to give it to Mr. Tasker, and I said, I would as soon as I got home, and I left them standing there, and I put my horses too, and went off. I had nearly got to the World Turned Upside Down, about a quarter of a mile, when I saw Boyce, the prisoner, who came after me; a person hallooed out that somebody was calling after me; I stopped, and looked round, and saw the prisoner, and he said, you have almost put me out of breath; I will thank you for the parcel, I have something to put in it. I said, I will wait a few minutes; I returned the parcel to him; he said he had something more. I said, I would wait a few minutes if he liked, He said, it was no consequence, I might go, and keep the shilling, for he would not detain me. He never returned the parcel; I drove on without it.</p>

About the middle of December last, or some where there about, I can't say to a week or ten days; the prisoner called upon me; he said, he waited on me on the part of Austen. He said, Austen wished to dispose of his reversionary interest in the stock belonging to his mother-in-law, and I told him, I had had sufficiently trouble with it already; I was engaged as a trustee, and should fulfill that trust; but I would not involve myself in any trouble, and I told him, I would have nothing farther to do with it; that was my final answer. I saw him again in the middle of January. The first time he mentioned that the deed should be prepared, I told him that I could not binder him from transfering; but I should not become a party to any deed, and if it were made, I should refer it to my attorney. When he came a second time, he said, he came with a copy of a deed; I told him, I was very much surprized at that, because I had told him, I would not become a party; and he said, surely, I would look at it; and I told him I should not. He asked me should he shew it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290030"></xptr>my attorney; and I told him, he might exert his own discretion; but if he took up my attorney's time, he must pay him for it, I look at the power of attorney; that signature

               <p>"I received last night a letter from Mr.

            , desiring me to write to you, saying, if I signed a power of attorney on Monday, the 15th instant, for Mr. Austen, to Mr. Smallbones. I have only to say, that I not only signed a power of attorney, but a deed also at Mr. Walker's, my attorney. Mr. Gill tells me that a power of attorney I signed in 1801, is different from the one I signed on Monday, the 15th; but it should be recollected that I do not write now as I did then; fifteen years you must allow, will alter a man's writing; and also that I write my name some times Jno. and at others John. But the signature of mine on Monday, the 15th, I signed my name as I have to this.</p>

            . I am acquainted with the prisoner's hand-writing; I have seen him write; I have seen letters from him directed to me, and I have afterwards learned from, on an interview with him on the subject of the application of those letters that they came from him. Those letters, and the instances in which I have seen him write enables me to form a judgment with respect to the identity of his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the prisoner's handwriting - A. I have very little belief upon the subject; if I had seen it with his signature; I might think it to be his.</p>

            . I am keeper of the Grffin public-house, which is in the County of Midlesex. In the month of December and January last, the prisoner and Austen were at my house five or six times; the last time they were there was a little time before I heard Mr. Boyce was in confinemint.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the month of December, I received a letter from Austen, dated Hastings, telling me he had some money in the funds in right of his wife's mother, and he wished to know if he could sell it; I wrote him answer back that if there were no restrictions in the will to prevent it, he could; and I told him to come to Town, and he had better advertise it in the newspapers. He came up two days after; he then called on me, and asked me to draw an advertisement, which I did, and put it in the Morning Chronicle. In the course of the day, a letter come from Mr. Gill; I shewed it to Austen, and we both went over together; that was the first letter that came. Mr. Gill said that he could get it done in a few days, and we went over four, five, or six times to his house, and we met at the New York coffee-house, and Auston seemed very much in a hurry, and said he would blow Gill's brains out for the delay; and I told him the best way was to go to Ballachi's and Bridges's, and see if it was going on, and I found it was. Mr. Gill was the person employed; I was merely a friend of Austen; I was not in the money line; I went merely to see to it, and knew nothing of the man only six or seven times seeing him; it was recommended to go down to Mr. Tasker, and I told him I would go. I went down, and saw Mr. Tasker he said it had been a very troublesome job, and he would have nothing to do with it, because he would not subject himself to a law suit; I told him, to convince him, that every thing was honourable, I would send him down the rough draft of the deed, and he might shew it to his attorney, and it should be altered if one word was wrong. Mr. Tasker said if he did not have any trouble, he would have no objection. The rough draft was then drawn up, and they asked me to go down; they told me I had better go down, and I went down with the rough draft; when I came there, I saw Mr. Tasker, and he said, he had just received a copy of a deed from a man in St. Alban's-street, and this money was so locked up that Austen had not a right to sell it, for that there were four other persons, making five lives, and he could not dispose of it, Mr. Tasker refused to look over the rough draft at all. I asked him to let his attorney look at it; Mr. Tasker said he was never to be biassed by an attorney, and he said he would not pay the annuity, the mother had sold without a warrant so to do. I then told him, that from that moment, I should take no further trouble about it. When I came back, I met Mr. Austen at the Griffin; I told him I should have nothing more to do with it. He said he would not go to Mr. Thorpe, who had also applied in answer to the advertisement, and he said Mr. Gill should do it. He put the rough draft in his pocket, and said he would send a person down to Mr. Tasker, in whom he could put more confidence then in me, and I said, I would have no more to do with it after that. As to any bargain, or any money, he was to give me, it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290031"></xptr>false. I told him I wanted no money. I called on him on Sunday morning after that, and he said; I am glad you are come, for I wanted to see you, and he said, I wish you would go to Mr. Gill's, for God's sake go, or my business will not be settled, for I can't go myself for my pantaloons are all to pieces, and my shirt is coming out. I told him it would be evening first, before I could go, and from that I went over. He wanted to go down to Dartford, and he had not a farthing, and I was obliged to lend him some money, as I very often did before. He said he was going in a one horse chaise. and I asked him how he could go in a one horse chaise, when he had no money, and he said, he could borrow one, and I parted with him there. I next went to Mr. Gill's, and got a parcel from him, and I called with it at Austen's lodgings, and asked if he had been there, and they said, he had not; and I told them to tell him that I had been there, and to say that I should be in Eagle-street. I never untied the parcel, nor any thing of the kind. there was the power of attorney, and a letter directed to Mr. Walker, and I went to Mr. Wright's, the Griffin, and Austen was there, and I called him to come into the parlour, and I then said, here are the papers; and I went out, and asked for pen and ink, and took them in, and then I went out again, and when I returned, Austen was writing, and I asked him what he was doing, and he had written something, and he said, he would get them done in a day, or two, and he folded the papers up, and put them in his pocket, and drank his grog, and said he would get them done that evening or the next day. From that moment, I knew nothing more about it.I never had any thing to do with it whatever more, and as for Mr. Gill's saving, that I told him that I had seen Mr. Walker, and paid a guinea, it is as great a falsehood as ever man uttered. This is the truth, as I am before the Almighty, I have no witnesses at all. Now with regard to that letter, Austen came to me, and asked me to go over with him and Mr. Gill to the Bull, and I said I was going to Kensington gravelpits, and it was two far; and he said, never mind, we shan't stop, and I went with him. Then I saw them deliver the parcel to the post boy, and Austen told me to give him a shilling for he had no money, After that, Austen came to me, and said, there was a mistake, and there was to be something more added. and he said, he knew he could not go for the boy, for his leg was bad, and he was ill, and I said I would go for him, and I ran after the boy, and overtook him, and it almost put me out of breath, and I said there is a mistake, they want to add something; and with that, he gave me the parcel back again, and I told him he need not wait; he might keep the shilling, and they would send it off by the post, and on my return to the Bull, I met Austen at the door, and gave the parcel to him; and that is all I have got to say.</p>

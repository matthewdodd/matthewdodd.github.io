            . I live in Chandos-Street, Covent-Garden. I missed money several times, and did not know how to come at the knowledge of the person that took it. I took and marked some on Easter-Eve, and on the Sunday morning I missed out of my breeches pocket five shillings of the marked money. On the Monday night I had a few friends with me: after they were gone I put more money marked; some in my coat, and some in my waistcoat pocket. When I went to put my clothes on, I missed seven shillings. I had marked twenty-four shillings, though I found but seventeen left.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Bell. I keep a coffee-room and wine vaults. The prisoner was waiter in the coffee-room. I sent my man that waited at the bar to him for change for half a guinea; when my man brought it, I gave him a strict charge to keep that from all other money. He delivered it to me. I took and locked it up. After which I examined it, and found three shillings, to the best of my memory, that I had marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know your own mark?</p>
               <p>Bill. I did not mark them all alike.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you in your house?</p>
               <p>Bill. We have seven servants, when we are full. We had six then, besides a hired porter. I have trusted the prisoner with a thousand pounds before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other servants the same access to his room as he?</p>
               <p>Bill. They had.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bill. I was desired by my master to get change for half a guinea of the prisoner. I received it of the prisoner, and the first opportunity I had I delivered it to my master. I had kept it by itself. The prisoner has behaved very just before me. I never saw no otherwise by him.</p>

            . I am one of the constables of Covent-Garden. I was sent for by Mr. Bill. The prisoner was ordered to take his money out of his pocket. Mr. Bill took up one shilling, which he thought was one of his marking.</p>

               <p>In regard to that shilling found among my own money, ask my master whether he did not give me one shilling and sixpence for the trouble I had been at in the club over night?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050025"></xptr>Bill to the question. I believe I did give him some money over night. The prisoner has lived with me a great while, and I have trusted him with large sums. If I had given myself time to have thought, I believe I should not have prosecuted him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Rose Inn, Old Bailey. On 26th Nov. the prisoner came and asked me to lend him two sovereigns, as he wanted to settle with some witnesses <hi rend="italic">over the way</hi>—he told me he was a detective in the police, and was doing wonderfully well—I knew him four or five years ago, when ho was in the police, and on the Newgate-street beat, and I supposed he was still in the police—I lent him the two sovereigns, and he said he would return them in an hour—I let him have the money, because he told me at that time he wanted to pay the witnesses, and was a detective; not because I had known him in the police.</p>

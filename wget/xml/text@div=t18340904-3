            . I am a clerk in the banking-house of Walker and Stanley, at Rotherham - Mr. Newman, the agent of Lord Fitzwilliam, paid into the house, in May last, £6,000 - it might be about the 24th of May - the direction given, was to pay it over to Snow and Co., bankers, London, on account of Lord Fitzwilliam - I made up a letter, containing seven Bills of Exchange and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040007"></xptr>three Bank-notes, which amounted all together to £6,000 - there was one Bank of England note for £500, No. 8,240, dated the 4th of April, 1834; one £500 note, of the Liverpool branch bank of England, No. 1,492, dated 28th of December, 1833; and another £500, of the Liverpool branch bank of England note, No. 1,569, the same date - that was all the Bank-notes - the notes were crossed in the face, "Per post, to Messrs. Snow and Co., 31 May, 34," in red ink - having enclosed these notes and the securities in the letter, I sealed the letter and took it home - it was directed,"Messrs. Snow and Co., bankers, London, post paid." - I locked it up when I got home - it was on a Saturday evening - I put it into the Post-office at nine o'clock on Sunday morning, at Rotherham, with another letter, addressed to Barclay and Co. - we have an account with the post-office, and did not pay the postage - (Ruthven here produced a £500 Bank of England note, No. 8,240) - this is one of the notes I enclosed in the letter, but it is not in the same condition as when I remitted it - the red ink mark has been partly obliterated - I saw it at Bow-street, and at that time the red ink was fresher - it was not obliterated at Bow-street at all - it was then in the same state as when I put it into the letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you lock up the letter? A. We have a box on purpose to lock up letters after business hours - I locked it in that box - there are two clerks in my office - we have each a key to the box - the other clerk is not here - I found the letter in the box in the morning - it was sealed - I put it into the Post-office without examining it - I did not conceive it necessary to examine it - the other clerk has a key, but he could not have access to it while it was at my house - I put it into the box at seven o'clock in the evening, and nobody could have access to the box but myself - I might have been out for an hour that evening - I am a clerk in the house - the other clerk is Mr. Dyson - he and I are on intimate terms, and visit occasionally.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. The box was in your house? A. Yes; my house communicates with the bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The note looks different to what it did before? A. It seems to have been wetted since I saw it at Bow-street - it has been in the custody of the officer - when I saw it at Bow-street, the red ink was perfectly visible - the note appeared rumpled, as if it had been carried in a pocket for some time - it could not be an old note when I put it into the letter, by the date of it; it was clean - when I saw it at Bow-street it might have passed through many hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You looked at a book just now, are the entries in your own handwriting? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Who are the partners of your house? A. Henry Walker, Mr. Stanley, and others - there are four partners - the box was in my own house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you took the letter from the box next morning, did it appear in the slightest degree disturbed? A. Not at all - the seal of the office was on it - the seal was locked up in the office - the other clerk could have access to that, but not after I made up the letter, because the keys of the drawer are locked up in the box the letters are put in, and the other clerk could not have access to the box after I put the letter in without going through my house - it is possible I might have been absent from my house two hours on Saturday evening, but I cannot state- I frequently go out for an hour after business, and sometimes two hours.</p>

            . I am an assistant in the Post-office at Rotherham - I made up the London mail-bag on the 1st of June - I took the letters out of the letter-box that morning - there were two letters from the Rotherham Bank - they were paid letters - This account of the paid and unpaid letters of that morning is in my handwriting - the paid letters amounted to 7s. 10d. - one of the Rotherham Bank letters that morning, I recollect, was directed to Snow and Co., and the other to Barclay and Co. - I put this account into the letterbag, with the letters - there were two letters at 2s. 6d. each, and a foreign letter, 2s., and a 10d. letter - the two 2s. 6d. letters were from the Bank - we kept an account of postage with the Rotherham Bank - if letters are put in and marked"paid," by them, we kept an account of them - I debited the Bank that morning with the two paid letters - the bag was forwarded duly that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This account only shows the gross amount of paid and unpaid letters that morning? A. That is all; my memory serves me as to the particular transaction that morning - I cannot tell the amount of paid and unpaid letters on the 2d of June, nor the 3d - I can tell the number of letters that went through our office to London on the 1st -

             was the letter carrier of that division - after sorting the letters to the proper divisions, I call the proper letter carriers to come and receive them from me - when they receive them from me, they take them to their own seats for the purpose of arranging them - I know the prisoner Goodwin - he was a carrier in the 5th division that day - his seat was next to Boyden, which is the Essex-street walk - the prisoner's was the Wych-street walk - they sat next to each other - letters are often missorted when two letter carriers sit next to each other - if a letter carrier finds a letter missorted before he leaves the office, he should send it back to the sorter, to be sorted to the proper district, or deliver it to the person who delivers in that district, if he knows him - if the mistake is not discovered till after he leaves the office, it is his duty, after delivering the letters in his own district, to carry it to the person to whom it is directed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been a sorter in the office? A. I have been in the office about two years and a half - I have always been a letter carrier, but I was a sorter of the "franks and paid," in the inland office - it is one office - there are two hundred or two hundred and fifty letter carriers in the General Post Office - I never counted them - I cannot tell how many sorters there are - I am not aware that there has been any great increase of sorters lately - I will not swear it - there has been a very great increase of letter carriers, to the extent of forty or fifty, and in consequence of that increase, there has been an increased extent of room required for them - I have not seen any particular confusion before the room was enlarged for them - they were all put into the original room at first - I have not heard that it was too small for business to go on - the space has been increased in that room - I suppose that was because there was not room - I have no recollection whether the addition to the room was going on between the 21st of May and the 3rd or 4th of June - the people of the Post Office were not employed in the room at the time the workmen were carrying on the improvements - to the best of my recollection I never saw them - I did not see the improvements going on during the duty of the morning - I have seen them going on - I have been in the room while they were going on - that was when I went to look over my box or desk - I went there to change my coat, not to do any duty - the coat was in my box - there might be letter carriers in the room at that time - I have no knowledge whether there were - I will not swear there were not ten there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been giving us an account of what would be done if a man discovered a mistake; have not you known mistakes occur, the source of which was never discovered? A. I cannot say that I have - I have no knowledge of it - I cannot say that I have heard of it - I have no knowledge of making mistakes without discovering the origin of them - I have made no mistakes in the progress of sorting or carrying letters - I know of no mistake being made on the 2nd of June - no mistake occurred to me - I delivered letters myself on the 2nd of June - my walk is in Lincoln's Inn as assistant - I sat five or six seats from Boyden, to the best of my recollection - there are partitions between the seats - Archer sat on the other side of Boyden - the partitions are not particularly high, for they are scolloped - they slope off from the top - there is no partition dividing the seats - they sit on stools - the division is in the box - the sorters sit without a partition in the seat, but there is a sloping division at the side to part one desk from the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you any reason to suppose you made a mistake that morning? A. I have none.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. When you went into the office to get your coat, and the workmen were about, was it in the middle of the day? - was any public business going on in the office? A. None at all - I went on private business of my own - the business of the office is over as soon as the letters are sent out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. During the time the letter sorting was going on, were the workmen in the room at all? A. No; they came in after that was all over - I have no recollection of any particular letter I sorted that morning - I have no knowledge whether I delivered any particular letter to Boyden that morning.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOYDEN. I am a letter carrier of Essex-streetwalk. Snow's banking-house is in my division - if a paid letter, addressed to them, came to the office on the 2nd of June, it should be sorted to me by Cotton - Messrs. Snow have letters by the early delivery -

Snow would be on my left side, because it is at the commencement of the delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for the person who sits on the left hand side to reach over the partition and take a letter? A. If disposed, he might - the partition is sloped out, so that our elbows touch each other on each side as we sit - the letters would lie near the high part of the partition, which is about two feet - the letters I sorted on the left hand were placed in sight of my left hand man - he could see them - they would be next to him - the letters for the Essex-street walk were about the length of his arm from him - the partition is to prevent one man's letters mixing with others - it prevents the letters coming together, but would not prevent his taking them - our seats are wooden stools and are moveable - The paid letters form no part of the charge - if a paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040009"></xptr>letter was abstracted, the carrier would not discover it - the paid letters are not charged to the letter carrier - when a parcel of letters are made up, we are called in to receive that number - we tell them up as to what they amount to, and that money we are to pay into the treasury - the paid letters form no part of that account - Goodwin has signed the book as having delivered letters that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How are the letters brought to you? A. We fetch the unpaid letters from the office - the unpaid letters are kept by themselves - a messenger brings them from one office to the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You receive your letters, I suppose, from different sorters; each bag is sorted by a person? A. No; there is a sorter for every division - he sorts them into walks - they are placed in a box for us - we sign no check for the paid letters, as to the charge.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 19th of June, about six o'clock, or from that to seven o'clock in the evening, I was near Parker-street, Drury-lane - I saw the prisoners Ward and McSweeney come out of a public-house in Parker-street, and part at the door - it was the Crown and Cushion, I think - a person came out with Ward first, and went to the Running Horse, at the corner - he was an old man - I saw no more of the old man that day - I saw Ward come out of the Running Horse and go back again to the Crown and Cushion - both he and the old man came out of the Running Horse, and parted, and Ward went to the Crown and Cushion - after that I saw Ward and McSweeney come out of the Crown and Cushion - I had not seen McSweeney before that - they parted at the door - I gave directions to Leadbitter to follow McSweeney - that is all that happened that day - on the following day I was in the Strand, at Mr. Hawley's, the watch-maker's, nearly opposite Bedford-street - I there saw Ward and the same old man go into the Queen's Head public-house, and then I saw them come out - I followed them to Crown-street, Westminster, into a private house - I think it was No. 20, Crown-street- after being there some time, I saw them come out with McSweeney - they went into a wine vault, at No. 11, King-street, Westminster, close by Crown-street - they left there, and I followed them to the Plough, in Beaufort-buildings, Strand - I saw them talking together at the door, and I laid hold of McSweeney and Ward, and took them into the parlour - the old man went away - when we got into the parlour, I said to McSweeney, "What have you got in your pocket?" - McSweeney put his hand into his right hand breeches pocket, and said, "I will show you"- he produced half-a-crown and 1s. 6d. - I put my hand into his left hand breeches pocket, and there found a £500 Bank-note - this is it (looking at it) it is No. 8240, dated 4th April, 1834 - it has been in my possession almost ever since - I gave it to the Post-office solicitor, having first marked it with my initials - I know it is the same note - the note was not wrapped up in any thing, but loose in his pocket - I asked him how he accounted for having possession of it - he said he was respectable, that he was a gentleman, that he had taken it at a gambling-house at the west end of the town - I asked him where - he said, "I decline telling" - I believe those were his words - I know he declined telling me - I asked him where he lived - he said,"At Chelsea" - I asked him where - he would not say - I searched Ward, and found on him part of the Times newspaper - I produce it - it contains an advertisement of 100l. reward for the property stolen - I had not seen an advertisement in any newspaper about the property myself, but I had seen a placard - as they were sitting in the parlour, McSweeney looked over towards Ward, and said, "It is all over; it is all up; Jack, you are a damned bad one all up your back" - Ward replied, "It is not me, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040010"></xptr>must be the old one" - I took them into custody - Leadbitter joined me soon afterwards - I took them to Bow-street - as soon as he came in at Bow-street, I asked their names, McSweeney called himself Benjamin Swabey, and the other, I believe, gave his name as Ward - I do not know that he stated what business he was - he might do so - I heard McSweeney say he had something to do with the law originally - Ward said he received the piece of the Times newspaper from McSweeney's lodging, in Crown-street, where he had come from, and McSweeney admitted that it was so - this was in the public-house - Leadbitter was not present at that time - I had sent for him, not liking to remove the two by myself - after taking them into custody, I went again to Crown-street, about four or five o'clock that afternoon, with Leadbitter, and a gentleman belonging to the Post-office, named Bokenham - we went to No. 20, and searched the house - we found nothing important there - on returning from there, towards Charing Cross, as we passed the end of Downing-street, a gentleman said, "I wonder where he is going," pointing to the prisoner, Goodwin, who was merely passing by, about a hundred yards from Crown-street - Leadbitter followed him, and from an intimation I received from Leadbitter, I went again with Mr. Bokenham to No. 20, Crown-street - we went up stairs, to the first floor, and found Goodwin there - Mr. Bokenham said to him, "I am sorry to see you here" (McSweeney's sister and brother-in-law were there) - Goodwin, I think, made answer, "Yes" - the brother said, "It is a bad job" - I recollect nothing more - we took Goodwin to the office - when the man said, "It is a bad job," I think Goodwin said"Yes" - I took McSweeney to Tothill-fields prison, in the evening - his sister and her husband were in the coach - they had some conversation with him - the sister was very much affected, and the brother-in-law pressed him to tell the truth, as he could not be a principal - McSweeney said,"No, I am only the go-between; they have not got the right man yet" - upon being further pressed by his brother-in-law, he said, "How can I look the world in the face, and betray my friend?" - the Bank-note was kept in my possession for a considerable time - I went to Ireland with it, and had it in my pocket-book, in my pocket - the red ink was fresh on it when I put it in my pocket-book, and the note was clean - on my journey, my pocket-book got completely wet through, and the appearance of the note very much altered - the red ink is a great deal paler.</p>
               <p>(The part of the Times newspaper produced, as found upon Ward, being referred to, contained an advertisement offering a reward of £100, upon conviction of the parties concerned in the robbery in question, and describing the Bank-notes and Bills of Exchange.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. 100l. reward is offered on conviction; were you aware of that when you gave your evidence to-day? A. Yes - I think I was examined twice at the police-office - I believe what I said before the magistrate was taken down in writing - I do not know that every word I have said was taken down - it was read over to me, and I signed it afterwards - I think I was examined twice - I cannot state whether I signed one or two examinations - what I said, was read over to me - I stated about having gone to the lodging in Crown-street, and seeing the brother-in-law and sister of McSweeney and Goodwin there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word respecting Bokenham making the observation to Goodwin, "I am sorry to see you here?" A. I have no doubt I did; but very often things stated are not taken down by the clerks fully; they take down what appears to them to meet the case - I have no doubt I stated it - this is my signature - (looking at his deposition.)</p>
               <p>(The witness's deposition being read over, did not state the conversation which passed between Goodwin and Mr. Bokenham at the room in Crown-street.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as very odd, when you were in the street, that a gentleman should point to Goodwin, and say, "I wonder where he is going?" A. It did not, for the gentleman making the observation belonged to the Postoffice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it strike you as material that Mr. Bokenham should say, "I am sorry to see you here?" A. Yes; and also Goodwin's answering, "Yes," to its being a bad job - the clerk at the police-office desired me to attend while he read over what I had sworn - this conversation is omitted in my deposition, but I stated it - I did not desire the clerk to insert it in my deposition when he read it - it was material in my own mind - there are many things I stated which are not in my deposition.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought that material, and found it omitted, why not desire the clerk to insert it? A. I have stated that I cannot account for the clerk's not taking it down; I have no other answer to give - I was present when Mr. Bokenham was examined, the best part of the time - I might have gone in and out of the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You saw an old man, why let him go? A. I was by myself and had other reasons.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take the old man? A. I beg to decline answering the question - I had my reasons - I was under promises - I did not believe him guilty of any offence, and I promised I should not interfere - I knew the old man before - I had known him many years - he is not near the Court, that I know of - I did not know where he lived - I swear that I do not know where he could be met with now, but I dare say by inquiring I could meet with him - he did not go before any magistrate on this occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of good character? A. I do not think I am to answer about people not in Court - I know there is a reward on this particular occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the old man has been transported? A. Unless his Lordship directs me, I decline answering.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the paper, when you got possession of it, cut out in the way it appears now? A. I think on recollection it might be a little larger, but I delivered it to the solicitor of the Post-office in the state I found it - it appears torn - it might be about one-third larger when it came into my possession - I delivered it to the solicitor precisely as I found it - I had it in my possession some days - I might have shown it to the solicitor, but they did not take it into their possession for some days, I think - I should think it was more than three weeks after I found it, I gave it to them - I have not seen it for three or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040011"></xptr>four weeks, till the day before yesterday, when Mr. Peacock, jun., gave it to me - he did not tell me he had altered it - seeing my own signature to it, I put it into my pocket without observation - I cannot say whether it was as large again or twice as large - I believe it was found in Ward's coat pocket - I have no knowledge of the pocket, but I believe it was the coat pocket - it was not rumpled up in the pocket - it was doubled together, smooth, in this sort of way (folding it up) - I cannot say whether it was in an outside pocket - I had seen Ward the day before this - Leadbitter was in the neighbourhood at the time, but we separated a great deal - I was in Queen-street, and Ward and the other man came into Queen-street, and went into the Running Horse - I was in a baker's shop directly opposite - I had a full view of Ward on that occasion - I was inside a baker's shop - if he had looked that way he could not have seen me as well as I could see him, as there was glass intervened.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure the paper has been reduced in size since you found it? A. I think so, but I do not know - I think it was a little larger.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 19th and 20th of June I was in company with Ruthven occasionally - on the 20th of June I saw McSweeney, Ward, and an old man, come from No. 20, Crown-street - I was sent for that day from Bow-street by Ruthven, and went to Beaufort-buildings - I found Ward and McSweeney in his custody - after they were taken to Bow-street, I went with Ruthven and Mr. Bokenham towards Crown-street, Westminster - as we returned, Mr. Bokenham directed my attention to Goodwin, whom we met near the end of Downing-street - I watched him, and saw him go into No. 20, Crown-street - I then called Ruthven and Mr. Bokenham - we all went into the house, and found Goodwin on the first floor with a man and woman, whom I understood to be McSweeney's brother-in-law and sister - Mr. Bokenham said, "Goodwin, I am surprised to see you here" - he did not make any reply, and McAlwin, the brother of McSweeney, said, "It is a bad job" - Goodwin said it was - I then took Goodwin to his lodging in Hatfield-street, Stamford-street - I searched his place there, but found nothing material - I took him to Bow-street - after he was committed, I took him to the front room of the office, waiting for a coach, and when we were there he said, "Is there not another young man in custody for the same thing?" - I said there was - (I had before that told him he was taken on suspicion of stealing a letter, containing Bank-notes) - he asked his name - I said I thought it was Farrant, (which was not correct,) and he said, "No, Bryant" - I said that might be his name - I then took him to the House of Correction - previous to that, he inquired if he could see Bryant - I said he could not - he then begged of me to let him see him, if it was only to exchange a look - I told him it could not be allowed - he then inquired if they were going to the same prison - I said they were not - I got a coach and took him to the House of Correction - I brought him at different times from the House of Correction to be examined, and on the second or third examination, I think the third, I was bringing him from the House of Correction to Bow-street, he inquired if I thought they would be committed to Newgate that day - (there were several re-examinations) - I said I did not know, and he expressed a wish that they might be, and said he was surprised that they were not committed at the examination before that, as he was surprised there was so much evidence against them as there was - on that day the prisoners were locked up in different cells at Bow-street - there are three cells, and each prisoner was in a different cell, and, in consequence of what the gaoler said to me, I went into the yard, and heard McSweeney call, "Tom, keep up your spirits; we can live as well in another country as we can in this" - Goodwin said,"Yes, it is all very well for you; but see how they will serve me before I get there; they will give me two years' solitary confinement, as they did Job Cox, before they send me off" - McSweeney said, "No, the case is not so clear against you as it was against him" - Ward hallooed out,"No; the worst transportation is only for burglars" - Job Cox was a general postman, whom I apprehended about two years or eighteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. That was the man one of them said had two years' solitary confinement before he was sent off? A. Yes; that was the man he named - this conversation must have been about the 4th of July - I made a minute in my memory of it - I think I made a memorandum of it at the time - I have no doubt that I did - I do not know where it is; I have not looked at it - I thought it not material - I think it was on the third examination - I was examined at the second examination - I gave part of my evidence at the first, and merely charged them as being suspected of the offence; and, on the second examination, on a Friday, I gave my evidence - I signed that examination at the time - it must have been about the 27th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations were there after that at which you were examined and signed your examination? A. On no occasion except at the last examination, when my evidence was read over, and I was bound over to attend here - my evidence was read over at the last examination - I reported to the solicitor what I overheard in the yard - I thought it material - I did not apply to the magistrate to have the conversation added to my deposition, and it is not stated in it - I communicated it to the solicitor on the very day I heard it, which I think must have been about the 4th of July - I made a memorandum of the date, which I have got at home, I have no doubt - I did not think it material to bring it here - I was not aware I should be asked for it - I was fully aware that 100l. depended upon the conviction of the men - I had seen the advertisement in the Times, and knew it long before their apprehension - I made this communication to the solicitor of the Post-office, either the same day I heard it or the following one - Mr. Peacock, sen., was present at the last examination, when my examination was read - he did not relate what I had told him, in the presence of the prisoners, in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it is your duty to detail before the magistrate, and in presence of the prisoners, every thing material relating to the charge? A. Yes; but I did not know that was material - I know it was my duty to state to Mr. Peacock all I knew - it was for him to know whether it was material - Mr. Peacock did not desire me to conceal it - he conducted the prosecution - it was for him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040012"></xptr>to know what was evidence, and not me - when I heard it, I did not know it was evidence - I read part of my proof from the solicitor of the Post-office, before I came here - I thought and believed it to be evidence, but I did not know that I should be called on to prove it - Shackell is the gaoler who called my attention to the conversation - I believe he is here - he left the yard, but his assistant gaoler was there - I do not know whether he is here; I believe not - he heard it as well as me - I told Mr. Peacock that the assistant gaoler heard it as well as me - the conversation between Mr. Bokenham and others, in Crown-street, occurred before I was examined at all - Mr. Bokenham said to Goodwin, "I am surprised to see you here."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state that before the magistrate? A. No. I did not know whether it was evidence or material - I was sworn to tell the whole truth - I told the truth with regard to the fact, that he was taken into custody at that house - I cannot repeat every thing that took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell it on your examination on your oath, as well as to the solicitor? A. I was not asked about it - Mr. Bokenham was examined himself - I recollect that - I do not know how long his examination was - if he was examined before the magistrate, it must have been in the afternoon; he was in the office - I do not know whether he gave evidence - he was there, and I expected he would be examined - I did not hear him examined - I did not say he was examined at length.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect to get any portion of the 100l. if any of the prisoners are convicted? A. I assure you I have never given it a consideration - I do expect a part of it - I cannot say how much - I do not think the reward depends upon how many are convicted - when I first took took them into custody, I expected to get some of the money - I think the reward would depend on their being convicted, but that would make no difference as to my speaking the truth - I never thought of speaking any thing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you leave out part of it before the magistrate? A. The solicitor examined me before the magistrate, to ascertain the facts, and, if asked, I should have stated it - the clerk does not ask the witness if he has any thing to add or alter, he asks him to sign his name, - to the best of my recollection, the magistrate did not ask if I had any thing to amend or alter - I believe I was not asked the question - it was read over to me - I did not find the part I had not stated had been omitted, I never thought of it - I thought of stating the facts as they occurred - I thought if there was any thing material in what Mr. Bokenham had said, he would state it himself - I did not hear Ruthven examined - Ruthven and myself are the only officers employed in this case.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know, or believe, that any person besides you and Ruthven will share any part of this reward? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you told us the whole of the conversation in the yard? A. Yes; to the best of my recollection. They talked about other things, saying, Shackell was a very good fellow, and talking about their treatment in prison - I did not hear McSweeney or Goodwin say they were sorry for Ward, for he knew nothing about it; nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Did you communicate the conversation you heard in the yard to Mr. Peacock before or after the last examination? A. I did it on the same day, or the following day; it was before the last examination. They were not committed, I think till about the middle of July, or the latter end - there were several examinations.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were any witnesses examined after the 27th of June? A. Yes, and their examinations taken. A. gentleman, from Birmingham, was examined, relative to a second charge, and one Cornish, and one Davis, but that was on a second charge - I believe nobody was examined on this charge after the third examination, which must have been about the middle of July - witnesses were examined before the magistrate on this charge, in July - Goodwin was apprehended in Crown-street, which is in the parish of St. Margaret, I believe - I know it is in the county of Middlesex.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Post-office. I accompanied the officers, as they have stated - I have been in Court, and heard Leadbitter and Ruthven examined - I heard a conversation at Bow-street, on the 20th of June, I think, between McSweeney and his sister - it was the day he was apprehended - she urged him very strongly, and so did his brother-in-law, to tell who he received the note from- she said, "For God's sake, do tell, for my sake, and the sake of your family" - McSweeney said, "No; you would have a much worse opinion of me then, than you possibly can have now" - he then said to his sister, "Ben Swabey would rather die, than betray his friend" - I accompanied the officers to the lodging in Crown-street, and heard what passed - I said to Goodwin, answered me with a monosyllable, but I cannot state what he said - Mr. McAlwin, who was present, said, "It is a bad job" - I am not aware of any thing else - I was so agitated at the time, at seeing the prisoner there, I do not know any thing more that passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you examined at the police-office? A. I was not - I attended there, and heard Ruthven examined there - I was not present when he was asked to listen to his examination read over to him - I only heard part of his examination - I was not present at the end of it - I believe I said I was sorry - whether I said sorry, or surprised, I do not know - I have heard Ruthven and Leadbitter examined to-day, and heard one of them say, my expression was, that I was "sorry," and the other, that I was "surprised" - I said, either sorry, or surprised - I only used one of these expressions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you heard in the Post-office of any suspicion arising respecting Mc Sweeney on the day he was taken up? A. I had not at all - Goodwin could have no knowledge of any suspicion being attached to McSweeney, from any thing passing in the Post-office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Goodwin remain in the employ of the Post-office up to the day when he was apprehended? A. He did, I have no doubt, but I am not in the same department - a person named McAlwin was examined at the police-office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time in the afternoon had you the conversation with Goodwin at the house in Crown-street? A. It was in the evening, probably between six and seven o'clock.</p>

            . I am keeper of the lock-up place at Bow-street - the three prisoners were in my custody - I have been in Court part of the time of this trial - I was here when Ruthven was examined, and part of the time that Leadbitter was - I was never desired to go out - I took Ward on several occasions from Bow-street office to the prison - on the 25th of July, I was bringing him from the prison to Bow-street office - he requested me, as soon as I came out of the prison, to let him remain with the two other prisoners for a short time - I asked him what for - he told me he had no money, and his wife had pawned every thing she had to raise money to meet his expenses, and he wished to see the other prisoners, to ask them for some money - I agreed, and he was with them - I believe it was by the sanction of Leadbitter, but I asked somebody if it might be done, and when I was about to convey him back to the prison in the afternoon, he said they had each given him 1s., which made 2s., and that Goodwin had given a girl 1l., and he felt himself much dissatisfied - and if they did not, he knew what to do - he said he would rather dic than split.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever present at any conversation between Goodwin and McSweeney? A. I was frequently in the yard - I remember Goodwin coming in a coach - he was very ill, and was brought into the yard where the other two prisoners were - he appeared very dejected, and was crying- he had the appearance of having had the jaundice - Swabey said to Goodwin, "Don't cry, Tom, you quite unman me; the worst is transportation for life" - Goodwin said, they would serve him in the same way as they did Job Cox, keep him two years in solitary confinement, and then transport him - Swabey said, "They cannot do that, for the case is not so clear against us as it was against him"- part of the conversation was while I was putting them in separate cells, and the latter part of it was during the time they were locked in different cells - they were hallooing from one to the other - this conversation about the transportation was on the 25th of July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear Ruthven give his evidence? A. Yes; I am the principal gaoler.</p>

             - I was locking them up part of the time, and part of the time Tyrrell locked them up - Tyrrell was not always there - the first part of the conversation was openly before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it begin? A. When Goodwin was brought into the yard, he seemed much dejected, and Swabey said,"Tom, don't cry, you quite unman me" - and during that time I was putting them in separate cells, and then I stayed in the yard, and heard this conversation - I was requested to take notice of any thing I might hear - Swabey said,"Tom, don't cry, you quite unman me; the worst is transportation for life" - that was said openly in the yard before me, before I locked them up - the three prisoners and myself were there - it is a square yard with three cells - there was nobody there but myself and the three prisoners, to my knowledge - in fact, I can take upon myself to swear so, not at that time - I am speaking of a certain day which I put down, on the 11th of July - Ruthven was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Ruthven there during any part of the time that day? A. He was in the cells with me.</p>
               <p>Q. During the conversation you have deposed to, was Ruthven in the yard at any part of it? A. No: the under-gaoler is very ill now - I was subpoened here - the conversation about Job Cox occurred in my hearing - in fact, I had heard it before, and was ordered to keep them in different cells, and they were in the habit of conversing together - and after I told it, I was told to take notice of what they said; and I did so - I was at Bow-street, but was not examined - I laid this statement before Sir Frederick Roe, and was requested to give it to Mr. Peacock - I do not know when I gave him the statement - I believe the prisoners were finally committed before I gave it to Sir Frederick Roe, but I do not recollect on what day - it was on the 25th of July that I took it down - the magistrate did not keep the paper - I laid it before him - he read it, and gave me a note with it, with directions to give it to Mr. Peacock - I do not know whether the prisoners were at that time in my custody - I believe not - I told Leadbitter, and showed him what I had heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself call Leadbitter to take notice of any conversation? A. I did - that was before I took down that writing - I did not stay with Leadbitter to hear it - I left the under-gaoler with him - the first memorandum I made was on the 11th of July - I made another on the 25th of July- it was before either of those dates that I called Leadbitter to listen - I have not seen my under-gaoler since yesterday morning - he returned from Guildford very ill - he came by the coach, as I wrote to him to come up, as I had to attend this Court - there is nothing to prevent his coming here, to my knowledge - I said he had been ill - and he is ill now.</p>

            . The prisoner Goodwing lodged at my aunt's house in Hatfield-street - McSweeney used to come to see Goodwin very frequently - Goodwin always called him his friend - on Friday, the 20th of June, Goodwin went out and left a message with me, saying, if his friend should call, he was gone to Westminster, and if not, there he should be at Hawkins's - his friend did not call - when he returned, he aske if his friend had called - I said, "No" - he then went out, and I did not see him afterwards - he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time of day did he go out the first time? A. He came in about ten o'clock in the morning, went out again and came in between one and two o'clock - between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, he went out, leaving a message for his friend; he came back between four and five o'clock, and finding his friend had not been, he went out again.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Crown-street, Westminster, and am McSweeney's brother-in-law - I am a housekeeper, and pay rates to St. Margaret's parish - McSweeney's name is Bryan McSweeney - I did not know of his going by any other name except on this occasion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Goodwin at McSweeney's on the 20th of June, before he was apprehended? A. No; not before he was apprehended - I saw him there then - he came in a little after five o'clock, or between five and six o'clock, and asked for McSweeney, about five or six minutes before the officers arrived - I told him McSweeney was apprehended for having possession of a note stolen from the Post-office - he said, "Good God!" or, "My God!" and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040014"></xptr>seemed surprised - I myself was in great confusion at the time, as the officers had been there and searched the place, and my wife was crying - while this was going on, the officers came in - I remember Mr. Bokenham coming in.</p>
               <p>Goodwin's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury: Being asked what I have to say, my answer is in a very few words. I know no more about it than either yourselves or the gentlemen of the Jury. If I am convicted, it will be on the evidence of two Bow-street officers, who are interested in the reward. I trust you will consider my case with justice.</p>
               <p>McSweeney's Defence. I beg leave to call your serious attention to the few observations I have to make. I could hardly restrain my feelings during the examination of the officers. I have no hesitation in saying that there is not an atom of truth in the extra evidence which is not in their depositions. Ruthven says I said to Ward, "Jack, it is all up:" as I hope for salvation, I did not know the man's name was John; I always understood his name to be William Ward. He used to work for me as a shoemaker. I have not seen him for years previous, to a few days before this transaction. I unwarily called him "Ward:" as to the other observations he places to me, I may say without egotism, I am not in the habit of using such expressions - with regard to what is said I said in the lock-up place, Shackle, if he speaks the truth, will say I stated, as far as I knew, the fact, they were both entirely innocent of the transaction - with regard to the subject of transportation, I said it would be as well for me now if I was transported, having hitherto borne an irreproachable character, but now it signifies not what becomes of me - but as to Goodwin's being transported, it is false, for I was convinced he knew nothing about the transaction - with regard to Cox, it is evident Shackle took his cue from the officers, for if I recollect right, Cox had but one year's imprisonment - they could not all mistake my saying two, unless they took the subject one from the other - had I received the note in the way stated, I could have gone to the Bank and got it changed - it is obvious the receipt of the letter could not have been known in London for two or three days, and with that knowledge, what was there to prevent my going to the Bank with it? - I am convinced you will see it in the true light - the fact is, the note, I regret to say, came into my possession at a gambling-house, and I gave 134l. in exchange for it - I had no knowledge of any thing of the sort- had we not all been treated in the manner we were, I should have been able to bring forward evidence - though unacquainted with the persons there, I could have proved where I got the note - we were twelve weeks in confinement - we were brought forward to please Mr. Peacock, and for no other motive: for at the last four examinations no further evidence was given - Gentlemen, I have only to repeat to you that Goodwin is entirely unacquainted with the matter - as far as I am concerned, I did not receive the note from him - Ward is unacquainted with it - he is a shoemaker, and he waited on me on the day in question for a job - I was engaged, and could not give him orders then- we walked out together, and it being very warm, I gave him some drink - I assert positively my innocence, and the innocence of the other prsioners - as regards me, I received the note, not from Goodwin, but from a stranger at the gambling-house - you must be well aware, men of the world frequenting those places, always wish to be unknown, and the owners of those places would be very tenacious of coming forward, it being unlawful - but if I had not been in confinement, (three weeks of which time I was not allowed to communicate with my legal adviser,) I could have brought forward evidence to prove I did win it, and probably the person from whom I got it - Gentlemen, it is generally believed that the capital punishment is abolished in this case; I regret to say it is in full force, and by the observations made by the Lord Chancellor, it will be carried into effect - I trust you will not bring to an ignominious end persons quite innocent - the other prisoners know no more of my transactions than I do of theirs - I have nothing more to say, but in the words of Scripture, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."</p>
               <p>Ward's Defence. I called on McSweeney on Thursday, the 19th, when Ruthven says he saw me - I never went into the second public-house - I live not six doors from the public-house he speaks of, and being in the habit of working for McSweeney, I called on him, and was apprehended - as to the newspaper, it was taken out merely as another piece of paper might be, wrapped up in this manner - it was quite half a paper - I had no knowledge of the contents - I never saw so much of it as I have seen today - I was put in solitary confinement for a whole week, 	- I have been tampered with by the officers - Mr. Peacock sent to me several times, to say he would pay me, and I should be rewarded if I had any thing to say - as to Shackle and the other man, how they can swear to such villanous acts, I cannot say - I am totally innocent.</p>

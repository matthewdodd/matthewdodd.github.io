               <p>Q. Did you tell him upon what charge you took him. - A. He asked me what was the matter, I told him he would know when I took him into the Manson House. I took him into the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor, the Lord Mayor asked him if he had heard the charge what the boy stated against him, he said he had not distinctly heard, the boy was asked some questions again, I do not recollect the words, and the Lord Mayor asked him if he had any thing to say in his defence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asked by the Lord Mayor how he came by the note. - A. The prisoner said he found them, that is all he said in his defence, he said he had found them papers.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being asked by the Lord Mayor how he came by this draft. - A. Yes, he said he had found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Respecting the draft that is on Mr. Spooner, I never received any draft of Mr. Oppenheim, I had been at Mr. Oppenhein's several times. I did not know that Mr. Oppenheim kept cash at the house. And with respect to the finding of it, there was a person that passed at the time that I picked it up at the foot of Blackfriers Bridge.</p>

"The man that had robbed me," and remarks similar to that, and to the same effect—the prisoner had access to my berth at times—I arrived in England on 1st July, 1860—the prisoner had left the ship about the beginning of March, 1850—I caused a man named Robinson, who had been my cook on board, to be taken into custody—he was tried in this Court, and sentenced to six months imprisonment—he was tried for stealing the whole amount, including the half note—I afterwards received some information, which induced me to look after the prisoner—I did not succeed in finding him till about seven weeks back—I was in the parlour of the Mitre Tavern, in Wool with, one evening—he came in, and when he saw me he appeared rather surprised—I called him by his name, Gilbert—he turned round and said, "Are you George Rice, who was in the <hi rend="italic">Firebrand</hi>?"—I said, "Yes, bow about the bills that you robbed me of?"—he said, "Come outside and talk to me about it"—I would not do that, but gave him into custody—the part of the note was the right hand half—the half without the "Five" upon it.</p>

About six o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing of the 19th of Dec., I was in Great Portland-street, and saw Collins standing near Mr. Cooper's, the butcher's shop—I did not see Johnson then-Collins walked up and down in front of the shop several times—I watched in a door-way for about ten minutes—I then saw Collins put his hand over a wire-guard at Mr. Cooper's, and take a piece of meat, which he put under the skirt of his coat, and walked away with it—Johnson then stepped out of the first private door next to the shop, about twelve yards off—he gave Collins this handkerchief—he wrapped the meat in it, and they went away together—I followed—Johnson turned, and saw me running—they both began to run—I called, "Stop thief," and Collins threw the meat and handkerchief down against some area railings—I saw another officer—I then ran after Johnson, and when I got near him he cried out, "Stop thief"—I laid hold of him, and he said, "The <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that has done it ran up there," meaning up Norton-street—(Collins had run up that street)—I said, "Yes, and you are the person that gave him the handkerchief"—I am sure I had seen Collins take it—there was a gas-lamp near the shop-door—I returned and took the meat and handkerchief up, where it was thrown down.</p>

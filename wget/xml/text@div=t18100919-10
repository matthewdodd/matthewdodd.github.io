             slid the sash, and took out seven gold seals and a watch chain.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did she take them out - A. I caught her hand in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take them out privately, or how - A. Part was privately.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you caught her hand - A. Yes, in the act, but not with all the goods in it. I caught one gold seal in her hand; upon my catching her hand, she dropped the others I believe, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing at the time you catched her hand - A. I believe I did; she said she did not know what I meaned by taking hold of her hand and polling her about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else besides you and the two prisoners in the shop - Not at the moment when I detected her, I called my daughter from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from that part of the shop where you was standing - A. I was standing up by the window, and she on the other side, we were close together, my face was that way at times where she was, they both kept me in conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the sliding of the sash make any noise - A. It generally does, but I did not hear any noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it slided back any material distance - It might be about six inches.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw one gold ring in her hand, are you sure she took up all the rest - A. I am positive that no one else did; she came some distance from the place, and then dropped them on the floor just by the counter; the chain she threw on the opposite side of the counter, not the side that I stood on.</p>
               <p>Q. They both came in together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had seized her hand, you called your daughter you say - A. Yes, I sent her in for our next dear neighbour, he came; an officer was sent for, and they were taken into custody; the prisoners were searched; I believe about three or four shillings were found in halfpence, they had some money each of them, but no other coin but halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You said they looked at a pin, what was the price of the pin that they looked at - A. Half-a-guinea. Then they said they wanted one each; at three shillings, or three and sixpence. That one was half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the ring they looked at. - A. About seven shillings. I do not think they enquired the price of the ring.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Mercer &amp; Mercer, solicitors, of Copthal Court, City—I know all the four prisoners'—on 4th July, 1872, Cooper and Jenkins, then Mrs. Clark, came to the office, together—they saw me and Mr. Mercer—they brought with them the will that is now the subject of inquiry—they handed it to me and gave me instructions to obtain probate on it—I took their instructions and afterwards prepared the affidavits that have been produced—a caveat was entered by Dr. McGrath, and afterwards withdrawn—I saw the other two prisoners, the attesting witnesses; the will not being signed in the ordinary way, it was necessary that one of the attesting witnesses should make an affidavit that the signa<lb></lb>ture in the attestation clause, or in the body of the will as the case might be, was intended as her signature, that is under Lord St. Leonard's Act; it is the practice at the Registrars' Office to require it—the will has the affidavit annexed to it, to the effect that it was executed by the testatrix on the day of the date thereof by signing her name in the attestation clause thereof, meaning and intending the same for her final signature to her will as the same name appears thereon—on 19th July, Hannah came to the best of my belief with Mrs. Clark; I am not sure whether Cooper came—I went generally into the matter with him as to how the will had been made, and he told me substantially the same as he told me afterwards when the caveat was entered, and on the 20th the affidavits were prepared for the two executrix—the caveat was entered on 29th July; that was communicated to Cooper and Jenkins, and they came to us and I arranged that they should bring the attesting witnesses on the 12th, and on the 12th the four prisoner's came together—I then took down Hutchinson's statement, of which this is the substance, they were all in my room together—the state<lb></lb>ment I took from Hutchinson, was substantially the same as that which Hannah had previously told me—I afterwards read it over to Hutchinson and Hannah, listened to it at my request—when Hutchinson had signed it, I asked Hannah if it was right, and so on, and he slightly corrected it as you will see, the only correction was, "I had known her by sight some two or three years"—it was an addition, not a correction—the caveat was never withdrawn in terms, we warned the caveator to enter an appearance, he did not, and upon an affidavit of service of the warning, the probate passed through the registry—proceedings were afterwards taken in Chancery, with reference to the will, it was a petition to deal with the fund which was in Court; that assumed the validity of the will; that was in November, 1872; the petition was presented by Mrs. Clark, and Mrs. Cooper, was</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was an order to transfer the sum of</hi> 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">odd to Mary Cooper, and the residue to Amelia Clark</hi>). That 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was capitalised upon a calculation of what the value of Cooper's annuity under the will was, there was a subsequent order of 20th February, 1874, which dealt with the fund of Edwin, the son of sir Jacob Adolphus, that order transferred to Mrs. Jenkins' trustees, the sum of 5,644<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3 per cent., that all went to the trustees; she had at that time married again, and this was under the marriage settlement—Mrs. Cooper took no interest in that; she had already capitalised her annuity—in July, 1874, there were adverse Chancery proceedings with a view to stop the fund, and a bill was filed by the subsequent plaintiff in the Probate Court—I then prepared these affidavits for the deponents who respectively swore to them, Hannah and Hutchinson, with a view to resist the applica<lb></lb>tion made in Chancery; I took the statements which they had made to me, and put it in the form of an affidavit and sent a clerk with them to get them made by the deponents—those are the affidavits of 15th July, 1874—I produce two cheques of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, dated 4th July, 1872, the day the testatrix died, payable to Mrs. Cooper, and signed Emma Adolphus—those have not been paid—they were given to me by Mrs. Copper, or Mrs. Clark; I can't say which at this distance of time, at, or a few days after they brought the will—I find by my entry at the time that on 12th July, I went to Robarts, and took the cheques to identify myself with the business, they not knowing me; I conferred with one of the principal clerks there, and he gave me some information as to the state of the account, and as far as my memory serves me there was not sufficient to meet either of the cheques at that time—the first affidavits were made on 15th July—the second ones were prepared pretty much in the same manner, they all rested upon the original statements made to me by Hannah and Hutchinson; by Hannah, in the first instance, and Hutchin<lb></lb>son, in the second.</p>

                  </hi>. I have for many years made the study of hand<lb></lb>writing a business—I was applied to some time in March, 1875, to form a judgment upon the subject of the handwriting of Miss Emma Adolphus, and the handwriting of the alleged will—I was examined in the Probate Court on the subject—I have formed a judgment that the will is decidedly not the same handwriting as the admitted handwriting of Emma Adolphus—the materials upon which I proceeded were several original letters which have, not been photographed; these are the letters produced by Dr. McGrath they are marked consecutively from A to O, in my handwriting—these three letters in an envelope were put into my hands by the Treasury—I have seen the originals of all Miss Adolphus's cheques, the cancelled will, and the—originals of all the documents photographed from A to R, but there are some exceptions which I have to make to the document marked K—with that exception these are all the documents I have seen in the handwriting of Emma Adolphus—the documents that I have seen in the handwriting of Mary Cooper, are the copy of the will, the six specimens of the word "Queens" which she wrote in the Probate Court, and the bodies of the cheques from R to Z—I have seen once the two cheques that have been produced to-day—I should like to look at them again (<hi rend="italic">they were handed to the witness</hi>)—my judgment is formed upon them as well as the others—I can give you general reasons why the will could not have been written by Emma Adolphus, in consequence of her defective eye sight—on 13th December she alludes to her failure of sight, in her own handwriting—I have seen the documents admitted or proved to be in her handwriting from that date forwards, and I can trace the failure of sight in the writer—they show that her sight got rapidly worse; there is no trace of any temporary improvement—the later documents evince that she became almost totally blind, if not quite, I should think quite blind, but certainly any one who was quite blind could write quite as well; that is any one who had been accustomed to write; in fact, I am surprised, looking at her handwriting, that she did not write better when blind—in document G, you will find the word "has," the pen entirely fails of ink in the middle; that evinces that the person was blind—at the bottom of the page, she writes "Miss Adolphus"—immediately after writing the "A" the pen fails of ink, but she still continues to write—then in writing the word "compliments" the "t's" fail of ink—any person who could see would naturally take a dip of ink then, but the "t's" is written without any ink at all—in document H you will find the same, in "Messrs. Robarts," and in the word "convenient," and in all the later documents—there are two or three very glaring instances in document I, showing strong evidence that the person could not see, and the same thing occurs both in M and N—in L, 0, and P there are none of those traces of want of ink; those documents are written with a steel pen which does not open so much, the ink in it lasts longer than in a quill pen, at least I think so—I observe in Miss Adolphus' writing where she has lifted the pen she has not been able to resume the writing at the proper point, except by accident; you have instances of that in G, H, and J, in the word "Queen's" and in "Road," and the writing is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200056"></xptr>
               <p>scattered all over the page in H and J; then after that, becoming conscious of that, she keeps her hand on the paper as long as she can; for instance, in K you will find "132, Queen's Road" all written by one operation of the pen, also "London, March," evincing a desire not to break oft", feeling that she could not find the place again—the word" continuous" expresses my meaning—in Q there is the same "ten pounds" she has taken her pen off, but the junctions are made most inaccurately; she has made the "0" by two operations of the pen, but there is no junction, she cannot see where she has put down the pen again—the middle "0" in the shilling place is joined accurately at the bottom, but that is accidental—in photograph H she has lifted her pen to cross the "t" in "convenient," that is done very well, but that is the last instance of it, never after that does she cross the "t" by a separate operation of the pen, but by taking it across from the bottom of the letter—the word "ten" in L is not written by her in my judgment—in B and D the small "i" is dotted and in photograph F, but there is no instance of that in any subsequent document—I have omitted one of the strongest instances of Miss Adolphus' failure of sight, which is in document Q; in the numerals 132 she has added another 2, making it 1322—I think that is a positive demonstration that she could not see; that is plainly and blackly written, and if she could see at all she must have been able to see that—the same thing occurs in "Bayswater," the letters over<lb></lb>ride each other constantly—now, taking the will, I judge from that that the writer was able to see perfectly well, as well as you or I, I am sure of it—where the pen of the writer of the will failed of ink the writer per<lb></lb>ceived it immediately, as in the following instance with the "h" in "bequeath," line 8, you find at the end of the h the pen fails or opens, and the next letter, the a in "all," which follows it is written as black as pos<lb></lb>sible, evincing that a fresh dip had been taken; and in the a in "seal" in the next line you find the pen opens and fails of ink, and the 1 is quite black—in the small in "be" in line 12 the pen writes pale, and the nest word is perfectly black—again at the in "Queen's," line 14, the pen fails, and you will observe in that particular instance that the junction is made very accurately, the upstroke is taken up again exactly where the pen had been taken off; the misplacing of the words which occurs in the will is, in my belief, intentional; for instance, in the sentence, "This is the last will," the word "will" is written above the word "last"—at line 11 of the first page the words "Mary Cooper of" are written on a curved line; that curved line is guided by the line immediately preceding it, by the words "shall be entitled," so that the person could see perfectly well to do that, and that line again follows the curve of the preceding line, so that the sight of the person had been influenced by each line—a similar observation may be made with respect to the next page, lines 9, 10, 11, and 12 follow the same curve, and the spaces between the words are as they would be made by a person who could see, as contrasted by the admitted writing of Miss Adolphus where the words are huddled together or separated by irregular and un<lb></lb>natural spaces—in the later documents of Miss Adolphus I have shown that she kept her hand on the paper as long as possible; now throughout the will the pen is continually lifted, as in the word "testament," the pen has been lifted after the s, and all through the will each word is apparently separate and distinct, there is not a single instance of two words being joined together, they may touch accidentally, as in the words "the last will and testament of," but the pen has been lifted before writing the word "of"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200057"></xptr>
               <p>—in the word "and" at line 2 you will find in the upstroke connecting the "n" and the "d" the pen has been lifted after forming the n, and it is put down again very accurately, and in "Bayswater," at line 5, after forming the pen has been taken up and the upstroke continued exactly in its right place, no one could continue it more accurately—there is a very clear instance in the word "Queen's" at line 14, and I could point out a number of such instances, not only in the upstroke, but the down stroke—the down-stroke of the in the second word of the will has been lengthened exactly in its place, and in the word "testament" in line 2 them has been lengthened—all the letters t in the will are crossed by a separate operation of the pen and never taken from the bottom of the letter, except perhaps in one or two doubtful instances at the end of a word—there are thirty-six small letters it in the will, twenty-seven of them are dotted, and with one exception all are dotted with dots in their proper place immediately over the letters, indicating that the writer possessed a clear vision, the one exception is in the word "said" at page 3, line 4, the 1 there is out of place, there may be two dots to it, most likely it is so, because I notice that the will is not punctuated—every line of the first and second pages of the will appears to begin at the proper distance from the edge of the paper, and there are several instances at the end of the lines where the writer has apparently compressed the character of the writing in approaching the edge of the paper, just like any writer would do—I don't find that the writing has been gradually diminished, because I think it has been the object of the writer to write a large hand; at the bottom of page 2 the final "s" in "Adolphus is diminished"—the capital "B" in "Bayswater" is unlike any capital B written by Emma Adolphus; the word "Bayswater" frequently occurs in the will, and the B finishes on a down stroke, but in Miss Adolphus's writing it is clear of the down stroke and joins with the a—in every instance of the word Bayswater she has joined the B with the a—the capital J in the third page of the will is unlike any capital J formed by Emma Adolphus—there are two J's in the cheque B, and again in cheque C a different form of J altogether—the J in "July" appears to be of a person not very familiar with handwriting—the capital N in the word "Names" is the last word of the will is formed more like a capital V, and unlike any capital N of Emma Adolphus—you see one of her N's in the word Number in both the cheques B and C, and she has made an enlargement of the small n in the document A, line 12; that is a very different N from the N in the will—she makes the N in two ways, but in no instance does it resemble a V, and I never saw one before, it is very peculiar. The capital letter Q occurs three times in the will, made like a capital U, that is still more distinctive, and certainly not like any capital Q by Emma Adolphus, her Q's are particularly plain and made like a Q in the orthodox manner—the word "Queens" comes several times; in photo<lb></lb>graph G you will find a Q at the top, and still plainer in document I at the beginning, it is a plain Q made in the proper manner, looped at the bottom; she always makes it in the same way—the writer of the will seems totally unacquainted with the form of the letter Q at all, both as a capital and a small letter—it is made improperly; a small q occurs only twice in the will in the word "bequeath" in line 8, it is made like a "y," and in line 10 of the last page like a "j," in neither instance like a properly formed q. There are five instances in the will where the word "in" is written with a capital I; Miss Adolphus never wrote the word "in" in the middle of a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200058"></xptr>
               <p>sentence with a capital letter—there are three instances in the last page of the will in the sentence "in the presence of us the undersigned who in her presence and in the presence of each other," and there is no such thing in Emma Adolphus's writing—the numeral 3 in lines 4 and 14 of the will is unlike her numeral—I cannot find an instance of a 3 finished in the same way; there is something indistinct about it; here the 3 is finished with a strong dash of the pen—there are several 3's, and in the fourth line of the will it is finished very distinctively indeed, in a very bold and emphatic manner—in the third page of the will the name "Adolphus" is written without the letter I; I think the person who wrote that was going to write "Adop," and the first stroke of the p has been converted into an 1, refer<lb></lb>ing to the proper mode of spelling it; but the 1 is omitted altogether—I have formed a judgment as to whose handwriting the will is—I have no doubt it is in the same handwriting as the copy of the will and the body of the cheques R to Z, and these six specimens—my reasons for saying so are the capital N formed like a V in the word "Names" in the last line of the will, also in the abbreviation "No" for "Number" in photograph K, in the cheques from R to Z, and in the two cheques produced this morning, the N is like a V—the best instances of it are in the cheques T, U, and V—in the copy of the will proved to be in Cooper's writing the word "Queens" occurs in three instances, and in each the Q is formed like a capital U in the same manner as the Q in "Queens" in the fourteenth line of the will—I have looked at the six specimens of the word Queens written by Cooper at the Probate Court; in one instance in No. 3 she has formed a small q like a y, and in Nos. 4 and 5 it begins like a y, and where it is in a capital it is made distictly like a capital U, that is in No. 2, but in none of the instances of the word Queens written with a small letter is that small letter at all like a q, no one would read it for a q; in No. 3 there is a little correction, in the first instance it is like a j, and it is now more like a y, and so is the y and j like they and j in the will—I have formed a very confident opinion on the subject with which I am now dealing—I have a great number of other instances of peculiarities—in my judgment I detect the writer of the will to be the same as the writer of the copy of the will and the cheques proved to be in Cooper's writing.</p>

               <p>not think it would require great ingenuity to forge a will in this way; I don't see the ingenuity in the forging of it—I don't see the difficulty in putting the "nt" in the word "testament" after they in this way; that was just an attempt to imitate the sprawling way in which Miss Adolphus wrote her cheques—I think that easy enough—the person might have written the "nt" below they if that idea had seized the mind of the writer, or put it anywhere else—there is nothing difficult in it—the curve in "emma Adolphus" does not show any ingenuity to my mind—I say it was done wilfully; I say all these curves are very easily done, requiring very little ingenuity—there in "road" at the bottom of page 1 is not at all similar to there in "road" in exhibit G; it is altogether different—the two words are as different as they well could be—there is as unlike as could be; it is not even an imitation of it—it would not be difficult to smear over the words "place" and "road" in this way; it might be done by accident—smears are similar to each other by whoever made; they might be done by the hand of the forger or by anybody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming for a moment that the hand that wrote the will was guided, would you expect to find any idiosyncrasies of the stronger hand in the writing of the guided hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not much experience in guided hands, but I should think it would be so, but there would be plain evidence that the hand was guided—I should expect to find some of the cha<lb></lb>racteristics of the guiding hand in the will; it would depend upon the amount of power of the guiding hand and the amount of weakness of the guided hand—the extent would depend upon the comparative power and capacity of the two hands—if the guided hand were weak and the guiding band were that of a strong person I think it is very possible, that the idiosyncracies of the guiding hand would be strongly marked—that is almost obvious—the guiding hand could do as it liked, especially if the hand was strong—if any peculiarity of the weak hand did appear it would be rather more likely to appear in the signature than in other words, but you see in the will it does not appear, because the A in "Adolphus" in the will is a small a, on the third line in the first page—the a's are formed like a small a, not like an enlarged one—I say the a in that third line is a small a; it is not more a capital A than the a in "and"—I say it is not intended for a capital letter, nor is the a in "Adolphus" in the fifteenth line of the second page, or in the word "Amelia" they are all small—look<lb></lb>ing at the word "Bayswater" in the third line of the copy of the will made at Messrs. Mercer's office, and at the same word in page 1 of the will, line 5, I have not the slightest doubt that whoever wrote the one wrote the other—the one seems to me to be the parent of the other, they are so alike—I do not think that the E in "emma" in exhibit M is like the E in "Estate" at page 1 of the will—there is a great difference—it was a characteristic of Emma Adolphus's E to make the upper loop very large and "' distinct and bold—if you look at all her E's you will find that is her chief characteristic—in the word "Estate" it is very cramped, as if the writer was almost afraid to make the bow at all—both are made on the same plan—of course very many persons make a capital E on the same plan; that is the only similarity between them—the A in the copy will made at Messrs. Mercer's office is similar to the A always made by Miss Adolphus, and all the A's in the copy will are properly formed capital A's—I dare say she would have formed the A in the same way in the will if she had written it small, but she has written it very large; that affords a possible motive for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200060"></xptr>
               <p>using that form of letter—she might have associated largeness of writing with childlike writing, and she may have formed the a small for that reason—I cannot tell; the Jury can form their view upon that as well as I can—the E in "emma" in the copy will is spelt twice with a small e; in the sixth line from the bottom it is a capital E; that is the way in which I make a capital E myself—I notice that there is a blundering in the spelling of the word "emma."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I may have formed an opinion as to whether the will was or not all written at one time, but I forget; if you will let me look at it, I will tell you now; my mind has not been directed to that at present, because I only had an opportunity of looking at the will once (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—there is no indication of its having been written at different times; it may have been, but it appears to me to have been written all at one time; that is my opinion upon it—I should think the names of the attesting witnesses were not written at the same time, the ink is not so dark; they may have been blotted, but I don't think they have—I could not tell whether they were written at or about the same time; I can't say they were not—I see no reason to doubt that the signatures were written at the same time, as far as I can see—I don't dispute it—I don't know how many times Juries have disagreed with my opinions, they have occasionally—sometimes one Jury has agreed, and another Jury has disturbed the verdict of the first.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I have just seen the two cheques produced, they arc forgeries undoubtedly—in the second cheque there are four strokes to the am in "emma," like one of the m's in the copy of the will—it may be a double n or it may be an in with four strokes—I believe the name is spelt correctly in the will and not in that cheque—two documents were sub<lb></lb>mitted to me, upon which I would not express an opinion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined. Q.</hi> What are those two documents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my examina<lb></lb>tion at the Probate Court, I did not speak with the same strength with regard to the signatures of R and S—I have expressed my opinion that they are the signatures of Miss Adolphus, but I am not absolutely sure of it; those are the only things I have a doubt about—I don't say they are not in her handwriting, that is all—my opinion about them is much the same now as it was then—there are certain peculiarities applicable to writing that has been guided—I do not find any such peculiarities or any trace of guiding in the whole of the will—I think it would be impossible for a guided hand to make the junctions with such accuracy, to begin with—there would be great decrepitude in the writing if it was guided, some<lb></lb>thing of a tremulous nature—I could very readily believe that some of the cheques written by Miss Adolphus were written by a guided hand, the character of the writing would have more of that character—not a particle of the will exhibits the character of being guided, it is in a clear firm hand throughout—the difference between there in the word "road" in the will and in document G, is this, in the will the lower limb of there is separated from the first down stroke, but in document G it merges; it is difficult to describe it, but it has a different character—in the o in "road" in the will the up-stroke is taken from the very middle of the o, connecting it with the a, but in document G, it is continued from above the o, and unusually high up—then the D is of different form altogether—Miss Adolphus frequently made the d turned up, but it is not so in the word "road," neither does it occur in any d in the will—there is no d at all like the d in document G—</p>

               <p>Miss Adolphus invariably made the d as in the word "pounds," and never in any other way; it is the same in the word "and;" and in all the cheques in Mrs. Cooper's handwriting the d is made in the same way as in the will—all the four letters in the word "road" are formed on a totally different principle from those of Miss Adolphus.</p>

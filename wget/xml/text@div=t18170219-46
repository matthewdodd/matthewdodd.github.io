My father hired the room, and always paid the rent - I always kept the key. On the 27th of January about a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, I fastened my door and window, there was a bed and bedding in my room, which belonged to my father, some of the things were mine; I returned about half-past ten o'clock, and found the asp of my padlock out, and the padlock on the floor. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The bed, bolster, pillow, three blankets, two sheets, and a counterpane belonged to my father, and the rest were mine. The prisoner had worked for my father five or six years, off and on. Bishop did not live in the house.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Spitalfields. I was on duty on the 27th of January, I saw the prisoner at the bottom of Fashion-street, Spitalfields, between eight and nine o'clock, he was walking with a bundle on his back; I stopped him, he said he was going to his brother's in Long-alley; he said, he had got a bed; I asked him where he brought it from; he said, from Spitalfields; and then said, he was going to his brother's in Half-Moon-alley, and that I might go with him; I asked him again, where he brought it from; he said, from the Loggerheads, which is a very different place from Spitalfields. Andrews came up, and asked him if he knew who kept the Loggerheads, he said, no; he then said, he brought it from the Bird-cage, which is near the Loggerheads; we secured him. When we came near the watch-house, he threw the bundle off his back, and ran off; I took it up, and Andrews<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190021"></xptr> secured him. He was brought to the watch-house about five minutes after. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Marriott, and live at Botany-bay, Enfield—on 1st December I went to bed at ten minutes to 10 o'clock—I fastened all the doors except the back door, which I left for my husband, whom I expected home—there were 81bs. of pickled pork in the kitchen, and some bread in the cupboard—after I got into bed and put the candle out, I heard the garden gate open and shut—persons can go round to the back from there—I got out of bed, went on to the staircase, and said, "Is that you, Henry?"—no one answered, but I saw the prisoner go out at the door—I knew him, as he lodged with us for two years up to the week before, and I knew him before that—I put my dress on, went down, and missed the meat and the bread—it was moonlight—the cupboard door and the house door were both open, and the moon shone on him.</p>

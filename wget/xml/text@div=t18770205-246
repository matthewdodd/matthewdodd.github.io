                  </hi>. I live at 99, Stanley Street, Pimlico, and am the widow of the deceased—I have known the prisoner, I should think over twelve months—the first time I saw him was in the Harrow Road, talking to my niece Carry Stephens, and she introduced him to me—I saw him twice after that at Mrs. Stephens'—the first time he came to our house was to fetch a hamper to take into Cornwall—I think that was sometime in October last year, be came in Mr-Stephen's trap and took the hamper away with him; that was the first time Mr. Collins saw him, I introduced him to him; he stayed somewhere about half an hour, they sat and talked some time, I don't know what about, I was there part of the time—the next time he came was on Thursday, 14th December, he had only been to the house once before that, that was when he came for the hamper; to the best of my recollection, that was the only time—on 14th December he came a little before 12.45, I let him in—after wishing me good morning, he said "Is Selina here"—she is a sister of Carry Stephens—I did not know that "he was engaged to be married to Carry but I knew that they kept company—he said he had had a letter from Selina to meet him there at 1 o'clock; he looked up at the clock and said "I am before ray time, it now wants a quarter"—he did not show me any letter—Mr. Collins was at home at that time, and he asked him to stay to dinner—we were in the front kitchen; he marked some new linen for me—I said to him "It is no use to have friends, Mr. Treadaway, unless you make use of them," and he said "No, what is it?"—I said "To mark some new linen for me, will you do it?" and he said "Yes"—all this took place in the front kitchen, which we use as a sitting room; he stayed to dinner with Mr. Collins and me—after dinner he wrote a letter, Mr. Collins gave him paper and envelope, and I gave him a stamp—after that I told him I was going to Paddington if I could get my work done—I went to Paddington about 4 o'clock, leaving him and Mr. Collins there, talking very comfortably together—I returned about 10.45 the same evening; the prisoner was then gone—Mr. Collins met me just outside the gate, waiting for me to come home—I saw the prisoner again next morning, the 15th, he came to our house about 10.30; I let him in at the area door, which we generally use—after wishing me good morning, he said "Is Mr. Collins in?"—I said he was not in, but he would be soon, and asked him to walk in—I put Mr. Collins' easy chair for him to sit down in the front kitchen—he said he was very tired—I asked him if he had got the letter in his pocket that he had told me the day before he had from Selina—he said "No, I have not been home all night, I have been walking about. I have not been to bed"—I said "You must be very tired," and I gave him a cushion to his back, and asked him to get a doze before Mr. Collins came in; but he did not seem sleepy—I then told him who I had seen at Paddington, and what passed there, and who took me to the 'bus—he asked how they all were; he meant my neice, and the Stephens—I told him they were all very well, with the exception of Mrs. Stephens, and as he knew she was never very well—he asked me if the workmen had—their meals there, if the workmen were there to tea—I said no, I never saw any workmen have any meals there; he said they did—Mr. Collins had not come in 'during that time, he came in about 11 o'clock, and came into the front kitchen; he</p>

               <p>wished the prisoner good morning, and asked him if he had had his break<lb></lb>fast—he said he had—I told Mr. Collins that he wanted to speak to him—Mr. Collins had been to the butcher's for a piece of mutton to boil for dinner, and he brought it in with him and put it on the dresser, and I went to prepare the dinner and left them talking together in an ordinary way, as people would—I did not hear what they were talking about, I did not pay any attention—I went in and out a good many times—I was cooking the dinner in the front kitchen, as we had no fire in the back kitchen that day—there is no door communicating between the front and back kitchens; you go out of the front kitchen door into the passage, and then a step or two into the back kitchen—they were talking together all the time I was getting the dinner ready—it was ready about 1.30 as near as I can think, I could not tell justly—before the mutton was quite ready Mr. Collins asked me to prepare him a basin of broth, and he said to the prisoner "Are you a hand at broth"—he said he was not hungry—Mr. Collins had his broth; I poured the prisoner out a glass of ale, and he drank it, and I ate my dinner—I did not wait for the mutton, I had a chop, which I had prepared separately—when I took up the dinner I asked the prisoner to come, and I saw Mr. Collins carve for him and likewise for himself—when I <hi rend="italic">left</hi> the kitchen he was still sitting in the armchair; I took up the dinner and left it on the table, and went into the other kitchen to make a pudding—whether he ate the dinner or not I don't know; I was out quite long enough for him to have done so—when I came into the front kitchen again he was still sitting in the chair, and Mr. Collins had finished his dinner and moved round, sitting in a different position talking to him; instead of sitting at the table eating his dinner he had turned himself round, talking; they were very near together—I then cleared away all the dinner things off the table, and went into the back kitchen—I was backwards and forwards clearing away; there were a great many things—during all that time they were in the kitchen talking together—once when I went in I saw the prisoner looking at a fiddle that Mr. Collins had hanging up on a nail on the wall; he was standing with one foot on the sofa and reaching at the fiddle, as though he had been looking at it; he was hanging it up again—when I left them there was only the distance of the table between them; Mr. Collins was sitting, and the prisoner was standing at the side of the table nearest the kitchen door—I saw him standing, hat in hand, as though he was going; I could not swear whether he was sitting the last time I saw him or whether he was standing, hat in hand, but I saw him both sitting and standing at different times—when I went in Mr. Collins was still sitting in the chair in the same place—up to that time I heard nothing to notice, they were talking in an ordi<lb></lb>nary way, nothing loud or anything to attract attention—the last time I went out of the front kitchen I went into the back kitchen to fetch a pan to get some hot water to wash up, and I had scarcely got to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> table when I heard a loud report; I turned momentarily round to go to see what it was, and I met the prisoner in the doorway of the back kitchen, he was coming towards me; that was not his way out, he was coming into the back kitchen—I said to him "What's that"—he said "I don't knew"—the words were scarcely uttered when be fired again; I saw the flash and heard the report, it was like a hot, heavy blow, it struck me in the ear, and I felt the blood trickling down my neck—I reeled round, but I did not fall—I saw the prisoner go along the passage to the area door—I don't know whether he had his hat on—I went after him and caught him by the coat</p>

               <p>at the area door; I opened my mouth to cry murder, and he put his hand in my mouth so that I could not speak, and with the other hand he took me by the neck and threw me down outside the area door, and he beat my head on the pavement stones; he did that several times—I struggled hard for life as he knelt upon me, and I got one of my hands loose—he still held me—as he was leaning over me I took him by his shirt-front, or something, I don't know what—I then found that I was regaining my feet—I tried to get up—he loosed me and went up the area steps rather quickly, at least it seemed quick to me—I put my other hand to the floor to try to get up, and I did get up, and I put my hand in a pool of "blood—I went up the area steps to try and catch him—I went a few steps on the pavement, and begged of the passers by to send for a doctor, and a policeman to take him, as he had murdered my husband and had shot me—I then turned back and went into the front kitchen—I could not tell you justly the time between my hearing the first shot and the time he ran up the area steps; it was not long, it seemed long to me, but it could not be many minutes—when I went into the front kitchen I said "What has he done? what has he done? has he shot you?"—my husband was lying down on the kitchen floor on the oilcloth—I knelt over him and begged of him to speak to me, but he was gone; he did not speak; I felt he was dead—the only sign of life I saw was just a slight quivering of the lip, and my only hope on earth was gone—there was no one living in the house with my husband and myself but a very aged lady, who was in bed at the time in the back drawing-room—we had a gentleman lodger, but he did not come home till late, after 6 o'clock in the evening—there was no one else in the" house at the time—I have no children—Mrs. Stephens is Mr. Collins' sister; her husband is a ladder-maker—my husband did not do anything in business lately, he was formerly a builder, he only did little odd things for himself in his own houses; he would have men to look after the houses, and he superintended; he had some house property—sometimes his nephew collected the rents from those houses, and sometimes himself—as a rule we kept the money upstairs—when there was any large quantity (<hi rend="italic">it</hi> was seldom there was any large amount in the house) it was kept upstairs in the room we slept in—there has been some hundreds sometimes, there was at one time; Mr. Collins bought two houses in Winchester Street, and he paid it all away, the last large amount we had I think that was more than a year ago—he wore a belt to strengthen his back, he was very weak in his back, he made use of it when he went into Cornwall to take some money with him, and I put a little brown-holland pocket in it to carry his money in—he never used that afterwards for the same purpose only when he went there, to save me the trouble of sending money to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first time I saw the prisoner was when he was with" my niece Carry in the Harrow Road—I think the Treadaways kept a shop at the corner of Paddington Green, but it was not there I saw him, it was near the Edgware Road-; he came out of a cigar shop or paper shop—I think Mr. Treadaway had a shop very near to Mr. Stephens—I don't know much about that place, I never go only when I go to Mrs. Stephens'—I saw the prisoner twice at Mrs. Stephens' house—I could not tell justly the time when he came for the hamper, it was somewhere about Octo<lb></lb>ber; he drove down in Mr. Stephens' pony and trap—he tied up the hamper for me—there was some brandy and wine offered him, I think be took some wine, but I could not be positive, and a piece of cake; I think</p>

               <p>he was there about half an hour—on Thursday, 14th December, I left home bout 4 o'clock, leaving the prisoner alone with Mr. Collins; before I left I had gone several times into the room an I sat there while they were talking—I did not pay the least attention to what they were saying—the prisoner never asked me to lend him any money—I never heard him ask my hus<lb></lb>band to lend him money—on the Friday when he came in and said that he was very tired I did not observe that he looked very tired; I thought if he was tired a doze would do him good—after dinner 1 was in and out several times before I went with the pan—it was when I was taking something in or fetching something away that I saw the fiddle—at one time I fancy he was standing with his hat in his hand, as though he was going; Mr. Collins was not standing up too at that time, he was sitting—I could not swear whether the prisoner was sitting or standing the last time I was in the room—I never heard any high words or noticed any angry looks either about Mr. Collins or the prisoner, or any loud talking—I had just left the room to fetch a pan to take into the front kitchen to draw-some hot water—I had just got into the back kitchen when I heard the noise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Gibbons, of-Westmoreland Street, Pimlico—on Friday, 15th December, about 3.15, or from that to 3.30, I was in Stanley Street, Pimlico, walking along on the opposite side to Mr. Collins' house—I heard a cry of "Oh, oh;" I saw nothing; it was a female voice in distress—I then heard another cry of distress a little louder and then I saw Mrs. Collins partly up the area steps, the head and shoulders; she was the first I saw; there was no one else there at that moment; she ried "Stop him! Stop him!"—at that time I was crossing the road towards the house, and as I was looking a young man opened the door and came out of the street door—by that time Mrs. Collins was at the top of the area steps—the young man came out of Mr. Collins' street door, the front door with steps to it; he opened the door and came out and left the door open after him—the area gate is at the further end of the area—at the time I saw them there was the length of the area between them—a female came up and Mrs. Collins was speaking to her as she came past, and I came over sideways and met him, I was about 2 feet from him—I recognised him when I was at the police-court, I had never seen him before; that is the young man (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>); he went down Sussex Street, turned the corner into Sussex Street, and passed into Cambridge Street, he was running very swiftly; he had a soft crowned hat on and he had his right hand to it, his left hand was under his coat—when he ran J saw something bright in his left hand when the flap of of his coat was blown aside by the wind—I saw his face as he was coming out; I have not the least doubt" that the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>Castle Street, Kentish Town, I have known the prisoner about five or sir months—he has been in the habit of frequently coming to my house—on Thursday morning, 14th December, he came there about 11 o'clock, he had a carpet bag with him—he said he had had a fall out with his father, and he was not going home again—he said he was owed money at Bayswater,' and he was going to try to get it—he did not say how or why he had fallen out with his father, or how the money at Bayswater had become due to him; he said nothing more, he left the carpet-bag at my house and went away, he asked me to let it remain until he returned, he said he was going to Bayswater to get this money that was owed him—he returned about 9 o'clock that evening, my husband was then at home—I asked him how he had got on to-day—he said very badly—I asked what he was going to do; he said he did know, he was sure—I said I had no place for him unless he laid on the couch all night—he said "Thank you"—I said-"You will have to get up in the morning when my husband goes to work"—he said "All right"—he stayed all night, and slept on the couch—my husband leaves about 5 o'clock in the morning, I got him some breakfast and the prisoner had a cup of tea with, him, and they both left soon after 5 o'clock, he still left the carpet-bag with me—he did not say whether he was coming back or not, or where he was going to—he returned about 4.30 or 4.45 that Friday afternoon, the 15th, he came with a loud knock, I answered it—I asked him what brought him "back so soon—I did not expect him before <hi rend="italic">my</hi> husband came home—he followed me in, and sat down on the couch; it was dark—he said it had been a nasty day, and he had got a bad cold—he had a bad cold; he could not speak, he was so hoarse—it was a very dull, dark, heavy day—I asked him how he had been getting on—he replied "Worse than ever," and I said "That is the fruits of lending money"—he asked me for some water to wash his face and hands to refresh himself—I said "You are not in a hurry, are you?"—he said "Not particular"—I showed him into the bed-room—he washed his hands, and came back to the sitting-room, and sat in the arm-chair—some friends of mine came in, and there they sat till my husband came in, about 6.30—there was no particular con<lb></lb>versation—I asked him where he got his bad cold, and he said he did not know—it was ordinary conversation about our own affairs—we were going to have a little stout-and-mild after my husband came home, and the prisoner said he had no money—I suppose he thought he must pay for something—my friends left about 9.30—the prisoner remained there till bed time; about 10 o'clock he asked if I would allow him to lie on the couch for another night—I said "Yes," and he stayed all night—in the morning he was still suffering very much from his cold, he could hardly speak—I did not like to turn him out again so soon—I had pity on him because he had such a cold—he went into the bed-room to wash; he was in there some time—my scissors were lying on the drawers, and he took them up and cut his whiskers off—I asked him what he was cutting his whiskers for; he said to make him look younger—I said "Have you been doing anything?"—he said "Never mind, you will know in time; you take my carpet bag to my mother's"—I said "Take it yourself"—he said "I am." not going home any more," and he wished me good-bye, and went away a little before 10 o'clock—he left the bag with me—I did not know what to do with it; I took it to his father's—I did not examine what was in it, or whether it was locked or unlocked; it was not heavy—that was the last I</p>

In the course of Friday, 15th December, I received a communication at our station, in consequence of which instructions were given to watch various parts of the metropolis—on Saturday night, 16th December, shortly after 12 o'clock, I arrived at the Isleworth police-station, in company with Sayer—I found that the prisoner had been only charged with the murder of Mr. Collins, and I caused him to be charged with the attempted murder of Mrs. Collins.; when the charge was entered on the sheet, he was brought in from the cell, and I told him that he would be so charged—at first he made no response; he seemed partially stupefied, as if he did not hear what I had said to him, and I said "Did you hear me, do you understand what I am saying to you?"—I then re<lb></lb>peated the substance of the additional charge to him, to which he replied "I don't know how I came to do it; it seems a blank to me"—a four-wheeled cab was obtained, and he was put into it, and we brought him to London—on the way from Isleworth we passed through a dirty lane; I mentioned it to Sayers, and the prisoner said "Oh, yes; I know that place; I came through that lane on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> way to see Mrs. Wiggins; I know this part part very well; I know my way about here very well"—in the course of our journey to London, I asked him where he got the revolver, adding that his father had told me that he never saw such a thing in his possession—he said "I bought it on Thursday morning, shortly after leaving home, at a pawnbroker's shop in the Seven Sisters' Road; I intended to use it;" I am not positive whether he said "for," or "on myself; things were very miserable at home, and I could obtain no employment"—he said "After the affair, I went towards Hyde Park, and so across the Regent's Park, and then to Kentish Town; I had been out all the previous night, at least,</p>

               <p>from 5 o'clock in the morning; I felt tired"—he then spoke of the follow<lb></lb>ing morning, Saturday morning, and said "When I left Kentish Town, I did not know where I was going, or what I was doing; I only had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., with a penny of which I bought a newspaper, to read about the affair; it was all wrong. I did not take a cab, or go to Victoria for the purpose of going to Dover; I had no money; with the other penny I bought 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of returns—when I went out that morning, I went through Finchley and Barnet, towards St. Albans, and finding at what place I was, I retraced my steps towards London, thinking I should like to see Mrs. Wiggins once more, and I did not want to be apprehended in London; on reaching Kentish Town, I found a pair of spectacles, which I put on and wore through Kensington and Hammersmith"—that was all that took place in the cab—on reaching the station, he was placed in a cell with a man in care of him—on the Sunday evening, he asked me for pens, ink, and paper to write a letter—I told him he could have them, but that I should read • what he wrote before sending it away—he said "I only want to write to Mrs. Milton to explain to her why I cut off my whiskers at her house as that seemed to surprise her"—I said "You had better not write the letter if you wish to see Mrs. Milton, or any other friend, I will send for them for you"—no letter was written, nor did they come.</p>

I am a daughter of the last witness—my sister was engaged to be married to the prisoner—the last time I saw him, before 15th December, was on 10th November, the day after my sister's birthday—he was at our house—I did not' write a letter to him about 14th December—there was no communication of the sort—I did not make any appointment verbally to meet him at Mr. Collins'—while my uncle was in Cornwall <hi rend="italic">last</hi> summer I was stopping over there, and I wrote inviting the prisoner and my sister to tea—my sister came, but he did not—I was stopping with my aunt there—I made no appointment to meet him there in December.</p>

               <p>he was studying for the purpose of passing an examination—he complained of headache on that day—I did not walk with him that evening—he was sitting in a chair downstairs in our house when he complained of his head—I do not know whether my sister Carry was there—I don't think she was—he was living opposite us with his father for some years—about nine months ago the whole family moved to Hornsey Road—my sister was in the habit of seeing him every Sunday evening when he was in a situation—they were on most affectionate terms—he was very much vexed at not being able to make her a present on her birthday—I saw him frequently between September and November; he appeared dreadfully depressed during thoso months—I never heard him say that he might as well shoot himself—I did not see him at King's Cross at anytime—I have a. brother at King's Cross—my sister Carry went there.</p>

Yours truly, <hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi>" it was to be delivered to him on Friday morning by the first post; that was the Friday of the murder, the 15th—I was out at the time and had not an opportunity of sending him a sovereign—I do not remember the date at which the letter came, but I am sure it was on the Thursday, the day before the murder—his address was on the letter, it was his father's address, I think—I did not send him any money at all.</p>

I am a physician and surgeon, and live at 55, Gloucester Street, Pimlico—on 15th December, about 3.25 in the afternoon, I was called to 99, Stanley Street—I knew the family—the area door was open—I saw a pool of blood on the steps downstairs, so I went down the area steps and into the front kitchen—I there saw the deceased John Collins lying on his back, dead—Mrs. Collins was kneeling by his side—I first took notice of Mr. Collins—there was a small wound on the outside of the left eyebrow, about half an inch in length, and six or seven small spots of blood on the front of the shirt—the wound was on the external angle of the left eyebrow—my opinion at that moment was, hearing that he had been shot, that the bullet had entered there—I made do further examination of him at that time, with this exception, that I undid his dress and unbuckled the belt that was round the waist; it was a broad belt, partly elastic and</p>

I live at 250, Lancaster Road, Notting Hill—I was in the service of Mr. Treadaway, the prisoner's grandfather, between twenty-three and twenty-four years ago—he "was then living in Newton Row, Westbourne Grove—I was a little over four years in his service as cook—Mrs. Treadaway, his first wife, was living there as well, also his son George and his daughter Susan—they were unmarried—Susan was subject to fits—I saw the fits very frequently—I slept with her—they used to last for some time; they occurred sometimes once or twice a week, and sometimes she would not have them quite so often—she had fits all the time I was there, and. Before I lived there—I don't know what kind of fits they were—she used to struggle very much, and she was quite black in the face when she was in them—she was very violent; it used to take me and her father to keep her down—she used to bite pieces out of the glasses—she was ill before the fit came on—she used to be very strange about the place—I could always tell because. I used to watch her; she would be so, perhaps, for a day, or perhaps only a few hours before the fit came on—she used to be very strange in her eyes, and in her manners; I could—tell from that when they were coming on—she complained of pains in—her head before they came on; she did not describe the pains at all, no more than that they were very shooting pains, darting—she did not complain of anything <hi rend="italic">else</hi> in particular; the was very ill after the fits for days—she was not able to be about after a fit; a fit would last sometimes an hour and sometimes more, and afterwards she looked very haggard about the eyes, very worn, and very wild—she had a very wild look for days—she was not at all conscious during the fit—she used to foam very much at the mouth; I was not with her up to her death—the mother was a very great invalid; she was very curious in the head; she used to say all sorts of horrible things, and sometimes throw things at me; she used to swear at me sometimes—she has thrown a cruet-stand "at" me—she was never able to do anything, because she always had some one with her nearly—she was passionate—she could not manage the house at all; she would care for nothing of that—I knew the prisoner's father—his name is George.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Eastwood Terrace, Hornsey Road, and carry on business there as an outfitter—the prisoner is my son—he was twenty—one this month—he was brought up in the country until the age of seven, on account of his health, at Isllingdon—he afterwards lived with me in the Harrow Road, Paddington—he went to the Philological School until he was fifteen years of age, and then he was in my shop with me for a year or two to learn business habits—he was for two or three years in several situations down to August, 1876—he used to come home occasionally; up to the time of his going into those situations he was very kind and good-natured—on a Saturday, I think in July or August, he came home from his situation to stay till the Monday, and on the Sunday morning I was out walking with him in the Holloway Road close to the Liverpool Road, we were on the left hand side of the way approaching the Liverpool Road, when I felt him stagger against me—I said "What is the matter, Fred, don't you feel well?" he mumbled something indistinctly, I could not understand what it was, but I noticed that his eyes appeared as if the sight was going; he then fainted; he lost his muscular power—he did not fall to the ground, only up against me—I dragged him into a door<lb></lb>way, and rubbed his back and opened his hands and rubbed them, and kept speaking to him, but he was not conscious—I took his hat off—he seemed to be quite unconscious of what I was doing, he could not speak to me—this lasted altogether, I think, as near as possible twenty minutes—he trembled very much, and shook violently and turned deadly pale, and then afterwards seemed gradually to recover—the first words he said to me were "I am burning in the throat, do get me something to drink"—I could not get anything to drink, but I got two oranges, which were the nearest things I could get, and he sucked the juice of the two oranges, and it seemed to make him much better; he gradually recovered—this happened about a mile from home—I walked home with him—we stopped once under the railway bridge for a few minutes—he was very weak, and he complained of, his head burning very much—he managed to walk home all right—he had slept at my house the night before—when we got home he complained of feeling very bad in his head, and he laid down on the sofa some time, and stopped in all the afternoon—I think he was asleep all the afternoon on the sofa, I know he was upstairs—when we started on our walk he appeared to be quite well; I did not notice anything unusual—once when we were living at 28, Harrow Road, he was sent to a chemist's, and he came home with his face cut and said that he had had a fit in Doctor Watts' shop—that must have been in the year 1873—there was a mark on his face, a graze, not a cut—he did not make any complaint particularly to me, he did to his mother—I did not attend to him then—he complained of his head all that day afterwards—he left his last situation in September, 1876, or the last week in August—during the last months that he was there he complained—frequently of his head aching very much, and he frequently</p>

               <p>enquired whether he should take any medicine—I to him "No," I did not think it necessary to take any medicine—he thought he was suffering from biliousness—he always complained of his head—I did not observe his com<lb></lb>plaints at first so much as I did the latter few weeks when he was at home—he complained more frequently at the latter part, I mean previous to December—he complained of his head feeling queer—those were the words he used to make use of," My head is so queer, I think I ought to take some medicine"—when we were at the Harrow Road I know that he used to wet his bed—that used to be between 1873 and 1874—that occurred five or six times—during the later period when he complained of feeling queer in his head he was very low-spirited, very much, depressed, sometimes he would not speak for an hour to me—I had no quarrel with him at all—he assisted me in the business two or three days before 14th December—on the Wednesday he wrote me a number of tickets for the window—he did not have any conversation with me before he went away on the Thursday—I know that he took away a carpet-bag with him—I do not remember his saying anything to me about going into a situation—my mother's maiden name was Susanna Baugham—she died in August, 1854, at the age of fifty-six or fifty-seven—she was always ill, she had been ill ever since I could remember—at times she was very bad indeed, she would stand at the window and say that people going by were making all sorts of game and fun at her, and she would throw things out of the window at them, and shake her fist at them, when there was no one doing anything of the kind—she was very passionate, at times fearfully so—she was guilty of acts of violence at various times and afterwards she was not conscious of her condition, she used to be so very kind afterwards—it was only on par<lb></lb>ticular days that she would be like that—I had a sister who was only two years younger than me; her name was Susanna—I cannot exactly remember in what year she died—I think it was just previous to my mother—I think she was twenty-three when she died—I saw a good deal of her in her lifetime, more particularly on the Sundays, the last few years of her life—I used to attend church with her; she was dreadfully afflicted.</p>

               <p>affinity between insanity and epilepsy—the hereditary transmission of insanity applies also to the hereditary transmission of epilepsy; I mean to say that epileptic vertigo is transmissible—it is possible that a person may have a taint of insanity and be subject to epileptic vertigo—a person out of his mind may have epileptic vertigo—I have seen specific instances of persons with epileptic vertigo acting automatically—on one occasion when I happened to be travelling abroad it was brought to my knowledge that one of the officers of the ship attempted to commit suicide on several occa<lb></lb>sions, and on conversing with him on the subject he denied all knowledge of the facts stated against him, but witnesses were produced to show that he had done so on several occasions; what I actually saw was this, I was called to him in a hurry, and I had reason to believe he was suffering from opium poisoning; upon applying the stomach pump I extracted about a pint of laudanum out of his stomach, and while performing this operation he was perfectly sensible, and denied all knowledge of having taken it—I believed that; I questioned him as to what he had taken; he was not able to answer me; he told me that he was quite unconscious of having taken anything—my attention was called to the fact that he looked ill, and when I went to him he complained of being ill, but when I asked him why, he said he did not know—I afterwards saw that the laudanum bottle in the doctor's cabin was quite empty, and there were dregs of laudanum in the bottom of a tumbler—I believe that was a case of epileptic vertigo—I believe from all the circumstances of the case that on all those occasions upon which he attempted to commit suicide he was unconscious of the fact that he had done so—that is a symptom of epileptic vertigo, and that was my conclusion from what he said—I have known other cases of automatic action in persons suffering from epileptic vertigo, cases of a similar character, and I came to the conclusion on much the same grounds—while I was house-physician I remember one case of a man who was brought into the hospital suffering from some slight complaint of his lungs, and various complaints were made against him for assaulting the patients in the wards at different times—I was informed by the nurses that this was done appa<lb></lb>rently while under the influence of a fit—I did not see them absolutely myself, but I was obliged to dismiss the man for his conduct—besides the cases that have come under my observation, I have, in the study of the profession, become acquainted with this disease of epilepsy divided into its various forms of epeleptic vertigo and epileptic fits; that is known to medical science; it is not a recognised form of mental derangement; all those fits of unconsciousness are included under the term epilepsy—the fact of a. man being epileptic does not necessarily mean that he is insane, but epilepsy may frequently be associated with insanity, and frequently it is; it may not be so necessarily, it may so wear out the brain as in time to make the person insane—at the time of the attack of vertigo the patient is unconscious—during the time of an attack of epileptic vertigo the person can perform acts of which he is unconscious, and speak, but not rationally; he may speak apparently rationally—I have not known such an instance—it is a part of medical science, known to medical men, that a person labouring under epileptic vertigo can talk rationally; they can answer questions—they may answer questions to the point, although it may not be rationally—there are a good many writers upon this subject, eminent medical men; among the English there are Doctors Maudslay, Jackson, Russell, and Reynolds, and among the French there are Trousseau, Fabret, and Esquirol; they</p>

               <p>are the principal writers upon epilepsy, they are living men and have had experience—it is after an acquaintance with the writings of those authors that I have given the last answer—I was requested by the solicitor conduct<lb></lb>ing this defence to attend at the Westminster police-court when the accused, was under charge; that was on the second examination, I believe, on the 26th December—I did not see the attack spoken to by Inspector Foignett; nothing occurred to attract my notice, I did not see anything the matter with him then; I have seen him on five occasions, including that time—he has answered any question that I may have put to him—on the first occa<lb></lb>sion I saw him at the Westminster police-court and on three occasions at the House of Detention and had three interviews with him—on the last two occasions I saw him in Newgate—during those interviews I had occasion to examine him physically and as a result of that examinational did not dis<lb></lb>cover any unhealthy condition—I then interrogated him as to his past health and he stated that he had been in good health till two years ago; he said that about that time he had what he termed a fainting fit in a chemist's shop; he described the fainting fit to me—he said that since then he had six or eight seizures of a similar character, and that in addition to those he had been subject during the last two years to very frequent and violent headaches—he said also that during this time he had been in the habit of occasionally passing water in 'bed during sleep—he also said that he had be liable to various nervous pains, more especially that which is medically termed angina pectoris, that is the name I give from his description—he said that since August last he had been in a very depressed and melancholic con<lb></lb>dition; he said he brooded over his troubles to such an extent that he sub<lb></lb>sequently formed the idea of committing suicide—he further stated that several plans of performed suicide suggested themselves to his mind, but that he finally determined upon a pistol as being the most expeditious and one that he was likely to have the resolution to carry out—finally he stated that on the morning of the 15th he had a very severe headache, and that while sitting with Mr. Collins he was seized with a violent shooting pain in the head, with giddiness, and with the sensation of a black cloud coming over his senses, and from that moment his mind was a blank until he found himself in the street—most of this was told upon the second interview that I had with him—he also stated that for the remainder of that day he felt head<lb></lb>ache and confused in his ideas, and towards the evening he felt quite well—these statements came out in the course of conversation with me—I did not tell him what I came to see him for, I told him I was a doctor come to see after his health; I did not in any way suggest the answers to my questions—supposing all these statements to be true, it indicated a form of disease known as epileptic vertigo—it was at the second interview, but the first that 1 had at the House of Detention, that he spoke about a dark cloud—I had an opportunity of conversing with him freely there—I think the 3rd of February was the last time I saw him—I saw his illness yesterday in the dock—the fit itself was somewhat of an anomalous character, but, in my opinion, it was decidedly of an epileptic form—I mean to say that it did not represent the characteristic symptoms of an epileptic fit; some of them did, but not all; it was somewhat more prolonged than is usual, and some of the symptoms were varied from what is common in that disease—I accom<lb></lb>panied him into the cell—total insensibility is one characteristic sign of epe<lb></lb>lepsy, and dilitation of the pupils and a seeming unconscious stupor, which for some time succeeded the attack—I tested the Question of total insensi<lb></lb>bility</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The learned Judge read to the witness that portion of the fathers evidence which referred to the illness of the prisoner when walking with him.</hi>) It is impossible for me to give an opinion from the description of one attack; I should not care to do so; some of the symptoms so described are quite consistent with epileptic vertigo, but the same symptoms might, to a certain extent, belong to other affections; there is nothing definitely characteristic—I could form an opinion if I had more than one fit described to me—the involuntary passing of water at night in sleep is a common symptom of epileptic seizure during sleep—the shooting and throbbing pains in the head are quite con<lb></lb>sistent with an epileptic attack, they are very frequently associated with it—an epileptic attack is very frequently followed by headache—fainting fits occur without being followed by headache, but very frequently they are—the symptoms which he described to me and which I term angina pectoris, was a pain and a sensation of a cord being drawn tightly round his chest, that very frequently accompanies epilepsy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Epilepsy is a disease of the brain—the patient is un<lb></lb>conscious during the attack—it always takes away consciousness—a violent act, of which the person knows nothing afterwards, is not necessarily an indication of epileptic vertigo, but during an attack of epileptic vertigo a person may do violent actions—in my own personal observation I have never seen an attack of epileptic vertigo last more than two or three minutes, but the effects usually last for many hours afterwards—it may show itself coming on—during that state of unconsciousness a person may do acts, not necessarily of violence, but an extraordinary act which he may not be able to recollect when he recovers; he would not be able to say what he had done; that is the characteristic; I mean to say that when he comes to himself after this unconscious condition he will answer questions intelli<lb></lb>gibly—it has not come under my own personal experience to ask a person questions in that condition—in the case of the man on board ship, he was, not given to opium eating, nor was he a hard drinker—I had watched him for some months previous to this, during which time complaints were being brought to me that on several occasions he had attempted to commit suicide—I had not myself seen him attempt to commit suicide—when I went to see the prisoner at the House of Detention I did not intimate to Dr. Smiles that I was going to see him—I wrote to the Governor telling him I was going to see him—Dr. Smiles was not present—there is nothing in the description I have heard read to me in reference to his appearance on the Sunday that is inconsistent with an ordinary fainting fit—the prisoner is not delicately framed—he seemed to me of fair organisation—he does not appear to me to be at all of a delicate frame.</p>

               <p>I went to see him—I went at the suggestion of the prisoner's solicitor—lunacy is a predisposing cause to epilepsy—if members of the family were lunatic and epileptic, it would be very strong presumption that any future generation would be tainted with that disease—assuming that some mem<lb></lb>bers of the family were affected with lunacy and another with epilepsy, it would presumably be in favour of the fainting described by the father being of an epileptic character—in the case of the man complained of in the ward of the hospital, I noticed the man myself, he was unconscious of having committed those acts—as to the man on board ship, although I did not see the attempts at suicide, I have no doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D., and member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.; I am resident physician at Bethlehem Royal Hospital, and lecturer on mental diseases at St. Thomas's Hospital—in my personal experience I have come across many cases of epilepsy—the medical profession recognise epileptic vertigo as a disease—some years ago I saw a gentleman who simply suffered from headache occasionally; at that time I had no suspicion of epilepsy; one morning suddenly whilst at breakfast he made a violent attack upon his wife; when I saw him shortly afterwards he could give me no account of it, nor any reason for so doing, he did not after that show any symptoms of mental disease, but he had subsequently at various intervals, some nine or ten epileptic fits—he had one about a month after he made the attack upon his wife; he continued under medical care about fourteen months; I heard of him about two years ago, he had then resumed his ordinary occupation and was perfectly well, and had no return of the fits, and he had-had ten or eleven in all—I heard of him about eighteen months ago, he was then well—I have not heard more recently—that is the only case I have seen that appears to me remarkable; I have seen others—a person attacked with epileptic vertigo is unconscious while he is committing the act, unconscious of what he may be doing, not insensible—from my own observation I can't say whether they can speak, they do acts automatically—all they do is automatic, that is the state they are in; I ground my opinion upon that; that is the definition of it; they act as mere machines, and when they recover they are utterly unconscious of anything that has happened—sometimes there may be perfect conscious<lb></lb>ness, perfect sanity before the attack—while under the influence of the vertigo they know not what they do, but I have seen cases where there is an impression afterwards of having done something, but they cannot tell what—the length of the attack varies very much, the longest I have ever seen lasted about an hour, the party being unconscious the whole of that time, but as a rule they are of very much shorter duration—I have been present during this trial; the symptoms described of constant headaches, passing water unconsciously during the night, and the pains described, correspond exactly with cases which I have had under my care, and which have been undoubtedly epileptic vertigo—I think they are characteristic of it—epilepsy, I think, would tend to shorten life, but not insanity—epilepsy is a disease of the brain—if there is an heredi<lb></lb>tary transmission of insanity, there may very probably be an hereditary transmission of epilepsy—yesterday I went into the jail and saw the prisoner in his illness—unfortunately I did not see him during the attack, only after, and he had been taken down before I got into the jail—he was unconscious when I went in—the pupils of the eye were dilated—I was not present when the unconsciousness was tested—an attempt to thwart or</p>

               <p>oppose an epileptic, influences him at the time of an attack—we consider epileptics a most dangerous class amongst all lunatics, most liable to sudden outbreaks—I don't know that an ordinary epileptic would at the time of the fit be more subject to an outbreak than at other times, only an epileptic lunatic—from what I saw yesterday I am of opinion that he had had an epileptic fit, or I might say an epileptic form of fit; some of the symptoms of epilepsy were wanting, there were other indications which showed that it was combined with a considerable amount of hysteria, but there were symptoms that did not belong to hysteria.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> From the terms on which they were, there was no cause for the violence on his part, they were on the most affectionate terms, and have been ever since, for what I know.</p>

I am a surgeon and am medical superintendent at Hanwell Lunatic Asylum—Mary Stilwell was in the asylum from October 12th, 1874, and died on 13th January, 1875; she was of unsound mind, she was not dangerous, except to herself; she was reckless and would get into mischief; she would tumble about and be liable to break her bones, not liable to suicide, or dangerous to anybody else—I have had many epe<lb></lb>leptic patients under my care for the last five years; I have averaged about 115 at a time constantly in the asylum, epileptic lunatics—I have seen several persons afflicted with epileptic vertigo, where it did not go beyond vertigo—I quite agree with the last two witnesses that a person in a fit of epileptic vertigo is unconscious at the time of any act he may commit—I have on several occasions had patients afflicted with epileptic vertigo who have attempted violence upon myself; I can recall to mind one that occurred about twelve months ago, a woman of the name of Fanny Sheward who was an epe<lb></lb>leptic, but who, before the attack of epilepsy, used to have these attacks of epileptic vertigo—on one occasion she was talking very agreeably and sen<lb></lb>sibly, and suddenly I saw that her mind seemed to get vacant; she did not look at me in the face, and she suddenly hit out at me, and as soon as that was done she went on talking in the same agreeable strain—I said to her "Why did you hit me?"—she said "I don't think I hit you, I don't remem<lb></lb>ber anything about it at all"—I have had other attacks made upon me by others, but I cannot recollect them so distinctly; those persons were afflicted with epileptic vertigo, alternating with epilepsy—this Sheward, some day or two after that had a violent attack of epilepsy and was much convulsed—in the other cases where the attempts were made upon me the patients, after recovering from the fit, were quite unconscious of what they had done—I saw the prisoner yesterday as he was coming out of the fit; he was uncon<lb></lb>scious then, but was not actually in the fit; from the symptoms I saw I formed the opinion that it was an epileptic fit, with some modified symptoms.</p>

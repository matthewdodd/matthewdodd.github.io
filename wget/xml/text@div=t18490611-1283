                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's husband, and am a cabinet-maker. I resided with my wife at Austin-street, Shoreditch—I have been married to her four years—one morning about two months ago I had been up-stairs to work before breakfast, and came down to breakfast about nine o'clock; my wife had then poured the coffee out—I felt sick after my coffee, and said, "I think there must be something in this coffee that is not right"—I felt pains after my meals constantly—blood came up, and blood came down from my bowels—I vomited blood that night—my tongue was constantly dry, and I constantly lost the hair off my head, and there was always something the matter with my nose, I was quite completely gone rotten—in the afternoon of the day I have spoken of, I came down rather quickly, and observed my wife take the tea-cup which I usually had my tea in from the dresser, put it on the table, and when I sat down where I generally sit, she <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the cup from me to her own side, so that I could not look into the bottom of the cup—while she was getting the pot from the hob to poor the tea into the cup, I looked into it and saw some white powder in it mixed with something—I took my finger and tasted it, and it burnt my tongue—it was a <hi rend="italic">retching</hi> taste like, a salty, sickly taste—I asked my wife what it was, and she said she supposed the child must have put something into it—that was impossible, because I saw her take the cup from the dresser, and the child is only two years old, and could not reach the cup—she was in great confusion—I washed the cup out myself—nothing more passed then—two days after I searched the house, and as I had heard that she always before tea had something to do with some boxes that stood on one side as you go up-stairs to my workshop; I looked into these two boxes first—I found nothing in them; but on lifting them down, I found a packet of some stuff between them—I put my finger to it and tasted it, and it tasted the same as that which I found in my cup—my wife was present, and I said, "What is this?"—she directly said, "Throw it in the fire, it is only salt of prunella which your brother's wife gave me"—I said, "I shall not throw it in the fire; this is the same stuff that I found in my tea-cup, I shall have it ex<lb></lb>amined—I took it up-stairs, and hid it in a <hi rend="italic">sly</hi> corner in my workshop where nobody could come to it, as it was out of my power to have it examined directly—I kept it there six weeks, at the end of which time my brother</p>

               <p>William came to my house—I told him how I had found it—we took it to Dr. Ryan, and my brother gave it him—I returned home and my brother came again to my house soon afterwards in the evening—I heard my brother say to my wife, you gave my brother poison—I left the house with him for a quarter of an hour, and returned home alone—my wife was then in great confusion, and when I entered the door she said, "Philip, I gave you poison, God forgive me for it; you <hi rend="italic">aint</hi> dead yet"—I said, "You have done a shocking crime on me"—her father came to the house next evening, and directly he came in doors, she said, "Father, take me in protection; they have found me out, they have got it all clear against me, they took the stuff out of the house"—I then told her father what she had done, and how I had found it out; and he said, "I don't think it; I can't think it"—he then left the house and she remained with me—her father and mother came the next morning: her father said, "You shan't stop with him," and they took her away—they returned in half an hour and the paint were very bad indeed then; I could hardly stand or breathe, and I thought every minute I should die—I went to Dr. Ryan and described the symptoms—I do not know whether I told him how long I had been so troubled—about a year ago, I observed that my wife treated me with distance—she was always out day after day; I told her she should stop at home—at last I bad suspicion of a man who lived opposite, and my wife told me that he came to my house for tools when I was out—I do not know that he had any tools in my house, he borrowed them always when I was out—he came on one occasion without any cause, and stood looking at my work; and when my wife came down stairs, he pretended to go and kiss the child, I watched, and saw them <hi rend="italic">wink</hi> at one another, and heard the word "To-morrow"—at another time I was out about half an hour, and when 1 returned the blinds were shut down, and the door was locked, and I knocked for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; she then came down stairs and opened the door—she looked quite confused, and as pale as death—I heard footsteps up<lb></lb>stairs, and asked her who was up-stairs; she replied, it was only the cat—I had no time then to stop to search, but went away again directly—when I came home in the evening, I asked her who was up-stairs, and what busi<lb></lb>ness she had with anybody up-stairs?-1 said, "What a shameful thing it was to have anything to do with another man"—she said, "Who told you?"—I said, "Never mind who told me"—that made her rather confused, and she said, "Philip, I must soon die; I have done something else wrong against you, I won't tell you till I am on my dying bed"—after that nothing hap<lb></lb>pened—I could not stop at home, and 1 let her go on for two years as she liked—she said she would not be made a prisoner by any man.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M.D. I reside at Dalston. About 7th or 8th May, William Schollenberger called on me and gave me a small brown paper par<lb></lb>cel containing a white powder, which I afterwards analyzed—I found it con<lb></lb>sisted of eight grains of common salt and nearly two of arsenic, with a small portion of organic matter—I saw a man outside the gate at the time, but I did not notice who he was—next day I saw the prosecutor; he seemed ex<lb></lb>tremely ill—I examined him as well I as could—he had principally to relate to me his symptoms, which I could not detect, except from his own information—I have heard the evidence which has been given to-day—such effects as he describes would be produced from the administration of small doses of arsenic from time to time—arsenic would produce burning pains in the throat—combined with salt it would produce a sickly <hi rend="italic">retching</hi> feeling, having a pecu<lb></lb>liarly nauseous taste—it sometimes produces pain in the intestines, but not always—the falling off of the hair is a symptom following the long administra<lb></lb>tion of arsenic in small doses—it affects the skin—dryness of the tongue and tightness of the throat are also symptoms—I first gave the prosecutor par-oxide of iron, thinking he might have arsenic in his stomach, and next day I com<lb></lb>menced a course of opium—I pursued towards him that course that I should adopt for a person affected with arsenic, and the result of that course was that he became decidedly better; that confirmed me in the truth of the facts he represented—I was of course guided a great deal by finding arsenic in the parcel, because there were a great many things I could not get at—I saw none of his excretions, which I ought to have done—he called on me ten or twelve times altogether—small quantities of arsenic would in the end produce death—It is impossible for me to say how long a party might continue to be dosed in that manner—I have known arsenic given for sixteen weeks in small doses medicinally—I had never seen him before—he is quite well now.</p>

               <p>other symptoms which accompany the administration of arsenic—I have not found persons complain of those things combined where no poison has been exhibited—taking them separately they are common, collectively they are not—they are not found collectively in disorders of the stomach—arsenic acts by disordering the stomach, and it acts on the nervous system as well—I am a graduate of the University of Edinburgh—I am in practice, and am are-cognised teacher of medicine at one of the metropolitan schools for medicine in Charlotte-street—I have lectured at the Polytechnic—I am not a physician of London—I am a member of the College of Surgeons at Edinburgh, which qualifies me for practice here as a surgeon.</p>

The prisoner is my daughter; she has been married four years—on 8th May I went to her house; her husband was there smoking his pipe—she was in bed, crying—I asked what she was crying for—she said Philip's brother had accused her of poisoning him—I turned to the husband and said, "Philip, do you accuse your wife of trying to poison you?"—she said, "No, father, it is not him, it is his brother accuses me of it"—she then said she was too fond of him to attempt to poison him—he said, "I shall always suspect it now my brother has got the poison"—she said, "I will not live under this suspicion;" I said I hoped she would not—she said she would come home next morning—I said I would come for her—she did not say, "They have found me out; they have got it all clear against me," or any such words.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M.D. I am a lecturer on chemistry, of the London Hospital, and have been so seven years. I have heard the symptoms described by the prosecutor of his sufferings—I do not think they are symptoms of continued poisoning—I think he is labouring under some chronic affection of the stomach—from his appearance, I should judge him to be a man of weak body—if he went into any of the public hospitals, they would directly say, that man has some organic disease of the stomach—illness would continue for a short time after arsenic ceased to be administered—the illness of a man would vary very much according as the doses were given—if the doses ceased to be administered, the effect of them would go away in about a fortnight, except a fresh dose was given—when it ceases, a man quite recovers his health—all the symptoms I have heard described are more consistent with an organic affection of the stomach, than the exhibition of arsenic—I no not think it possible that any individual could be subjected to the influence of arsenic for a continued period of six months—arsenic produces a burning tongue—there is no taste in arsenic; I have tasted it hundreds of times, it is the opinion of all chemists that there is no taste in it—it is a question frequently mooted in courts of justice, and they are all agreed upon it—it would not leave a metallic taste on the tongue, or anything like a burning, nothing of the sort—I have tasted arsenic this morning, for the purpose of satisfying myself, as I always do in a case of this kind, and I felt no influence—sal<lb></lb>prunella would not produce a burning sensation, it would produce an unpleasant sensation in the mouth, but I do not call it a burning—tightness of the throat is a symptom of derangement of the stomach-whenever the stomach is deranged, whether from disease or poison, there is that symptom, but in affections of the stomach it is expressly given as one of the symptoms by Abercrombie, who is one of the greatest authorities on affections of the stomach—if the discharge of blood upwards and downwards had resulted from arsenic, I have no doubt that death must have followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That would of course depend upon the quantity of blood that came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I believe when blood comes from the intestines it indicates a strong dose—blood may come from the mouth without coming from the stomach—arsenic does not accumulate in the system; I never heard that it did—I have read Dr. Taylor's work on poisoning—he is of opinion that it does not accumulate in the system—I am not certain that Christison offers any opinion upon it—I believe there is but one physician who advocates it—I am of opinion that it passes off—the symptoms I have heard described might proceed from the taking of small doses of arsenic—the falling off of the hair is one symptom of arsenic—it affects the skin—I have not tasted arsenic combined with salt—I should not think it necessary to perform such an experiment—there is no instance in which salt gives a corrosive character to anything—I am not a surgeon—opium will palliate all diseases of the stomach, and the par-oxide of iron would do neither harm nor good; I take it to be just like a dose of water—it does not produce any immediate effect—opium would stop the pain—from the description I have heard from the witnesses, and from having looked carefully at the man himself, I have no doubt that he labours under organic disease of the stomach—I have been led to study that particular class of complaint—my parents died from organic</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110053"></xptr>
               <p>disease of the stomach, and they had all these appearances, and their symptoms were exactly like those which have been described—the sallow complexion is one characteristic—I cannot say that the falling off of the hair would be any sign at all; it is a symptom of poisoning by arsenic; but, then, hair falls off from anxiety of mind, and many other circumstances—if the man was of a jealous temperament that would be very likely to keep him in a state of excitement, and that is known to have an influence upon the skin—it would prevent the functions of the body being properly performed, and the hair would necessarily fall off.</p>

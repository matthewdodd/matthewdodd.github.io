               <p>I am wife of the last witness, I live in John-street, Oxford-Market, I know the prisoner, my husband has a house in Union-street, No. 6. the prisoner took the apartment of me, not by agreement in writing, she was to have it for two guineas a week; there was a parlour, a first floor, a second floor; it is a single house, all in front; she had every apartment, except a cellar: I missed the things mentioned in the indictment: I saw them at Justice Hyde's, three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Where is this cellar? - There are three cellars, and this is the further one, a part of a cellar: she had all the house, and the cellars, but a cellar in the area, and that has no communication with the house, the communication is from the street, and from the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. My Lord, I beg to observe on the part of the prisoner, that it is plain from this woman's evidence, let the way to the cellar be where it will, or from whence it will, that the prisoner had compleat controul over the house; she had the key, she took the house for the avowed purpose of letting lodgings; and the possession of that cellar cannot any way be considered as the possession of the landlord of that house.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Have you a key of the great door. - Yes, I always had.</p>

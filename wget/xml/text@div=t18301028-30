               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I called to ask how the prosecutrix was - when I went up the door was ajar, and the two children in bed; I awoke them, and asked how their mother was - they said she was not at home; I asked why they were not up, as it was twelve o'clock - the girl began to cry, and said her mother would beat her, the place not being cleaned, and the fire not lighted; she got up, and washed her little brother - I made the place tidy, and folded some linen for the mangle; I went out and met a person who used to work where the prosecutrix did - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280023"></xptr>asked if she could stop a night or two with me, as Mrs. Searles had turned her out; I said I would ask the persons where I lived - she then said she was going to Banner-street to get work, and would leave this parcel with me; she threw them into a small basket - she stopped with me that night, and the next morning the prosecutrix came, caught me by the throat, and said these were her things.</p>

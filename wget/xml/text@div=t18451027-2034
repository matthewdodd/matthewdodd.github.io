                  </hi>. I live in Ratcliffe Highway, and am an optician—the prisoner lived with me about four years—on the 29th of Sept. he applied to me for half-a-crown—he said he wanted it for a material we use in our trade to polish glass—I gave him a sovereign to get change, and saw no more of him till he was in custody—he never brought me the sovereign or change.</p>

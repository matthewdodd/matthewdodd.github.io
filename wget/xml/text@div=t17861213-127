               <p>I live in High-street, Lambeth; on the 22d of November, I lost a horse from <placeName id="t17861213-127-crimeloc638">Long-acre</placeName>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. There is no doubt of the identity; when your horse was missed from the door, your friend Mr. Peacock advised you to go to the Green-yard? - He did.</p>
               <p>You walked to the Green-yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way did you take? - Down James's-street, and so on to the Piazza, Covent Garden; we went for the shortest way.</p>
               <p>How far was you from the Green-yard before you met this man with your horse? - Not far.</p>
               <p>In what way was he riding, briskly or how? - No; he was walking the horse.</p>
               <p>You immediately went up to him, and pulled him off the horse? - Yes; when he got to Sir Sampson's he said, he found the horse astray, and was taking him to the Green-yard; he said, some boys were driving the horse in Long-acre, and some men recommended it to him to take it to the Green-yard.</p>
               <p>Was he within three or four hundred yards of the Green-yard? - He might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>He had not got to the Green-yard? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Was this man drunk or sober? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How did he appear to you? - He looked very reasonable.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be somewhat in liquor? - I cannot say he was.</p>
               <p>I believe it struck you in such a way that you expressed yourself in some such way as this; I wish I had given him a horse whipping? - I said as I had my property I wished I had let the man go.</p>
               <p>Court. What part of Long-acre does Mr. Peacock live in? - The corner of an alley near the middle.</p>

               <p>Was it a tall man or a little man? - I cannot tell rightly.</p>

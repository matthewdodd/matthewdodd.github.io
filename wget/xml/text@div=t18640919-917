                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, and live at 128, Great Suffolk-street, Borough—the deceased was my wife—I had been married to her about fourteen or fifteen years—we have had five children—the prisoner Dr. Goss was in partnership with Dr. Jones in the South wark-bridge-road—Dr. Jones had attended my wife in three of her previous confinements—I can remember the prisoner with Dr. Jones for ten or twelve years—he has sometimes attended my wife with Dr Jones, on one occasion in her confine<lb></lb>ment—my wife's confinements were difficult; she wanted care and attention—in August last she was in the family way—on Wednesday, 17th August, Dr. Goss was sent for to attend her—about three months ago as he was passing by my wife said she wished to engage him; he looked in about a fortnight afterwards, and then she engaged him—I was present at the time—on 17th August she was taken unwell, and I sent a messenger for Dr. Goss between 7 and 8 in the evening—he did not come at all on the Wednesday night; be came on the Thursday morning a little before 12—he went into the bar-parlour and saw my wife for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—when he came out, I said to him, "Well, Doctor, how is my wife going on?"—he said, "The symptoms she has are a mere nothing, she may go on for week or a fortnight, or very likely a month in this state; it is nothing, and you must not make yourself uneasy about it"—he then left my mother had come on the Wednesday evening, before I sent for the doctor and she remained with my wife up to the time of her death—we sent for him again on the Friday night—she went on very comfortably on the Thurs<lb></lb>day, but on Friday evening she began to have some very bad pains—I sent for him and he very soon came—I suppose it was between 8 and 9 o'clock—he went up stairs to my wife and stayed some time—I was standing at the door when he came out—I said, "Well, Doctor, how is my wife going on?"—he said, "She is going on very well, but it is a cross birth. I have examined her; I can't tell you exactly whether it is the elbow or the knee that presents itself—I said, "Doctor, you are never going to leave her then in that state?"—he said, "Oh yes, I am; I have not had any tea or supper,. but I shall be back again"—I said, "I hope you will come back again directly"—he said, "Oh, no, I shan't I shall be back again to-night"—I said, "Will it be over to-night?"—he said, "Oh, yes; I hope it will be over before I come back"—he came back again about 12 o'clock, I believe, but I did not see him, I was asleep on the sofa—he stopped about half an hour—he next came on Saturday afternoon about 3, but I was not in the way then—my wife got gradually weaker and lower in spirits, and weaker altogether—the pains left her from the Friday night—Dr. Goss called on Saturday of his own accord</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190101"></xptr>
               <p>—I understand he remained about a quarter of an hour or twenty minute I went up to my wife, and she said she was very bad, and she knew she should not have strength to go through it—I sent for Dr. Goss again about 8 or a little after—we understood he was attending Mrs. Edwards at the Bridge House—he was there, and he came in about twenty minutes or half an hour—I met him at the door—I was waiting for him, and I said, "Doctor, really something must be done with my poor wife; she is sinking fast, and I don't believe she will have strength to go through what she has got to go through"—he said, "You don't mean that, Brazier?"—I said, "I do, indeed, or, and I am afraid she has been left too long"—he turned round very angrily indeed, and said, "Brazier, what do you mean? I don't understand you; what I have done I have done for the best"—I said, "I hope you have, air"—he said, You know it is impossible for me to be in two places at once"—I said, I am quite aware of that, sir"—by that time he was up by the bedroom door, and in about a minute or a minute and a half or two minutes I heard the door slam, and my mother came down stairs—I did not see Dr. Goss then, he went out at the private door; I saw no more of him—I subsequently went for Mr. Llewellyn—he attended immediately—my wife was confined between 11 and 12—it was between 8 and 9, or something of that sort, that Dr. Goss left—Mr. Llewellyn came and examined my wife, and said he must have assistance and consultation—I begged him to get the cleverest person he could, and he went and fetched Mr. Jarvis, and they both remained until the delivery—I saw no more of Dr. Goss—my wife died on 4th September.</p>

I am the mother of the last witness—I attended the deceased in four confinements previous to this one—on Wednesday, 17th August, I went to see her in consequence of being sent for—from what I observed, I thought the confinement was likely to take place soon—I re<lb></lb>commended that Dr. Goss should be sent for—he did not come till Thurs<lb></lb>day, some time about the forenoon—I told him the symptoms, and that I was convinced it would not go off—the symptom I observed was a <hi rend="italic">show</hi>—he said it might go off for a fortnight, or even a month—he had known such a thing—I told him I never had—we did not send for him again; she was not in a great deal of pain—she went on very slowly, having pains now and then—we sent for him on the Friday night, between 7 and 8 o'clock, and he came between 8 or 9, or between 9 and 10—Mrs. Brazier was very bad in that interval—I described to him the state she was in, and told him a circumstance that I was very much surprised at; that the child had a motion with every pain—he remained with us about three quartern of an hour, or it might be nearly an hour, and he came again that evening—I never left her—I observed her symptoms, and told him of them—when he came the second time, he said he had had no tea—I said, "Shall I get you anything?"—he said, "No;" he wanted to go home, but he would come back again, and he did about 12—he stopped with us about an hour, and then he got up very suddenly, and said he should go—a lady who was with me said, "Surely you are not going, Mr. Goss?"—he said, "Yes, I am; I am not going to stop here"—she said, "Will there be time to send to you"—he said, "Oh yes, there will be time enough; I only wish it may be all over, and the child on the bed when I come back"—he came again on Saturday morning between 1 and 2—I told him she had been very bad all night, that her pains were gone, and that her strength was gone with them—he examined her—I told him I was convinced she had had pains enough to bring half a dozen children into the world if she had had proper assistance—he said it would be an evening job—I asked him if it was all right for the world—that was on Friday—he said, "Now—I said, "How is it?"—he said, "I don't know whether it is an arm or a leg"—I asked him on the Saturday if it had progressed much—he said, "Yes, a little," but it would be an evening job; it would not come off till the evening—she was</p>

               <p>very weak and faint—we sent for him again on Saturday night, about 8 or 9 o'clock—I was listening very attentively, expecting him, and when I heard his knock at the foot of the stain, I went to the lobby—I heard my son say to him, "Oh, Dr. Goes, I am afraid you have left my wife too long; the is sinking fast;" and I heard him speak very cross, "What do you mean? Can I be in two places at once? I have done the best I could?"—my son said, "I hope you have—;" he then came up stairs in a very great pet—I said, "I am very glad to see you, sir; she has been very ill, very bad, and her pains are all gone, and her strength with them"—he said, "I don't know what Brazier means by talking to me in this manner; I will not be spoken to by any man in such a manner"—I said, "You must make some allowance for a husband's feelings; she has been very ill"—he kept on saying that he would not be talked to in that manner; that he could act be in two places at once—I said, "Well, sir, if you could not, you might have sent some one else, or have told us, that we might get some one else"—"Then get them," he said, and he took up his hat, and was about immediately to leave the room—Mrs. Brazier put up her hands, and said, "For God's sake don't be angry; don't leave me, Mr. Goes; don't leave me to die; don't be angry"—but he was half-way down the stairs; she begged me to call him back, but I could not have done it for the world—he went on down the stairs, and slammed the door in such a manner that it really shook the little house—that was all I saw of him—Mr. Llewellyn was then sent for, and he fetched Dr. Jarvis—she was confined between 11 and 12 that night—she lived for fourteen days afterwards, but she was sinking last every day—she never rallied—for the first day or two she felt better from her extreme pain and agony, but she never rallied, only to get out of bed a few minutes at a time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a burgeon, of 28, Trinity-Street—I have been in practice ten yean—I was called in to see Airs. Brazier on Saturday night, 20th August, about half-past 10—I found her in labour—I made an exami<lb></lb>nation—I found it a case of arm presentation, the elbow forward far down in the passage, the <hi rend="italic">os uteri</hi> grasping the shoulder—the woman was very much exhausted, and it was a case that I would not undertake the responsibility of myself—I came down stairs, and mentioned it to the husband, and then went and brought in Dr. Jarvis—I was away a quarter of an hour or rather more; a sufficient time to go down to St. Thomas-street and back—I found Dr. Jarvis at home, and he returned with me immediately—he examined the patient, and advised chloroform to be administered, so as to facilitate deliver; and turning—I administered the chloroform, and Dr. Jarvis delivered the patient—I attended her afterwards until she died—she rallied a little after delivery—she seemed to get on very fairly for two or three days, then pain commenced in the region of the womb, and she daily got gradually worn and worse, and died on the Sunday fortnight following—I attribute her death to exhaustion consequent upon inflammation which sprung up in the right side of the womb, a few days after delivery—upon post-mortem ex<lb></lb>amination it was found there was inflammation of the right broad ligament and of the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi>—in my opinion she had not sufficient vital power to resist the slight inflammation that arose—inflammation occasionally comes on after delivery, after a difficult birth, and sometimes after an ordinary birth—in my opinion that was the immediate cause of death—I cannot undertake to say whether that was hastened in any way, or produced by anything that happened or did not happen on that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think she was delivered as soon as she should have been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot form an opinion in what condition the patient was at 9 o'clock, or any time before, not from my experience at 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you know or have heard of the case, can you say it was wrong to leave her undelivered up to the time you saw her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is impossible to say what condition she was in previously; I can only say what condition she was in at the time I arrived—medical opinion might differ upon that subject—I Will not undertake to say that she suffered from that cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In a case of that kind, where the presentation is of a knee or elbow, would you expect inflammation of the womb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In an arm presentation you might expect it, because you would have to turn, and some<lb></lb>times that is a difficult thing—I think it would be an Library thing to succeed the turning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. JARVIS</hi>. I am a member of the College of Physicians, and obstetric physician of St. Thomas's—I was called in on the Saturday night by Mr. Llewellyn—I have heard the evidence he has given, and agree with him en<lb></lb>tirely—having regard to this being a cross birth, and being known to be so before 9 o'clock in the evening, an examination ought certainly to have taken place by the medical man attending; but that, involves the whole case, that is to say, ought the medical man to have left—it would be no use to make an examination and then go—it was: necessary for him; to be there at 9, and necessary for some, one to attend her—I delivered her; it was one of the most difficult cases in midwifery, and required a great deal of cart and attention—I had nothing to do with the case between the delivery and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190105"></xptr>
               <p>a consultation with Mr. Llewellyn on the Friday—she certainly died from exhaustion—it was a difficult and anxious labour, that was one source of ex<lb></lb>haustion—there was slight inflammation of the right broad ligament—she was exhausted prior to that coming on—I gather that she was a slight and delicate woman previously; undersized and very spare in habit—I can't say how she was before I saw her—she was then extremely exhausted; whether that exhaustion was due to the previous labour pains or any other cause I am not prepared to say—looking at the state, in which I found her at 11 o'clock, I should say she ought not to have been left without medical attend<lb></lb>ance—there is no question about that—every hour unquestionably added to the difficulty of the birth—I look upon the slight inflammation which occurred as having just turned the scale—I think if that had not occurred she would probably have survived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Slight inflammation of that description happens in very many cases where there is difficult labour, does: it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> And in very natural labours too—Mr. Llewellyn arrived at my house a little before 11—I cannot say whether if the deceased had been attended at 9 o'clock, as she was when I saw her, any different termination would have taken place—I can't say positively that two hours' difference in the termination of the labour would have affected materially the result of the case, or may have made any difference to the termination of the case—I won't say that I think she might still have died if it had not been for the inflammation which supervened—I should have hoped she would have rallied—that inflamma<lb></lb>tion might have occurred from a common cold, and in the most natural labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you saw, ought this to have been done at an earlier period than two hours before you did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose that would depend entirely on the state in which the os <hi rend="italic">uteri</hi> was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so—what state it was in two hours previously I could not undertake to say—in my opinion this was not a premature birth—there was no post-mortem evidence upon that question—he rapidity of dilatation of the <hi rend="italic">os uteri</hi> differs with different patients—some<lb></lb>times where it is rigid and small, there is a rapid dilatation, and sometimes it remains rigid and contracted hour after hour—that would be quite eccen<lb></lb>tric of the person's constitution.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Those answers then rather qualify what you said before, that she ought to have been delivered more than two hours before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is the qualifying element, that she was in an exceedingly reduced and exhausted state, and that we are able to deliver by artificial means if a person's strength is flagging, independent of the opening of the mouth of the womb; therefore I cannot go beyond 9 o'clock; I should certainly say at 9 means might have been adopted to deliver her, but whether that would have made the slightest difference in the termination of the case I cannot say.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the <hi rend="italic">os uteri</hi> sufficiently dilated for the purposes of delivery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Fully so—I gave her brandy at once—I believe she would have died there and then without the administration of chloroform—I should be very sorry to connect the death with anything that occurred on that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GOSS</hi> examined her at 9 o'clook, is it probable that he would have found the mouth of the womb sufficiently dilated for delivery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think probably, but I cannot say positively—if that was so every hour or half-hour afterwards became of importance—she should have been delivered as soon as the womb was properly dilated—it was a full<lb></lb>grown child.</p>

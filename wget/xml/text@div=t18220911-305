Kimberley accosted me, and asked if I was good natured; I told her to go about her business; she directly put her hand into my pocket, and took out a half-crown and a shilling - I kept hold of my watch. I immediately seized her, and Davenport ran over into Privy-garden - she said nothing, but was in company with the other. She was behind me at the time Kimberly robbed me. I took Kimberley to the watch-house - I was perfectly sober. She did it all in a moment. Davenport said before the Magistrate, that Kimberley told her to go away, which was the case.</p>

            . I am the watch-house-keeper. Kimberley was brought to the watch-house, and after the prosecutor was gone, Davenport came to ask for the key of the door. Mitchell had described her, and I said,</p>
               <p>"I believe you are the woman I want" - I began to search her; she put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out a half-crown and a shilling. The prosecutor appeared to have been drinking; but knew what he was about. She said the money was her own.</p>
               <p>DAVENPORT'S Defence. The money was my own. I went to ask her for the key. I never saw the man.</p>
               <p>KIMBERLEY'S Defence. I was returning to my lodging, and met this man intoxicated, put my hand out to guard myself against him - he turned back, and said I had robbed him. This woman was not with me.</p>

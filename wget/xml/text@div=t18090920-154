             bespoke a bed for himself and wife, and he having slept there before, it was his particular request that he might sleep in another room where he might have a larger bed, he being a large man. He had slept there three nights before within a fortnight, it was discovered that he had robbed all the three beds that he had slept in in the nights before; in order to detect him, and to bring him to justice, I ordered that he might have a bed, and when he was gone to bed I directed that an officer might be fetched from Bow-street, saying that I had a thief in the house. On the morning following, two officers came, they waited for this gentleman and wife coming down stairs, which was about 8 o'clock.</p>

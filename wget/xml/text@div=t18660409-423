                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 63). On 22d March, from information I received, I watched the prosecutor's shop from different places—I was not in uniform—Blackerby and Eyles were in his service—Blackerby was fore<lb></lb>man—at half-past 7, I saw Eyles knock at the door—he was received by Blackerby or the boy—Eyles, I believe it was, took down the shutters—I went a short distance down the road, and then saw Blackerby and Eyles in the shop—about ten minutes to 8, I saw Emmerson at Mount-gardens, which is at the side of the shop—the slaughter-house has a private way from the shop through the house—he had a towel in his hand—he shoved his hand against the slaughter-house door, which was fast—I then went in front of the Westminster-road into the shop, and walked backwards and forwards several times—Blackerby and Eyles were in the shop together—he went up and spoke to them—Eyles then left Blackerby, and went through the shop towards the slaughter-house—Blackerby by waving his hand and head gave him the office to go round to the slaughter-house door—he went very quickly—the door was opened when he arrived, and he was admitted—I concealed myself in a house facing the slaughter-house and stood there a few minutes—a great number of men who work at Moseley's were coming home to breakfast—Eyles opened the slaughter house door and looked all round—he returned again, as people were passing—he opened it a second time, looked round, and returned again, and the third time he stood at the door</p>

               <p>about a minute, opened it quickly, and Emmerson came out with a very large bundle on his arm, and went down Mount-gardens—I followed him to a public-house in Carlisle-laue, where he went for some rum—I then got the assistance of a railway policeman, and said, "I charge you with receiving property which consists of meat, well knowing the same to have been stolen from the Westminster-road"—he said, "All right, I have bought it"—I took him to Tower-street station, and asked him what account he could give me of it—he said, "I bought it; I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of it, and I have got to pay the other"—I said, "Do you know what amount you have got"—he said, "I do not "—I said, "Have you got any receipt"—he said, "No"—I said, "I am not satisfied"—I searched him and found a sheep's pluck in his pocket—I said, "Here is a pluck"—he said, "All right, I will pull it out"—as Mr. Swingler was away from home, I thought it necessary to wait—I left Emmerson at the station, and then returned to the shop and watched for nearly an hour and a half—I saw Eyles leave with a brown coat over his blue slop, and a small bundle under his arm—I followed him into Hercules-buildings, stopped him, and gave him in custody—I then returned to the shop and took Blackerby, and told him the charge—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You will have to go"—I sent him down by a man, because only the mistress was there, who was in a very weak state of health, so I took charge of the shop while they got assistance.</p>

I have not spoken to Blackerby three times since he has been there. I am a butcher.

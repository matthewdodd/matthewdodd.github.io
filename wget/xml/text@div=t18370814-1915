                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isaac Blanchard. On the 30th of July I was going in search of my husband, and met the prisoner in Oxford-street, about twenty minutes to four o'clock in the morning—he addressed me, and spoke to me several times before I answered him—I believe he asked me where I was going—he walked by the side of me for about twenty minutes—I kept walking on—I had a ring on my finger, and he attempted to take it off—I put my hand under my shawl, and he put his arm round me, and made another attempt, and then I took it off and put it into my mouth, he then took it with his thumb and fingers, and ran off with it—the policeman saw him running, and he took him—when he was taken, I asked for my ring—he said he had not got it—I have lost it entirely.</p>

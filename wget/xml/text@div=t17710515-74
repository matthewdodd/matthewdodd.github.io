            . The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 7th of April last. He brought his loom next day into my shop to work with me; he work'd six days in making ribbons; he said he was tired of weaving. On 15th of April I went out, and he and his brother came and fetched his loom away. I let him in on the 16th between ten and eleven at night. After I went to bed I recollected that I had left my watch by the loom; I went to fetch it: I found the prisoner snoring lying upon my bed; the next morning I found the prisoner's bed smooth, and the sheets never turn'd down; so it was plain he had never been in bed. When I went to work I found the work cut out of the loom, and a pair of scissars. The prisoner was gone, and the street door, which had been bolted over night after the prisoner came in, was left upon a spring lock, and the bolts drawn; the prisoner had gone out, and shut the door after him; we searched the prisoner's lodgings, but found nothing there. In one Lewis's house we found thirty-three yards of silk,</p>

I made every inch of it; black differs so much that I am able to say these three different pieces are all of the same piece of silk; and that piece was mine, I am confident, every inch of it.

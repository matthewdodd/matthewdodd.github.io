On Tuesday night, the 21st of May, I met him in White Lion-street, about half-past seven o'clock - We usually met there. We were walking along, he asked me to let him look at the notes. I had told him on that day week that my father had had a little money, and was going to put us to school with it; I did not know the amount. He said, if I would let him see them, he would tell me what they were. I took him home. I knew my father had put them under the flap of the table. I could not read writing. He looked at them, and said it was a 30l. and a 10l. - I wrapped them up, and put them under the table again; I went out, and left him in the room by himself; he used to go to my father's sometimes. I was called away, and returned in about half an hour, but never saw the notes after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I have known him about five years. My father thought I took them. I was not given in charge myself.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the 24th of May, the prisoner was in my custody-his father and mother came to him in the watch-house, and said it would be better for him to confess. In consequence of what he said, I went with him to his master's house, and immediately the prisoner took us into the privy, and put his hand down the hole, and gave me a parcel, which contained a 30l. note, with a 5l., and one 2l. together. I produced them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRLEY. I searched the privy. Flint has spoken correctly.</p>

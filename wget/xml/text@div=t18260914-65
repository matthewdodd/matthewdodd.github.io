            . I live at Loughton, in Essex, and am a bricklayer. I was at Fairlop Fair, and saw Burrell - he gave me this mare to take care of, about seven o'clock in the evening; I had her in my possession about an hour and three-quarters before I missed her; I tied a hempen halter round her head, and tied her to another cord; she had a bridle and saddle on; I had three more in my care, standing with her; I only lost this one; I was absent only five or six minutes, and on my return this mare was gone, and the rope taken away, with her bridle and saddle also - I had not observed the prisoner. Mr. Burrell came up in a quarter of an hour, when I was inquiring about it. I saw her again on the Friday week - she had been found then. The prisoner is a stranger to me.</p>

On a Friday I brought this mare from Dixon's, and was riding it in Long-lane, when Burrell claimed it; she was brought there for sale; I did not see her till that Friday, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and do not know who brought her; she had no bridle or saddle on.

This mare was brought into our yard on Saturday, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140053"></xptr>8th of July, by the prisoner; I think it was in the afternoon; I desired him to go into the counting-house for the clerk to book her. We only take horses in for sale. I am positive he is the person; I saw him three or four days afterwards; he called on the Tuesday, to inquire if she was sold; he sold her himself in our yard, to a man named Joseph Day, for 11l., on Friday, the 14th - it was not paid for till the following Monday - he called that day for the money; I had heard it was stolen, and gave him in charge; I told him it was stolen; he said it belonged to himself and his brother, and he had had her about six months; I am certain of that - it had no saddle or bridle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain he said he had had her six months? A. Yes, I am. The transaction was public.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. The prisoner was given in charge - I asked him who the other boy was - he said he had seen him several times, but did not know his name, nor where he lived, that he had met him, and walked down Tottenham-court-road with him, but he did not know he meant to take the cake - the prisoner had some halfpence and a sixpence.</p>

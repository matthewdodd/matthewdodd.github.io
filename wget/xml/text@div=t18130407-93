            . I am a labourer. On the 1st of December, Mr. Armstrong gave me two marked shillings and two three-shilling pieces. I then went to the prisoner's house, in Pump-court, Golden-lane. I asked her if she had any shillings or sixpences, bad ones. She told me that she had only four shillings. She gave me four shillings, and I gave her the two marked shillings that I had received from Armstrong. Then Mr. Armstrongs, the father and son, and Bishop came into the room, and the four bad shillings that I had from her Bishop took out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went there had you any more money than was marked by Armstrong - A. Not any of any kind.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. On the 1st of December, I gave Roach these two marked shillings. They are marked with a P, a scratch, one is; and the other is marked with W B struck on the head. These marks were on them when I gave them to Roach. I searched Roach very particular before I gave them to him; he had no money of any kind. I then gave him the two marked shillings, and two three-shilling pieces. I, Bishop, and my son went with Roach to the prisoner's house. Roach went in. We had agreed with Roach before that; when he had purchased he was to cough, and after we had waited a few minutes we heard a cough. My son and Bishop went in. I went in last. When I came into the room my son had got hold of Mrs. Joyce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mrs. Joyce before - A. I had seen her, but I was not acquainted with her. Roach was in the same room, very near her, and two men on the other side of the room. As soon as I went in, whether she caught my eye or not, her hands dropped these two shillings; they fell on the ground; I picked them up. They are the two identical shillings that I gave to Roach; they are two good shillings.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with my father and Bishop to this house. I went into the house as soon as I heard the signal of a cough that was to be given by Roach for our coming in. I immediately laid hold of the prisoner's wrists, and out of her hands dropped two shillings, which my father picked up. I then told her to stand up, that I might search her, and when I got her in the middle of the room, from some part of her clothes dropped these three counterfeit shillings. There were two men in the room: nothing but good money was found upon them. On my searching the room, in a drawer I found two counterfeit sixpences.</p>

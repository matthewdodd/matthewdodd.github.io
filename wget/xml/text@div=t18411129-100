                  </hi>. I conduct the farming business of Richard Dyson, at Waltham-cross. The prisoner was my carter—he was to start about one o'clock in the morning of the 30th of October, to come to my stable in Park-lane—he was allowed half a truss of hay for his three cart-horses, and was not allowed to take any more—he feeds as he goes on—he had no directions to stop at the Seven Sisters public-house—the 50lbs. of hay produced resembles my master's hay—I believe it is his.</p>

About five o'clock in the morning of the 30th of October I was on duty in the Seven Sisters'-road—the prisoner passed me with a load of hay, a truss on the top, and a bottle-truss on the side—he drew up at the Seven Sisters public-house, and gave his horses water—he got up, took the truss of hay down, and took it to the back of the premises, and placed it in a pig<lb></lb>sty—I then accused him of leaving it there—he denied it—I then saw him knock at the door—he said he did not leave any there—I went and fetched it from there, and have it here.</p>

On the 17th of April, as I was going home from a public-house between eleven and twelve at night; the prisoner picked me up. I had been drinking and was a little the worse for liquor. As I was coming up the Old Jewry, the prisoner took hold of my arm, and said, she wanted to speak with me. She pulled me down the Old Jewry, till we came to an alley on the right-hand; there she felt about my breeches, and wanted me to feel about her; I told her I did not understand that. Then I put my hand to my watch, and felt I had got it. She walked with me out of the alley, up to the beginning of <placeName id="t17800510-41-crimeloc223">Cheapside</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17800510-41-crimeloc223" type="placeName" value="Cheapside"></interp>

I was going to cross the way from her; I put my hand to my watch and missed it; it had a silver chain to it. There was nobody in company with me but the prisoner. I told her she had got my watch; she denied it; I took her to the watch-house, and she was searched, and the watch was produced upon the table in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced by the constable who found it upon her and it was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I am an unfortunate, unhappy girl. As I was coming along Cheapside, this man asked me to go and drink with him, which I did. Then he said if I would go with him he would give me something. He said he had nothing to give me then, but I might take his watch to hold. When he was going away he asked me for it again; I asked him for what he promised to give me; he knocked me down like a dog, and said if I did not give it him he would charge the watch with me, which he did. I did not deny giving it him when I came to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give her the watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you knock her down? - No.</p>

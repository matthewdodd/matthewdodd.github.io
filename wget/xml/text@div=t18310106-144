               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. I believe you are proprietor of other houses? A. Yes; when I let a house on a repairing lease, if a window gets broken or destroyed, it is the business of the tenant to replace it - he was bound to leave the house in as good state as he found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 43, Livingstone Road, Clapham—on 26th September last I was living at 15, Regent Square, and the prisoner was lodging there, he sold me 15 yards of velveteen, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me later in the day whether I would like to buy some more, and produced this pawn-ticket ("26th Sept., 1878, for velveteen, 10a"), and said "Will you buy this ticket?"—I said "I do not wish for any more of it;" but after a time I agreed to buy it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I paid him—in March last I went to Mr. Cloud, pawnbroker, 14 and 16, Kenton Street, Brunswick Square, and learned that the velveteen had already been redeemed—I have never received the velveteen or the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner—these three letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in his handwriting, and to the best of my belief the signature, "John Sutton, M.D.," to this declaration is his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He sold me the ticket for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the evening of the day I bought the 15 yards, 26th September—I took the house at 15, Regent Square from the prisoner, who had been then living there two years—soon after I took the house he went to 64, Guildford Street—he had bought that house for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800Z.—I knew he had a large account'at the Birkbeck Bank—I know Mr. Weston and have seen him here to-day—I have heard there was a Dr. Miller at Regent Square, but I never saw him or knew him—there were two plates on the door, one Mr. Sutton, the other Dr. Miller<lb></lb>Sutton had an American diploma—he gave me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not as a present, but money I had lent him—he has had money from me for years past—I lent him money for law costs—I have been in Dublin a long time ago with Sutton, but do not know whether it was the Clarence Hotel—I may have pawned articles in his name—I have never passed as Mrs. Sutton—I do not think I ever pawned goods at Mr. Cloud's in the name of Sutton—I might have done so at Ebsley's years ago—I have seen Miss Glover or Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Mazoni here to-day—I have never passed in the name of Mrs. Sutton—I never saw an announcement in a Dublin paper that Dr. Sutton and his wife were staying at the Clarence Hotel—I have never lived with him as his wife, I decline to answer the question—I swore at the police-court that I never did—I decline to say whether I slept in the same room with him—I have not lived with him as his wife or mistress—I have been in Ireland with him and Mrs. Blodd, and have stayed at a hotel with him, but not as Mrs. Sutton—I never was at Manchester—there was an action pending between Sutton and myself, but not when I went to redeem</p>

               <p>the velveteen in March—it was a ridiculous action, there was nothing in it—I never threatened to ruin him; I have been the saving of him—he has threatened to be the ruin of me—in my evidence before Mr. Flowers on a charge against Sutton by a woman named Baines I said "The prisoner came to my house and asked me to buy the pair of earnings produced, and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them. He said 'Unless you buy them of me poor Mrs. Baines will have to sleep in the workhouse'"—Sutton was acquitted—I was the landlady of 15, Regent Square—there was an interpleader summons before Mr. Justice Field at chambers, and he made an order against me, and I appealed at chambers before the Judge by counsel, and the decision was against me—Sutton was not then practising as a doctor at 15, Regent Square—I know nothing about his practising at Guildford Street—the medicine patent is mine—he did not discover the medicine, or register it in my name, because he was the proprietor of another patent—Dr. Barringer, a friend of mine, discovered it, and gave me the receipt four or five years ago, for nothing—he has often spoken to Sutton about it—I have not complained of Sutton breaking his promise to marry me, or threatened to ruin him in con<lb></lb>sequence—he bought me a dress in Ireland and two cameo brooches—I do not know where the velveteen came from—he did not order it for me—he, never gave me any, I bought it from him—I went into Marchmont Street and he asked me to go into a shop with him, and I saw him measured for a suit of clothes—he never had any interest in my patent, but used to write letters for me sometimes and advise me how to advertise it—he was not the inventor, and no agreement was filed between us in reference to it—he tried to get a divorce from his wife, I was not cited as co-respondent—he lived at my house after the velveteen was pawned, but not with me—he slept in a room at the top of the house by himself—I was never in his room after the pawning of the velveteen—I do not think he slept there—he used to sleep in Guildford Street, at Mrs. Mazoni's, and other places in the same neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—I never asked Dr. Barringer to swear that he had invented the medicine—I went to Mrs. Mazoni in April, after the brokers were in pos<lb></lb>session of my mother's furniture, but did not tell her I had forgotten that the pawn-ticket related to something else, and that if Sutton would not prosecute me I would unsay in cross-examination all that I had already said—there are no proceedings pending between us—Sutton has never had a sealskin jacket from Mr. Ashburn, pawnbroker, to be sent to me to try on for approval—Mr. Ashburn sent it for me of his own accord, and I was to pay for it—I have been in the habit of buying jewellery from him—it would be untrue to say that I ever pawned anything in. the name of Sutton—Sutton knew nothing about the jacket until I told him—he was not going to pay for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not buy my house from Sutton—he took it on a three years' agreement, and it had one year to run when he left, and I took it from him at 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there was no furniture—that which has been seized was the property of my mother and myself—Sutton signed this agreement with reference to the furniture in dispute after I had been cross-examined at the police-court.

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at 13, Milman Street, Bedford Row, and have known Mrs. Louis perfectly well for 12 years—I knew her as Mrs. Sutton when I first saw her—I have not heard her called Mrs. Sutton, but I went to 15, Regent Square, about apartments 12 years ago and she showed me the rooms—I asked her if she was Mrs. Sutton, and she said "Yes," and I took the apartments—they occupied the same bedroom—I lodged with them about 12 months, and have known them on and off ever since—I have often seen him give her money—tie last amount was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in December last—it was from a patient of Mr. White* head—Sutton had a practice 11 or 12 years ago in Regent Square and all at 64, Guildford Street—it was a good practice; one of his patients paid him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and out of it she received 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was the landlady at 64, Guild<lb></lb>ford Street at that time—I have not been in their bedroom, but have lived in the house and knew they occupied the same bedroom—I left there about nine years ago—I saw the dressmaker in March last making a dress, and</p>

               <p>Mrs. Louis told me Sutton had made her a present—nothing was said about the velveteen—she went out pleasuring with him—nothing was said about burning a pawnticket—Sutton left Regent Square a few months ago—he had his name plate on the door, but I could not say if Dr. Miller's name was there—Sutton had an account at the Birkbeck Bank and bought house—he was carrying on business as a doctor in Regent Square in 1878, and had a good practice, and also at 64, Guildford Street, and did not appear to be in want of money—I was not present when he paid for his house—I have seen certain deeds—when I first knew him he had the house, 15, Regent Square, and there was some furniture there—I knew it in 1878—I was a continual visitor—I saw Mrs. Louis frequently, but she was not called Mrs. Sutton—Sutton did not say what the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for which he handed to her—she said the velveteen was a present from him—I have had no conversation with her about this case—I was subpœnaed by the Treasury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know he was convicted for forging trade marks; not since I have known him, or that he has been in prison for 12 months for procuring a man to be falsely registered on the medical register in the name of Smith—I have not been on friendly terms with him—I went to identify him, and have visited him in Newgate.</p>

I know Miss Louis, and have known the prisoner as Dr. Sutton 17 or 18 years she called at my house in Burton Street in April last when Sutton was out on remand from Bow Street—she said, "Will you send your husband to Mr. Sutton"—she wanted to arrange the affair—she said, "I will do nothing if he will leave me alone"—she said, "If it is the medicine he wants, he can have it," meaning the patent medicine—I have visited 15, Regent Square, some time ago—I do not re<lb></lb>collect Miss Louis mentioning a pawnticket, or about having bought velveteen from Sutton—she was called Mrs. Louis—I never heard her called Mrs. Sutton—I remember her going to Gravesend—Sutton paid expenses.</p>

                  </hi>. I was Sutton's landlord, at 15, Regent Square—I let him the house unfurnished in 1868 for three years, and in February 1870 he gave up possession and cancelled the agreement, which was transferred over to Mrs. Louis—he paid the rent and was a very good tenant—he had a plate on the door, but I do not remember seeing a plate of Dr. Miller—Mrs. Louis was my tenant since 1870, and Sutton has not resided there since to my knowledge—his brass plate was taken down when Mrs. Louis took the house—he called himself M.D.</p>

            . Q.In the month of October in the last year, were you an officer of the excise stationed in Norfolk. - A. Yes, I was stationed at Casson. On the the 19th of that month, I went out with the other officers to intercept smuggled goods, without success, that night; we went again on the night of the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. Name the officers that were with you, it is not necessary that you should mention any body else. - A. There were Gosling, Cambridge, and several others.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been waiting before you heard any thing that attracted your notice. - A. I suppose an hour; we went out about eight or nine, I heard several carts come in the road, where I was to intercept them. I left the other officers about a mile from where I was; upon hearing the carts coming on the road, I went to the other officers to come to my assistance; the other officers were waiting in another direction in case they should take another road. They came with me. I and the other officers followed the carts.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you come up to them. - A. I suppose it might be half an hour or more. There might be ten or a dozen carts, I did not count them; they were loaded with tubs, they appeared like half anchors, just such as smuggled goods are carried about in the country; and there were several persons on foot, and seven or eight persons on horseback; I thought there might be a score or more; upon our coming up to them Mr. Gosling, the excise officer, stopped the first cart, and I stopped against the second cart: I told the man with the second cart if he attempted to take the goods, I would shoot him; he immediately jumped on the cart, and told me I might fire and be d - d, for we should not have the goods. We were immediately surrounded by a number of horsemen, that attended the carts, they began to flourish their bludgeons over our heads, and told us we should have nothing; we told them we would have the goods, or otherwise we would shoot them.

               <p>Q. Was he the man that you described to have got up in the cart. - A. No, he was one of the horsemen. The carts turned back, and the horsemen collected together to fill up the road, they all of them turned round; the carts were behind the horsemen; the horsemen crossed the road to prevent us from following of them; they formed a line with their heads towards our heads.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on horseback or on foot. - A. On horseback.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of your party on horseback. - A. Four, three officers and another person; we immediately opposed the horsemen, and told them we would not be stopped, we broke through their ranks. They headed us again, after we had broke through the ranks.</p>
               <p>Q. They turned upon you and past between you and the carts. - A. They did; I ordered every man on my side to cock their pistols. I was determined to have the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that order loud enough for the smugglers to hear you. - A. Yes, they then filled up the road again, they had faced about, they told us we should not go any further; I told

             I would shoot him if he did not let me go forward, I pointed my pistol to Abel's breast; at that time another horseman had a stick over my arm; Abel flourished his stick over my head; he ordered the footmen to come forward, the footmen called out unhorse them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the footmen been at the time they turned about. - A. When the carts turned round they went with the carts, they were in the rear of the horsemen; they came forward, we told them we were determined to fire; some of the horsemen ordered the blunderbuss to be brought forward, they called out bring forward the blunderbuss, put in an additional ball; we advanced and they attempted to fire upon us; I immediately pointed my pistol to the breast of Abel, and told him I was determined to shoot him; he then dared me to shoot him; I asked him if he had no person that wanted him, if he had not a wife and family that wanted him; he then damned me, and told me to come there with him. I followed him into a turnip field, he asked me what I wanted, there was ten pound for me, which I immediately accepted, and rode to the officers, and told them that he had bribed me; some of the horsemen came into the turnip field, and some stopped out; the horses and carts went forward. Jeremiah Abel came back after he went to the men, and told them what he had done; I saw him go away, and come back from the other men to me, and the other officers, and he said, I see you all know it, you are all satisfied; we immediately went to Casson-Wood-Row-house, and signed the notes; the carts went on.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked the notes and afterwards left them at the house of the supervisor. - A. Yes, immediately; I left them with the supervisor's wife. It was impossible for us to make a seizure, by being opposed by the horsemen.</p>
               <p>Q. The supervisors house was a considerable distance from you. - A. About as far as nine mile to the supervisor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it not been but for the great resistance, of a great number of persons, and their threats that they used should you have seized these things for the King. - A. Yes, we went out for that purpose.</p>

               <p>Q. What made you desist from taking this seizure. - A. By there being such superior force.</p>

             called Ailsbrook out into the turnip piece, when they came out Abel said it was settled, we went to Woodrow house and endorsed the notes, the day and minute it was done, and signed our respective names; we carried them that very night before the day light to the supervisors.</p>
               <p>Mr. Att. General. Could you have seized these goods. - A. No we were prevented by number, both horse and foot; we should certainly have seized them, if it had not been for that resistance, and the number.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of these goods that they had; were they worth two or three hundred pound or more. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were small casks, such as smugglers carry spirits in. - A. Yes, they were slung; there were twelve or thirteen carts.</p>

               <p>Q. These notes were not kept secret as a bribe, but declared immediately to the supervisor. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What situation was the person in who you firmly believe to be the prisoner at the bar. - A. He was on horseback.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this transaction did you see the prisoner. - A. Not till Mr. Ailsbrook went into the turnip field.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking of that night, how long after that night was it that you saw him again. - A. Upon Gee's hearing, to the best of my recollection, on the 28th of November,</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him on Gee's hearing at East Dereham, did it occur to you that he was one of the smugglers on that night. - A. The moment I saw him I recollected the situation he was in according to my own idea.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation did he remain in while Ailsbrook and Abel went into the turnip field. - A. He remained in the road at the time I went up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that opinion that you formed on Gee's hearing remained unshaken down to this present time. - A. It is, I have no doubt at all but he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You accompanied the other officers into the public house and signed the notes. - A. No, I remained on horseback in the road; I went immediately with them to the supervisor's house, and left them notes with the wife, and related to her the circumstance under which they had been received.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Bermondsey-street, out wark. The prisoner was in my employ for about five weeks-in con<lb></lb>sequence of something, I marked two half-crowns and one shilling, and gave it Phoebe Ann Davis on Wednesday evening, August the 8th—I are her some directions—I afterwards saw her in the shop—I was looking rough a crevice on the stairs—the prisoner was there—I saw Davis pur<lb></lb>chase some goods and tender some money—she left the shop—there were other customers there—I still remained there—I immediately went to the till and took the silver out—I found the two marked half-crowns and two sixpences, which were not marked—the marked shilling was gone—I had been the till before the marked money was paid by Davis—there were no sixpences in it then, nor any money whatever, except a few halfpence—I sent for a policeman, had the prisoner searched, and the marked shilling was found on him—I challenged him with the theft—he told me he had stolen is that morning, and the money was in his waistcoat pocket—the officer was present—I will swear he made use of that expression.</p>

               <p>You I believe are the prosecutor mentioned in this indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell my Lord and the Jury all that passed at the Sun in St. Catharine's?</p>
               <p>We were drinking at Mr. Wilkins's at the Sun at St. Catharine's, and two women were wrangling in the house; I took one of them and led her out to the door, and she took off her patten and she hit me on the nose, it cut me, I had a stick in my hand, and gave her a slap, not to do her any harm; she went into Mr. Wilkins's, and was going to bring one of the measures to knock my brains out; she said she would get a warrant for me; I was at the same house the next day; I remember Whiteway coming into the house; I was sitting drinking with some of the gang, and he came and told me I should go with him, I told him that I would not go with him, that I belonged to the King; I told him there was some beer to drink, and I would not go with him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Dawson's coming in? - No, I know nothing about Dawson; the prisoner told me, that if I would not go along with him he would shoot me; indeed I do not know what I said, but he said immediately, clear the way, and did shoot at me with a pistol, I believe it was loaded, but I had a wound; he never took me up nor laid his hand upon me on the warrant, but said I should go along with him.</p>
               <p>Was you wounded? - Yes, he laid the bone bare; I fell down under the table, and I got up and walked two or three steps, and fell again under the table; then I cried out murder, and went into the street, and walked down to the rendezvous; I never struck him, nor he never touched me; here is the hat I had on, (an oil-skin hat with a large hole in it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's Counsel. You was what is called master of the gang? - I do not know, the Lieutenant told me I should be the captain of the gang.</p>
               <p>How many of your gang were there? - I know there was not a dozen.</p>
               <p>Were there several? - There were only eight in the whole, but I do not know how many; whether they were all there I do not know, nor how many were there.</p>
               <p>How long had you been drinking together? - Not long; we had two pots of beer, I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before in the course of your life? - I do not know that I had.</p>
               <p>You never had any quarrel with him? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Nothing that should occasion any spite between you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What weapons had you, and the rest of your gang? - Nothing but sticks.</p>
               <p>Bludgeons for the purpose of defence? - Defence! we did not need any defence.</p>
               <p>Have you one of them here? - No.</p>
               <p>They were such sticks as press-gangs usually carry with them? - Yes, Sir, we had sticks; I had a stick; I do not know whether all the rest had sticks a-piece.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to him, that you would not be taken by any b - y b - r of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240024"></xptr>thief-taker, and that you would knock his brains out, if he offered to take you? - Indeed I did not, nor any expression of that sort.</p>
               <p>Did not you raise your stick to prevent his taking you? - No, I did not, but I had the stick in my hand, and I lifted it up; I do not know whether I did not do thus; I stretched the stick between me and him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, what was the expression that you used when you raised the stick? - I used no expression at all; I did not raise the stick any higher than this; I did not raise it for any purpose to strike him, or to do any harm with it.</p>
               <p>You have told us already you had once refused to go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But this man repeated that you should go with him, or he would shoot you? - Yes; upon which I told him, I would not go; he first said, young man, you must go along with me; I said, I will not; then he said, if you will not, I will shoot you; and he said, clear the way, and he shot me; I did not raise the stick at that time; I did not say, if you attempt to take me, I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you would not be taken by any b - y b - r of a thief-taker, and that you would knock his brains out if he offered to take you? - As I wish I may be saved, I did not say such a thing, I had not time to say much, that was all I said; when he came in, he said; young man, you must go along with me; no says I, I will not; says he, if you do not, I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>The rest of the gang had sticks? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not they all raise their sticks? - I do not know that they did; I do not know that he was desperately beat afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did you ever strike him, or hold up your stick to strike him? - No.</p>
               <p>Tell us, and repeat it, that it may be fully understood, what conversation passed when you said you would not go? - He came and said, young man, you must go with me; he said, he did not care what I belonged to, snapping something; I do not know whether he said again, I should or not; but afterwards he said, if I would not go with him, he would shoot me.</p>

Describe the manner, (describes it, by holding out a stick rather slanting down) Philbin had his hat on, it was tore in the manner it is now by the shot; it was a new hat; Philbin fell underneath the table; I stood close along side; he did not strike at Whiteway, nor did any of my comrades make any resistance at all; this is the pistol which I took from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I want to see whether I understand you right; all that passed after Whiteway came in, was Pickett's telling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240025"></xptr>him, Dawson had taken his word; Whiteway's saying, I will take nobody's word, and taking out his pistol, saying, take care, and firing immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No conversation passed between you and Philbin, after Whiteway said that he would fire.</p>
               <p>Had there any conversation passed between them before? - Yes, when Whiteway came in, the prisoner said, Philbin must go with him; Philbin made answer, and said he would not go; Whiteway said he should go; I heard no more.</p>
               <p>What did he say, when he said the second time he should go? - I did not hear Whiteway say any thing more; Philbin said, he would not go with any b - y runners; he held the stick in the manner I have described from the first to the last; we were all standing up, Whiteway ordered us to stand up; Philbin said, he would not go; Whiteway said, he should, and Philbin said, he would not go with any b - y runner; that was afterwards.</p>
               <p>So then Philbin always refused to go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The woman came in, and she charged him as her prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the assault between the woman and him? - Yes; there were four of us there; we had no sticks with us, only Philbin had a stick.</p>
               <p>He said he would not go with any b - r of a runner? - Yes; that he said just before Whiteway shot him.</p>
               <p>How many other persons were there in the room besides your gang? - That is impossible to tell; Whiteway had nobody with him, but Dawson.</p>
               <p>And you were four of you? - There were about four of us, at the time he came to serve the warrant; there might be eight or nine of the gang, at that time we were all sitting down; I never saw the prisoner before; never had any quarrel or ill-will with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did these eight or nine of the gang, or any of you, attempt to rescue the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you call rescuing? did you strike, or attempt to strike? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is the captain of a press-gang with a bludgeon in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Surely that will reduce murder to homicide.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. An officer who is resisted in the execution of his office, may justify the fact of killing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Do you think he is resisted (by saying he would not go,) by the captain of a press-gang holding a bludgeon in his hand this way, and saying he would not go.</p>
               <p>Court. If a man holds a bludgeon any way in his hand, and declares he will not obey the warrant of a justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. He said, I will not go without any other resistance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. It could not at the most, have been more than man-slaughter, if death had ensued.</p>
               <p>Court. I will not say, whether it is justisiable, or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. It seems to me, that that fort of shooting which, would have amounted to murder, if it had been followed by death, is a malicious shooting, and vice versa, that if it would not have amounted to murder, if death had ensued, it could not be a malicious shooting; it would be a strange construction, if such a firing, as tho' not being justifiable, would have amounted only to manslaughter, if the party had died, could be within this statute, for then he would not have been deprived of the benefit of clergy, if the man had died.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is a constable comes with a warrant, and a man standing at the head of a press-gang, declaring, I will not be taken, and held a weapon in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Why are eight men who are in habits of peace, without having a weapon in hand, without uttering a word, to be considered as a gang.</p>
               <p>Court. No, but any other men that were so armed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. But they were not armed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240026"></xptr>Court. The captain was armed, and he repeats his declaration in words, that he will not go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. They are not under his command for any such purpose, or inclined to act improperly.</p>
               <p>Court. There are seven or eight companions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. We wish to proceed in our case.</p>
               <p>Jury. How many were there of your people at that time? - Eight or nine; there were a great many men and women in the room.</p>
               <p>Jury. We live near that spot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Your gang were not armed you say, nor interfered at all? - I did not mind that any other of us had a stick.</p>
               <p>Jury. He did not offer to strike? - No, it was almost as thick as a broom stick, with which we used to go out a pressing, but it never was attempted to be used for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the warrant produced? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Court to Philbin. Did you see it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he touch you, or take you? - No, if he had touched me, I would have gone with him.</p>

               <p>Had Whiteway at all taken Philbin? - No, nor never was nigh him in my seeing; then I turned my head to Dawson to speak to him again, to tell him that, and heard the report of a pistol; I did not see him fire at the man;

               <p>Had you at all resisted Whiteway? - No, Sir, nor any of our company struck, or attempted to strike; we were not armed; Philbin had a stick in his hand, but whether he did attempt to strike him or not, I do not know.</p>

               <p>Do you believe it was possible for him to have taken Philbin at that time, if he had desired it? - No, I do not, because there was so many of his side; he told me in my bar that he would not be taken, and that he would have his gang down.</p>
               <p>For what? - To take his part.</p>

               <p>Did Leach say so? - I do not recollect Leach; it was a general voice; he is the Captain of our gang, and he shall not go; Pickett said, if you will take my word, I will produce him in the morning; my reason for taking Pickett's word, was as much because I saw it was impossible to take him away by force; I did not see the warrant produced; it had been intimated to me by the companions, that he should say he would not come with any body; I had been about some business, and I met the woman with Whiteway; he applied to me, and said I am afraid he will not come; I said I will go down with you; I did think it morally impossible from the manner in which these people behaved that Whiteway could have brought the man away.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I shall not trouble the Jury with any defence.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, the construction of this act has not been, that such shooting has always been held to be malicious, as would have amounted to murder, if it had killed the party; now considering this case, suppose that instead of only wounding the prosecutor, that the prisoner had in fact killed him, what would have been the consequence? Serjeant Hawkins says, that when an officer kills one who resists him in the execution of his office, he may justify the fact: this man was a constable acting under the authority of a warrant granted by a Justice of peace, for an assault and battery, by Philbin; he comes there, and Dawson is prevailed on to give his consent at the request of Pickett, that Philbin should appear the next morning, and Dawson tells you he did not think it safe at that time to execute a warrant, otherwife he certainly would; it was his duty, he ought to have executed the warrant, and taken Philbin before the Justice; it was the prisoner's duty, and he was punishable if he neglected his duty to have executed that warrant: here is a press gang, consisting of seven, and Philbin at the head of them; he lifts his weapon as the press gang say, with the end of the weapon towards the ground; that alone would not be an assault, but coupled with the declaration that he would not go with the constable; it would justify the officer, and reduce the crime to manslaughter, if he had killed him on that occasion; but on the evidence of Wilkins and Dawson, it appears that all the press gang resisted; they all declared with one voice, that Philbin was their Captain, and that he should not go, that he should pay no obedience to the warrant of the Justice. Gentlemen, it is not an offence within this act, and it is not necessary for me to say how far it was justiable, it is sufficient for me to say, I think in point of law, the prisoner must be acquitted.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned.</p>

On Saturday, 25th January, I saw the prisoners and another man together in Beech Street, Barbican—Cannon placed himself by the side of a lady who was looking in at a shop window, with the other two stood behind him; they left there and followed an old lady going in an opposite direction—Cannon walked by her side some little distance, and Jennings and the other man behind—she went into a newspaper shop in Red Cross Street—Cannon followed her in and stood by her side—I saw his hand down towards her dress—he came out and gave something to Jennings and they went away—I went in and spoke to the lady, I had some difficulty in making her hear, but I ascertained something from her and came out, but the prisoners had gone—I saw them again on Saturday, 1st March, in Barbican, with a third man—Cannon was following three ladies who went into a shop there—he followed them in, with his hands by the side of her dress—I got assistance and took the two prisoners into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy two parlours, at 32, Iroumonger-street, in the parish of St. Luke—the prisoner lodged there—John Owen Smith is the landlord. Oh 18th Dec., about half-past six o'clock, I left my wife and the prisoner—they were to meet me at a public-house in Leonard<lb></lb>square at nine, or half-past—my wife came, but not the prisoner—she said the prisoner was very poorly—we went home a little after twelve, found the front parlour-door open, and missed some gowns, aprons, and other articles—some from the font room, and some from a box in the back room—the box was not locked, but the room door was—I found the shutter about three parts up—it was bolted when I left—I have examined the things produced—they are mine.</p>

               <p>I am a porter: On Monday last I went into a public-house, in Marlborough-street, and called for a pint of porter; I sat down pretty near the prisoner at the bar; I observed a great bulk in her pocket; I could visibly see that they were pots, or something of that kind; I informed the landlord; we took her into the kitchen, and she refused to take them out; she pulled one out, and said, that was all she had; I put my hand into her pocket and took out another pint pot; in endeavouring to get that out of her pocket, she let this one fall that she had got between her legs; it was round her middle with this bit of string, (producing two pots, one with a spring tied to it); she broke the string in getting it off.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Jones.) What time did this happend - A. About five in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When where they brought to you? - A. Between five and six o'clock, from Marlborough-street; I have been in business, last September, twelve months; I have never sold any pots since I have been in business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A person of my acquaintance had had a quarrel with her landlady; the landlady turned the woman out; she was in a great passion about her rent; and she gave me the pots, with a piece of pork that they had been having for dinner, which I believe that witness had; I live down at Gravesend; I have a husband and family at Gravesend.</p>

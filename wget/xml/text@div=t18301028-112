On the 26th of June last, a lady named Cashin, came with her daughters, to lodge at my house - the eldest daughter was Catherine; she appeared in perfect health when they first came, and continued so till within four or five weeks previous to the time that I went with her to Mr. Long, which was on Friday, the 13th of August - he lives at No. 41, Harley-street; Miss Catherine Cashin introduced me to Mr. Long - Mrs. Cashin, on the morning of that day, requested I would go with Miss Catherine to Mr. Long, and state to him her fears with respect to the wound on her daughter's back - I did so; he did not examine her back in my presence - he said Miss Cashin must go and inhale, and after that he would look at her back; I went with her while she inhaled, and after that Mr. Long had her in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you describe, as well as you can, what the process of inhaling was? A. When I went into the room there appeared to me to be two cabinet-pianos; on her entering the room, each lady took a pipe about a yard and a half long, and put it into an orifice in the machine, opposite to which she placed a chair, and put the other end of the pipe into her mouth; I should think there were eight or ten ladies in the room - Miss Cashin was half an hour or three quarters inhaling; she then went into a room down stairs, to which I did not go - I saw Mr. Long as we were going into the carriage; that was after Miss Cashin had been in the room: as we were going to the carriage Mr. Long expressed a wish that Miss Cashin would not omit coming every day to his house, for the purpose of inhaling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the wound on her back? A. He said it would be quite well in a few days - I went home with Miss Cashin.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of August, in consequence of the state Miss Cashin was in, and something Mrs. Cashin said to you, did you write to Mr. Long? A. I did, and between six and seven o'clock he came to the house, and saw Miss Cashin, in my presence; he examined the wound on her back, said it was in a beautiful state, and that he would give one hundred guineas if he could produce a similar wound on the persons of some of his patients - I directed his attention to a particular portion of the wound, which was much darker than the rest; it presented a dark inflamed appearance - he said it was the consequence of inhaling, and unless these consequences were produced he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280049"></xptr>could expect no beneficial result. [Here the witness doubled a piece of paper, about five inches square, to show the size of the wound.] Mr. Long asked how I had treated the wound - I said I had applied a poultice of bread and water, with a large portion of hog's lard, and had given her a saline draught; he said I had done very well - I asked him what was to be done to allay the irritation of her stomach; he said he had heard of no irritation of the stomach; I told him that in my note I had expressed the words "unceasing sickness;" he said I had not, but on referring to the note, which he had with him, he found I had stated it - he said the sickness was of no consequence, but on the contrary, a benefit; I begged he would order something to quiet the stomach and bowels - he said it was altogether in consequence of inhaling, and that these symptoms combined with the wound, were proofs that his system was taking due effect; I begged of him to give her a composing draught - he said a tumbler of mulled port wine was a better composing draught than all the doctors could give, for that he hated the very name of physic - he directed me to give it to her, and on the staircase he requested I would expose the wound to the air; I objected to administer the mulled port wine, but he insisted on its being given - I gave her a wine-glass full, which was immediately rejected by the stomach; he requested I would expose the wound to the air, lay on a piece of linen, and keep a constant application of cold cream - I said, to expose a wound like that to the air would produce madness almost; he then said that, on reconsidering, he thought there could not be a better application than the poultice I had already named - he requested I would continue that poultice, and he should rely on my judgment, for an account of the wound on the following morning - that as I had constantly applied the poultice I should be better able, to from a correct opinion than he could; he then took his leave: I applied the poultice as he desired, and she got worse - Mr. Long came again on the following morning,(15th) between eleven and twelve o'clock; I was in Miss Cashin's bed-room with him - Mrs. Cashin was also there, and nobody else; Miss Cashin was in bed; on going into the room he very hastily took off his coat, threw it on the bed, and requested some soft dry linen to be procured; this was before any thing had passed, except the customary compliments on entering the room - he had asked how Miss Cashin was, and I said she was worse; after ordering the linen he very uncorteously stripped off her night dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say "uncorteously?" A. Because I never saw a <rs id="t18301028-112-deflabel630" type="occupation">medical man</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18301028-112-defend979 t18301028-112-deflabel630"></join> do so in my life; he did not do it gently, but very rudely - I begged him to step aside till I had removed the poultice; Miss Cashin said, "Indeed, Mr. Long, you shall not touch my back again - it is horrible, the state in which you have brought me; you very well know, when I became your patient I was in perfect health, but now you are killing me;" Mr. Long replied,"Whatever inconvenience you are now suffering will be of short duration, for in two or three days you will be in better health than ever you were in your life," and again spoke most confidently that the result of his system would be to prolong her life - he then put on his coat; Mrs. Cashin said, "Mr. Long, I thought you were going to do something to Catherine's back."</p>
               <p>Q. Before he put on his coat, and Mrs. Cashin thus addressed him, do you remember his saying any thing of the complaint she would have been under? A. He said that within two months she would have been seized with consumption - that the state of the stomach and bowels were all symptoms he wished to produce, and that they were proofs there were the seeds of consumption in her- when he had put on his coat, he said, in answer to Mrs. Cashin, that no person could be doing better than Miss cashin was - I pointed out to him again the same spot in the wound, which I had pointed out on the Saturday; it was then darker, and the wound had materially extended in that interval - he said that probably a number of biles would come out, which would be the consequence of inhaling, and what he wished to produce - he said she was going on uncommonly well; the linen he desired had been brought to him, but he made no use of it at all - Miss Cashin's back was laying exposed during all this conversation; I should think the wound was exposed to the air for ten or fifteen minutes - I again pressed his attention to the sickness, and Mrs. Cashin did the same - he said he had a remedy with him which would stay the sickness, but he would not then apply it, for the sickness would be of ultimate benefit to her, and he liked the sickness; Mrs. Cashin said, "Good God, Mr. Long, why don't you now apply it?" he said he did not wish the sickness to be stopped, that he had had a lady who had had sickness for six weeks, and she was better for it; that our fears were perfectly groundless, for no person could be doing better than Miss Cashin was - I then named the irritation of the bowels, and he ordered her to have some rhubarb and magnesia; before he went away he said if the sickness was not over by eleven or twelve o'clock at night he would call, and give her something that would stop it - this was Sunday morning; (Miss Cashin died about ten o'clock on the Tuesday morning;) he called again that Sunday night, between eleven and twelve, of his own accord; the sickness had continued, and he gave her some medicine which he brought with him; it was thrown off her stomach before Mr. Long left the room - he had stated in the morning that he was going to Richmond for the day, and would call on his return.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state, according to your observation, was Miss Cashin in the morning while Mr. Long was there? A. She presented in the morning a very distressed and restless appearance; she was tumbling and tossing about the bed - she got gradually worse, and when Mr. Long called, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I told him I thought the nervous system was so much affected something ought to be done, and probably some medicine might be given with effect - he said my fears were perfectly groundless, and it was my ignorance of his system, and that she would be perfectly well in two or three days; he then took his leave; I was with Miss Cashin till past two o'clock in the morning; we were constantly removing her pillow - her distress was extreme; Mr. Long called next morning between eight and nine o'clock - I was not then in the bed-room, but I stepped into the drawing-room, after he left Miss Cashin, to ask him how he thought she was; he said she was doing uncommonly well; I immediately left the room - he came again in the afternoon, after Mr. Brodie had been;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280050"></xptr>Miss Cashin had continued gradually getting worse, in consequence of which Mr. Brodie was sent for, and saw her about six o'clock in the evening, and ordered a poultice and saline draught, which was administered, and she had temporary relief - Mr. Long called about seven o'clock the same evening; I saw him pass in and out, but did not speak to him - the poultice had been administered before he came; Miss cashin passed a very had night - I saw her on Tuesday morning, at half-past seven o'clock, and gave her a saline draught, by Mr. Brodie's prescription, and in half an hour, or three quarters of an hour, I gave her a cup of coffee and some dry toast; Mr. Long had not interdicted her from any kind of food at all - I heard him state, in the course of his attendance, that his patients night eat and drink whatever they liked, without restriction; after giving her the coffee and toast, I left her - she was then extremely ill; this was about eight o'clock - the bell rang violently, and there was a great thumping on the floor while I was at breakfast; I immediately went up to her bed-room, and found her dying - I tried to get a tea-spoon full of brandy into her mouth, but her jaws were quite set, and she was dead- Mr. Foulkes, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, had been sent for, but she was dead; I should think she died at very near ten o'clock, but, in my agitation, I cannot speak to the time - I had seen Mr. Long about six or seven o'clock the night preceding; he was not informed of Mr. Brodie having being called in, in my presence -Mrs. Cashin is not in this country.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did two ladies, named Cashin, come from Ireland? A. Yes, this and a younger one; the other was a patient of Mr. Long's before her - I understand she had been his patient from the time they came to England; I only went with Miss Catherine - she appeared in perfect health, and continued so till within four or five days of her going to the prisoner with me; she had been his patient for four or five days before I went with her.</p>

            . I live at Dublin. I married a sister of Miss Cashin's - in consequence of a letter which I received, I came over to this country; she had left Ireland about seven weeks, and was then in very good health - I arrived in England on Saturday, the 14th, about six o'clock in the evening, and went to see her immediately; I remained below stairs while the prisoner was up with her - he came down shortly after my arrival, and I asked him what he thought of Miss Cashin; he said, "As to Miss Cashin, she is doing remarkably well, just as I wish," and was just in the state he wished her to be - I remarked that her stomach was sick; he said that did not signify, that would be well of itself - before he came down I was in the hall, or on the stairs, and heard him conversing with Mrs. Roberts; she asked him if something should not be done to allay the heat of Miss Cashin's back - Mr. Long said it should be exposed to the air; Mrs. Roberts said she thought something ought to be put to it - he said,"Then, if there must be something, put a little cold cream, and sop it up with linen from time to time;" Mrs. Roberts said she (Miss Cashin) could not bear that - he then said, "What would you put?" she said she had applied a poultice, which had given relief in the morning: next morning, Sunday, I breakfasted with Mr. Long - I went on account of my sister; on leaving him, I told him I had come from Ireland to inquire into the health of the two Miss Cashins - he told me with regard to Miss Catherine Cashin, that her friends need be under no apprehension, for that her back was in the state he wished it to be, and that there were many of his patients would be glad to have such a discharge; her stomach, he siad, would get well of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in the course of your conversation, say any thing about what induced her to become his patient? A. He told me that a young lady, a patient of his, asked him what he thought of Miss Cashin, and that he told the young lady, unless Miss Cashin put herself under his care she would die of consumption in two or three months - that the young lady told Mrs. Cashin, the mother, the conversation she had had with him, and the consequence was, that Mrs. Cashin put Miss Cashin under his course of treatment, hoping to prevent her from consumption; he told me his treatment was to rub a mixture on different parts of the body, sometimes on the back, sometimes on the chest, head and the eyes also - he said that had been done to Miss Cashin, and asked me to sign a book which he had, binding every one to secrecy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say, "Binding every one to secrecy?" A. He produced a book, and asked me to sign it - I wished to see the purport of the obligation; I read it, and remarked that I had no objection to sign it, as it required us not to divulge what the mixture was, or the colour of it, and I could not divulge it, for I never saw it, and did not know what it was made of; there was a gentleman in the room at the time, who said, "Are you going to swear Mr. Sweetman?" and remarked that it was all nonsense - Mr. Long replied that he had his reasons for making people sign the book. My sister died on the Tuesday following - Mrs. Cashin is in Ireland.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. I believe Mrs. Cashin had come from Ireland on account of a younger daughter, Miss Ellen? A. Yes, she was supposed to be in a consumption - she brought her to England to put her under Mr. Long's care.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she lost one of her children before of consumption? A. I suppose it was considered consumption - her son had died about a year before at Lyons, in France; he was nineteen years old - Catherine was twenty-four, and the younger sister sixteen or seventeen; not more than seventeen.</p>
               <p>B. C. BRODIE, Esq. I am a surgeon. I went on Monday, the 16th of August, between five and six o'clock, to the house of Mrs. Roberts, and saw Miss Cashin - she was confined to her bed; I examined her person, and found her back very extensively inflamed - the whole of the inflamed surface must have been as large as the whole of a common plate, and in the centre of the inflamed part there was a spot as big as the palm of my hand, which was black, dead, in a state which we call slough or mortified - she was also suffering from incessant sickness; I was informed that nothing whatever would remain on her stomach- I prescribed some medicine for her, merely to allay the sickness - nothing further could be done at that time; I ordered a poultice to be applied to the back - I believe it had been poulticed before; I desired it to be continued -I thought her very ill indeed, though I did not at that time regard her to be in such very imminent danger as she was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280051"></xptr>Q. Had you any means of judging how the place on the back had been produced? A. I should think some very powerful stimulating linament had been applied to the back; I called at the house on the following afternoon, and found she had died in the morning - in her state I should think it quite absurd to administer a tumbler of port wine - it was impossible it could stay on her stomach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. When you arrived at the house, and heard the young lady was dead, I believe you were perfectly astonished? A. I did not expect her to die that day; I do not know that I expressed great astonishment - I saw the body; mortification had extended in the course of the night very rapidly indeed -I did not examine the entire body.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a system among some of your profession of curing disease by counter-irritation? A. It is very common; a blister causes counter irritation.</p>
               <p>Q. Will not the things which are made use of as counter-irritation have different effects on different persons? A. Yes, they will; I have known cases where a blister will not disturb the system of one person, and produce very great distrubance in another: the bad appearance in this wound would not alter after death.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are there means which may be used by professional gentlemen to check counter-irritation, if it proceeds too rapidly? A. Yes, there are, and they require to be used with discretion.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you think it right to apply to a person in perfect health, stimulating linaments, which would produce such a slough and sore as you saw on this lady's back? A. Certainly not, and I doubt very much whether any stimulating linaments, in common use among the profession, would produce the same effects - the same extensive mischief; I mean by that to include the constitutional effects and the local effects: the sickness and vomiting were as much the effects of what had been done as the mischief - if the linaments had not been applied to the back there would not have been the sickness nor the mortification.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Upon your judgment and experience, if lotion of so powerful a stimulating nature as to produce the effect you observed on the person of the patient, was applied to a person of her sex and appearance, being then in perfect health, was such an application likely to produce a derangement in the system, and to produce disease and danger? A. I think it would, and it has fallen to my lot to see another case, exactly similar, since.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there much difference in the constitution of persons, so as for the effect to be different, according to the constitution? A. There is - it depends on the constitution, the thickness of the skin, and other things; it is not uncommon to apply stimulants to the chest, blisters for instance - I never knew stimulants applied where there were no symptoms of consumption; I did not know the young lady before - when I saw her there was a black spot of mortification in the centre of the wound, which extended during the night; the black spot itself was as large as the palm of my hand; wine would have been proper to administer if the stomach would bear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you say it was improper is on account of the stomach? A. The question put to me was whether a tumbler of wine would be proper; mulled port wine, administered in a proper quantity, would not be improper, if the stomach would bear it - I was not present at the post mortem examination; the appearances I saw on the back were quite sufficient to account for death - I can say nothing about what produced these appearances, except from what I was told by Mr. Sweetman, Mrs. Roberts, and others in the house; I did not examine the back after the body was opened - I saw a portion of the dead skin, which was taken from the back.</p>

            . I am a bachelor of medicine. I attended at Mrs. Roberts' house, and saw the body of the deceased there, stated to be Catherine Cashin, on the Sunday morning after her death; I examined the body, and the wound on her back - (producing a memorandum) this was not made by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us an account of the appearances of the body, as well as you can, without referring to that? A. I will endeavour to do so, but it is not usual with medical men to recollect these things - we commit them to writing. I have heard Mr. Brodie's evidence, and concur in every thing he has stated, most certainly; I went to the tomb where she was buried; I saw the same body there, as far as I could possibly ascertain - it had similar appearances to the body I had seen; I had sewn up part of it - it had the sewing up which I had made, and also the incisions I made.</p>

            . I attended the examination of the body of the deceased, at the Roman Catholic chapel, Moorfields, on the 24th of August; Dr. Thompson, and various other surgeons were present - there was a piece of dead or disorganized skin, which we call an eschara - (which Mr. Brodie calls slough) between the shoulders, nearly the size of the crown of my hat; the parts beneath the skin were gorged with serum.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the appearances you saw on the back seem to you to have been produced by? A. If I was to hold a piece of hot iron about a quarter of an inch from the skin, it would produce such an eschara - we examined with a view to discern if there was any latent disease; we discovered none whatever - I examined under the brain and spinal marrow; the muscles were in a tolerably healthy state - they were in the state I should expect after laying some time in the tomb.</p>

            , ESQ. M.D. I attended the tomb, and was present at the examination of the body - the limbs and breast were plump and fleshy, and so was the body generally; there was no appearance whatever of disease, except where the wound was inflicted - not of disease which could have preceded the inflication of the wound; I believe there was no disease existing previous to that - there was no evidence of it whatever; I examined the brain - it was perfectly sound, and the spinal marrow was perfectly sound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Was this on the Sunday after her death? A. On the 24th, the Tuesday week.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOGG, ESQ. I am a physician. I examined the body of Miss Cashin, with the other gentlemen, in the tomb at Moorfields chapel - I observed the appearances on the back very particularly; I have heard the evidence of the other gentlemen - I differ a little with Dr. Johnson's description of the spine, but I agree in the description of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280052"></xptr>the wound on the back; I should have supposed it was produced either by fire or gunpowder - it had that appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you conceive any state in which, in a healthy body, the application of any thing which could produce such a sore could be of service? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What, do not you agree with Dr. Johnson about? A. It struck me the sheet of the spine was discoloured opposite the external wound - the inference I should draw from that was, that there must have been very great constitutional disturbance ensuing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not state before the Coroner, that not having been present at the first examination, it was difficult for you to ascertain the cause of death? A. I said so, and that violence done to the nervous system was sufficient to cause death, particularly if done to a nervous young lady.</p>

            . I am in the prisoner's service, and have been so for six months - I was in his service on the 3rd of August; I remember Miss Cashin being a patient - she had a sister also a patient; I rubbed some liquid on the back of Miss Catherine Cashin on the 3rd of August, by Mr. Long's order - that was the first time I rubbed her back; I did not do it afterwards - I do not know what the liquid was composed of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Had Mr. Long a good many patients? A. Yes, a good many, many of them persons of rank and station - I was employed to rub the ladies; I used to take the lady who was to be rubbed behind a screen, which separated them from the rest of the room - the rubbing was for the purpose of producing a sore of discharge; she was rubbed but once - she came day after day to be dressed, and I washed round it with a lotion; I rubbed her the same as I did other persons, and washed her with the same lotion as others - it did not produce a greater discharge on her back than on that of other persons; there was not more discharging from her back than was usual - the rubbing usually produced a little discharge, not very much the first time; she was only rubbed once - she came to have it dressed till the 13th; I dressed it every day - it did not produce a worse appearance than usual; the bottle of lotion stood in the room where the ladies were - the Marchioness of Ormond and her daughter, Lady

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the same lotion applied to wash as had produced the sore? A. Yes - Miss Cashin's mother and sister were in the room when I rubbed her back, nobody else; when I had done this, I kept the bottle for other patients - when the liquid was out Mr. Long put more into it; the sore on Miss Cashin's back, on the 14th, was not bigger than the palm of my hand - not worse than other ladies; it was rather red - my master attended her every day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the lotion produce any sore, except when used for rubbing? A. No; I rubbed with a sponge- I have seen ladies wash their hands in the lotion and drink it.</p>

Gentlemen, I now leave the case in your hands with hope and confidence: an intention to do evil no one will impute to me, and it will be for you to decide whether a medical practitioner, he his comparative knowledge or skill what it may, shall be criminally answerable for a fatal event, which he could neither foresee nor avert. I am to be tried, not by any fancied system of justice, but by the law of England, constitutionally administered - to that law I make my firm and solemn appeal; you, Gentlemen, will have it explained by the learned Judge, and on his wisdom and your conscience, I place my firm reliance.</p>

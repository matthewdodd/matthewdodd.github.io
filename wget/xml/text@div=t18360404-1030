I have known the prisoner about two years—she lived in my house for six or seven weeks, like one of my family—on the 23rd of March, I and my wife went to a sale opposite Whitechapel church—I left the prisoner at home with a young man, who works in the room—I returned about five or six o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was then gone, and did not return at all—I missed a pair of trowsers from a box, and from the table drawer, which had been locked, and of which my wife had the key in her pocket, I missed the other articles.</p>

On getting on the stairs of the first floor, I knocked at the staircase door, which leads into a passage; this door shuts the two rooms on the first floor entirely separate from the rest of the premises - the passage only leads to the two rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a correct model of the floor - (producing it) - A. It is. The passage door was shut and bolted, the prisoner's wife opened it, and exactly opposite that door is the room door, which was open, the prisoner was in bed. I told him he was suspected of uttering forged notes and asked his name? he said it was

            , and that he had lived there about three months. I found some linen drying in the front room, which his wife said, in his presence, was hers. I then searched the passage, and found, just opposite the bedroom door, the pannel was loose. I had a candle, as the passage was dark. On moving the pannel I found a small roll of black cotton, with eighteen 1 l. Bank notes in it, which I marked, these are them - (looking at them). I asked him how they came there? he said he knew nothing about them. Jeffries gave me a piece of black cotton from a table drawer in the prisoner's room. On comparing it with that the notes were in they fitted. I produce them - they are parts of a coat sleeve. These rooms run from one to the other. I have no doubt but they originally belonged to each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is it an old house - A. Yes; the passage only leads to these two rooms. I never had complaints against persons in this house before.</p>

When they took the pannel down the prisoners saw them do it, and appeared agitated at that moment. Foy asked how they came there? he said he knew nothing of them.

            . The house No. 110, Curtain-road, belongs to me, I live in the adjoining house. The prisoner lodged on the first floor, in the back room - he was nearly three months there. When he first came Mrs. Cowden had the front room; she left a month ago, nobody occupied it after. I gave the prisoner's wife leave to dry her clothes there. His sister brought a bedstead in, but never lived there - his wife helped her in with the bedstead three days before the officers came. She brought nothing else, and did not stay many minutes. The passage door shuts the back and front room in separately, as if it was a house of itself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had Cowden lived there - A. Almost eleven years. I never saw his sister but once after she took the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Lowndes. On Friday morning, 30th August, I was in the parlour adjoining my shop, and I saw the prisoner on the steps, just leaving my shop—he had no business there—I ran after him, and called "Stop thief!"—he was running—I saw him stopped by Rose—I had never lost sight of him between the time of his going out of the shop and his being stopped—he got away from Rose—I continued running for some time, and then went back to my shop—I then missed a box that was in the till behind my counter, containing one shil<lb></lb>ling, three 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—pieces, and two sixpences, which I bad seen safe a minute or two before the man left the shop—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man; I never lost sight of him for a moment—I had not seen him before to my knowledge—I have seen a part of the box since, but cannot swear to it.</p>

I was standing in the parlour looking in the shop through a glass-door—I did not see any one come in—I was busy—the first I saw was a person leaving the shop, sideways—his back was not towards me—the shop-door fronts the parlour—he was making his way out as fast as he could—I saw him stopped—he broke away almost directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a news-agent. On 30th Aug. I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running—he said, "Don't stop me, Mr. Rose, I have done nothing"—I attempted to stop him—he broke away, and left this part of a box in my hand—I had known him for many years, and he knew me.</p>

Q.</hi> Where do you live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the Waterloo-road—he did not come down with a rush to me—I saw him fifty yards before he came to me—I knew him well—there was no other person in the road-there were other persons behind him crying "Stop thief!"—I told the police that I knew him—I do not know where he lived—I know his father and mother; they used to sell rabbits—I did not see the prisoner again till Sunday week, when he was taken.</p>

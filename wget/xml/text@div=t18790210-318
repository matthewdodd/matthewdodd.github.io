I am stationed at Forest Hill—on 23rd January I spoke to Mr. Smith, the station-master, went into the goods yard, searched, and found two trusses of mixture concealed in the porters' room—I mixed with it some pieces of paper on which I put my initials, and Mr. Smith put a cross on them—we inserted two pieces in each truss, and kept watch—at 3 a.m. the prisoner Wale came in with a horse and cart and came out a few minutes afterwards with two trusses of stuff in his cart—I went round Perry Vale and stopped at the Forest Hill Hotel—I then followed Wale to a greengrocer's shop in Stanstead Road, where he stopped 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then went on to his stable in Malham Road, backed his cart against the loft window, and was in the act of putting the truss into the loft, when I went up and said "Well, where did you get that truss from?"—he said "Why, what makes you ask me; that is a funny question for you to ask me, is not it?"—I said "I wish to know"—I was in plain clothes, but he knew me—he said "Why! do you think I stole them, then?"—I said "I don't know, I wish to know where you got them from"—he said "If you must know, I got them from Forest Hill station—I said "How did you get them there?"—he said "I bought them of one of the goods porters, the man who serves the stuff out"—I said "What did you give him for it?"—he said "Well, I don't think I am bound to answer that question"—I said "Please yourself"—an officer in uniform was there, and I ordered him to take him in custody—I said "I believe you have got the property of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway in your cart, and there are some of my marks in it"—I opened the hay, took one of my papers out and showed it to him, saying, "There is my initials and Mr. Smith, the station-masters cross"—he said that he was quite innocent—I then went to Thatcher in the goods yard and told him I should take him on a charge of stealing two trusses of hay, the property of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway—he said "I did not steal them, I found them in the goods yard; I did not know who they belonged to, and I sold them to Wale for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I took him to the station and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and an address label—the two trusses I saw in Wale's place were the same that I saw in the goods yard with my marks.</p>

Wale said that he had bought the two trusses for litter—I was in uniform—during the nine years I have known him he has borne a most high character—his horse began to trot, and I said "I can hardly keep up, I should like to drive," and he said "Jump up"—the hay is still in the same state, except that I put new bands on it, as they were broken by lifting it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at Forest Hill—Thatcher was the only goods porter there—hay is kept in the goods yard, and there were 300 or 400 trusses there on 22nd and 23rd January—they are not kept in the porters' room—on 23rd January Stump came to me and I went with him to the goods yard at 7 p.m., and found in the porter's office two trusses of hay—four pieces of paper were put into it, and I arranged with Stump to watch—I saw the trusses at the police station two days afterwards, and saw the two pieces of paper put into each—those two trusses were I should say good hay, they were not thrown aside to be sold as litter—Thatcher had no authority to dispose of it—I was present on the 24th, when Stump accused Thatcher of stealing the hay—he said that he had it to put in the goods room—I questioned him about it, and he admitted that he had sold it for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a truss—when there are sweepings of hay in the yard it is cleared up with the rubbish and put in a truck and buried—these are not sweepings—I know Wale, and have seen him in the yard; he came for hay, and always had a consignment note—I never allow goods to be taken away except by persons who have consignment notes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RAVEN</hi>. We have hay in every day—the trucks are run into the goods yard and the hay is unloaded into waggons—once or twice the consignees have stored hay on the premises to release the trucks—I did not touch these two trusses, I could not—I was accountable for 60 trusses, and I charged him with stealing two trusses without going home and counting to see if I had lost any—I have never known the bands burst on unloaning hay, and the only litter has been from the sweepings of the trucks or the droppings from the cart—the two trusses of hay were good serviceable stuff—this is clover—Thatcher came there I think last May; he has a wife and child—he was taken on the 24th.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have known Wale some years—several residents at Forest Hill are here to give him a character—I go into the goods yard occasionally—there is sometimes a litter in the yard from the sweepings of the trucks—we have 700 or 800 trusses a week—all the hay swept up is not appropriated by the company—the sweepings are sent away and sold; We do not give the money to the consignor—I cannot say whether it goes to dividends—I heard Wale say that he was innocent of knowing that it was stolen—Mr. Martin, of Brockley, is a large consignor of hay to our place—he could not have his hay there because there is no siding—the consignor</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Litter consists of the sweepings from the trucks—we do not appropriate it to dividends; we burn it—it is of no value—there is not the slightest pretence for saying that this was litter—litter is never concealed in the porters' room—besides the consignment of Mr. Martin's 60 trusses there was another consignment of 80 trusses—I ascertained the value from Mr. Martin—goods are only delivered upon a consignment note unless the consignee comes himself—no goods were consigned to Wale on this occasion—the servants are not allowed to receive gratuities.</p>

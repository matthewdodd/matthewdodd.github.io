                  </hi>. I am a dyer, and live in Little Marylebone-street, Manchester-square. On Wednesday, the 6th of July, I was in the public-house at the corner of York-square—I came out, and saw two or three persons at the corner of the square—I went over to them, and they were talking of tossing for half-and-half—there were several of them together—I was not of the prosecutor's party, but was accidentally passing—I saw them at the corner of York-square and Munster-street, and crossed over—there appeared nine or ten people—one of them was challenging the pri<lb></lb>soner, I believe, to toss for half-and-half, and be refused—he spoke in a foreign language, but I could tell by his manner that he did not wish to do it—he said something about one man to one man—he and his two friends then went on to the first lamp-post—the others stopped where they were—the prisoner and his companions stopped by the lamp-post—I believe it was from the others calling after them, "Are you going to toss for the half-and-half?"—I do not know whether they said any thing or not, but the prisoner beckoned over to those who were standing at the corner—the pro<lb></lb>secutor then said he would go over to them—he went, and I followed him, and when he got within three yards of them, the prisoner rushed out from the lamp-post, where he was leaning, and made a thrust at him—I cannot</p>

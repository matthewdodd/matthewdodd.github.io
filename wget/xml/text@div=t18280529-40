               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you alone occupy these apartments? A. Yes; it is a public staircase. I had been out from eleven to three o'clock - I had left Harris, my boy, to attend my apartments.</p>

            . I am in my seventeenth year; I had the care of Mr. Dunston's apartments - I was going down to my dinner a little before two o'clock; I dine in the lower part of the house, with another person belonging to the house; every thing was safe when I went down - I remained below about half an hour; I left the door locked, and put the key on the ledge over the door. When I returned I found the prisoner, (who was a stranger,) on the fourth floor stairs; my master occupies the third and fourth floors; the prisoner asked me for a strange man, who I knew nothing of: I said if he would be so good as to go down stairs, I would ask Mr. Gale, and while I was asking Mr. Gale for the name he gave me, the prisoner ran out of the house; I ran after him - he never got out of my sight, before I stopped him myself; he had a case of instruments and a box, containing the stomach-pump, and a pair of sheets, a pillow-case, and a glass tumbler; I delivered them over to Mr. Gale - I gave him into Mr. Gale's hands, and did not leave him till the constable had taken him; I went into the apartment, and found these things missing, which were safe when I went down to dinner; he said nothing when I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose the street door is open all day? A. Yes; the house is let out in chambers - a great many people pass up and down stairs; I am certain I saw him on the fourth flight of stairs; the key of the door could easily be got down. I went down into the kitchen to dine; I could not see the street door from there; the linen was master's; I found all the property on the prisoner - he came back voluntarily.</p>

            . I have the care of the whole of this house; the rent is paid to Mr. Boyle, who does not live there. On the 24th of May, Harris came down stairs, and asked me about a name, and the prisoner ran out at the door; he was a stranger; Harris called out "Mr. Gale"- I immediately ran up the stairs, and in a minute or two saw him come back with the prisoner in charge: I went to Mr. Dunston's room - as soon as the prisoner came up to the door he asked me to let him go down stairs; I said, No, he should not, and he walked up stairs; I took him up stairs - he put a bag down which he had got; I opened it, and found it contained this property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not come out till he was in custody? A. No, I was standing at the door - I was called up from the kitchen; a great many people might have been up stairs for what I know - he made no resistance.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going into the room, and looking round I found this picklock-key close to the prisoner, as he sat on the bed; I tried the key to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290032"></xptr>lock of the door - it would not open it; but one of the keys found on the prisoner opened one of the drawers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the regular door key? A. Yes - that was in the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARRIS re-examined. One key opens the third and fourth floor doors; I found the key of master's door in the bed-room door, which communicates with the staircase.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNSTON. I know these sheets - they are marked with my name, and were taken from a drawer in the bed-room, and are worth 14s. - also the pillow-case, which is worth 2s.; this case of instruments is mine - it cost me between five and six guineas; some of them are made by my particular direction; I conceive them to be fully worth five guineas; this stomach-pump is worth between 3l. and 4l.; a table-cloth was missing, which is here; this quilt is worth 10s.; the whole property is worth about 10l. I am certain they were all safe when I left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain they were all there? A. I did not see the sheets and pillow-case, but have no doubt they were in the drawers; the instruments cost me more than I have valued them at; I had no doubt about any of my property before the Magistrate; two shirts were produced, which were not mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a foreigner, and not able to make myself properly understood. Mr. Dunston said before the Magistrate, that he could not swear to a particular piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNSTON. I have said there were some shirts there which I could not swear to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MR. GALE. Q. At what time did you come up stairs? A. Between two and three o'clock; I was waiting at the door for the boy to come back - I took you up stairs myself: I did not come out of the kitchen to lay hold of you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to JOHN BARNETT. Q. Was I in the room when given into your charge? A. On the third staircase; I searched and found a bunch of common keys in your pocket; I found the key and sugar-tongs on the bed; you were sitting on the bed when they were found.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNSTON. These sugar-tongs are mine; they were kept in a closet in the sitting-room, not in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken into the room everything was looked over; this young man found the key and sugar-tongs near the head of the bed, and I stood by the drawers, not near the bed.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARRIS. The prisoner opened the room door, and walked about the room before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I positively deny being in one of the rooms before I was taken up; these things were on the stairs of the fourth flight - I went up to inquire for Mr. Crowther, a maker of German lamps - he lived there about six months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. GALE. I went to live there on the 4th of September; a Mr. Carder lived there before the prosecutor - he was a dealer in Birmingham were and lamps.</p>

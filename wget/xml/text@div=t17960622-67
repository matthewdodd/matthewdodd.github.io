               <p>Q. Did he stand up, or was he knocked down? - A. I did not see him knocked down; I don't know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220087"></xptr>that the blows were given with violence; he was in a passion; when it was over Seabrook went towards town, and Robinson went towards home; I did not take much notice of Seabrook, he did not appear to be hurt; I saw Robinson strike him, I believe about his shoulders, with the umbrella, and break it; it was broke and thrown away; that was after he had struck him with his fist about the head, and then he Kicked him; but I cannot say where.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a gardener, I work at jobbing about, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another; but I am a gardener to the Veterinary college; the deceased, Seabrook, lived within five doors of me, at Kentish-town; I know the prisoner; I came out of the garden to get a pint of beeer, thinking not to be seen by my master; as I was going along there was Seabrook about forty yards before me, and as he came against Robinson's gate there was a stone laid in the way; Seabrook picked up the stone and threw it away; Robinson was coming along with his milk-pails, and saw him take the stone; and he came up and said, what business have you to throw that stone away; why, says he, is it your's? yes, says he, it is mine, and you shall fetch it back; no, says Seabrook, I won't, and then Robinson dropped his yokes off and set his pails down, and swore he should; and the other said, he would not; and then he took his umbrella and endeavoured to keep Robinson off with it; and then as he drew back I ran into Fisher's, and said, here is a sight; they had not struck one another then; Seabrook stood on his own defence to get away; I went in and called them out to see the sight, and I looked at them through the glass of the new tap-room; and I saw the umbrella broke and thrown into the brook; I saw it broke with beating the deceased, or struggling to get away.</p>

               <p>I live at Camden-town: I saw the latter part of this quarrel; the first that I saw of it was after I was called out by Kendrick; I was at work at Mrs. Fisher's, as a carpenter; I immediately came forward, I and my partner; and when I came out I saw a bustle between Robinson and Seabrook, and there were two or three blows passed; I saw Robinson strike him, I believe twice, about the breast, as near as I could guess; Seabrook turned about to go towards town, and Robinson turned about after him and gave him a kick on the breach; Seabrook walked away, apparently as well as I or any other man unhurt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you see him afterwards? - A. Yes; three or four days after he came into Mrs. Fisher's, and had a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>Q. What appeared to be his complaint? - A. A putrid fever; I gave him a clyster on Thursday night, and nothing but congealed blood came from him; there was a bruise upon his right breach, and a yellow mark about his stomach, but I cannot tell whether that proceeded from a blow or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether there was not a putrid fever in that house? - A. No; it was in the family, and I believe six weeks before that.</p>
               <p>Q. In your opinion what did he die of? - A. I cannot say; he had a very bad fever.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a surgeon in Kentish-town: I saw the deceased before his death about ten days and upwards; on the 6th of June when I first saw him, he complained of some pain about his chest, and some about his head; he requested to be bled; I told him at that time there was no particular occasion for it; if it encreased the next morning, he should be bled; the next morning he was better, and I did not see him again till Saturday, when he was seized with a violent bleeding at the nose; he lost a pint, or a pint and an half of blood; that was on Saturday the 11th, and at that time he had a putrid fever; and he continued so; on Wednesday the bleeding came on again, and he had all the appearance of a putrid fever at the time he died.</p>
               <p>Q. And not from any other cause? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Did not two other surgeons attend? - A. Dr. Rowley attended him, and Mr. Cowper, and it was our opinion that there was no symptom by which we could say but that he died of a putrid fever.</p>

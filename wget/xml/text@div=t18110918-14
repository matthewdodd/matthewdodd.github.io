On the 26th of July, the two prisoners came to my shop about seven in the morning, my apprentice was sweeping out the shop, they wanted to look at some ribbons, and they both looked at some plain ribbons a considerable while I took out a drawer of figured ribbons, they looked at various patterns; Davis took up a piece of pink ribbon, she said buy this, it is a pretty one; Norris declined it; I took out the plain drawer again, she at last chose a piece and had a yard, and paid five pence for it, they then left my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that they left your shop had you any knowledge that you had missed any thing - A. No, not in the least; I put the plain drawer in its place, and in putting the figured ribbon drawer to rights; I missed the piece that Davis picked out: I desired my apprentice to go after them, he did, and brought them back; I desired them to leave the ribbon that they had stolen; Davis, after hesitating a great while, took out of her pocket a piece of buff, that was not the piece that I had missed nor did I know that they had got that. I said to my apprentice go for a constable. He immediately went out, I went and bolted the door. They offered to pay me for the ribbon, Davis said she would pay for it; I told them that was not the way I would settle it. They then said they would go out;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180009"></xptr>I begged they would remain quiet till the constable came, upon which Davis came to the door where I was standing, and beat me over my head. I at length got hold of both her hands, and held her fast. Then Norris came and beat me, their blows were pretty heavy on me; this lasted until

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Who is Hemming? A. My cousin; he had been out all night with me- I was never out all night before; I had been at a public-house, and had a pint of beer - I was only in one public-house; when I awoke the coffee-shop was quite full of people - I found my watch-glass on the ground.</p>

            . I was at the William the Fourth coffee-shop on Sunday morning, and saw the prosecutor come in with Hemming - the prisoners sat opposite me; I saw the prisoner Murphy there first - Percival came in a good while after him; another man was in their company - the prosecutor was asleep; I saw the one who is not in custody shift a stool up in the corner - he moved it again, just by where Harrison sat, and then Murphy was moving about from one place to the other; Percival was leaning over the next box - I heard Percival ask Murphy for a knife; Murphy gave him one, and Percival gave it to the other man, who cut Harrison's watch-guard, and in taking his watch out, the glass and key fell on the ground - I saw Percival give the knife back to Murphy, who said it was a pearl handle and steel blade; I saw no more of the watch- the man who took it went and sat on the stairs, and shortly after they all three left the room and went away together; several other persons left at the same time - I awoke Harrison, and told him what had occurred; Hemming came out with us - I met the prisoners and the other man by Spitalfields church, almost immediately after, with several others who had been in the shop; I directly went to the Police station, and told what had occurred, but before I got assistance they were gone - I knew Murphy before, by his living at the top of the street where I do; he was not acquainted with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you sleep that night? A. No where - I live in Charles-street, Curtain-road; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200044"></xptr>and a few friends generally go out on a Saturday night -I had been drinking, but was not intoxicated; I staid with my friends at the coffee-shop - I am a chair-maker; I was a afraid to mention it in the house - after I did mention it a man told me to hold my tongue; Harrison went out after losing his watch, and came in again - I then mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there as many as twenty persons in the shop when Harrison awoke? A. Yes, but all that were in the place were of one company, laughing and joking together - six persons were in my company; I was there not an hour and a half before Harrison - the prisoners were sober; I never quarrelled with Murphy - I had two pints of porter, and drank with several friends besides; I was not the least intoxicated.</p>

I looked round, and saw Murphy sitting on the edge of the table by the side of a young woman, and the other prisoner on the form - I saw a knife in Murphy's hand, and at the same time I saw the one who is not taken, sitting under the prosecutor on a sort of stool, shifting about him - I laid down my head and went to sleep again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had been a little tipay? A. No, I had been up early on the Saturday morning - I was in Knight's company all night; we only went to one public-house - I live at Kingsland; I went home and came back, as I could not get in - Knight went with me.</p>

               <p>Murphy's Defence. I was going home between two and three o'clock in the morning, and went into the coffee-shop, alone; I had my knife to my hand, spreading some butter - I showed the persons near me what a curious knife it was; it was handed round to be examined - there were thirty or forty persons in the shop; the prosecutor and witnesses were asleep - I had no connection with the party - I never saw them before, except Knight, whom I have abused for abusing his mother in the street, and for that reason, I believe, he picked me out; seven or eight persons went out at the same time as me.</p>
               <p>Percival's Defence. I went there for a cup of coffee, and returned directly, as I was sitting up, watching my brother, who lay dead.</p>

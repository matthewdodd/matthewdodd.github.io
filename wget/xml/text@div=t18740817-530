                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter carriers at the South Western District office—the prisoner was a sorter in that office—he had been there about eighteen months—on Saturday evening, the 25th July, he was on duty there—in the early part of the evening he was stamping letters and packets and sorting, and the latter part he was making up the Southampton bag—about 7 o'clock my attention was called to him, and I saw that he was handling his letters in a manner which excited my sus<lb></lb>picions—after he had finished sorting and had made up his bag he was about leaving the office—he had left his road some eight or ten yards and I saw that he was carrying his left arm close to his side, so that he could not use his arm—he could not take it away from his side—I went to him and asked him what was the matter with his arm, if he had got anything underneath, and as I was approaching him be turned his right side towards me and dropped these two packets on the floor—I picked them up and took him into my private room, and asked him if he had anything else about him that did not belong to him—he turned his pockets out and there was nothing else found—he said "Pray, let me go this time for my poor mother's sake"—I asked him if he was in want—he said no, he had got a good home and did not know what possessed him to take the packets—one of the packets is ad<lb></lb>dressed "Mrs. A. P. Howell, Sisewell Gap, near Leiston, Suffolk"—there is no post-mark on it; the stamp has not been obliterated—it was the prisoner's duty that evening to obliterate the stamp—he should have done that between 5 and 5.30—in the usual course that letter would have been dispatched from our office to the Western Central at 5.20—the packet con<lb></lb>tains a brooch, a pair of earrings, and a small box—at the time I stopped him he had finished his duty and was leaving the office—he had his coat on his arm and his hat on—he had no other duties that night—he had nothing to do with the trollies—I was present when he was before the magistrate, and heard him make a statement there on the second occasion—he was re<lb></lb>manded from the Monday till the Friday—he said that he found the two packets under the road where he was at work after he had made up and sealed the bag—he might have found them there—it would not naturally have been there—according to the routine of the office it should have been dispatched at the other end of the office two hours before—if he had found a mis-sort it was his duty to put that on a table behind him which is there for the purpose, without leaving his seat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think he made use of the words "What possessed me?"—it was in answer to a question that I put to him, "What possessed you to take them?"—he did not say "What should possess me to take them, as I wanted for nothing?"-if ho had found a letter for Southampton after he had sealed his bag he would have to open the bag again—there is a porter there who goes to the station with the railway bags—he does not sometimes carry letters when they are left out of the bags—I should never ask him to take one or sanction his taking one—I did not see the prisoner put his bag on the trolly—the letters did not fall from him as he was putting the bag on the trolly because he had no bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 46, Desborough Gardens, Pimlico—on 25th July, I posted a letter containing a pair of earrings and a brooch in a little box to my wife, who was in Suffolk—I put it in the pillar letter-box in Desborough Gardens about 3.30 that afternoon.</p>

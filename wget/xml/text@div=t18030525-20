               <p>Second Count. A round blank of base metal of the size of a shilling, feloniously and traiterously did colour.(The case was opened by Mr. Fielding.)</p>
               <p>JAMES TRAKLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know the man at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you known him? - A. About two months before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you first become acquainted with him? - A.At a public-house in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your acquaintance, did he apply to you for any loan of money? - A. Yes, about a fortnight before he was taken up, he came with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state for what that loan of money was wanted? - A. Yes, they told me they were going to Cox's, the resiner's, in Little Britain, to buy gold and silver.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they tell you for what purpose they wanted that gold and silver? - A. To make half guineas and guineas of; I went with them to Cox's to the door; Bryan told me, I had better give the other man the money, and he would go in and buy it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he give you a reason why the other man was to go in? - A.He said, he did not like to go in, because he was so well known there for having bought so much silver; the man went in, and stopped about a quarter of an hour, and then came out again with some stuff in a paper, some silver and gold as he called it.</p>
               <p>Q.While the other man was gone in, had Bryan and you any conversation? - A.He said, he would be answerable for the money, as there was nothing but gold and silver sold there; he came out again, and we went to a public-house, and he gave me this stuff, which he told me cost more money than what he had of me a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any further conversation about money? - A.Bryan and the other man told me they would come the next night to my house; Bryan came, but the other did not; Bryan's wife came with him.</p>

               <p>Q.On what business did you call there? - A. To know why they did not come.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of what passed at the lodgings, did you give any information? - A.He, Bryan, told me he finished the silver; I called at Bryan's on Sunday; he was not at home; I saw the wife.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you call for? - A. I called to know why the other man did not come; she told me her husband was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of what Bryan said, that he finished the silver, did you give your information at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you direct the officers to the lodgings at which you had been? - A.I did.</p>

               <p>Q.Did not you say you had never been told that there would be a reward for it? - A.I was told I should have my expences.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not now believe there is a reward? - A. I never understood there was any particular reward.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there a reward in this case?</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. A.No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you come into this Court with a belief, and go before the Magistrate with a belief, that there was a reward of forty pounds? - A. I was not certain of it; I did not firmly believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never got the ten guineas again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not, upon your oath, said, that if you did not get, your ten guineas, you would prosecute this man, and make it up by your share of the reward? - A.No, I never said so.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the officers of Bow-street: In consequence of an information I received on the 13th of April, I went with a search-warrant to No. 132, St. John-street, Smithfield; I went up two-pair-of-stairs; I knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q.The front room? - A.The front room; the prisoner, Bryan, came to the door in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q.What time of the morning was it? - A.Between seven and eight; he opened the door, and let me in; I and my brother officers, Passmore and Lewis, went in; I told him I had come with an aukward circumstance; that I had a search warrant against his apartment; he said, I was very welcome to search; when I went into the room I saw a great quantity of half crowns, some shillings and sixpences, and some gold on the table; the gold and silver were all on the table mixed together.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that good money you found on the table? - A. It was all good but one shilling and two sixpences; on searching about we found some implements, some stamps that answer the marks upon these shillings I have got, and some vitriol, and other ingredients for coining. On searching the prisoner I found six had shillings in his right-hand breeches pocket; Mrs. Bryan taking up her pockets from the head of the bed, I caught hold of the pockets, and took them out of her hand, and found five bad shillings in her pocket; there was a half crown and a sixpence very good; I secured them; this is the money I found on the man, and this on the woman. (The things were all produced.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. She was found in bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.The husband was found in bed? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.You made a mistake I believe; you said you searched the man, he was naked? - A. He had put his small clothes on before I searched him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250021"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you find any aqua fortis? - A. I found some vitriol.</p>
               <p>Q. Vitriol is a distinct thing from aqua fortis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no aqua fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any files? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have often searched such places? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You always found files? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not files necessary in this business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not aqua fortis necessary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find any press? - A. No; there was a little hand vyse.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no crucible? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Whether vitriol or aqua fortis, that was the thing you found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>EVAN LEWIS sworn. - I went to this house; I found this liquid, a pair of plyers, three stamps, with letters upon them, A D, a P, and an A; I found some papers, containing something, I imagine to be gold dust; another paper with some other metal in it not of the same colour; I found some clippings of some kind of metal, and something like filings of metal; some scowering-paper, some part of which seems to have been used; a piece of cork that appears to have been used, and these two bottles, and some blacking I found.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find all the things that are there? - A. Passmore and I found them, and put them in. Here is a piece of paper I found in his pocketbook (the paper read), eight ounces of silver, at 5s. 8d. per ounce, 2l. 5s. 4d. eight blank copper at 3l. 2s. mill seventeen ounces at 11/2d. 2s. 11/2d. cuttings at 2s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What is that you call blacking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew it me - is it not liquorice? - A. Yes, for ought I know; here is a piece that is not liquorice.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that this is a piece of liquorice? - A. I have not tried it; here is a little bit of blacking that is not liquorice.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been at the apprehension of a person for colouring silver before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Scowering-paper is used in cleaning irons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you been in the army? - A. Yes; I gave evidence on Governor Wall's trial.</p>
               <p>- POWELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. - I am clerk to the Solicitor for the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen the things that are produced? - A. Yes, they are such as are used by persons who counterfeit the coin.</p>
               <p>Q.Will that liquid, if there is a particle of silver in the metal to which it is applied, produce the silver on the outside of the metal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that by actual experiment which you yourself have made? - A. Yes, out of this very liquid I made the experiment; the officer, Blackman, delivered to me one of the counterfeit shillings, which was then finished fit for circulation, and found on John Bryan. In order to satisfy myself that the aqua fortis would produce the effect on this particular blank, I took all the silver from it entirely, and reduced it to the same state it had originally been in as a base metal blank; I had some of the liquid out of the bottle delivered to me by the same officer; I then applied such materials as are found, by robbing it with the sand-paper and the cork; I then made use of the aqua fortis; I put the aqua fortis into a cup, but knowing it would be too strong of itself, I lowered it by adding a little water, which is always done when it is used; I then put the blank in, and it produced the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you had taken all the silver from it? - A. Yes, all the silver on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. It produced what? - A. The colour of silver again.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only taken the silver from the surface, but there was silver in it? - A.Certainly; it was a composition of base metal and silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you destroy the colour of silver? - A. By taking it off compleatly with the sandpaper.</p>
               <p>Q.Rubbing with sand-paper made it rub off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you make it smooth again? - A. By rubbing it with cork.</p>
               <p>Q.Then putting it into the liquor produced the colour of silver again? - A. Yes; at first when I took it out it was black, and it was necessary to clean it with salt; there is salt among the things found coming out of the pickle; it has a blackish appearance, and rubbing it with salt cleans it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was found on John Bryan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When cleaned with salt it appears very clean indeed, and glaringly white? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing there that reduces that glaring white? - A. No; here is a pair of plyers; these may be used in holding the blank while the operation is performed of rubbing it with the sandpaper and cork, which is preparative to its being coloured; here is sand-paper, which is of a peculiar sort used by those who counterfeit the coin; part appears to have been used, the other not.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a piece of blacking, what is the use of that? - A. I don't think that is used in that case; it is very dry, it has been kept a long while, I cannot form an opinion of it; here is a piece of cork that appears to have been used a long while; here is the salt I mentioned; here is the liquid that produced the colour; here are some stamps used by persons in coining; there are the letters D P A upon them; these sort of marks are often<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250022"></xptr>put by persons on good money, which gives a kind of credit to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the money found on the man, is any of that money marked with either of those stamps? - A. Here is one with D and P (compares them); the D corresponds and the P corresponds. I am now looking at what was found on the woman; here is one piece with a P, which corresponds with the stamp; here is another with an A and a D, found upon the woman.</p>

               <p>Q.The pieces of coin found upon the man and the woman, do they all appear to be coloured blanks? - A. Those found on the woman are coloured blanks.</p>
               <p>Q.Do they appear ever to have been in circulation? - A.They do not appear to have been in circulation; here are four in particular I think have not been in circulation; they are coloured blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see among the things found sufficient for a person possessing blanks, to produce the colour of silver, and make them appear good shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Aqua fortis is obliged to be lowered with water? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing found in the room capable of producing the effect without alteration? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a single shilling that was found on the man fit for circulation? - A.These four in my opinion have not been in circulation, and they looked much better when I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they found on the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you mean to swear, that there is one shilling among those found on the prisoner, which would deceive a cautious person? - A. I conceive those four I have produced I could pass very well.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Knowlys, I think you should select one shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Shew any one to the Jury compleat, and fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Court. In a case of this sort it cannot be necessary for the prosecutor to say which shilling is coloured.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MENSELLING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the Moniers of his Majesty's Mint.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that shilling, is it a good shilling or not? - A. It is not; it is base metal coloured.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say, that that appears like a shilling by any outward application, or is it internally white? - A. I cannot say; it is base metal coloured.</p>
               <p>

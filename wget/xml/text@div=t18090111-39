On the 21st of December I missed some lead from the back bow of the house, about a quarter of a hundred weight. I had seen it on the house one or two days before. The prisoner had been at work at the house several days before, as a <rs id="t18090111-39-deflabel232" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>

            . Q. You are an officer of Worship street office - A. I am. On the 20th of December, about a quarter before seven in the evening, I was out on patrol duty in company with Crosswell and Valentine, and going up Hackney road we met the prisoner, he was coming towards London, he had a bag on his shoulder; I asked him what he had there; he said they were his tools and a bit of lead; I examined the bag, I found it contained nothing but lead and a bit of iron, a kind of an hold fast for a window.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the weight of the lead - A. I suppose about twenty pound or upwards. I asked him where he brought it from; he said from Mourning lane, Hackney, it belonged to a man of the name of Barnes, that worked for a bricklayer, and he was carrying it to a plumber's in Shoreditch by Barnes's order; he could not tell the plumber's name. When we got him down to the office he said what he told me before was all lies; he said he was coming out of Thomas's square, in Hackney, opposite the Nag's Head in Mare street, a young man overtook him and asked him to carry the bag as far as Shoreditch; what was in it he did not know. He was committed that night. The next day I went to Hackney, there I found Mr. Brown instead of Mr. Barnes; I saw the plumber fit it to the top of the house; it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the matter; I took the lead to carry for the person, as I was coming home; I never saw that person but that evening; he asked me to bring it on the road for him and he would give me a pot of beer. As I was returning home I met these gentlemen; they detained me with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

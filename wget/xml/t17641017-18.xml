I was in her house the 30th of September. I first went and knocked at the door; the girl said, where I had been, I might go again: then I went to the Seven Stars and Crown, and told the prisoner, that Nan would not let me in: he went along with me; she let us in: I went to bed, and hung my watch up by the mantle-piece: all the doors and windows were fast at that time; when he went out, I got up, and bolted the door after him; this was at past twelve o'clock. The next morning I missed my watch, and the window was broke. About eleven the next day, the prisoner sent for me at the Black Horse in Lemon-street, and said, Harry, how could Nan be so cruel, as to go to my mother about your watch? if you had staid two or three days, perhaps you might have heard of it.</p>

On the 30th of September, Davis and the prisoner came to me, to my mother's house; Davis and I went to bed before Chapman went away; he asked me to let him sit up in an arm-chair all night; I gave him leave; he took a chair and laid it down, and laid himself upon it: the windows and doors were all fast then: after some time, I heard him at the window; I raised my head up, and saw him take the key out of the pin of the window; I was afraid of my life, and laid myself down again; the prisoner said, Nanny, is it twelve o'clock? I said, it is half an hour after: then he went away, and Davis fastened the door after him: after that, when he was in a little dose, I heard a rustle at the window: I saw Chapman come to the bed-side, and snatch the watch, and go out at the window: my candle was out, but I always leave a good fire a-light. In the morning I went to the prisoner's mother, and brought it in with a joke: I asked her what time he came home? she said, about ten o'clock: I said, it was about half an hour after twelve when he went from my house: I said he has taken my Harry's watch: he owned to the taking the watch to me, but I have no witnesses of it.</p>

Sarah Davis depos'd that on Saturday Night 3 Men met her in the Street, one of them kissed her, and thrust his Hand down her Bosom, which she bore very patiently; then he put it up her Coats and she was still unwilling to make a Disturbance in the Street; but at last she missed her Money, and then she thought it was high time to cry out. The Watch came to her Assistance, the Prisoner was taken, and the two other Men ran away. But since the Prisoner's commitment, she had seen a Brother of his who was so very like him, that she could not distinguish them, and therefore she could not swear to the Man.

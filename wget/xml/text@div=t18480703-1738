                  </hi>. I am an officer of John Ashley Warre, Esq., Sheriff of Kent. I have employed the prisoner as possession-man—on 22nd May I Io°k possession of the property of Joseph Colin Fletcher, of 14, Bennett-Place, Trafalgar-row, Greenwich, and left the prisoner in possession on Mon<lb></lb>day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030120"></xptr>
               <p>morning, 26th June—in consequence of information, I went there with Arthur, who brought this copper tank with him—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he asked Robe if he had been out on Saturday evening—he denied it, and then said be had—I have a very imperfect recollection of the conversation—Robe left the room—Arthur followed him—afterwards he came back, and took from his waistcoat-pocket this silver spoon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) and handed it to a person who was also in possession under the bankruptcy—he had no right to have it in his pocket—I did not hear what he said to the man—Arthur took it, and took him to the station—he knew well that it was his duty to protect the; property, and not take anything—he has been a possession-man for years—he afterwards said Mr. Fletcher had given it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. The Sheriff seized my property on 22nd May—I gave the prisoner some old clothes and bottles—I cannot say whether this tank was among them—I was not aware I was not allowed to do so, and he did not tell me so—this spoon has no mark on it—I did not give it him—it is similar to mine—mine was in a cruet—I do not know whether the skillet is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine-store dealer at Trafalgar-row, Green<lb></lb>wich. On 24th June, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came and asked if I bought copper—I said, "Yes"—in about five minutes he came with this tank in a handkerchief or basket—I gave him <hi rend="italic">lad</hi>. for it, as old metal—it is not perfect—in about five or ten minutes he came again, with something in a basket, and a copper skillet; but I would not look at it, as the gas was put out, and I heard he was in possession of Mr. Fletcher's house—on the Monday morning I took the tank to the station, and then went to Morriss'.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>.) On 26th June I received this tank from Tookey—I went with Morriss to Mr. Fletcher's, and asked the prisoner if he had been out on Saturday night—he said, "Yes, over to the Lord Nelson, for some beer"—I said, "Did you go out to sell anything?"—after a little confusion, he said, yes, he had sold a sort of copper tank at a place just below—I said, "Did you go to sell anything else?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Be sure;" and in a minute or two he said he had taken a sort of stew-pan, but did not sell it—he ran into the kitchen, I followed him, he came up again, took a mustard-spoon from his waistcoat-pocket, and handed it to the other man in possession, saying, "You see to that, it belongs to the cruet's"—he got hold of one end, and" I of the other—all Mr. Fletcher's plate was of the shell pattern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. An inventory had been taken; this spoon was not included; I put it into my pocket, and kept possession of it, as it was not in the sale.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)

                  </hi>. I am game-keeper to Sir Charles Hulse, of Dagen<lb></lb>ham Reach, Essex.

On 13th or 14th Oct. last, I was at the wall where the boat was taken from, and saw the prisoner coming along on the wall—he came up to me—I said, "Halloo! young man, what are you after here? I thought you were on board of a barge"—" So I am, "he said, "but my barge is higher up; I am after this boat; lend me a hand to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it on;"'—I did so; I said, "Have you got any sculls <hi rend="italic">V</hi>—he said, "I am going to have a pair out of that house"—I then left him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer. Mr. John Samuel Martin Fonblanque lives at Twickenham—my shop is within half a mile of him—last Sunday, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was in my meadow—the two prisoners came along with a bag on their shoulder—they broke the fence down—I desired them to go back—they went back—they went, perhaps, fifty yards to the other side of the hedge, and laid their bag up in the ditch—a man was with me—he said, "I think there is something wrong"—we went and got over the hedge—just as we got over, the prisoner William came with a parcel of stuff in his hand, and dropped it one the bag to cover it over—I returned, and said I would get a policeman and examine the bag—I sent for a policeman—he did not come—I went and took the bag, and two geese were in it—when the policeman came I ordered him to go and take the two prisoners, who were on the other side of the field—this is the bag—the geese were dead, and their necks broken—I had seen Rogers in the field on the Saturday with another man.</p>

On the 25th of April, I was rubbing down the labourers, at four o'clock, and found some tobacco in the prisoner's pocket, and gave him over to my brother officer to search him; this is what I took from the prisoner - I have sealed it up, and kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.You cannot say where it came from? A. The King's warehouse; he was leaving that warehouse - there are no merchants deposit in that warehouse; it all belongs to the King: he had been in the Docks thirteen years, on and off; he has borne an excellent character, and the Company did not wish to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WALDEN. Robey gave the prisoner to me - I searched him, and found a little tobacco in his pockets - I told him to open his trousers, which he did, and I found a hard lump of tobacco tied up with yarn; he said he had been sampling tobacco in the warehouse, and that he took that off the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did he say he took it for his own purposes? A. He said he took that little bit, and thought it no harm - he bears a very good character; this tobacco itself is worth 1 1/2d. - the duty upon it will be 1s. 10 1/2d.; men are not allowed to eat any.</p>

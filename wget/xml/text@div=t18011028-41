               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see him in the month of September last? - A. I did, on Friday, the 18th of September; I made an appointment, and told him I should be out on Saturday and Sunday, but would meet him on Monday by the side of the dead wall in Lincoln's-inn-fields; I communicated it to my friends, and Mr.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had this money from your wife? - A. I asked my wife for the keys, and she took a bag with some gold in it, and told twenty guineas out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought her here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened as long ago as the 7th of November last? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never seen this man before the 7th of November? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in his company before? - A. I never was in his company in my life till this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. How early after the 7th of November, did you give any information to any body? - A. I did not give any information till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How early did you give information to any body whatever after the 7th of November? - A. I did not give any information of that particular business to any individual, till I was near going before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before that man was taken up, say any thing to any body about the business of the 7th of November? - A. No; I told them about something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them he had extorted twenty guineas from you before he was taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Parr? - A.About ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him intimately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a friend of your's, and was to accompany you? - A. He was; Mr. Parr advised me to take my nephew with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed, of course, at that time of night, a good many watch boxes, and gave no alarm to any body? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you did not communicate this particular transaction to any person, before the prisoner was taken up? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you communicate generally, that an exorbitant demand had been made upon you? - A. No, I did not in those terms; I told Mr. Parr about the rum and brandy; I said, a man had come, and got a gallon of rum, and a gallon of brandy, from me, and said, his name was Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how he got it? - A. I did; he came one morning with two stone bottles, and said, he must have a gallon of rum, and a gallon of brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give it? - A.Because I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Though you told Mr. Parr<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280041"></xptr>about a particular transaction about rum and brandy, you never told him that he had extorted twenty guineas from you last November? - A.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I kept a public-house, called the Dake's Head, in Phoenix-alley, Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor make any communication to you in September? - A. He did in January.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Lincoln's-inn-fields in September last? - A. I did, in consequence of his calling on me the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the morning did you go? - A. About eight o'clock; I saw the prisoner there at half past eight, under the dead wall, at the fourth post from the watch-box; he stood up for some little time with his arms across, looking backwards and forwards; I was sitting in the Star public-house, waiting for Mr. Spencer and his nephew to come; I saw him there till the clock struck nine; then he pulled his watch out of his pocket, got up, and went through Great Turnstile, into Holborn; I followed him, and met Mr. Spencer and his nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any thing that had passed between you and him, apprehend the prisoner? - A. We met him plump, and took him by the collar in Holborn, opposite Mr. Corbyn's, the chemist's shop; we took him to the Star public-house, and from thence to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to say any thing to you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be worse for him? - A. No; he asked liberty to go to a place to evacuate; I told him if he did, I would go with him; I got a candle, and went down with him; says he, I wish you would take me to any place than to Bow-street, and I will give you forty guineas, if you won't take me to Bow-street; do you want to get me hanged instead of you, says I, what do you mean by offering me forty pounds, I will do no such thing; he said, that is more than I have had of Mr. Spencer; I did not know, says I, that you had had any money; he said, I had better let him go, why should I be so anxious to take his life away, that I must look very sharp to get the blood money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You and Mr. Spencer have been old acquaintances? - A. About ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I have seen him five or six years back frequently; he was a soldier when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was intimate with the prosecutor, was not he? - A. Not that I know of; I have seen the prisoner several times, but the last time I saw him before I took him into custody was, as they were going up Holborn, in January; I did not see him with Mr. Spencer but that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How often, in the course of the year, had you seen Mr. Spencer and the prisoner together? -- A. Never, but in January, when I saw them going up Holborn together; that was the only time till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not seen them together before that? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation about the forty guineas, somebody else heard, I suppose? - A. I don't know, it was in the cellar; there was nobody there but the prisoner and me.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner said, he would give you forty guineas, if you would not take him to Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not practised as an attorney once on a time? - A.Never.</p>

               <p>Q. They tell me, you are a bit of a lawyer? - A. They tell you wrong then.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Every word Mr. Parr has said, is false; I never mentioned a word, that he has mentioned, to him, either in the cellar, or any where else; when he said, I was his prisoner, I asked him by what authority; I said, I was not afraid to go, for I was innocent of what was laid to my charge; he went with me into the cellar, and asked me whether I had not better go away; I said, I would not, for I was innocent; I have a wife and family, who, I hope, you will think of; the Bow-street officers, after I was in custody, went and took fifteen guineas out of my box, and a watch, with a gold chain and seal, which I bought in Oxford-street.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About four o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of January I went to Jones-court, and heard some conversation in a lower room; I heard the prisoner very much pressing the man to go to bed - he refused; I then heard him ask for money, which she denied having, and she asked him to give her some gin- he refused; she then said if he would not treat her she would him - she then came out; I went in, and asked if he had been robbed; he said Yes, of 2l. 8s. - I saw the serjeant coming along; I left him with the prosecutor, while I went to look for the prisoner - I found her in High-street, with another woman, who had lent her her bonnet and shawl; when I got back the serjeant said he had found a sovereign on the prosecutor, and 1l. 8s. 6d. was found in the prisoner's hand, in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles', and 2s. 6d., and 2d. in copper, was found in her pocket - the prosecutor and the serjeant were there at the time; that was the second time I went to look for her - I had heard her ask him for money in the room; I heard him ask her to return what she had taken from him- when the prosecutor accused her of taking this money from his pocket she said it was a button, and then at the station-house she said a gentleman gave it her in Bedford-square; she then told another story.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. I went to the room in Jones-court; I found the prosecutor there, who said he had lost 2l. 18s. - I found on him one sovereign, and three or four pennyworth of half-pence.</p>

I live at No. 34, Strutton-ground, Westminster; my husband does not behave well to me, and he had cut my head - I had been out with some friends; I met the prosecutor, who took me to have some gin - there were two more women with me, one of whom took me to her lodging.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN. I think I did not have any gin with her; I know by the time I left my friends, I had not time to go to any house with her; there was another woman in the house, but she was not there the whole time - I was in her company about a quarter of an hour; I have no recollection of being in any other place with her.</p>

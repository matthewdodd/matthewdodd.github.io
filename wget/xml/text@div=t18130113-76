               <p>Q. When did you lose this cotton - A. On Saturday, the 19th of December, as my wife was looking over the prisoner's bed, she felt something hard; she put her hand in, and pulled out this cotton. The prisoner is my <rs id="t18130113-76-deflabel451" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 19th of December, the prosecutor came to the office to fetch me. I went with him into his workshop. A man was on his work-board. The master said, his apprentice had robbed him of some callico. I asked the prisoner, where it was. He went to the bed, and took it out from between the tick and the feathers. He had cut it off a piece of between thirty and forty yards. His master took the piece out of the drawer. It matched exactly.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

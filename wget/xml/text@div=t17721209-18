               <p>- Chaplain. I am a constable: the 10th of November, at two in the morning, there was an alarm of the watch, and I found the prisoners and another in custody of the watchman; he had a parcel of fowls he had taken from the prisoners. The youngest was admitted an evidence, and he went and shewed where they got the fowls.</p>
               <p>- Cartwright. I am a watchman; I saw five lads by the Barley-mow door; I stopped them; the youngest had something under his coat; I let them go into the house, and then ordered the landlord to keep them while I got assistance; I went and got another watchman, who found three or four ducks in the bag on Dale.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Gibs, a jewellers; in Bunhill-row; Trusty was my school-fellow; I met these lads; we had been to see the Lord Mayor's show; it was too late to go home; we were going to walk till morning; Henley and Dale took the fowls, and we went down the field and saw some ducks in the water; we drove them out and run them down.</p>
               <p>Dale said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Henley said he knew nothing of the ducks, and that he was locked out that at night. He called three witnesses to his character, who said that he had worked for Mr. Crouch; is nineteen years of age, and they never knew any harm of him.</p>
               <p>Trusty said, that he, Brookfield, and Weakley, were innocent of the fact; that they were met by the other two and asked to contribute to the expence of dressing them the next day. He called five witnesses, that had known him a great while, who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Brookfield said he was not at the taking of the fowls; that he met the rest of the prisoners, at the Barley-mow. He called his father, who said while he was gone to his club, he went out; that he never used to stay out: that he never heard any imputation on his character before.</p>

               <p>How had the prisoner got into your house? - He lifted up the sash; when I awaked, the sash was up, and he in the house.</p>
               <p>Was the sash down at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any fastening? - No fastening, but the sash was down in its place, and a curtain before it in the inside, the curtain was drawn almost back.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the sash was down the night before? - I am sure it was, for I had only two children at home with me, and they were in bed, I was the last up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the sash was up when I went to the place, or whether it was down? - I am sure the sash was down and the curtain before it, for I did it myself.</p>

               <p>I am sometimes afflicted with lunacy, I have been so for a series of years, and when I get a drop of liquor, I have no recollection of any thing that I do; it was at that unfortunate time that I committed this rash act, I thought the house was uninhabited, it had the appearance of one; when I took this box up, I thought it was a box containing of tobacco, and I never opened it till after it was delivered to that man; I have been in Bethlem, and at St. Luke's, and in private mad-houses, and all will not do; it comes at intervals upon me, like the flux and reflux of the tide; I subpoened Mr. Gosner, the apothecary of Bethlem Hospital, and one Johnson of the Bolt and Ton, in Fleet-street, and Mr. Coleman, the surgeon, that lives below Exeter-change, and Mr. Thwaites.</p>
               <p>- GOSNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apothecary at Bethlem-hospital, I know the prisoner well, about six or seven years ago he was sent to Bethlem by the Commissioners of sick and hurt seamen, as insane, and was in a state of insanity for some time, but got well; he was there to the best of my recollection seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Have you known any thing of him since that time? - About two months since he called upon me, and appeared in great distress, in a sailor's jacket.</p>
               <p>What did you judge of his condition of mind about that time? - I had about ten minutes conversation with him, he appeared in his perfect senses then; he appeared in great distress, and wanted me to recommend him to any apothecary.</p>
               <p>Do you know enough of his case to know whether it was of a kind to be subject to a relapse? - Most of those cases are subject to relapses, we frequently have them over and over again.</p>
               <p>A little drink would bring on the disorder? - Very suddenly, I believe the first occasion of the disorder was from that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a navy surgeon, I have known the prisoner about seven years; about five months after I first became acquainted with him, he was seized with insanity on board the Salisbury, it continued three months; then I sent him to Yorkshire: I knew him at Gibralter again, he was then a soldier, I got him discharged, and he was appointed my second mate.</p>
               <p>When did you come home? - In May 1783.</p>
               <p>Did he come home with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What has been the state of his mind since? - He went into the country soon after; I saw him once since he came to London this time.</p>
               <p>What have you understood of his condition of mind since he came home? - I always understood, that whenever he got any liquor, he was insane for twenty-four hours at least.</p>
               <p>Independent of his madness, what was his character? - His character was always honest.</p>
               <p>By his being mate under you, I suppose you had some opinion of him? - I had, otherwise I should not have received him.</p>
               <p>He has no skill, I suppose? - Yes, Sir, as a dresser I can trust him very well, not anything further.</p>

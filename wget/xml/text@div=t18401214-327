                  </hi>. I live in Coleman-street. At a quarter-past nine o'clock, on the 29th of November, I was in Holborn—when I got into Red Lion-street, I had hold of my brother's arm, and while making space for a female to pass, I observed a handkerchief flash from my brother's right side—I caught sight of the prisoner, who drew back into a door-way, but I did not see him with it in his hand—I said to my brother, "You have lost your handkerchief"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "That is the man," and he collared the prisoner, who made a desperate resistance—my brother got him from the door-way, and I picked up the handkerchief in the door-way—there was no other person there.</p>

There were two men passed by, that my brother had some suspicion of, but they did not go into the door-way—I took the handkerchief from where the prisoner's feet had been.</p>

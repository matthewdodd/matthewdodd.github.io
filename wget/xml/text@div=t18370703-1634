                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 39, White Cross<lb></lb>place, Finsbury-square. On Tuesday night, the 27th I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor at the Ship public-house, and I rather think I saw the tall prisoner (Millward) there—I saw the prosuctor leave—he was just leaving as I left—I went out directly after him—it was near twelve o'clock—he went out with the some man he was talking with—I would not positively swear, but I believe it was Millward—I did not notice any other other person—I did not notice Jones—Millward and the prosecutor went out together into Skinner-street—I saw him afterwards, walking dowen Skinner-street with a female—when I came out of the public-house the prosecutor had turned round Skinner-street, and a female was by the side of him, and I believe had hold of his arm—it appeared to me that the man he was with, who I believe was Mill ward, remained at the door—I saw him there—I stood at the door looking after the prosecutor—I staid while he walker I sup<lb></lb>pose thirty yards down the street with the girl his side—I do not know where the girl came from—she might have come to him just before I got out—I saw one or two girls inside the house, and some outside—Ray<lb></lb>mond was inside the house—it was not her that had hold of his arm—I think it was one in lighter clothes—when I had watched them for thirty yards, I went away and saw no more—he appeared to be in ifquor</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What became of the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He walked down to<lb></lb>wards Bishopsgate—my attention was attracted, seeing a respectable intan with a lot of old umbrellas, and I thought he was not in very good com<lb></lb>pany—I do not know what became of the prisoner—I did not see which way he went—I am sure two men did not go out with the proseucton—I saw but one go with him—I did not notice that Jones was there—where I got to the door Millward was at the door, at the door, and I then lost night of him.</p>
               <p>(James Bye, a Type-founder, of Ivy-lane, Hoxton, deposed to Millward's good character;—Young of Long-alley, a baker John Beeson, of Wellington-street, Stepney-green a potato-dealer; and James Sey mother Lamb-alley, Sun-street Bishogate gave Jones a good character.)</p>

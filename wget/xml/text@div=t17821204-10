               <p>Court. Where did the muslin lay? - On the counter, it is the same, I missed that piece of muslin; I brought her back and demanded the muslin of her, which she delivered up.</p>
               <p>(The muslin produced; four yards and a half.)</p>
               <p>Court. How much do you suppose it worth? - It is valued at 20 s.</p>

               <p>Court. You did not see her take it? - No my Lord I did not, I missed it after she went.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. You did not see her take it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You do not know but she might have put it up accidentally with the other muslin? - It was in the other pocket.</p>
               <p>Is not the woman big with child? - I cannot say Sir, I am no Surgeon.</p>
               <p>No, but you might answer that without being a Surgeon: you asked her name, and you told her she had got something; did not you? - She begged to be let go, I brought her back and desired her to deliver up what she had in her pocket.</p>
               <p>The muslin was along with the other things? - No Sir, it was in another pocket.</p>
               <p>Did not you press her to give it up, and say, if you have taken this muslin by mistake, it should be given up? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not your master know this woman? has not this woman been in your shop before? - I believe she has.</p>
               <p>Did she ever go out without buying? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you took the prisoner, did you find the muslin in a paper, or loose in her pocket? - Loose in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Had you shown her that piece of muslin? - I cannot say that I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Did she say that it was through mistake, when you first apprehended her? - No Sir, she did not, but whether by fright or not I cannot say, she cried immediately as soon as I brought her back.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a very good character.</p>

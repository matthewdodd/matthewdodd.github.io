On the 6th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was going through St. Martin's-court, with Kiley - I saw the three prisoners; I knew Hayes and Carey before.

As we went through St. Martin's-court, the prisoners called after her-Carr said she would have nothing to do with them, they followed her and knocked her down; when she recovered herself, she missed her handkerchief. The prisoners said they had not got it.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did you not call the people to help you-A. They only laughed at it, and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The people laughed at the row, there was a great deal of laughing between them.</p>

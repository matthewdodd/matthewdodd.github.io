             (police-constable). I took the prisoner; I asked him what made him take it; he said he was very glad he took it; he was drunk - but I think he knew what he was saying.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I recollect nothing of it till I was at Worship-street; I had removed from those buildings the day before, and having met a friend that day, had something to drink; I went by mistake to the house which I had lived in, and in coming away, I dragged down the blanket to alarm the landlady, but not to steal it.</p>

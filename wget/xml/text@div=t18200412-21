On the 15th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, two lodgers came home and gave me seven 1 l. Bank-notes to take care of. Nobody was in the house but the prisoner, and he sat by the fire and saw me lock them up in my box below stairs. It stood on a table opposite the fire-place. I went out to get some butter and left him sitting there alone. I was gone about a quarter of an hour. On my return I found the door fast. A lodger who was out came up and we got in with her key. I found my box broken open, and the prisoner and money gone. He did not return. He had broken it open with a hatchet. I have not recovered the notes - he had lodged three weeks with me. I took him in out of charity. Nobody could have come in while I was out.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. The prosecutrix informed me of the robbery next morning. The prisoner was brought to me in three weeks after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had they slept there? A. I do not know - when I opened the door, they went out at the back door into Mr. Jones' premises, who is a gardener - they were outside the door when they spoke to me - they then ran.</p>

            . I have lived all my life at Old Brentford. I know the two prisoners very well - we were all together on the night of the 2d of March, and were intoxicated - we went and got Mr. Shackell's pump - we pulled the wood work away with our hands; we took the pump to Mr. Nichols' barn, and left it there, about one o'clock in the morning; we staid there till about half-past eight, when I saw Thomas Vaughan - he asked what we wanted there - we said we had been resting; we then went out. I was taken up on the 24th of April; I had not been away from home - I had seen the prisoners once or twice afterwards, near home, but not oftener.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never were away from home, did you not think you had done any harm? A. No; I do not know which of us were taken up first. If they are convicted I expect I shall get off; I was never in any Court in my life; I was taken up once, but I did not go before a Magistrate; I cannot recollect when it was - it was within six months; I was taken before a Magistrate of Brentford - it was on suspicion of stealing a rope, but they would not take the young chap's evidence that wanted to swear our lives away; the Magistrate committed me but I was not tried; I was in prison three weeks - I do not know who took the pump up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SHACKELL re-examined. I have since exchanged the pump for another; I took it from the barn myself - I did not know it would be wanted.</p>

               <p>"I am your prisoner, it is me that has done it, take me to the watch-house" - he said,</p>
               <p>"There is the pistol, pick it up;' I picked it up, having hold of him at the same time - it laid about three or four yards from where he stood; a watchman came to my assistance - the prisoner appeared to have been drinking, but it appeared to me that he was quite sensible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How near were you to the two persons when the pistol was discharged? A. I think seven or eight yards from them - I had both the persons distinctly in my view at the time I saw the pistol discharged - I saw the flash, but did not see in whose hand it was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, for ought you know. the woman might have discharged it herself? A. That I cannot say - they were both walking together: whether she had hold of his arm I cannot say - I did not notice whether the man was reeling or not; it appeared to me that he was perfectly sensible when I spoke to him, and when he spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he spoke to you, was it as a steady and collected man; or was it in an agitated, frantic state? A. He stood perfectly straight when I took him by the collar- he did not appear the least agitated or disturbed, not at that time - I saw them for about a minute before the pistol was fired, or not quite so long. I said on the former trial I heard the man speaking, but could not hear what he said; he seemed to be in a rage.</p>
               <p>Q. After your gave your evidence the girl's deposition was read? A. Yes; she said he was very rude - that he spoke to her and seemed in anger.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long was it that you had an opportunity of seeing them, previous to the pistol being fired? A. About a minute; I do not recollect seeing anybody near them when the pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They were speaking very loud, and it appeared to you that they were in a rage? A. It did.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mary-le-bone. On the 17th of December I was in Baker-street, about a quarter-past ten o'clock - I heard a pistol fired off, went up, and found Whinnett and Knight with the prisoner in charge; Whinnett desired me to lay hold of him, and Knight to look after the woman - we took him to the watch-house; and in Baker-street we were going to search him, he said he had no arms about him, and that he hoped he had done the deed effectually - we went further on, and he said if he had another (he did not say pistol) he would serve himself the same; he laughed at the watch-house, and made a joke of the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he hoped he had done the deed effectually? A. Yes; I am certain of those words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use these words in a wild incoherent way? A. He said so in a laughing manner, not wild - he spoke loud.</p>
               <p>Q. As though he seemed to enjoy what he had done? A. Yes, and said if he had another he would have served himself the same, in a kind of laughing manner; and at the watch-house he laughed and made a joke of it, but appeared in perfect possession of his senses - he made a bravado of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said on the last trial that when you went up you heard pretty loud talking? A. There was a crowd of people round the shop talking.</p>

On the night of the 17th of December the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, charged with shooting a woman in Crawford-street; I asked what he had to say; he said that was best known to himself; I went to see him about ten minutes after that - he said nothing then; I went a second time in about a quarter of an hour, and he said he had done the deed, and inquired how his Mary was - he said she had been his ruin; he was not sober, nor was he to say drunk; he had been drinking - I received a card from him, with his address on it; I took it from him in searching him, before he was locked up.</p>

               <p>Q. When he came to the watch-house did he present the appearance of a man in an agitated, disturbed state of mind, or one who had committed such an act, and was making a bravado of it? A. No; he appeared wild - he looked like a man that was wild, and who had committed a great act - that disturbed appearance continued while he was in my view, and when I went to him in the lock-up place he appeared the same; nothing but his card and a knife was found on him; when he was brought in, I asked what he had to say for himself; he stood upright - he did not ramble about as a drunken man would - his wild appearance made me suspect he had been drinking; I attributed his wild appearance to liquor, and the act together.</p>

On Wednesday evening last I met him at ten minutes after six o'clock, at the corner of Woodstock-street and Oxford-street, at a public-house; he was there first - I staid about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, while he drank a glass of gin and water - I then went with him down Orchard-street, to Salisbury-mews; he wished me good night, and said he should go and have a pint of ale, and asked me to go with him, which I did; I went to the Bee Hive, in Crawford-street - I staid there with him till a quarter-past nine o'clock - we were in a back parlour there; he had two pints of ale and a pipe: when I left the Bee Hive I went with him to Gloucester-place, he was going to bid me good night there; he was in liquor, and I thought I would see him to Crawford-street - I did not know where he lived: we went up Baker-street, by the New-road, and back again to Gloucester-place; I stood talking with him in Gloucester-place about a quarter of an hour - it was then almost ten o'clock: we then went round into Thornton-place, and there he would have a pot of ale, at No. 4, Thornton-place - as we were coming out the watchman went"Past ten," we then went back into Crawford-street - we were talking together; I was telling him not to go into a public-house, but to go home - he said he would: he told me he lived towards the City - I told him I would go as far as Baker-street and Crawford-street; I asked him if he knew where he was - he said No, but he said he was going down Regent-street; I think he had been drinking when I first met him- when we were last in Crawford-street he could hardly walk straight; he was very wild in his behaviour: I asked him to write to me - he said be would. I was pursuading him to go home; he said he would see me back, and find his way himself - I went as far as the corner of Spring-street; I had hold of his right arm: I was outside, nearest the curb-stone, when I was shot; I said,</p>
               <p>"Lord have mercy upon me,</p>
               <p>"and I ran over to a baker's-shop - I did not see the pistol, or the person who shot me; Mr. Bushell, the surgeon, came to me at the baker's-shop, and brought me here - I did not see any other person near me when I was shot, except a watchman. When I first saw him at the play-house, he asked me if my name was Davis.

               <p>MR. GOODGER. It is the same I extracted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Many persons before myself have stood in the awful situation in which I am now placed, but, perhaps, no one in the same perplexing circumstances; for although I have the life of a fellow creature to answer for, I solemnly declare that I never had the least intention of injuring any other person than myself. I had been for some time in a very distressing and unsettled state of mind, arising out of some pecuniary disappointments and family disputes, and these matters had so unsettled my understanding, and overcome my reason, that I looked forward to an act of suicide as the only resource left me; this I had meditated for some time, and have more than once expressed my intention indirectly to some parts of my family, and this long before my unfortunate meeting with the deceased, against whom I had no sort of hostility - I never had the least dispute or difference with her, and could have no possible, or even imaginary, motive for seeking to do her the least injury, and much less to deprive her of life, in so shocking a manner. I came to town with an intention of using the pistol against myself, and endeavoured to borrow from intoxication the resolution necessary for effecting my purpose. Of the fatal transaction I have no recollection whatever: my memory sunk under the influence of the excess of liquor I had drunk, and I do not remember any thing of the occurrence; but I am certain that I could not have meant to destroy the deceased - I must have intended to have carried my original intention against myself into effect, and not to have destroyed an innocent and unoffending person. The deceased herself, in her deposition, bears me out in the statement, that no dispute or angry words had ever occurred between as- all had been in perfect good humour up to, and even at the very moment, when the pistol was so fatally discharged; and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150085"></xptr>may hope, perhaps, not to be considered so lost to every thing human, as, without any sort of provocation, to have committed so dreadful an offence. Tired of life as I have been, and awfully situated as I now am, I resign myself into your hands, with the most implicit reliance on your justice and humanity - only troubling you further, with assuring you of the deep and endless regret which I must ever feel, while any sense remains to me, at having been, though quite unconsciously, the means of terminating the existence of the unhappy victim of my lamentable frenzy.</p>

            . I am a journey man tailor, and live in Upper Rosamond-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner upwards of two years; he was a very steady young man, industrious, and well behaved; his conduct has not undergone any change till within these last two or three months: he has since that seemed very curious in his talk and manner to what he has been before - his mind has appeared affected for within a month of this transaction; from the conduct he has evinced for the last two or three months, I think his mind is subject to occasional fits of derangement; I dined with him on the day this accident happened - he was very curious in his manner, and made a dreadful noise; he did not appear to have the command of his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about suicide? A. He was talking once about a man who shot himself going into Regent's-park; the newspapers called him a gentleman - he said he wondered, if he shot himself, whether they would call him a gentleman; he left me about five minutes past five o'clock - we had had two pints of ale, and a glass of gin and water between us; I cannot say whether he had taken any thing before dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing particular to you that afternoon? A. Yes: he forced me to take dinner with him at last; he said I had better dine with him - I refused at first; he pressed me, and said it might be the last I might eat with him - I asked why? but he gave me no answer; I did dine with him at the Mitre tavern, St. Martin's-lane, and just before dinner he made a groaning noise with his mouth; I said,</p>
               <p>"You had better not make that noise;" he said, "Oh, nousense!" I felt ashamed of him, as there were people in the room, and took very little notice of him; when he left me at five o'clock, he said he was going to his brother's, and would meet me at a quarter before nine o'clock that evening again, at the same house - I went there, but he did not come; from his conduct that day, and from what I had seen of him before, my opinion is he was not in his right mind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you conceive him incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong? A. I think he was not in a state to be trusted by himself; I said, "Shall I go with you?" be said No: I pressed him to let me go, but he would not.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. He pressed you to dine with him, you mean he invited you? Q. Yes; I suppose he paid for the dinner, but I did not see him pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do every thing as far as you saw, like a rational man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you work? A. At Mr.Burchart's, Clifford-street, Bond-street; the prisoner lived at Greenwich, but came backwards and forwards, and I have gone down there on a Sunday; I never thought of calling in a medical man to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think he could distinguish between right and wrong? A. That was on this Wednesday that I noticed it so particularly.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the most particular thing you noticed, his pressing you to dinner - did you think that an act of derangement? A. No, but the way he went on talking; he said if he could not get his bread one way, he could another - he could get it at brush-making, or could write with his right hand or left.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Before you observed this alteration, was he a man of mild humane conduct? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Mitre public-house, and have known the prisoner seven or eight months - he belongs to a society of tailors, which is held at my house; I noticed nothing particular in his conduct when I first became acquainted with him, but on the Monday that he came up from Greenwich, he had left his mother's, and came up to take his certificate from the house - he was talking to several people in the parlour, and on the Tuesday he was talking to a gentleman in the parlour, about a gentleman shooting himself in a hackney-coach; they had called him a gentlemen in the papers - he said to one of the tailors,"Do you think if I was to shoot myself, they would style me a gentleman?"</p>
               <p>Q. Was this observation made in a wild agitated manner, or calm? A. Why I think he had drunk a glass or two of ale: I thought he was in a deranged state of mind on the Wednesday - he came in between twelve and one o'clock I think; he came into the bar, as he was allowed to do, and took some bread and cheese, and had three or four glasses of ale - he went into the parlour to see the rest of the gentlemen, and had a glass of gin there; he and Pearson dined together about half-past two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of his conduct did you consider him deranged? A. He had two pints of ale, and a glass of gin and water before dinner; he came into the bar again about five o'clock, and asked me for a bundle - he untied it, took out a pair of shoes and said, "I am going to give these to my brother, but suppose I shall get up thanks for them;" I said, "You are talking strange to-day, what is the matter with you?" he said he was lost - he should not be lost neither, for he had three or four trades to his hand; my wife said he was tipsy - I said No he was not; I asked what trade he was before - he said he was a clerk, a tailor, a brushmaker, and a packing case maker - that he had travelled to Old Ford, and if he travelled as he had done, he could get his living.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From this you judge he was insane? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was this said in a calm manner? A. He was walking backwards and forwards in the bar, and appeared to be strange.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he pay for his dinner? A. No - I thought nothing of that; he never ran a score with me, but made it a rule to come to the bar and pay me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother: I have lately discovered a difference in his conduct and habits on Friday, the 12th of December, he called on me, and appeared very wild; that was the first time I had seen him for six months - he then appeared much agitated, and told me I was not to be surprised to hear of his death, for he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150086"></xptr>certainly should make away with himself; I do not recollect his saying any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all this appear like a calm and collected man, or as if he did not know what he was about? A. He had been walking about the room in an agitated state, and saying nothing, then turned round, and said, "Richard, you must not be surprised to hear of my death, for I certainly think I shall put an end to myself?"</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his intellects about him then? A.He had; I did not think him insane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What steps did you take to prevent his making away with himself? A. I did not take any steps; I did not take much notice of it - his character was very good, from what I have had an opportunity of observing.</p>

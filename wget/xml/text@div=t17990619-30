On the 11th of June he went into an apartment called a stove, a place where he had no business; I did not find him there; he was leaving off work about seven o'clock at night, and having a suspicion he had sugar concealed about him, I called him into the accompting-house, and challenged him with it; he confessed he had got some; I did not tell him it would be better to confess, or worse if he did not. I called a man into the accompting-house, and the prisoner pulled it out of his breeches himself in a bag, containing two pounds three quarters; he told me it was the first time he ever did such a thing, and he would take care it should be the last, and begged forgiveness.</p>

               <p>"Don't kill the woman." I was in front of him; I gave him a little push, to separate them. He directly cried out for the fork, and ran in and fetched it; he was gone about a minute. I stood in the yard, not thinking he was going to stick me with it. He came out, and stuck me right in the face, and knocked me back some distance with it; he pushed it right into my face. One of the prongs ran in just under my eye, and went up into my brain, and the other prong went by the side of my head; it knocked me backwards against some palings. I followed him into his mother's house after the fork was taken from him. I struck at him, but did not hit him; I became insensible, and cannot say what passed. The stab gave me great pain; it went right into my brain. I was confined to my bed three weeks and three days, and was in great pain. I can see very little with the eye now; I cannot work now, for my head is bad.</p>

I heard it sound as if it penetrated into the head; it pushed him backwards against some paling. Edwards held his hands up, as if to save himself from farther harm, as the prisoner had drawn the fork out of him. Adams's brother came up, and tried to get the fork out of his hand, and in the scuffle the brother cried out that he was stabbed. I then made my way into the house, pushed his brother aside, and took the fork from him; I took it into Hockett's, and left it in care of his daughter. I saw

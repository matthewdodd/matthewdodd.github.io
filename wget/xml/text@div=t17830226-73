               <p>Your bed? - Aye, my feather-bed, and an old pocket, charged an halfpenny; I never saw the prisoner before this day se'nnight, when she was taken: I lost my things this day se'nnight about half after two in the morning, the watchman came and told me.</p>
               <p>Have you got your things again? - No, they are there. The mischance happened in my house, I did not lay there, the window was not bolted: I know the bed to be mine, the pocket and thimble belonged to a woman that hanged herself in my room: the prisoner had thrown down the bed, there is the dirt on it now, and the petticoats I took out of her apron, and the pocket that man took out of her pocket; the petticoat and pocket laid in my room.</p>

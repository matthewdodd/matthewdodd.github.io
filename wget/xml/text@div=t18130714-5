On Friday the 25th of June the prisoner was in the cellar, which is a warehouse. I went and called him out rather in haste. I perceived him put a small key in his pocket. On Saturday evening I made a search; I searched a little box in the cellar. I saw sundry articles in the box; I did not proceed any further, as my employers were not at home. On Sunday the 27th I opened this box in the cellar, and found a pair of silk stockings. No one was with me. After that Slade and me opened his box up stairs. I found in that a number of articles, and three pair of new silk stockings. These are them. I know the silk stockings; they have our private mark upon them. In his jacket pocket I found a few buttons. I know they were the prisoner's boxes; I have seen him lock and unlock them. The prisoner had the keys of both the boxes about him. This is the paper that the stockings were in. They were in our shop September the 4th, 1812. The stockings are new they have not been worn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Chamber House Farm, Thatcham, Berks, the property of Mr. Tull—on Thursday, 18th October, about 12.25, I saw the prisoner run from the house that was burnt; it was a place built for weaning calves, a wooden shed with a thatch—the prisoner went round into the stable where I was; he and the boy, John Rodd, were together—Rodd is younger than the prisoner—about 10 minutes afterwards I looked out of the stable and saw smoke over the building across the farm-yard—I ran round to see what it was, and found the calves' house all on fire—I then ran back to alarm some one—I can't say whether there was any one else there at the time except the two boys, after I gave the alarm there was—I was about 78 yards from the place when I first saw the fire—the prisoner and Rodd had just come out, they were both running together—they came out of the shed where the fire was—they came and asked me what time it was—other persons might have gone to the shed between the time of the prisoner coming to me and my seeing the fire.</p>

I am a domestic servant at Chamber House Farm—on the morning of 18th October the prisoner came tome about a little past 8 o'clock, and asked mo for some matches to make a fire in the chimney—the chimney is in a cottage on the farm used for agricultural purposes—I gave him some matches and he went away—he was in my master's service—no other boy came with him.</p>

I am a member of the Berkshire constabulary—on 18th October last, between five and six in the evening, in consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation, I saw the prisoner—I asked him to show me where the fire had been—he took me and showed me—I asked him if he knew who did it he said "I did not do it, it was Rodd; I dropped a lucifer in the road, Rodd picked it up, and said 'Let us go and set the shed on fire, it will make a job for the carpenters'"—I then took the prisoner to George farm, Cookham, where Rodd lived—I found Rodd and charged him in the prisoner's presence with setting the shed on fire—he said "I know nothing about it"—I told him what the prisoner had told me—he said "I did not do it, it was Sims; he went to the servant girl at Chamber House farm, and got part of a box of</p>

               <p>matches, and he came to me and said 'Let us go and make a fire in the shed;' I went with him and saw him set make on fire"—Sims did not deny anything that Rodd said; he said nothing—he only said "I threw the box in the fire and burnt it"—I then took him into custody—I took both of them.</p>

I am assistant bailiff to Mr. Tull—on 18th Octo-ber last I saw the shed a little before 11, it was all right then—I re<lb></lb>turned in the afternoon at a little past three, I then found it burnt down—the prisoner was employed as a cow-boy—it was part of his duty to lifter up the shed—I have known him some time, he has been a very good boy.</p>

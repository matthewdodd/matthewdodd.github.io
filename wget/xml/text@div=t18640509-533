                  </hi>. I am assistant to Arthur Kay, and others, ware-housemen, of Old Change—I saw the prisoner there on 4th May, about 1 o'clock in the day, he was soldering down cases; he was employed for that purpose—he did not belong to the establishment—he was at work in the same part of the warehouse that I was—there was some flannel kept there, in a fixture, a place reserved especially for piece goods—they are piled one on the other on the floor, in an aperture on purpose—he would have access to those goods—I cannot distinctly state the time he left the premises—I went to dinner about a quarter to 3—I was told he was there then—I did not see him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There are three Mr. Kays in the firm, are there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and Mr. Evans—I was not there with the prisoner all the time—there are several persons in the employment, all engaged in different parts of the warehouse—this is common flannel, which is used in the trade for shirting—I last saw the prisoner about 1; he might have left shortly after 1.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City detective officer—about twenty minutes past 3 on the afternoon of 4th May, I saw the prisoner in St. Mary Axe, with a dealer whom I knew—I saw them turn up a narrow court, called Brown's-buildings—at that time the prisoner was carrying a bundle—I fol-lowed just behind them up the court, and saw them turn into a recess, where the court suddenly gets wider—I stepped back into a doorway; just as I did so, two females, also dealers, went up to them, and the man dealer pushed them away, with an oath, and said, "You don't want to buy stolen goods"—the females thereupon left, and so did the prisoner—I was in private clothes at the time as I am now—the dealer followed the prisoner up the court through into Bury-street—I followed them up to the top of Bury-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090043"></xptr>
               <p>when the dealer turned round and saw me coming—he immediately leant on a post as though nothing had occurred, and the prisoner went on into Castle-street, Houndsditch, still carrying the bundle—I followed and stopped him—I told him I was an officer, and said, "What have you in that bundle?" he said, "I do not know what it is"—I said, "Where did you get it?" he said, "I picked it up"—I said, "Where?" he said, "In Cannon-street"—I said, "How long since?" he said, "About a quarter of an hour"—I said, "Your explanation is unsatisfactory to me, you must come with me to the station"—on our way there I said, "When you picked it up, was it in the same state it is now?" he said, "This is my handkerchief that is round it, when I picked it up there was nothing round it"—on our arrival at the station I examined the contents of the bundle; it contained this piece of woollen cloth; this ticket was on it at the time; "191/2 cut "is written on it in pencil, and it bears the number "9998," and at the bottom "483/4 yards" in ink—I asked the prisoner where he worked, and he said he had been employed at Arthur Kay and Evans's, in Cannon-street, up to 3 o'clock that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you were before the Magistrate did you remember that about his working till 3 o'clock, at Kay's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes, and I spoke of it—Brown's-buildings leads from St. Mary Axe to Bury-street—I saw the dealer pull open the handkerchief, and look at part of this stuff—the prisoner gave me a correct address, and said also that he had been soldering cases for Arthur Kay and Evans, which I found was correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Arthur Kay, the prosecutor—these woolen goods correspond with goods we have in our establishment—I know the number of this ticket; that corresponds—I have the duplicate numbers entered in my stock book—I have the books here—I have it entered here in my own writing (<hi rend="italic">Referring to the book.</hi>)—it is the manufacturer's number—the number on the ticket corresponds with that in the book—that enables me to say that this is the property of my employer, with the length that has been cut off—I have an order here from one of our travellers for part of this piece, and the portion sent to him added to this makes up the proper number of yards—this piece is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi> or 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know of your own knowledge apart from that book, whether any goods were sent of this kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; I was present when it was cut off, entered, and sent—191/2 yards were cut off—they were sent to a customer of ours—this is the order copied from the traveller's sheet—I saw 191/2 yards cut off, and sent out of our place—there are about 30 yards altogether—I have not measured it—probably any other tradesman who received goods of this character from the same manufacturer would have the same mark on his goods—the 191/2 was written by a young man named Cale, who has left us about ten days or a fortnight—the 483/4 is the manu-facturer's writing—I know nothing of the prisoner's character at all—I have no doubt whatever that this flannel is the property of Mr. Arthur Kay.</p>

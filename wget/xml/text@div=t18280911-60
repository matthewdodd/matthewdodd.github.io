On the 29th of August, I saw the prisoner by the Peterborough coach, which stood near the inn yard - I saw him open the coach door, take the parcel out of the pocket, put it under his arm, and run down Holborn; I followed, and took him in Fleet-market - he offered me the parcel, and begged forgiveness; I gave him in charge- I never saw him before.</p>

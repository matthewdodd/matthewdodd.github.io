                  </hi>. I am superintendent at the wharf of Messrs.

Saunders"—here is "Groves' van" in my writing—it-was originally "cart," and I altered it to "van"—I was present when the barrels were delivered, both in the morning and in the afternoon—I counted them both in the vans after they were delivered—Wood, I believe, is the man who presented the order for the last fifteen barrels, and signed the receipt for them—on that occasion Wood's van was mentioned, and he signed, "H.

COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Wood was taken up on this charge at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We went there to make inquiries, and accompanied him to the station—after the ease had been heard before the Magistrate, Bryan was made a witness, and was suffered to go at large—before he gave evidence I visited him in his cell—I did not tell him it was a pity he should be the innocent tool of a fellow of the name of Spain, who I knew to be a great scoundrel—I might have mentioned Spain to him; but I did not know him to be a scoundrel—I said I believed Spain was the head and front of the matter, and had got them into trouble—I tried to get from him all the information I could, in order to pursue and get Spain into custody—I have been trying part of the time to get hold of Spain—I do not know what Spain is—I believe he lived in London—I looked for him in a good many places—I do not know that he has left the country since this—I don't know where he is; we have been seeking for him—I went to Bryan's wife, and with her I tried to seek for Spain—I searched for some days—Bryan was not at liberty a moment; he was taken again immediately upon another charge—I don't know that Bryan is a plumber and glazier by trade; he was working as a painter—I did not see him working—I saw him in a yard in Bishopsgate-street.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went to Day's and took him into custody, it was five mouths after the affair, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not remember his telling me that when he made purchases for ready money, he did not make entries in his books; if he did say so, I did not hear him.</p>

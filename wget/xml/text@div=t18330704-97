I took the prisoner on the other charge, and as I was bringing him and the other prisoners up to Newgate, I saw Smith had a shirt on, made of a coarse sort of cloth; I had heard of this loss, and I sent word to Mr. Walker that if he would send me a piece of his cloth, I should be able to find the rest; he sent me a piece of Tuesday - and on Wednesday I went to Smith's house with a search-warrant, and found this cloth, (which is all in pieces) concealed between the bed and sacking - Smith's wife was at home.</p>

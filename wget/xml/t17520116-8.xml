            . On the 13th of Dec. my servant got up about four o'clock, and came and told me he missed a side of bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the prisoner up for it ?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Because he had robbed me several times before; I charged an officer with him. After I charged him with taking it, he told me where it was; and he also owned it before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your bacon again ?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160007"></xptr>Freeman. It is here; it is a particular side of bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. How particular?</p>
               <p>Freeman. It is an old sow side; if you please to send it to be weighed, it weighs eight stone all but a pound. It was sold by one Mr. Larum, but it was not delivered; I had received the money for it, and after it was stole, I was obliged to return the money again.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last ?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I had seen it the day before it was lost in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner your servant?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I took him in out of the streets, and he was such a drunken fellow I was forced to part with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he your servant at the time you lost the bacon ?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No, my Lord, he was not.</p>

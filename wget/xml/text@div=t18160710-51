I called out for assistance, and it happened that there was no watchmen convenient, or any person by; Mr. Cavenagh came from the public-house, and siezed one of them; he seized Healey; he took him to the watchhouse. I neither got my coat, hat, nor money, again. I had observed that Healey was one of those that pushed me. I pointed him out. I can take upon myself to say, I saw Hickey run away from behind me; he helped to take my coat off, and ran away. I was a little tipsey, not much. I had never seen Hickey or Hesley before. I saw Hickey in the watchhouse when I went there, the same night; he was brought to the watchhouse before I got there. I did not see him that night; but I saw him the next morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Hickney. Q Did I take the coat forcibley from you - A. Yes, you are a person who helped to take it off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Hickey. Q. I will ask the witness if I spoke a word to him - A. Yes; he insulted me, and he shoved me about, and wanted me to fight him in the street; I did not fight with him.</p>

            . I rushed out with my rattle in my hand, and sprung it. I saw seme men in the street; I saw Morris, Healey, and Gardner there; I saw four, five, or six more about him; he was calling out. I did not see what any of the men did to him; he had his coat and hat off when I came out. I saw Healey; he was not near Gardener; he was about four yards from him; he was squaring at Gardener at the time, and I asked Gardener who took his coat, and he told me, that they stripped him of his coat and hat. I said who, and he pointed out Haley, as one of the party who hustled him. He did not mention his money at that time. I siezed Healey, and called watch, and the watchman came up, only one watchman came, and I delivered Haley into his charge, and sent him to the watchhouse. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100026"></xptr>did not see any thing of Hickey. I followed him to where I was told he went into; I found him there; it was in a cook's shop, about forty yards from the house where I live. With the assistance of a watchman I took him to the watchhouse; not the first watchman that I sent Healey by. I saw no coat with Healey; he had not a coat. I returned with my rattle the second time. I first went out without a rattle and siezed Healey, and finding he had not the coat, I let him go. Then I took hold of another man, and finding he had not got the coat, I returned to the man who was pointed out to me. Healey was squaring the second time, and not the first.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Cavenagh. I remember Gardener being at our house; he was rather in liquor. I heard no noise until I went to put up the shutters, at a little after eleven o'clock; it was about ten minutes after Gardener had left the house; I heard a man sing out in the street for assistance; it was this young man Gardener; I saw a great number of men about him. I ran, and told my master; he jumped out with the rattle; I went after him. I saw one of the prisoners run down the street with a coat in his hand; I ran after him; I saw him go into the cook's shop; he then had the coat under his arm; I did not follow him into the shop, but I stood at the door; I called for a watchman, and a watchman came in the course of five minutes, and then I went up to my master, and told him where the man was that took the coat. I staid at the door a little white; but not until the watchman came up. My master came, and we met the watchman, and then went to the cook's shop, and searched the house, and found the prisoner Hickey pretending to be asleep up on the garret stairs, with his clothes on. We did not find the coat. We took him into custody, and gave him in charge of a watchman. I am sure he is the man who ran down the street with the coat. I saw nothing of Healey.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Hickey. Q. Did you see me take the coat from Gardener's person - A. No. I was within a yard of him when he started with the coat, and I am sure of it.</p>

            . I am a watchman; but was not on duty that night. I was standing next door to the cook's shop, and saw Hickey run past with a coat in his arms; he went into the cook's shop with it; I did not follow him. What became of him and the coat, I don't know.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Hickey. Q. Was it a coat, a bundle, or what - A. it was a coat; it hung on his arm; I saw it was a coat by the flaps of it.</p>

               <p>Hickey's Defence. I went to this gentleman's house to have a pint of beer, and when I was returing, I saw the prosecutor in a row with a parcel of men, and he pulled his coat off to fight, and he gave it away to a person, and he ran away with it. When I went home, the door was fast, and so I laid down on the stairs, and some time after I had been asleep, the watchman and Mr. Cavenagh came, and awakened me; and I told them I had no coat and hat, and the house was searched, and they were not found, and I had no place to put them.</p>

               <p>Healey's Defence. I was at Mr. Cavenagh's house, and by the same score I owed Mr. Cavenagh two-pence halfpenny, which I paid him, and after that, I and this other young man went out together, and saw this man, the prosecutor, and I saw a man with a coat in his arms; but I know nothing at all about it; I am paite innocent of it.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was Gardener putting himself in a position to fight - A. No; he did not appear like a man who was fighting at all. When the prosecutor accused Healey of having robbed him, Healey squared at him.</p>

               <p>James Gardener. Re-examined. The coat was pulled off me; I did not pull it off to fight; I did not put myself in any position to fight, nor any thing of the kind.</p>

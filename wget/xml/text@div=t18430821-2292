               <p>February last I had an execution against Henry Baker—I lodged it against him on the 15th of June—about a quarter before eleven o'clock on that day I went to Wbitecross-street prison, in consequence of a message that he had been arrested—I saw the prisoner there—I made a communication to him—he caught me at the back of my collar, struck me on the head, and seized my watch-guard and watch, which was in my pocket—he did not get the watch from me—I struggled with him, and struck him under the chin—he immedi<lb></lb>ately seized my hat—my handkerchief was in it, and it fell on the ground—he seized it, and pressed it in his bosom as it was falling down—the gloves were with it—the pocket-book was in my right hand coat pocket—he spoke to a person on the staircase, who knocked me on my head, and another came with a bowl of sawdust and rubbed it in my face—they pulled me into the ward—I am sure the handkerchief was put into the prisoner's bosom—the other men did not attack me till after he took the handkerchief—I saw the pocket-book about an hour after—I have never seen my handkerchief or gloves since.</p>

I would not lodge it—no money was named—I first saw him in No. 8 ward, about four seats from the fire-place—I was informed that there were two Bakers in the ward—I went to the inner gate, and found there were two—I asked some person to call Henry Baker—the man came out, and said, "There are two Henry Bakers"—I said, "I want the pipe-maker"—he went in, and said, "The man has hurt his leg, will you go in?"—I did not leave the detainer at the gate, because I am responsible, as I might lodge it against a wrong Henry Baker—it is necessary for me to see the person—the prisoner did not move out of the ward—I was indicted by a woman named Miles, in Totten<lb></lb>ham-place, for an assault—I was acquitted—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay the whole myself—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but she was to have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was paid to Mr. Wolfe, the clerk to Mr. Flower.</p>

                  </hi>. I and the prisoner were in No. 8 ward when the pro<lb></lb>secutor came in there—he spoke to Baker when he was going away—Baker went after him and pushed him—the prosecutor turned round, and said, "Don't be foolish"—then they hustled altogether, and went out of the ward—I saw the pocket-book close by the door in No. 8 ward on the right hand side at the top of the steward's table—I did not see it in the prisoner's possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the office of Mr. Field, the detective, and live at 20, Devereux—court, Temple—I have known the prisoner his about eighteen months—the signature to this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) looks like writing, but it is "Ryle and Co.," and not "Segers and Co.," that I am accustomed to see—I swore before under the impression that I had, but I will not now swear positively, that it is the prisoner's writing—I have seen so many persons writing that I would not swear to any one's.</p>

I am a merchant, carrying on business at Nice—I received a letter, dated 28th January, at the latter end of January—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a translation of it—I had written to the person who wrote that letter—(<hi rend="italic">This letter contained the following</hi>: "We regret to find that your price is too high; nevertheless, to prove that we are ready to enter into business with your house, we accept the following prices"—<hi rend="italic">a list of prices then followed</hi>—"at the above prices, with discount at 10 per cent, you may make us the consignment by the <hi rend="italic">Messagerie Imperial</hi>")—in consequence of that letter, I made up a package of goods, and forwarded them to London—I also sent this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the case I sent was marked "P. T. 72"—these hats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) formed part of the goods I sent in that packet—the numbers on the hats correspond with the numbers on this invoice, but some are missing now from the case—I have never been paid—I drew for the goods, and I received the bill back protested—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—this was my first transaction with Ryle and Co.—if I had known that Ryle and Co. had been in custody, I would not have sent the goods—one of these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing, and the other is in my clerk's, but signed by me.</p>

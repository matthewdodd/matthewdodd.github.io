                  </hi>. I reside at 4, Lancaster Street, Hyde Park—in 1859 I was residing partly in England, and partly in New York and New Orleans—in 1859, when I was in New York, my daughter, Emily Florence Magee, was living with me—I first became acquainted with the prisoner, I think, in December 1859—he paid his addresses to my daughter—I can't say when they were engaged, I was in England at the time—I remember the 12th December very well; my daughter was married on that day at Calvary Church, New York, by the Rev. Dr. Hawks; the marriage was performed in the ordinary manner—I heard my daughter and the prisoner agree to take each other as husband and wife—I afterwards saw them sign the register—Dr. Hawks handed me the certificate of the marriage, and said it would be good in England as well as anywhere else—I saw my daughter and the prisoner sign that; this is the certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it signed by the clergyman, not by the prisoner and my daughter, I saw them sign the register—after that the prisoner and my daughter lived together as man and wife—my daughter is still alive.</p>

               <p>and knew nothing of Mr. Eardley—I started for England about June or July, and returned to America in October—I heard of the engagement from my daughter the day I left Liverpool for New York—I think that was the 25th September—I was requested to keep the matter secret, be<lb></lb>cause Mr. Eardley was not in America, and therefore I was requested not to talk about it, and it was kept secret for some time—I am quite sure it was the register I saw signed, there were several persons present in the room—I did not ask the cleryman whether it would be good in England—it was a statement made voluntarily by him without any question being raised—since my daughter has ceased to live with Sir Culling Eardley she has lived at my house.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"10, Sackville Street, W., July 29th, 1865. I hardly know whether you will receive my letter, but, as our friend Dr. Pettigrew has communicated with you, I venture to write—he has told you that I am most anxious to be re-united with you, and I come to ask it of you. Florence, I have wronged you terribly; I have wronged you in your self-respect, and have been a selfish, bad husband to you till now; and yet I so believe in your nature that I crave and beg you to take me back. I have sinned grievously, and have no excuse. Will you forgive me? I cannot write you a composed letter; I just pour out my own feelings. My own wife, if you only knew what bitter remorse I have gone through since we parted at the London Bridge, you would at any rate pity me. Oh! by the memory of old days at Gilead Lodge, St. Leonard's, and Liver<lb></lb>pool, let me be as I was. Reproach me if you will, mistrust me, you are in your right, but take me back. As a child I come to you; lead me. My wife, I love you, indeed I love you. I long, oh! so fully, to be worthy of you. I shall work hard to increase what is left of my ill-spent fortune to make up to you as far as I can. I believe, though my relations would stand aloof from me, that I am young enough, and have enough in me, to earn a good name for you myself, that you may not be ashamed of being my wife. Will you answer me yourself, and not send my note to your lawyers? Don't, I pray, refuse me; think over it, and if you cannot love me enough to receive me again, write to me yourself to say so, but let me see your hand<lb></lb>writing again, my own, own wife. Your undeserving husband, Eardley G. C. Eardley.")</p>

               <p>on the 12th December, 1859; it was a perfectly valid marriage according to the law of New York; even if the parties had not signed the register, it would not affect the validity of the marriage at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The laws of marriage in America differ in the different States, do they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do—there is no necessity for the publication of banns in New York, nor for signing the register, nor for witnesses; you can be married anywhere—a couple meeting in the street can go and be married where they like; that is the law of matrimony in New York—it has been long established by custom that the marriage should be performed by a clergyman, of some recognised denomination, or by a Magistrate—as to the actual legal requirements, there is no statute that a marriage should be by a clergyman; a marriage before witnesses is suffi<lb></lb>cient—a marriage may be by a clergyman himself, and in the absence of a clergyman before witnesses—a marriage in New York in the Scottish form has been held to be valid, but I don't think that any marriage has taken place or been sustained in that form for some years—the only statute on the subject of persons professing different faiths, provides that a marriage solemnised in the Jewish form by a qualified Jewish priest, or in a form of any other religious denomination by a clergyman of that denomination, shall entitle the parties to register their marriage, if they chose to do so, but there is nothing at all affecting the validity—taking the case of a Pro<lb></lb>testant and a Catholic, they can be married in either faith, or by a Magis<lb></lb>trate—the marriage need not take place in both faiths.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Stephen Betts, a butcher, at Putney. The prisoner was in my service about three months—on the 31st of Aug., in consequence of some circumstances, I required to search her box—the police<lb></lb>man was sent for; and on her consenting, I went up to her box in her bed-room, and she unlocked it—I found in it two aprons belonging to my son Stephen, and a sheet cut to pieces—I have put it together to see if it would make a sheet—I can swear to it by a B which I put on it myself, and a little dot—I found a long muslin curtain, which was an apron of my daughter's, and I joined it together myself, and made a curtain—it is my own work—I found a night-shirt of my son's in the kitchen table-drawer, which I can swear to by a B that was on it—the letters have been picked out, but I can see that there has been the cotton there—I asked the prisoner how she came by the aprons—she said she had made half-a-dozen aprons for a young man, and he had given her these two—she said the curtain was her own—I said I could swear to it—she said it was hers, and she had more like it—I told her to show me one like it, and she showed me one which was clear muslin—the sheet, she said, she bought of a housemaid at Streatham, where she lived servant—I had never given her these things—she had no right or authority to have them in her box.</p>

               <p>(William Roberts, a linen-draper, in Paul-street, Finsbury, the prisoner's uncle, gave her a good character, and engaged to send for her brother to take her to her friends in the country.)</p>

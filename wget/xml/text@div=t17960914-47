               <p>Q. Not so much in liquor but he could walk, and seemed to know what he was about? - A. Yes, he seemed to know what he was about. I understood from him that there was somebody waiting for him, that requested him to come in to look at the watch for him.(The Police officer who apprehended the prisoner deposed, that the prisoner said he did not mean to steal the watch, he meant to shew it to a friend to buy it, or else to exchange; that he searched him, but second no watch upon him, only a chain with a button at the end of it; that he was very much in liquor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A friend of mine asked me to go with him to buy a watch at Mr. Wright's; we met a young woman, and he stopped talking to her, and desired me to look at one, that I should know what he wanted as well as he did; the prosecutor he shewed me a second, and I took it to the door to call the young man in, and when I came back, I had the watch in my hand, and he charged the constable with me; I had the watch in my hand, and laid it down upon the table.</p>

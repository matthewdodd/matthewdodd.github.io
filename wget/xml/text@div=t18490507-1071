                  </hi> I am a lighterman. On Sunday, 1st April, I took the prisoner as a weekly servant—next day I gave him an order for some sacks on Messrs. Lang and Shang, and gave him half a crown to get them rowed on board a barge, and I was to meet him there at three o'clock in the morning—I went, and waited till twelve—the sacks were not there, and he never came.</p>

                  </hi> I am a lighterman. On the night of 2d April I went to a public-house opposite the Victoria Theatre, and saw the prisoner—I asked him where his barge was—he said he had not got one—I said, "Are not you at work for Mr. Smith"—he said, "Yes," and Mr. Smith had sent him for some sacks—he showed me the order, and I directed him to the place, but he said he was not going that night—I left him in the New-cut—next morning I went on board my barge, and found him in the cabin—I asked if he was not going for the sacks—he said he did not like to go, because he had spent the money—he gave me the key of the barge, and told me to give it to Mr. Smith—I did so.</p>

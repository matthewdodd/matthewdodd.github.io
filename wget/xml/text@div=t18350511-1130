                  </hi>. I am a hat manufacturer, and live in Gracechurch-street, and have other partners. The prisoner was our warehouseman for eight or nine years—this book contained an alphabetical list of all our customers—it is an index—the prisoner did not keep our accounts—he was trusted with the execution of orders—we had missed the book for six months, and made very great search—we were afraid he intended to make use of it in an improper manner, or that it might fall into some hands who would make use of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the prisoner's housekeeper. He lived in St. George-street—he gave this book into my hands one Satarsday might in October, when he brought it home, and begged me to keep it, and let so one see it.</p>

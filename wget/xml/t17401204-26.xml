There were a great many Bags of Pepper in the Hold, and we came to an Agreement to take a little, so I opened the Hold Doors, and Greenwood and I went down; we took at that Time about 200 lb. Weight out of the Company's Bags; the Prisoner was at that Time keeping a Look-out on Deck, and he knew what we were about. We put the Pepper into two Bags, and got it into the Cabbin; and the Prisoner and Clowes haul'd it out on Deck. The next Night we took 130 lb. and put it into two Bags which we had of Mr. Ridout; and after we had got it on Deck, the Prisoner and Clowes handed it into the Boat to us. We carried it to Ridout's, and I saw one Bag started into his Cellar; it was carried in at his Back-Door between 9 and 10 at Night, and he paid us for it. The Prisoner did not go with us in the Boat, but came to us by Land; he was present at the paying of the Money, and receiv'd his share of it.</p>

             . I know the Prisoner very well. About the latter End of September, in the Year 39, I was boarded on the Prisoner Oliver's Hoy; and about 8 or 9 in the Evening, Burges opened the Hold Doors, and fill'd 2 Bags of Pepper; the Prisoner and I haul'd them on Deck, and help'd to put them into the Boat . I did not go with them, for I and the Prisoner went by Land. When we came to Ridout's , they had weighed the Pepper, and were casting up what it came to; I think it was 32 l . I took 5 l. for mine, and my Partners Shoes , and I saw the Prisoner and Burges take theirs . I staid there to drink part of some Punch, and then went away. The Pepper was lock'd up in the Hold, and the Keys were given to the Company ; but I believe these were private Keys with which Burges opened the Doors.</p>

               <p>Councel. What Method is taken in locking up these Goods on Board the Hoy?</p>
               <p>Mr. Day. The Commander locks up the Hatches, and the Keys are sealed up and given generally to the Husband of the Ship. This is done to prevent any one from getting at the Cargo; and the Captain of the Ship sends up an Impression of the Seal which he intends to use.</p>
               <p>Councel. Have the Company ever suffer'd by losing their Goods before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Day. Yes, they have been very great Sufferers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Foster. At the Arrival of the Ships, they lighten at Long-Reach or Erith; the Captain reports at the Custom House, and an Entry is made, that the whole Cargo may go out at once. It appears by the Register, that Greenwood and Clowes were at this Time on Board the Thomas and

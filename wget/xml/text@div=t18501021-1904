                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Water-lane, Brixton. On 10th Oct., I saw the prisoner between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I knew him before—he had been twice in my service, but he was not then—I said, "If you like to stop you can have your supper, and bed, and breakfast in the morning, and I will give you a shilling to help my foreman to kill a bullock"—he said he would—I left him so to do—I went out that evening—when I came back I was told something—I then missed two ribs of beef, half a loin of beef, three shoulders of mutton, a leg of lamb, a shoulder of lamb, and several other joints of meat—my basket was taken, and some hooks.</p>

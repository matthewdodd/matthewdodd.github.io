On the 13th of July, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I went into the front parlour; I saw the window open, and both the closet doors - I went to shut down the window, and saw the print of a man's foot on a chair under the window - I went and shut one closet door, and found every thing right - I went to the other closet, and missed the Bible from there - I gave an alarm, and in about ten minutes the officer came with the Bible.</p>

I was looking out at a window, and saw Holley walking backwarks and forwards by the prosecutor's window; my husband was in bed - I told him, and he desired me to watch; I saw the other prisoner get out of the prosecutor's window, and hand a parcel to Holley - I could not see what I was; they came by my window, and went towards London-field - I watched them till my husband got his clothes on; the prisoners were soon brought back.</p>

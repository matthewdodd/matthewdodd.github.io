                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor, and live in Hunter-street, Brunswick-square. I know the prisoner—I let him some horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—I cannot specify the day he first began to have them, but the last was on the last quarter-day—he had them about six weeks in all, before he took them away—we entered into a verbal agreement—when he came to me first he wanted four horses and two <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—I said I would let him them for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—that was agreed to—he was to pay a week in advance—he was not able to do it—he only paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then said as he could not raise the money, he might have them by paying every morning a day in advance, which would be 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day; if he did not pay that, the bar—gain was to be at an end—he paid me that money every morning for six weeks, till the 7th of April, when he made off with the property—I never sold these things to him—I never signed a receipt for 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., selling them to him—I went to Mr. Robinson's Repository on the 7th of April, and there found my three <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, four horses, and two sets of harness—I had only let him two <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, but there was another on the premises, which he took away at the same time—I did not allow him to take it away—he told me he had let it to a gentleman at 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;. a week, and he had planned for the gentleman to have it that morning, but I found it at the Repository—he also took away another horse besides the four, under pretence of putting it to grass, because he had hurt his knee—I have never found that horse since.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100083"></xptr>
               <p>same rank—another horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was let in the same way to a man named Ball—I lived on the profits—I am not in debt now, only for the widow—I have not cleared off all her debts yet—I bare been in trouble several times since I have been in London—I have been threatened to be arrested, and have had declarations and copies of writs after my goods as well as my person—I did not put away these things on that ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, had you not executions against your goods before I you made this arrangement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw it till the prisoner told me so—I never parted with my goods—there was no execution till eight or ten weeks after I came to London, and that was a false one—I was told by the prisoner, when my horses stood in Edgeware-road, that there was a countryman backwards and forwards at the stable—I had told him the situation I was placed in, and he told me this to frighten me—I was going into the country, I was afraid somebody would be there after me, and I said to the woman up stairs, "I am going into the country, these things are Hockey's," merely that nobody might interfere with them while I was gone—I have never told anybody else so—I swear that, and I only said so, that the things might be safe till I came back—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I cannot tell whose handwriting this is—it Is something like mine, but I would not swear it was my writing—I shall not say anything about it—I write different to that often—I always write one hand—I am not confident about this being my handwriting—it is something like it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another paper</hi>)—this is not my handwriting—I swear that—I would not swear to the other one, there is a difference in the hand—they are not like each other—I always spell William with two 1's—it is impossible for me to say whether I sometimes sign with one 1—I do not know the Prince Regent public-house, in Seymour-place—I know different houses there, but not their names—I was not in Seymour-place with the prisoner on the 18th of March last—I was elsewhere—wherever I was in the habit of settling any business, and wherever he paid me, he always called for pen and ink, and took a receipt for what he paid me—I might have been in a public-house in Seymour-place with the prisoner when pen and ink was called for—he has called for it in twenty different houses in London, but on the 18th I was engaged buying a horse of a man in the street—the prisoner took a stable for these horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, by the side of the Edgeware-road—it was the stable I had—he moved from there to one in Sloane-street, of his own hire—the prisoner took away the other horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> a fortnight before he took them all away—he had given me leave to put it in his yard, and said he would let it for me—he told me so at different times—I do not know when the first time was—I should think about three weeks after we had made the agreement—he kept telling me every morning that he would let it—I went to Robinson's Repository on the 7th of April, the things were to be sold on the 8th—I authorized a friend of mine to buy them in if they were sold very cheap—I paid a deposit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have left the remainder of them there ever since—I brought an action against Mr. Robinson before I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him notice first that the property was stolen, and was mine—I went before the Lord Mayor, and told him there was an order not to sell the property—he said he would sell it, which he did—he was nearly giving it away, and I said to a friend of mine named Austin, "You may as well buy it in"—Austin paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after I brought the action—I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by my attorney's advice—he said the property might be bought in as well</p>

               <p>by me as anybody else, it would not make any difference in the action—I don't know whether I was ever in any public-house at the corner of Regent-street—I don't know whether any money passed between me and the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the second paper produced, called a receipt.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you did not see that paper in a public-house in Regent-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no mark on this paper—I cannot swear to it—it was a Mrs. Pearson I told about the horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> being the prisoner's—that was very near six weeks before the 7th of April, I should say—he had but just taken the stable then—it was soon after the agree<lb></lb>ment was made—I thought it would perhaps make the things safe while I was gone, as he said there was a countryman after me every morning—I told Mrs. Pearson I was going down into the country, by the mail, that night—I asked Mr. Desborough, at Robinson's, if I paid the money would they let me have the things, but I did not offer it (Mr. Robinson had advanced 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them when the prisoner took them there) Desbo<lb></lb>rough did not tell me I could—he said nothing to it—he did not say, I might see have them for that sum provided the prisoner consented—he said, "They must be put to the hammer"—I went to the Repository again and again, at different times, after my property, to see what was done with it—an appointment was made for me to come at a certain time, that I might see the prisoner, and I went with a policeman—there was not more than one appointment made—I went to a public-house opposite, and watched at the window for him, and told the policeman to watch for him—I did not tell the policeman I lived in the Edgeware-road—I told him I lived at No. 20, Molyneaux-street, Oxford-street, which is close by the Edgeware-road, not fifty rods from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in the presence of Desborough, sign your name twice over, for the purpose of enabling him to say whether the receipt was ge<lb></lb>nuine or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> signed a paper, but I do not know whether that is it or not—I signed a paper, to show my hand-writing—this has no mark on it to prove it is the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he has been in the habit of buying and selling horses there—he came in his own name, and signed the entry in our book in his own name—Barnes afterwards bought the horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on them—he has never since cleared them—he has taken away part of them—he paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more the next day—he has left one of the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—we were compelled to sell two of the horses by auction—he took away two horses and two <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and asked us to retain the other till he could get money—he wanted us to take some corn of him, and pay for the horses out of it—the remainder, which he did not clear, was sold on the Thursday follwing—I did not see Barnes sign this paper, but I have seen him write his name, and believe this paper to be his writing—the prisoner left the receipt with me—I be<lb></lb>lieve Barnes did not come to meet the prisoner by appointment—he pre<lb></lb>tended coming several times, saying he would give him in charge, but never did so; and Mr. Robinson said, "We will make an appointment ourselves; he is coming on such a day, you come"—he did come, and he was taken that very day—that was the only appointment I know of.</p>

               <p>some one else will have you before long"—and then he said, "Next day I <hi rend="italic">gammoned</hi> him that they were Sheriffs' officers that were after him"—I said, "Were they?"—he said, "No, but I <hi rend="italic">gammoned</hi> him that, to keep him from the stable"—he said he had told him so to intimidate him—he called on me on another day, very much excited, and spoke very ill and disrespect<lb></lb>fully of "the countryman"—he said he did not care, he would <hi rend="italic">serve</hi> him out before long, that he had already planned it, that he should have two or three respectable witnesses present at the stables in Burwood-mews, and he afterwards told me that they were all ready—he told me he bad previously seen "the countryman," and told him there was a Sheriff's officer after him, and if he was not taken, his property would be, and be had planned for them to be present, to hear him admit that it was his property, and not the countryman's—I do not remember any thing else that he said that day—there were many other times—once he came to the yard, looked at a whip, and asked the price—I said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Will you credit me?"—I said, "No"—he then said he bad paid "the countryman" within 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or something very short of the money, and that was all the money he had—some time after I was with Barnes in Chapel-street—we caught sight of the prisoner—as soon as he saw us he ran away as hard as he could—that was the day the horses were sold.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house and coffee-shop in the Edgeware-road. I know Barnes—I have seen him come to my house to take refreshment—the prisoner lodged at my house—I seldom saw him have any money while at my house—I have heard him say Barnes was a very goodsort of a fellow, and he was going to do business with him—he said he was going to work these things for Barnes—one day at dinner, he and a person he was intimate with, were in conversation together—the pri<lb></lb>soner said Barnes had accused him of taking some oats, or something from the stables, and he would make the old b—remember it, for he would put him in the hole for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you kept the coffee-shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ever since Christmas—I was at Brighton before that, working on the rail<lb></lb>way, for about seven months—I was a journeyman bricklayer before that—I have been a bricklayer all my life—I have known Barnes's family for some years, but have had no particular knowledge of him—I only know him from coming to my house for two or three months—I first became acquainted with him from his coming to my house with the prisoner—his family live about eighteen or twenty miles below Ipswich, somewhere about Beaconsfield—he lived with his brothers, I believe, and was a farmer—I was asked to become a witness six or seven weeks ago—Mr. Robin<lb></lb>son's clerk came and asked what I knew, and where the prisoner was—I was subpœnaed here on Monday by Barnes—I was not examined before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 257.) Barnes took me to apprehend the prisoner in Mr. Robinson's yard, in Little Britain—I took him to the station—I told him Barnes charged him with felony—he made no answer.</p>

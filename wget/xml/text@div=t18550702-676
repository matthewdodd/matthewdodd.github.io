I am going on for thirteen years old—I am a labourer, and live at Hilttngdon Heath—I know the prisoner—I saw him and Sconce on 13th June, in the road between Hillingdon Church and the Star—they were quarrelling, and the prisoner went up to Sconce and hit him down with his fist, and stabbed him—there had not been any scuffling and fighting before; the prisoner went all on a sudden and knocked him down, and stabbed him in the neck with a knife which he drew out of his sleeve—he bled—George Hardman came up and said to the prisoner, "Don't hurt the man"—that was after he had stabbed Sconce—the prisoner did not do anything more to Sconce—Sconce got up and walked home—he was not so much hurt as Hardman was.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the militia—the prisoner was in the same regiment—I knew him when he first came to our billet—he enlisted in June—on Wednesday, 13th June, I was in the road, and saw the prisoner and Sconce, about a quarter after 9 o'clock—they had a few words—I heard Sconce ask the prisoner whether he had a halfpenny to lend him till to<lb></lb>morrow morning, to get half a screw of tobacco—the prisoner said, "I am able enough to take my own part"—there were no more angry words than that—the prisoner then came up and knocked Sconce down, and kicked him in the side—Sconce had said nothing to provoke him before that—he never lifted his hand to him—I saw the prisoner stab him in the right side of the neck with a knife—he had the knife somewhere in his sleeve—he bled—I said to the prisoner, "Don't hurt the man," and he jumped up and stabbed me—Sconce got up and went away—the prisoner ran away towards Hillingdon—I knew the knife before; the prisoner bought it and gave ninepence for it; he told us so—it is a little white handled knife—this is it.</p>

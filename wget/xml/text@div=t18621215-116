I have asked the publican to come, and also the man who set the stave, but they do not like to lose their time. On the Thursday I met a man, whom I had lent 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to; he paid me eighteen pence of it by giving me half a crown, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change. That is the half-crown now produced; I bought half an ounce of tobacco with it, and the tobacconist said that it was bad. I told him where I got it, and offered to come back and pay him for the tobacco—the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece I never had in my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father in Britannia-terrace, City-road—he is a musician. I know the prisoners by sight, but never spoke to them—on the 3rd of April, about half-past eight o'clock, I was coming down Plummer-street, with two of my school-fellows—it was dark, out there were lamps, and one of the prisoners (I do not know which) knocked led off my hat—I am quite sure they are the two—Goakam picked it up, and they both ran away—I ran after them, crying "Stop thief!"—Goakam then gave the hat to the other who ran on, and he came back and asked me if I was running after him—I said, "Yes," and asked him where my bat was—he pointed to the spot where it was, and said, "There it is, then" hit me on the side of the face, knocked me down, and ran away—I met a policeman and informed him of it.</p>

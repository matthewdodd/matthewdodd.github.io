            . On the 10th of December, about half-past one o'clock, I went, by Mr. Pite's direction, to his shop, and bought a boa, three silk handkerchiefs, and three pairs of stockings, which came to 50s.; I gave the prisoner 30s. and a sovereign, which Mr. Pite had marked and given to me the evening before.</p>

               <p>MR. PITE. I spoke to the prisoner about a quarter before two o'clock, when I came up from dinner - he said, "I have sold a boa;" I said, "Have you given a cheque?" he made a cheque of it for 30s., and another cheque for 15s. - I am not sure whether he said what he had sold for the 15s., but I think he said, "I have sold some silk handkerchiefs for that;" after he had put the cheques on the file, and gone, I counted the money, for I had previously put in 1l. 5s. 5d., which was marked, and took from it the remaining cash - I then found there was 2l. 5s. more than when I left; I could not accuse the prisoner of taking any, till I knew what had been laid out- I sent for Mr. Brook, who had laid out 2l. 10s., and there was 5s. short; I took the prisoner up stairs, and asked what he had taken from the customers at dinner time - he said, "I have put cheques for it, 30s. and 15s.;" I said, "Is that all you sold?" he said, after some hesitating, "I have sold some stockings;" I said, "You did not give a cheque;" he said, "Yes, I did" - I said,"You have not put the money into the drawer;" he said,"I have;" I said, "You have not" - I said, "What money have you about you?" he pulled out some in his purse, and I asked to look at it; he refused - I sent for an officer, who searched him, and found the 1l. 19s. in his hand, and 3s. or 4s. more at the watch-house, 5s. of which was marked, and I can swear it is part of the money I gave Mr. Brook.</p>
               <p>MR. BROOK re-examined. Q. Did you consider yourself responsible for the money, and that if you had lost it you must have paid it to Pite? A. Yes, I considered it mine while it was in my possession.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

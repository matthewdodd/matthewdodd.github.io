                  </hi>. I am a wool-dealer, at Marlborough-place, Old Kent-road. I have a warehouse and premises in Grange-walk, about 150 yards from a public-house—there is a bottom floor, and a second and third floor—there are two doors to it in the yard, and steps leading up to another door—a person outside could get into the bottom-floor by opening one of the doors. but I understood they were closed—the wool was on the ground-floor—I had not given orders on 23rd Dec. for the delivery of any wool—on 24th Dec. I missed two bags, one larger than the other—they weighed 42lbs., and were worth from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

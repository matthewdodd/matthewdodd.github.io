On the 14th of August, I was going towards Bethnal-green; I first saw the prisoner at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150041"></xptr>end of Hare-street; I saw the prisoner there, following me. When I came to the workhouse, in <placeName id="t18170115-93-crimeloc483">Hare-street - fields</placeName>

When I recovered, I found myself at the workhouse; the prisoner assisted them in taking my umbrella; I had not been looking at the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I had know the prisoner for five or six years. I struck him with the umbrella; my umbrella was found in the field.</p>

               <p>MARIA GARDNER. I was at the poor-house at the time, it is in Hare-street - fields; I saw Mr. Harlow passing the poor house; I saw the prisoner with several more, striking him on his face - He was quite senseless; he was led into the poor-house, I led him in. I saw the prisoner take the umbrella from him, and throw it across the field; I picked it up, and brought it into the workhouse; they then went away, there was no cry of stop thief, or any alarm given; nor did any body pursue them, before they threw it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. There was nobody to hinder them from taking the umbrella away.</p>
               <p>HARLOW re-examined. There was no attempt to rifle my pockets. <rs id="t18170115-93-verdict484" type="verdictDescription">

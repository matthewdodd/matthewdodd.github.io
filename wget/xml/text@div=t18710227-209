                  </hi>. I live at 371, City Road—on Saturday night, 4th February, about 1.15 or 1.30, I was returning home from my sister's, where I had been to supper—I was walking with a friend, and when within 100 yards of my own house, all of a sudden three men darted out from some place; I don't know where—one appeared on each side of us, and one behind us—the prisoner, who was one of them, put a piece of fish in my mouth, and said "I want some money; see; I have nothing but this to eat"—I refused to give him anything—he then clapped his hand to my side, where my watch was—I had my coat buttoned up—I pushed him away, and the next moment he struck me between the eyes, and knocked me against the coping of the rails—my head fell back against the coping of the rails—I rose up again, and before I could hardly get my footing, he struck me in the mouth, and knocked my teeth out—I rose again, and one of his companions struck me with a club, or something, at the back of my head, which almost stunned me; it raised up a place as big as a very large egg—the man was striking at me again, but as he was doing it some persons and a policeman came up—my friend, Mr. Moore, had his arms pinioned</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Featherstone Building, City Road—I was with Mr. Eschman on the night of 4th February, in the City Road, walking arm in arm; all on a sudden we heard footsteps behind us, and one man came on my side, and one on his, and there was another behind—the one on my side said "Give me some halfpence, master," and the one on Mr. Eschman's side at the same time put a piece of fish round in front of him, using some bad language, and said "This is all I have got to eat, give me some money"—I pushed one away, saying "Get away, I have nothing for you"—at the same time a blow was struck by the prisoner, and Mr. Eschman was swung right away from me—I then made a rush to strike the prisoner with my umbrella, and the other man caught hold of me, and said "Here, you stand back"—another person came up in the mean time, and said "The best thing you can do to help your friend is to get a police<lb></lb>man"—I immediately rushed up the City Road, and at the corner of Duncan Terrace, I met a policeman, and brought him down, and gave the prisoner into custody as he was about striking Mr. Eschman again.</p>

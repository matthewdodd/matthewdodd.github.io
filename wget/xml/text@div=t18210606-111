            . I was fellow-servant with Morgan, but am now out of place. On the 2d of May, about half-past seven o'clock, I went to the Fortune of War, public-house; Morgan sat down and went to sleep, I stood up in the room, and saw Buckle's hand down at his right hand breeches pocket. I awoke him, and asked him to feel his pockets, he felt and said,</p>
               <p>"I have lost my money, I have been robbed in this house;" the prisoners were cracking nuts together. Morgan said, if they would give up the money, he would say nothing; Turner said, I was a scoundrel for saying such a thing against a modest woman like her. Morgan went for an officer; I put my foot against the door, and said, Nobody should go out without being searched. Turner insisted on going, and went out - Buckle did not offer to go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they in house before you - A. I cannot say, for I was rather intoxicated - Morgan was sober. He paid me no money that night, there was some conversation about it before he got to the house; he said he would pay me when he got there. I sat down by the fire-place next to Morgan. The pot-boy and I had a few words about an hour before the robbery. Morgan was in the room then, he was asleep when I was turned out - I was not out ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Turner run into the street to go away - A. He went towards the street, and came back with another soldier, he was in his regimentals. The prosecutor was asleep when I went out and when I returned.</p>

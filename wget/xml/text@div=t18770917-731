I am the wife of Arthur Leonard Seeley, and now live at 15, Morton Street, Clerkenwell—in June last, I had words with my husband and he went away in a bit of temper, I remained at 2, Hornsey Park Road, where we were then living—Mr. and Mrs. Charlton lived at No. 3—when my husband left me I became intimate with Mrs. Charlton, who encouraged me to drink, and that went on till 5th July, when I removed to 86, Euston Road, by Mrs. Charlton's advice to avoid my husband—Mrs. Charlton ordered the vans and told me to "shut up" as I had nothing to do with it, and she would not allow me to say anything—on 4th July, I was very intoxicated and went to bed all the afternoon, I awoke between 3 and 4 o'clock next morning—I had not then quite recovered—I heard something moving about at the back of the house—I went into the back-room, and saw Clayton with a chest of drawers on his back—he put them over the wall to Mr. Charlton, and Mr. Charlton senior—they had all been packed full of goods ready for removal, by myself and a servant—afterwards Mrs. Charlton came upstairs and said "Make haste, the van is come"—I went to look, and saw a van—I said "How did you get into the house?"—she said "By the window"—I said "I fastened the window"—she said "Oh, we managed it," and when I went downstairs the kitchen window was wide open—I had employed Clayton to remove the things—the removal then took place, Mrs. Charlton taking part; I was about the house till the vans were loaded, when I and Mrs. Charlton got on the top of one to go to Euston Road—we went in a roundabout away to avoid anyone seeing me who knew me—Mrs. Charlton directed everything—she got down before we got to the Euston Road, because a man was following the vans, and she said "I don't know you "—we got there about 7 o'clock; I did not look over the things till a day or two afterwards, when I missed the things mentioned in this list (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>); afterwards Mrs. Charlton visited me and I asked her if she had any of the things—she said "I have not"—my husband joined me at Euston Road, and on 10th July, Mrs. Charlton came again—my husband was at home then—I begged her to give up the things"—I said "I am sure you had the things"—she said "I had not—I said "My husband will prosecute you unless you bring them back"—she said she had nothing belonging to me at first, and then she said "Yes, I will give them up"—I gave her a dress, and paid her 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for her trouble in removing the goods—I did not pay Mr. Charlton anything—I did not engage him; I paid Clayton 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at the time of the removal I was possessed of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">James Lovegrove was fare called in.</hi>) I know that man and I know Mr. Ward—those two men were engaged in the removal—I, Mrs. Charlton, and Sarah Goodship were looking out for the vans when they drove up to the door—I had not quite recovered, I was not sober—I did not speak to the carmen more than necessary—I did not know who Clayton was—I did not tell Sarah Goodship that some of the things were to go to her mother—I was not in the room when some things were taken to Mrs. Charlton's—I did not go to Mr. Goodship's house; I know him, he lives in the country—Mrs. Charlton was not in our house at the Euston Road at 10 o'clock—I did not send out for brandy or spirits.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. I said before the Magistrate, "When the goods were being removed from Hornsey Park Road, the defendants Charlton and Clayton were there—Mrs. Seeley told me she had given some goods to the Charltons—while we were in the front room in the Euston Road she said "I think it was very unkind of Mrs. Charlton not coming to help put the things straight, as I have given her a bedstead, a palliasse, a chest of drawers, and a washstand"—I helped Mrs. Charlton to move the palliasse downstairs in Mrs. Seeley's house, over the wall and up Mrs. Charlton's staircase—Mrs. Seeley was upstairs while the palliasse was being taken down—she was in the room while it was taken from it—she told me to help Mrs. Charlton to take it down—this was on the Wednesday afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and work for Mr. Denman,. of Camden Town—I recollect moving some thing from Hornsey Park Road, and Mrs. Seeley, Mrs. Charlton, and the girl waiting for me—Mrs. Seeley said Clay<lb></lb>ton was her husband.</p>

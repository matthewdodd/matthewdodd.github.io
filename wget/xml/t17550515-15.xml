               <p>Charles Hodges. I was not at home when the cheese was taken away; when I returned home there were some people who shewed me the cheese, and said it had been stolen, and the man was taken and sent to the Round-house. I can only swear the cheese to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hodges. It was on the 15th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hodges. I was; he said as he was going along a man dropped the cheese, and the people laid hold of him.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner bring a cheese out of the prosecutor's shop under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I do not know the Day of the month; there were two more men along with him; they went away together; I went after them, and the prisoner dropt the cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the Day was it?</p>
               <p>Freeman. It was about half an hour after eight at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lights near?</p>
               <p>Freeman. The candles and lamps were lighted, and the prisoner came by me; I live about three doors from the prosecutor's house, on the same side the way.</p>

               <p>I had been to St. Giles's, and coming home there was a mob of people, and they laid hold of me; I knew nothing at all of the matter from that time to this.</p>

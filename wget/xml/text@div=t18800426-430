                  </hi>. I live at Smith wood Common, in the parish of Albury, and am employed by the Puke of Northumberland to superintend the common—on Monday, 22nd March, Peter Farley called me from my house at a little after 10 p.m.—I went with him to the common and saw two fires burning—the furze was burning—the two fires were about 200 yards apart, or a little more—I saw the prisoner there; he was at the second fire we got to—I said, "That won't do, King"—the second fare was over then, and I saw him light a match and light a third fire—it was then that I said, "That won't do, King," and he put it out directly—I had put out the two first fires—I first saw King standing a little way off the second fire—I said, "Halloa, King," and went part of the way to him—I then saw another fire, a third, and saw the prisoner standing by it—I went part of the way home, and then went back again, and saw the prisoner light a match and light the furze, and then put it out again—I said, "That won't do"—he said that he would set all the furze on fire, he did not do anything more, but went home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first fire might be 100 yards from my house, or not quite so much—the prisoner lives with my son in a cottage more than 30 yards from mine—the second fire was about 200 yards away from my cottage in quite a different direction to the first fire—the first fire was the nearest to my cottage—it took me about a minute to get from the first fire to the second—I could see the prisoner perfectly clearly at the second fire—he was standing looking at it being put out—after the second fire was put out I saw a third fire, and in consequence of that I turned back and went to it, and saw the prisoner standing by it—I said at the police-court, "I saw King near the second fire, close beside it. I said to him, 'Halloa, King.' He made no answer. We left King there I went part of the way home again. I saw King stooping down; I don't know whether he was lighting his pipe or a match, but the furze bush was on fire"—that is right—I also said, "I saw the fire, but I did not see the match; there was no fire when I saw King stooping"—I have been in Court at Guild<lb></lb>ford since I gave evidence at the police-court—I was before the Magis<lb></lb>trates there—it was for taking some sheep into the yard—I am on bail now to take my trial at the Surrey Assizes for sheep-stealing—I did not see any third fire until I got up to King and saw him stooping to strike a light—I swear that he said, "I will burn all the furze"—I did not say something different to that at the police-court—I said, "After he had put the fire out, he said, 'All the lot ought to be burnt'"—I did not hear him say, "It would not matter much if it was all burnt, it is only a bit of waste stuff"—I do not remember his using the words "waste stuff"—I</p>

He-examined. Before I turned back I saw him standing there near the furze, and went back directly—I saw him stoop down, strike the match, and set the furze on fire—I do not know whether he was lighting his pipe or not—I never saw a pipe if he had one—I can't say whether I should have seen it, because it was dark—I never heard him say anything about a pipe—he did not show me one.</p>

He had been drinking, but I don't think he was the worse for it—I say that because he said he had been in the Jerry shop—he did not seem the worse for drink—I could not tell that he had been drinking, only he said that he had been in the Jerry shop—he seemed a little like a man who was the worse for drink, but I could not say much about it—I did not think then that he looked like a man that had been drinking, but he said that he was tight after we put the fire out. Peter Parley. I live at Smithwood Common—on Monday, 22nd March, about 10 o'clock, I saw a fire on the common—Denyer was called, and I went with him on to the common—we went to the fire and it was put out—I then saw a second fire several yards from the first—we went and put that out—as we were going from the first fire to the second I saw the prisoner several yards from the second fire—we spoke to him—the second fire was put out, and I went home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the police-court, "I did not speak to King"—we might have been four or five minutes putting out the second fire—the prisoner did not come up to us—I first saw him when we were going from one fire to another—there was a disturbance among some people who were at the second fire—King had nothing to do with that—the people about the second fire did not threaten to throw me into it, but they hit me—nobody said, "Put him into the fire"—we came to words, and then they hit me—the words were not about who lit the fire—he said they thought that they had been to Cranley—I said they had not—I have found out now that what they said was true—I know a beerhouse kept by a man named Ede—I know Denyer's son; the prisoner lodges with him—I don't know that the prisoner's uncle is the Duke of Cambridge's wood-man—I do not know whether the Duke of Cambridge has any property there—this is a plan of the spot—this is old Denyer's cottage; this is young Denyer's; this is Ede's beerhouse, which is pretty well straight across the common from young Denyer's cottage—if the prisoner had been drinking at Ede's beerhouse during the evening he would follow this line; and if after he went home he saw the fire blazing, he would follow this other line to go there—the position of the third fire was about half way between where I had the quarrel with the man, and the cottage of Denyer's son—I have not been a witness at Guildford since I was a</p>

By the Court. There is furze all over the common, every inch of it, but on different spots—if he wanted to light his pipe there is a quantity of furze in different places.</p>

I am sergeant of the Surrey Constabulary—I took the prisoner in custody on Tuesday, 23rd March, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I told him he would be charged with setting fire to the furze on Smithwood Common on the night of the 22nd—he said, "I can't help it; I was drunk at the time or else I should not have done it. It is no use my telling a lie about it, as I know Denyer saw me strike a light, and when I saw him I put the fire out myself"—a pipe was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 67, Neale Street, Camberwell—I am single, and in the employment of Mr. Carman, of 40, Boyson Road, Camberwell—I had been in the habit for some time of walking out with the prisoner—I ceased to do so for two months previous to the 12th January—on that night, about 9.30 or 9.45, Mr. Carman sent me out on an errand—it was a snowy night—when I got to the Albany Road I saw the prisoner coming down the Albany Road and I stopped and looked into a shop window to avoid him; the shop was at the corner of a street, I don't know the name of it; it was a turning leading to the canal—the prisoner came behind me and said "You b—, I owe it you," and he took hold of my waist and threw me in the water—I did not feel <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, all my breath was gone—I could not soream; he took hold of my waist and I felt no more till I was in the water—I don't know how far he pushed me—he had threatened me before this, the night I went to my new situation; that was on a Sunday, I don't know the date; I had been at my place, Mr. Carman's, two months and twelve days—he said if I deceived him he would catch hold of my throat and gnaw me to death—I did not see anybody about when he came up to me on this night—after I had been in the water I felt something hard, and I managed to stand up and screamed my loudest—a gentleman came up and assisted me out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-txamintd</hi>). I have seen Alice Childers several times since this matter happened—on those occasions she has given me four different accounts of it—on the 15th, the day after she was brought into the hospital, she said she had been out that night; that it was a snowy night, and she lost her way, and had fallen into the canal—those were her words as nearly as I can recollect—the second statement was a day or two after, and that was that while she was out on a message a man came from behind and pushed her into the canal—the third statement was a day or two after that again, that while she was with a young man, she heard some one come as they were round the corner; they thought it was the police, and they ran off, and in turning at the corner of the basin in taking a short cut, her foot slipped and she tumbled into the canal the fourth statement was made on the day of her discharge, the 21st January, that was made before the nurse, and it was to the effect that her young man had thrown her into the cause</p>

               <p>—one of her statements was that she was in the family way; she said that while in the hospital; but she has also stated that she was poorly when she fell into the canal—she was not in the family way as far as I could dis<lb></lb>cover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is not uncommon for women, when seduced, to think they are in the family way—I did not mention these matters before the Magistrate; I was prevented by detective Read; he said he had volunteered statements and had been told not to answer any thing what he was asked—I myself have experienced the folly of trying to volunteer in the witness-box, and have been snubbed by counsel for doing so—I did not mention it to-day until I had sent word to counsel.</p>

I do not know Annie Linkin—I have never seen her—I never said to her that I was going to make away with myself—I did not go Sunday after Sunday to the prisoner's lodging—the doctor examined me at the hospital and told me I was seduced—I told him this affair just as it happened—I did not tell him that I had lost my way in the snow, and had fallen into the canal—I did not say anything about slipping into the canal—I told him that I was out on a message, and a man came behind me, took me by the waist, and pushed me into the canal—I did not say I was out with a young man and heard a noise and ran, and that my foot slipped and I fell into the canal.</p>

I am landlady of the house where the prisoner lodged—he is a very steady upright young man—this young woman was always coming every Sunday to see him, and would not go away from the door; she has stood at the door many a time as if she was foolish—I don't recollect any particular night in January—the prisoner used to come home from his work about 10 o'clock or 10.30, and sometimes sooner—I don't remember being struck by his absence any night—I have answered the prosecutrix at the door many a time on a Sunday afternoon about 3.30—she said she wanted to see <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>—I said he was not at home; and she has told me once or twice that she knew he was at home—he has never seen her—she has not made any statement to me about herself—I sent Mrs. Linkin out one Sunday to speak to her, because I was tired of going out to her.</p>

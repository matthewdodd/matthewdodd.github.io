On the 26th of March my house was broken into; I fastened it up myself, and my lodger and I examined all the house at a quarter-past eleven o'clock; all the doors and windows were fast - I then went to bed; next morning I found the house broken open, the shutters, the glass, and the bolt of the door broken - I heard a noise of wrenching in the night, and we got up; a lodger got a light - I was lame, and could not come down myself; I have not lost any thing.</p>

            . I lodged at the White Horse on the 26th of March - I went to bed about ten o'clock, and about twenty minutes to five in the morning I heard a noise, which seemed to be in the back part of the house; I laid still for ten minutes, and then heard a bolt burst, as I thought, at the front door - I got up, looked through the window, and called the watchman and the Police; I heard nothing after the bolt went - my wife got up and struck a light; I took a poker in my hand, went to the front door, opened it, and let the Policeman in - I found the front door fast, and the back door was fast; I put my hand against the back parlour door - that flew open, and the shutters and the window of the back room were open wide enough to let a man in - the bolts of the shutters were undone; two great holes had been cut through the shutters, the bolts unfastened, and two squares of glass broken - there were footmarks in the snow in the yard; I saw the prisoner in custody afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the footmarks of one person or more? A.Only one - it did not snow when I came home at night; thirty-seven holes were bored in the shutters by a center-bit - I went to bed before the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>ZACHARIAH BAKER. I am a Policeman. I was in Spital-street early on the morning of the 26th of March, about one or two hundred yards from the White Horse- I heard Wood call out Watch and Police; I went to the White Horse, and called my serjeant and other assistance - we were let in by Wood; his description of the shutters and window is correct - I saw footmarks in the snow in the yard, and I followed those footmarks immediately; they led me over six or seven fences at the back of the house, and I heard a rustling at the door of a house in the eighth yard - I traced footmarks to that door; the serjeant and I tried to force the door in, but could not - I heard that door bolted before we got up to it; there was a back window - I broke two or three squares of glass, unfastened the hasp, and got in; I heard footsteps going from the ground floor to the first floor front room, and there I found the prisoner, sitting at the foot of a bed, where a male and female, and a young child were in bed; the prisoner was sitting with his legs across, his arms folded, and his coat and his hat off, which were all wet by the side of him - he appeared to be asleep; I disturbed him, and found in his pocket two street door keys and a box - I took him to the station-house, and afterwards to the watch-house; he would not give us his address - I took his shoes off his feet, and compared them with the marks in the snow, both right and left, all the way, and they corresponded all the way; they were new left and right shoes - I compared them with the snow, they fitted exactly; the marks were deeper than above the soles - I did not compare it by making a mark by the side of the footmark, but I put the shoes into the footmarks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it snowing when you were called? A. A little; it was about twenty minutes to five o'clock - the snow ceased a minute or two after I got into the house; the prisoner was found about one or two hundred yards from the prosecutrix's - I got over seven wooden fences and a wall, following the footsteps, and my serjeant followed with me; the serjeant of the patrol went round the front way - I wear right and left shoes, but mine had hob-nails; I compared his shoes about half an hour after I secured him - the water did not drip into the footsteps; it was light enough to see that - I knew the person by sight in whose room he was found; I have not been there since - the prisoner was pretending to be asleep, sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed, all over wet; no housebreaking implements were found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From what part of the house did you trace the footsteps? A. From the shutter of the back room, where the breaking had been.</p>
               <p>JOHN McWILLIAM. I am a Policeman. I went with Baker to the White Horse; I got there about twenty minutes to five o'clock; I did not hear any noise till I heard the alarm; I then went into Mrs. Pawson's house - we went through the house, and traced the footmarks through the snow to the other house, and I heard the door slammed in and bolted - he got in at the window; I got in, went up, and took the prisoner: when Baker aroused him I looked under the window, and saw his shoe laying there, wet - I said to Baker, "Take him to the watch-house;" he said he would be d-d if he went without his shoes: I said,"Are these your shoes?" he said Yes, and put them on - we took him to the station-house; I afterwards took his shoes off, and compared them with the footmarks - they corresponded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You must have been at the person's heels when he got into the house? A. Yes - he went into that house, but he was never in my sight; I only say so from hearing the door slam while I was in the yard - I examined the room, but found no housebreaking implements; I have no reason to think the person who lives in that room has gone away - the prisoner said he could prove by the man in the room that he had not been out all night, except for a pot of beer - I said, "That man knows me better than to come up and say so."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did the man say? A.He made no answer; my footmarks were almost as large again as the prisoner's, and Baker's had hob nails - the prisoner's had small brads; there were no other footsteps to be seen in any direction.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. I went with McWilliam to the house; I observed him take the prisoner's shoes there, and there was snow sticking to the heels, and the bottom of his trousers were quite wet, and his hat appeared as if rain had sprinkled on it; the drops stuck to it.</p>

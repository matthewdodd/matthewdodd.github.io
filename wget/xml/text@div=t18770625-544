                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Bankruptcy Court, and produce the proceedings in bankruptcy of the prisoner—the petition was filed on the 9th October, 1876—the act of bankruptcy was the failure to obey a debtor's summons—I have the affidavit of service of Samuel Daniel—the prisoner was adjudged a bankrupt on 30th October, 1876—the first meeting of creditors was on 14th November, when Mr. John Vale was appointed trustee; December 9th was appointed for the prisoner's public examination—I have here a note that he failed to attend—on 20th December a warrant was issued for his apprehension—there is also a statement filed by the prisoner on 19th May, 1877—the debts are returned as 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the assets 890<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant at 5, Hill's Place, Oxford Street, and the prisoner's trustee in Bankruptcy—besides the 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. returned, there are other creditors amounting to 519<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; one is for a loan of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the prisoner denies this liability—Messrs. Lumley acted as my solicitors—in December an application was made for a warrant to apprehend the prisoner—from the 9th December to the end of April I was unable to find him—on 28th April I went to see him at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, when he signed the statement produced—I afterwards advertised and received a letter—the prisoner did not disclose to me until after the prosecution the monies found at various banks, when I received deposit notes of monies standing in various names:—the monies were 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited with the Stourbridge and Kidderminster Bank in the name of M. C. Williams, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Mark Long at the National Provincial Bank at Birmingham, and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of M. C. Williams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been trustee in many bankruptcies—my bill of costs from Lumley's is not sent in—the Bankruptcy Court has restrained the creditors from touching the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. assets—the banks have orders not to pay—I was instructed by a committee of investigation to prosecute; I was bound to regard their wishes as well as other creditors—I did not name to the prisoner places where I thought he had property—an application was made to the Court for money to defray the prisoner's defence, which the Court refused—I cannot give you the dates of all the debts—I hope the bankrupt will pay 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound.

Lumley have been our solicitors seventeen or eighteen years; I employed them in this matter just before issuing the debtors' summons—there was no agreement for six months' credit—I did tell the prisoner he had laid himself open to a criminal charge—I did not preserve all his letters—I am aware he alleges my threat to be the reason of his non-surrender—I saw him several times between the summons and the adjudication—he offered to pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides our account if I would not make him a bankrupt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was no threat after the bankruptcy proceedings commenced, only when I first found I had been imposed upon—he said he had no money, having previously said he was a man of considerable means and that he had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

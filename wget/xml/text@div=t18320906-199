               <p>MARGARET PRESTON. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the night of the 12th of August, he was very drunk - he was in company with the prisoner and more of his friends - the prisoner was also drunk; my husband was sick - the prisoner helped him up stairs to bed, and helped all his clothes off except his trousers; I was putting my baby to bed at this time - my husband was laying on the bed; the prisoner assisted to take off my husband's trousers, but he would not let him, and the prisoner went down stairs - my husband followed him with all his clothes off but his trousers; they were not gone many minutes - I followed them down, and when I got down, I saw them wrangling together and fighting - they had hold of each other; I went between them to part them, and received a scar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060093"></xptr>on my left hand; I then observed some blood on my husband - I called Murder! I found he was hurt on the head and body - a surgeon attended him afterwards; when my husband went out of the room after the prisoner, he ran down following him - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you one of the party at Greenwich? A. Yes; I was confused; my sister is married to the prisoner - we had been happy and comfortable; I suppose I was two or three minutes in the room before I followed them down, and when I got down they were struggling.</p>
               <p>PATRICK PRESTON re-examined. I do not remember the prisoner putting me to bed, or pulling my clothes off; I remember his trying to take my trousers off; I told him I would not let any body take them off; he gave me some saucy answer, and them went down stairs - I went after him, but how it began, or how I got on after I got down I do not know; I do not know what passed till I found my neck bleeding, and he said, "Now I have you;" who first struck I do not know, but I was cut - I do not know whether supper was going on then.</p>
               <p>MRS. PRESTON. Supper was over; nobody is here who was present when they got down stairs.</p>

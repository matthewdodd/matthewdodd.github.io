                  </hi>. I am Governor of the House of Correc<lb></lb>tion, Coldbath-fields. The prisoner was an inmate of that prison in June—he came in on 4th November—I knew the deceased, his name was William Henry Woodhouse—he was a warder—on Saturday, 10th June, about eight in the morning, he came to me with the prisoner, and reported in his presence that the prisoner had complained to him that one of the prisoners in the yard had held a conversation with him, and asked him if he were not the man who had criminal intercourse with his own daughter, or something to that effect—Woodhouse said to me that he did not believe the truth of the prisoners state<lb></lb>ment—I said instantly, "Nor do I," and told the prisoner I should remove him into a cell by himself, for he really was not a man fit to associate with others—he was then taken away by Woodhouse—about an hour after that I saw the prisoner in a cell in No. 5 yard—I had then seen Woodhouse carried away wounded and dying from No. 5 yard—when I went to the cell I said to the prisoner, "You have done a fatal deed at last; this poor man is dead. you have killed him "—he said, "Serve him right, a b----y villain!"—he</p>

                  </hi>. I work on the river Thames, to get ballast Last Monday night week I was at the Phoenix public-house, drinking—the prisoner came in between eight and nine o'clock—I had been there about two hours then—some words passed between the prisoner and a man named Franklin about <hi rend="italic">sparring,</hi> and they did <hi rend="italic">spar</hi>—I do not think they hurt each other—they seemed to be joking—I asked the prisoner to spar with me, and threw off my jacket on the table—he refused to do so, and I believe I gave him some abusive language—I was not drunk, and I can<lb></lb>not say I was quite sober—I could just recollect what passed—I called him some names, and said, "Why not call for some beer, instead of making a disturbance?"—I was leaning on the partition that divided the two boxes in the tap-room—a few moments afterwards, as he was leav<lb></lb>ing the tap-room he gave me a kick in the * * * * and went out—he did not hurt me much—I staid some few moments, and then went out to go home to my lodging, which is about thirty yards from the public-house—the prisoner met me, and came across the street towards me—he asked me to fight, or <hi rend="italic">spar</hi>—I said I would not, and told him to go home to his wife, a scoundrel, or words to that effect—he then gave me an<lb></lb>other kick in the same place as before—I said, why should he kick me so, if he did it again I should give him in charge—he then made a plunge with his hand towards me—I put up my hand to prevent it, and something cut my finger or thumb, but I saw nothing in his hand—he then went away—it was a slight cut, such as a knife would make—a surgeon saw the cut at the Thames police-office—I never struck the prisoner at all.</p>

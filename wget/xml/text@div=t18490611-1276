                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Wren, of East-street, Mary<lb></lb>lebone. The prisoner took a lodging of me on 7th May, and gave me a reference at 42, Wimpole-street—he brought a carpet-bag and bundle the same day, about eleven o'clock—he came in about eight in the evening with a stranger—they went into the room together—the prisoner was rather in liquor—they left about a quarter or twenty minutes past eight—the prisoner then had a bundle under his arm—I afterwards went into the room and missed one of Mr. Ball's boots, a jacket, waistcoat, pair of trowsers, and a shirt—he is a lodger of mine, and was gone out—I had seen them safe at eight—the prisoner's carpet-bag and bundle were still there—it was in Mr. Ball's room; he was going to sleep with him—the prisoner came back on the 8th—I asked him where Mr. Ball's things were—he said he did not know what I meant, that he had not been home all night—a constable was sent for, and he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge with Mrs. Wren. I went out about a quarter to eight o'clock, came back a little before twelve, and missed these things—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them; they are mine, and were on a chair when I went out—there was a square in the jacket-pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 129). On 8th May I was called to Mrs. Wren's, and took the prisoner to the station—I asked where he slept that night; he said at a coffee-shop, in Maryfebone-lane—I afterwards went there, made inquiries, and received this jacket, waistcoat, trowsers, shirt, and a square, from the landlady—the square was in the waistcoat-pocket—I pro<lb></lb>duce the prisoner's carpet-bag, and it contains the same sort of property.</p>

I live at the coffee-house, in Marylebone-lane—the pri<lb></lb>soner came there on Monday night very drunk, with a bundle under his arm, which he put on a chair—it was afterwards found under the bed and delivered to the policeman—it contained the things produced; I can only swear to the shirt and jacket.</p>

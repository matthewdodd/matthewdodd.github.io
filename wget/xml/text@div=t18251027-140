When the 10th of October arrived (the period to which I had paid her) I told her I had got new servants - that Mrs. Jones and the family were about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270061"></xptr>to return. On the following morning I was awoke by a noise in the attic, and heard a box being carried out. On the Saturday following (the 15th) she collected her boxes into the hall, and said, "Here are my boxes - would you wish to look at them?" I said, "No, if I had mistrusted you it would be too late now." I had not then made any charge against them. These circumstances, and the number of boxes put me on inquiring, and either on that Saturday or the Sunday, I missed a number of articles, and a great many books. I got a search-warrant, and went to their lodgings with the officer - they were both there. I found many books there, and among the rest the first and third volumes of Percy's Relics of English Poetry - I have the second volume of it here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you among those a history of the Inquisition? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not send this book to the female prisoner by your own son? A. No; he is not five years of age. - My nephew had access to my library, and could take what books he liked, but he never spoiled a set; I did once find that he had mislaid some of my books, and taken some away with him, but this is two years and a half ago. The female prisoner had been in my house from November 1824 - if he had taken any books away it must have been previous to her coming. I have not said that some of my sets had been broken in consequence of what he took away; I have missed single books, but no sets broken - there were odd volumes in my library. I made the female prisoner a present of a watch, and I gave her some other trifling presents about ten days before she went away. I was expecting the female part of my family in town, when I gave her notice to go, because I had ample reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct, in the absence of Mrs. Jones. She asked me as a favour to let her stay a fortnight after her marriage; she had never before her marriage slept in the kitchen to my knowledge, as I stand in the presence of your Lordship and of heaven; she never slept on the dresser with the door bolted, she slept in the attic, there was a fastening to that door, there are locks to all my doors up stairs. I do not upon my oath, know of the fastening being taken off that door. I suppose there was a key to the lock, but I never got possession of it. I gave her an old fender, and a lamp which had been in the chimney in my dressing-room, and was very black; a man was coming to make me a new lamp, and I told him I would let him have it, if he would allow me something for it; she came up stairs and said, Sir. "Will you let me have the lamp, for what the lamp-maker would allow for it?" I said "No - Chambers, I can't think of selling any thing to you, I would rather give it you." I really thought at that time, that the glass of it was broken - this is the lamp (looking at one produced.) I bought it about five years ago for 3 l. 10 s., but we had never used it scarcely - I ordered another of a different kind. Mary Strives is my housemaid. I never offered the prisoner a gold watch, if she would not take the silver one. I gave a chronometer for the use of the kitchen, which was lent by my watchmaker; but when I gave the prisoner what I did at last, I took that away again. I gave her a silver watch which cost 6 l. I did not gave her The History of the Inquisition - there was something said about me by Mary Strives, at the time of the prisoner's nuptials - but the prisoner remained in the house after that. Mary Strives has not been discharged since she was subpoenaed to be a witness. Mrs. Jones discharged her a month ago. I was not present at the time - my nephew's name is James Shirvet. I have not seen the room where the prisoner slept for some time; but my house was undergoing a thorough repair, about two months ago, and the locks were taken away, and replaced again before the prisoner went away. I do not know the state of the fastening of her door - but I suppose the carpenters took off every lock, and replaced them. Upon my oath, I did not have a small bolt taken off her door, nor take the key of a middle door. I do not know of any middle door in my house - the report of Mary Strives was first circulated about the 10th of September, when the prisoner's nuptials were celebrated - it was not then that I made the prisoner a present. I gave her warning a week before her marriage - I paid her her wages, and a month in advance; I did not then know of her marriage - she told me she was to be married on the ensuing Monday. I did not give her warning on the day she told me what

             had said; I do not know in what room Mary Strives slept - the report was, that when I was in the country, I had followed two young women about fourteen years of age into a field - it was Mary Strives who brought this report to town. When the cook had put some money into the bank, I advised Mary Strives to save her money, and put it there, and it was said by Chambers that I had offered Mary Strives 100 l. to be my wife - there was not a report that the female prisoner had caught me in a particular situation with Mary Strives. I do not owe the prisoner a farthing. I think she left me on the 15th of October, and was apprehended on the following Thursday. - When she left, she pretended to say she had not received all her wages, and went to Mrs. Jones on the subject. I had been inquiring into the state of things, and got the warrant on the Thursday, this letter (looking at it) was written about the time I discharged her - it contains a statement of the money she had received, and what she had to receive; she had been attempting to perplex me with her account, and I put it down upon paper; I do not remember that I was afraid of any abuse or disturbance at that time. I could state, on oath, if I was on a dying-bed, I do not recollect threatening to take her before a Magistrate - I do not recollect any cause for it - I gave her this letter about the time of her discharge. I never gave the prisoner a writing-desk - I gave her 2 l. when she was going away. Mrs. Jones gave her 2 l., and might have given her some profiles, but not to my knowledge - this letter is my writing:</p>
               <p>(read.)</p>
               <p>For MRS. CHAMBERS.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones has settled with Chambers till the month of May; but of this she was not quite certain, as her cook is in Coram-street, and if there is any mistake, she will rectify it. Wages from the month of May to the 9th of September, 5 l. 12 s.; till the month of October, the month in advance, 1 l. 8 s., makes 7 l., according to sixteen guineas per annum. On account of your care of the children, you were promised to have your wages made up to 20 l.; Mrs. Jones accordingly made you a present of 2 l., and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270062"></xptr>4 l., which was paid for a watch, as which you have a receipt for six guineas. You deposited four sovereigns with Mrs. Jones, but I having advanced you three, leaves your wages just eight sovereigns. I promised you something towards your expenses to see your father and mother, and I now fulfil the promise, by giving you, in addition to the 2 l., enclosing a bank-note of 10 l. Now, Chambers, what have you done to merit this extraordinary kindness thus shewn you? Your conduct has been unprincipled; your behaviour scandalous - since three months past you have neglected your duty, having left the house in complete filth and disorder, even the knives being left in dust and rust; and since Mrs. Jones went into the country you have declined to wash your own clothes, and, without my knowledge or consent, gave them to my washerwoman. I intrusted you with the key of my book-room, and you left them all unlocked, so that the workmen in the house might, and doubtless have, taken many of them away. With all this, you put me to great expense in having a worthless girl with you in the house, and that without adding any thing to my comfort, or to the proper management of the house. Yet, on account of some qualities, I forgive you, and wish you well. When you return, it will be a good time for you to have a situation; and Mrs. Jones will give you, doubtless, an undeniable character. You have always been kind and good to the children, and, for this reason, I and Mrs. Jones would be happy to cherish unfeigned good-will towards you, and would be glad occasionally to see you - but, with respect to myself, whatever may be my feelings, it is my present intention never to speak to you again.</p>
               <p>J. JONES.</p>
               <p>I shall take a copy of this letter, and, if rendered necessary, by abuse or disturbance on your part, I will send it to your uncle, and immediately go to a Magistrate to ask his advice how to act towards you.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination continued. Q. What abuse did you expect? A. I certainly experienced her abuse and clamour while the workmen were there, and I wanted to turn her away then, but I did not. I said then to her, in reference to the violence she had displayed, that she was mortified at the idea of going, and was impudent to me - upon my oath it did not allude to any misconduct to the prisoner or Mary Strives. Upon my oath The History of the Inquisition was not given to her, in consequence of her having stated, that she found me in a particular situation with Mary Strives.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At the time you gave her this lamp, did you know where the top was? A. No - I did not; it was only the stand I gave her, it was not in a state fit for use - I did not think it worth 6 d. My nephew had left me two years and a half; the set of Relics of Ancient Poetry was complete after he left me. I am certain I had it in my hand, and had occasion to refer to it at the time. I first gave the female prisoner notice to quit - I did not know of her marriage - I did not hear of the report that Mary Strives had given out, until the nuptials of the prisoner had taken place. I never authorised my nephew, or my son, to give her any books; I never took any liberty with her or Strives, in my life; I am fifty-seven years of age - I am married, and have two children - my youngest child was taken ill, and the prisoner offered her service to attend her, and by her assiduity I had reason to believe the child was restored - the medical gentleman said so; this created great gratitude in Mrs. Jones' bosom and in mine; she asked to have the child left in her care during the winter, which was complied with, and Mrs. Jones said, in addition to her regular wages of 16 l. per year, she should have two sovereigns on the child's birth-day, and on the birth-day of my son I should have given her two sovereigns but as she had complained of the want of a time-piece in the kitchen, I said I would commute the four sovereigns into a watch, which cost 6 l.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When the prisoner was going away, what did she ask you? A. To look at her boxes if I pleased. I understood her to mean to search them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GEORGE EMBLETON. Q. Was not a woman of the name of Garrat, or Becket, or Thompson, the cause of my wife being turned out of the house? A. That woman had nothing whatever to do with her dismissal.</p>

            'S Defence. Dr. Jones gave me the watch one night when I had been out, and when I returned he was along with a woman in the parlour, and he told me not to say any thing about it - at another time he took the key from the middle door; he has knocked me down on the stairs frequently, and given me a bottle of wine and 1 lb. of tea, and a bottle of Hollands; that woman left her cap in the house, and took Dr. Jones's hat.</p>
               <p>MARY STRIVES. I have been in the service of Dr. Jones, but am to leave it in a few days. I received my notice to attend here on Saturday evening, and Mrs. Jones gave me warning the next day; the female prisoner made some discovery respecting Dr. Jones, and me about five months ago; she was going out one morning, and the Dr. had his hat and coat on, as if he was going out; as soon as she was gone, he took them off again, and came down into the kitchen to insult me; he followed me into the front kitchen while I was washing my hands, and put his arms round my waist; the prisoner came down at that time, and found him in that situation; she did not say much to him there - but more up stairs; she said he had insulted her, and she thought it a shame he should insult a young girl who had not been in the house a fortnight.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you under notice to quit? A. Yes, I staid some time in town after this; I have been near four months at Sawbridgeworth with Mrs. Jones; the subpoena was served there; Mrs. Jones afterwards brought me to town; she, and her mother, had subpoenas at the same time; I have been at her mother's house since I came to town; I was not to go to her house till after the trial; I was sent for this morning by the officer, and Mrs. Jones brought me here to-day with her; I was very angry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270063"></xptr>with my master for insulting me, but I did not tell Mrs. Jones, because he desired me not, before the prisoner at that moment. I have been in his service about eleven months, and a fortnight since, but I have been three months in the country.</p>

             was in the house during that time as charwoman; I heard that Mrs. Becket was there, but never saw her. When Dr. Jones begged I would not mention it to my mistress, he made the same request to the female prisoner, and it was after that the presents were given.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this about a fortnight after you got to the house? A. Yes; Mrs. Jones was not in town at the time. Dr. Jones and I were the only persons in the house; I was wiping my hands in the front kitchen at a round towel; he came and said I was a nice girl, and wanted to kiss me, but I would not let him - he was interrupted by the cook coming down the area steps - she had not been out three minutes; I do not know how she came to return, unless it was she thought he meant to insult me, as she had not seen him go out; as I was going down the kitchen stairs, I saw him in the hall with his hat and coat on; when the prisoner returned, she left the children outside the gate; she told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, to insult a young girl, and she would leave the house directly; she went up stairs and fetched her box down, and he begged her to take it up again; he said he hoped she would not name it to Mrs. Jones; he did not at that time give her, or me any presents, or promise us any thing to suppress what had passed; the prisoner then went up stairs with her clothes, and he followed her into the bed-room, as she told me afterwards. He told me, about five months ago, that if I would consent to be his wife, I should have hundreds in the Bank - this was when he was insulting me again in the back parlour - no one saw that, but I afterwards told the prisoner of it. I never knew of any book being given or sent to her; he never in my hearing offered her any money to conceal what she had seen. He brought down a silver watch into the kitchen, and said, "Chambers, there is a watch I have bought, and I will give it you." This might be about a month after the first insult was offered to me; he said she had been a good servant, and she deserved it, and she might either have that or his own gold watch. When he was insulting me, she said he had insulted her, and she would not stop in the house; she said afterwards, that he had offered her presents in her bed-room, not to say anything to Mrs. Jones about it - I did not say anything to Mrs. Jones. The report generally spread in the country was, that there were two little girls, one about thirteen and the other about fourteen years of age, who went into the fields at Sawbridgeworth, and Dr. Jones asked if he might accompany them - I mentioned it in town, when I came about the wedding - but only to my fellow servants.</p>

            . The female prisoner is my niece, but she has been most of her life in the country. I have assisted in supporting her; I know Dr. Jones's son, and recollect his bringing The History of the Inquisition to my house one day in November last, when I was dressing to attend Lord Chief Justice Abbot to go to the Levee. I think it was on the day Fountleroy's report went up; he said to me "See what a nice book papa has given Chamber's - she says you must read it;" I said I have no time - but he persisted in saying I must read it, and it was left there ten days or a fortnight. I said to the prisoner's sister "Mary, if Dorothy comes, beg her to take this book it must have been given her as waste paper." I did not know my niece was married - I met her at the Police-office and I saw Dr. Jones there - he said "Oh, my God, what a piece of business this is;" I said "Who brought it on?" he said "Do get this business settled, nobody can settle it but you." I told him if he could point out a way I should be glad; he said "If I had known I would never have brought them here; I meant to have called upon you, and wanted Mr. Fox to have called." I said "If I had known what was going forward in your house she should not have been there an hour;" he said it was all lies - I did not describe what was going on - I thought he knew. He said he would have the house searched again - there was nobody there but the poor old father - the mother was at the office. As we were going to the house he stopped at the corner, and said "For God's sake get it settled;" I said "Point out a way and I shall be happy - there is but one way, by withdrawing the prosecution." He searched the house and found nothing but a sixpenny blue handkerchief; he said "This is mine, I can swear to it." The woman said "Doctor, I gave 6 d. for it." The lamp was then shewn me - it was not then broken - it was a very handsome one, and I ordered it to be taken to the office, to shew the Magistrate what a handsome glass he had given the poor girl - it was broken at the office. I have had her in my house for months together, and she was very honest - as to her husband, I lived under his father forty-five years ago, and a more honest young man never existed - I have assisted him with money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You spoke to Dr. Jones at the office? A. Yes, and represented it would be the ruin of these people; he said he was very sorry, and if it came to the ears of his connexion it would be his ruin. I did not then give him to understand what reports I alluded to, but I did afterwards, and he said it was all lies. Dr. Jones has often asked me to dine with him in his house - I never did, but I have often taken wine in the kitchen, with the servants, which he has brought down. His son is about five years of age.</p>
               <p>JOHN BODLY. I know the female prisoner - I bought this book, The Tale of a Tub, at a book-stand in Miller-street, for 1 s. 6 d. - I lent it to the prisoner two or three years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you write any name in it. A. No, I do not recollect that I did - I have read different parts of it - I bought it two or three years ago, but have not read it through - I cannot tell what it is about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there any marks in it? A. Yes; but I do not remember them. I have not lent it to any other person.</p>
               <p>DR. JONES re-examined. Q. How do you know this book to be your's? A. I have had it in my library long ago. I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the female prisoner a good character.</p>

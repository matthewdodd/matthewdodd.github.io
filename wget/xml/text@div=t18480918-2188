                  </hi>. I am a linendraper and smack-owner, of Barking—Armitage was my apprentice. On 23rd Aug. I fastened up my house, and went to bed—the prisoner did not sleep in the house that night; he had absconded a fortnight before—I came down next morning, and found the kitchen window-shutter taken down—I missed three coats, two pairs of trowsers, and other articles—on 14th Sept. Armitage was found in a cupboard in the kitchen, covered over with pieces of wood—I gave him in charge—some property was shown me by the police, which was mine—I went with them to Rosemary-lane—Powell was sitting at a door there—Armitage said, "That is the man I sold the things to"—the policeman searched Powells house, produced two great coats, a pair of trowsers, and a shawl, which are mine, and these boots also.</p>

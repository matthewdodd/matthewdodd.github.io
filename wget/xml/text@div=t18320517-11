               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You had an opportunity of seeing the person and shape of the man? A. I had - it was possible for a person to go down stairs when I returned to my room after the struggle; there were four strange persons in the house besides the prisoner - I did not look at their shirts or braces; their countenances and the colour of their hair were different to his - they took off their night-caps, to enable me to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Policeman first examine the prisoner, and say he observed no tear or any thing particular about his dress? A. No - he was not examined in his bed; he appeared to be asleep when I first went in - I had awoke the other gentlemen, and they did not appear confused; it was not the appearance as of a person disturbed from sleep; when he came out of the bed-room after us he was in his shirt - I observed that he walked backwards; he never put his back so that it could be seen - he opened the door, and stepped backwards, so that his back should not be seen; I saw his countenance, and was satisfied from the first that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, "A most uncomfortable circumstance has occurred, a gentleman has been robbed - as there are three gentlemen in the house besides you, I should like to see you?" A. I do not know whether I did or not-Mr. Harrison or myself spoke to all the gentlemen as we awoke them; I did not desire to see his shirt in bed, saying the person's shirt had been torn - I was as confident of him at the house as at the station; when I saw his shirt it put aside all chance of my being in error in selecting him; I told the Policeman to keep an eye on him before he went down stairs - I am satisfied he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a person had been caught on the right shoulder, the part torn would not be where that is, but in the small of the back? A.

             THOMAS. I am superintendant of the F division of Police. On the morning in question I was at the station, in Covent-garden, and from what the prosecutor said I had the prisoner's coat and waistcoat taken off, and afterward his neckcloth - the gathers of his shirt from the neck appeared fresh torn, and there was no button on his shirt-collar; I afterwards received from Mr. 
               <persName id="t18320517-11-person303">Harrison</persName>
             a shirt-button, which I compared with those on the wrists of his shirt, and it corresponded - there were no buttons on the collar; this button had been attached to something, because there are fibres of thread to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you the shirt? A. Yes(producing a very dirty one), it is a common thread button - there have been two on the collar; the shirt was as dirty as it is now when I took it off the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning in question I went to the Hummums to get a bed, and had not been there long before I was disturbed by Mr. Harrison and one or two gentlemen; Mr. Harrison awoke me, saying an unpleasant circumstance had occurred, a gentleman had been robbed, and said, "The gentleman thinks the shirt of the person has been torn, and we have taken the liberty of going into three other gentlemen's rooms, you will let us look at your's;" I got up immediately, and showed him my shirt; the Policeman said, "There is no tear on it"-I came out afterwards; the prosecutor requested to see me without my coat and waistcoat - I took them off; that was after he had gone to his bed-room; I wished to go with him, but was refused - they came out, and he again desired to see me without my coat and waistcoat; I took them off, and took my braces off; they soon retired, and I walked up stairs - I sent for Mr. Lewis, and asked if he wished to give me in charge; he said he should like to see my shirt once more - the Policeman and others were pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170026"></xptr>sent; he then looked at my shirt, and said there could be no doubt of it, I should be given in charge.</p>

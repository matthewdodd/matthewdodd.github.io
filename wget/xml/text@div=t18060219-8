             sworn. Mrs. Courtice is my sister, I live with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you when this property was taken. - A. I was standing in the parlour adjoining the shop, I saw the prisoner in the shop, the cracking of the basket made me look towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the cracking of the basket. - A. It made a noise when he took it up, he took the basket off the table, I followed him immediately and cried out Stop thief, but soon lost sight of him; some gentlemen that heard our cries pursued him and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought back. - A. He was taken, I saw him again at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that the person you saw at the watchhouse was the same that you saw in the shop. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lost sight of him. - A. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time had you a view of him. - A. I saw him distinctly take the basket of clothes out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive to him. - A. I am positive to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a light in the shop. - A. Yes, a very good light, I had a very few minutes before that trimmed up the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing whether the door of the shop was secured before he came in. - A. A few minutes before I saw the prisoner come in the shop, I went into the shop, I found the shop door standing open, without being able to account how it came so; I shut it and put my knee against it to be sure the latch had catched.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it shut before that time. - A. It is generally kept shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very clear and positive that the latch took. - A. Yes, I am very sure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that you had seen it open a very little while before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a fastening to the outside door as well as to the in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that any person coming to the door and finding it shut, might open it for the purpose of coming into the shop. - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the usual way of your keeping your shop door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person coming there might let themselves in and out. - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had not shut upshop. - A. No, we keep a green grocer's, we generally leave it unshut till about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The shutters were not put up nor the door fastened. - A. No, we always bolt it then, we do not shut up till after ten, this was rather before ten.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoner before in your life. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard something crack in the shop, does your shop and parlour join together. - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Hearing that noise of course it alarmed you. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And seeing a person in the shop of course you were more alarmed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The very moment you saw the person that moment he went away. - A. Yes, he went away as fast as he could, and he had the basket in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was going out as fast as he could, I suppose he had his back towards you. - A. I had the side view of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had only this momentary view of seeing him, and that only from his side face. - A. Yes, it was his side face that I saw him.</p>

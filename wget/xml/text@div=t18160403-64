            . It is possible for a person about nine or ten o'clock in the evening, who knows our premises, to go up stairs without our knowledge. On the night of the 12th of March, I went up stairs about half past ten; and as I went past the door of one of the chambers, I perceived the bed was disordered; a bed which had been before made; a pair of sheets, a blanket, and a great coat were missing; that was from one room, Shortly after, I examined my own chamber, and missed a pair of stays, two sheets, two bed-gowns, two pair of stockings, two pocket handkerchiefs, four cotton aprons, and one linen one. These things had been washed and taken up stairs. I then gave an alarm, that I thought the house must have been broken open.</p>

            , ESQ. I am the son of the prosecutor, one of the sheriffs of this county. The prisoner lived at house while our groom was ill; he had left us nearly three quarters of a year when this happened. He was with us for six weeks, and he knew the house perfectly. He slept in that part of the house which adjoins the room from which this properly was taken. It was perfectly easy for a person to get into our house between eight and ten in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner Miller came to my shop, and ordered a pair of slippers—I took them home on Thursday, the 26th of Sept., about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, for Millet to look at, being the first of an order, to see if they were the sort he liked—when I took them home I saw Charlotte Edge—I gave them to her—she said, "Very well, I will show them to Mr. Miller—I went the next morning, and found they were all gone, slippers and all—I had not sold the slippers in any way—Miller never knew the price, nor never asked the price—I did not sell the slippers—the price was not named.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. The prisoner work'd for me 13 years; I had no suspicion of her till a little before last Christmas; some of those things have been missing a year and half; I know she was very poor, and I gave her leave to come into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Jones. These mentioned in the indictment were part of them found in the prisoner's lodgings by a search warrant from justice Fielding, and part were found at Mrs. Blackiters, and part at Mrs. Curtis's, the high constable was with me at her lodgings when I found some upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find at her lodgings?</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say for herself?</p>
               <p>Jones. She told me they were not my property at first, but afterwards she confess'd they were mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sell things for him, and I had these things to sell; some things he has taken away that I bought and paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you ever allow her to sell things for you?</p>
               <p>Jones. I never did; here are my wife and apprentice, they both know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell her any of these things?</p>

            . I always thought the prisoner to be a very honest person; she brought me a piece of silk to make her a petticoat; she said she could make her one of something cheaper, so I bought the piece of her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her for it?</p>
               <p>A. Curtis. I gave her half a guinea for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she came by it?</p>
               <p>A. Curtis. She said it was a remnant, and she had it of Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it is worth more than half a guinea?</p>
               <p>A. Curtis. It is dirty, and there is several spots in it; and she said he let her have it cheap (produc'd in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Jones. What is the value of that piece of silk?</p>
               <p>Jones. It cost me to the best of my remembrance 18 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>A. Curtis. She brought me also a black figured cloak, and told me she had it of a lady's woman, that had no lining.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her for that?</p>
               <p>A. Curtis. I gave her a guinea for that (produc'd in court.)</p>

            . I bought two remnants of yellow stuff of the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. That is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Blackiter. Is any thing here that you bought of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. Yes, here is the cloak I bought of her (produc'd) to the best of my remembrance the outside cost 15 s. and as to the lining, she and I were to settle that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy it?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I think it was before Christmas, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she had them?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. She said they were odd remnants of Mr. Jones's, as I understood her, she said Mr. Jones trusted her to sell them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This cloak is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trust the prisoner to sell it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I bought this piece of yellow silk of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This I call yellow and white shot lutestring, it is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Blackiter. What did you give her for that?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. To the best of my knowledge I gave her 3 l. 7 s. for that and some gause.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she come by that?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. She said she was a lady's woman; and that the lady was going to be married, and she gave her them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I have known her almost 7 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. My husband is a baker, I have trusted her in my shop, and looked upon her to be an honest person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This witness bought a gown of me, and paid Mr. Jones for it, it was a silveret.</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I bought a piece of the prisoner, and paid Mr. Jones for it afterwards in his shop.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is not said in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I mention this, to shew Mr. Jones trusted me to sell things.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Blackiter. When did you buy that piece you mentioned?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I think it was about last Christmas that the prisoner brought it to me, I think it was yellow silveret, two remnants, I bought it of her, and paid Mr. Jones for it in his own shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you send her with them remnants?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Last year I sold a parcel of remnants as is usual at times in our shop; perhaps there might be such a thing as that, I cannot contradict that, for I gave the prisoner a gown myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mrs. Blackiter paying of you.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe she did, but I cannot remember it; I never trusted the prisoner to sell any thing to my knowledge on my own acount.</p>

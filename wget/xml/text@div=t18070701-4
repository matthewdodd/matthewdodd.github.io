            , junior. Q. I believe the prisoner has been in your service. - A. Yes, he came into my service on the 21st of January last, I hired him for a few weeks; he had <rs id="t18070701-4-deflabel26" type="occupation">sold horses</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18070701-4-defend78 t18070701-4-deflabel26"></join> for me before. In the month of March, I told him to sell me a horse, the price of the horse was eighty guineas; he came to me two days after, he told me that he could not get eighty guineas for it, but that lord Craven's groom would give seventy-four. I told him that I had so many horses that I must get rid of them, he must take the seventy four guineas; he came to me in the evening and said he had sold the horse, and gave me the seventy four guineas in bank notes and cash.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you authorised him to take the money. - A. Yes, I had authorised him to sell the horse, and likewise to receive the money. I spoke to him on account of his bringing the money in that way; I said to him where is the check; he then said that lord Craven's groom had some other drafts, and he had changed the money; I then said to him there must be some rascality in this business, and I would let lord Craven know. He then said if I did, I should ruin him and lord Craven's groom to; he also said, in an impertinent way, I will never sell a horse for you again; he said all servants must live. I immediately said have not you wages, he replied a man must get something for selling a horse, these things are always happening, we must live in this sort of way, a man cannot live upon his wages, it is a regular way.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose horse did he tell you it was. - A. Mr Fawkes's.</p>
               <p>Q. At what price did he offer you that horse for lord Craven. - A. Eighty guineas. I informed my lord Craven of it, he agreed to give eighty guineas for it I paid the prisoner eighty four pounds for the house; he gave me a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the receipt. - A. It is (read in court). I received two checks of my lord Craven; I received the money at the bankers, and out of that money I paid the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You say that you paid eighty four pounds. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you had no part out of that eighty four pounds. - A. I had no part of the eighty four pounds; he gave it me as a present out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was it not your bargain to pay seventy four pounds for the horse, and to divide the sum of six guineas between each of you. - A. No.</p>

Yes; the prisoner rode up to me one morning, just after I had let his lordship out; he asked me if his lordship was at home, I said no, sir, he is just gone out; he said he wished to speak to him concerning a horse he had sold to his groom Pentford; I suppose, says he, you have heard the story; no, I said, I know nothing at all about it; says he it is concerning a horse that I sold to his groom Pentford, and I find the man is like to lose his situation; he said, I certainly sold the horse for more than what I might have taken for him, but Pentford is not to blame, he had nothing to do in it, and I should be very sorry if the man lost his situation through it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

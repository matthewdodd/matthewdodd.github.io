            . I am clerk to the Magistrate of the Whitechapel-office - I produce a deposition made by the defendant, on the examination of Arthur Thompson, on a charge of forgery - I took it down - it was read over to him deliberately, before he signed it - he was asked if it was true - he said, Yes - he was perfectly collected, and appeared perfectly to understand it - he did not appear at all frightened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been a clerk at that office? A. Nearly twenty years- I remember his being first brought there; he appears to me to be a young man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mode of taking these examinations? A. The witnesses state their evidence to the Magistrate, and when he decides to commit, they are sent into the clerk's office to have their evidence written down; on this occasion I went into the office with the defendant; I asked him what he had said to the Magistrate, and what he had to state, and I wrote it down - I endeavoured to take the very words, and believe I did, on this occasion - I will not say I took down his very words, but the substance of what he said, that is our general practice - I took his own words as nearly as I could; he was examined twice; I read his deposition over to him in the presence of the Magistrate, and he signed it; we are sometimes much pressed with business at our office, but I have as much time as I think necessary to take down what a witness says. (The deposition was here read, in which the defendant swore positively that Arthur Thompson, the person then under examination, was the person who had delivered a note to him to take to Messrs. Taylor's brewery; on his return he saw him by the turnpike, that Thompson beckoned to the defendant, who then pointed him out to the officers; Thompson ran away, but was pursued and taken into custody.</p>

            . I am short-hand writer to the Court; the defendant was examined here last Sessions, on the trial of Arthur Thompson - I took his evidence in shorthand.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Will you read those parts of his evidence, which apply to this case? (Reads.) Q. How old are you? A. Seventeen years. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 2, James-street, Limehouse-fields. Q. On the first of July, did the prisoner accost you? A. Yes; I do not think that is the man (looking at him). Q. Are you sure about that? A. Yes; I am sure that is not the man. Q. Was there a man afterwards taken into custody? A. Yes. Q. Do you know whether that is the man who was taken into custody? A. Yes; he looks like the man. Q. When was he taken? A. On the first of July; Mr. Tuson, an officer, took him. Q. Did you point out the person who was to be taken into custody? A. I saw a person run across the road, and I said that looked like the man. Q. Was the man who ran across the road, and who you pointed out, the same person who had spoken to you before? A. He looked like the same person. Q. Was that person taken into custody? A. Yes. Q. Was the person taken into custody, the person you had seen before? A. I am not positive. Q. Were you positive then? A. No. Q. Do you mean to say you were not positive, and that you did not swear to him? A. No, I was not positive. Q. Have you never been positive about the man? A. Not altogether positive. Q. Now you say you are not positive that is the man? A. No, I am not. Q. Have you seen any friend of the prisoner's lately? A. No. Q. Had no communication with any one? A. No. Q. How long were you with any person whom you had any communication with? A. Do you mean the person who gave me the note? Mr. Brodrick. Yes. A. I suppose about ten minutes. Q. When that person was taken into custody by the constable, do you mean to say you did not speak to him positively? A. No. Q. Were you sworn before the Magistrate? A. Yes. Q. Was what you said taken down in writing? A. Yes. Q. When that man was taken into custody, did you not speak positively to him, to the officer? A. No, Sir. Q. You will swear that, will you? A. Yes. Q. Did you or not speak positively to the man, to the officer? A. No. Q. That you swear? A. Yes. Q. By the Court. Do you believe the man taken into custody, is the man who before had spoken to you? A. No, my Lord, I do not think it was the man. Q. You do not think he is the man who spoke to you? A. No. Q. Did you say so to the officer? A. No, I was so frightened at the time. Q. Did any person speak to you that day, and give you anything? A. The man spoke to me, and gave me a note. Q. What did you do with the note? A. I was to take it to Mr. Taylor's. Q. Did you point out any person then to the constable? A. No. Q. Did you point out that man then to Mr. Sewell, or to the constable? A. No, I did not point him out. Q. Did you say anything to them? A. No, I did not. Q. Did you say whether he was the man or not? A. No. Q. Now, young man, be particular, are you quite sure you did not point out that man, as the person who had spoken to you before? A. Yes. Q. Attend to the question, I am speaking of the time after this man was stopped; you say the person had him in custody - you came up first, then the constable, and afterwards Sewell; did you point out to the constable or to Sewell, that the man in custody was the person who spoke to you before?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260061"></xptr>A. I did not point at all. Q. Did you say that he was the man, or that he was not? A. No, I do not recollect saying a word. Q. Will you swear you did not say anything? A. I did not speak a word. Q. Do you mean to say you did not intimate in any way, that he was the man? A. No. Q. Did you afterwards state that to be the man? A. No. I did not think him to be the man - I had my (or great) doubts whether he was the man. Mr. Brodrick. Q. Now look at that (handing him the deposition), is that your signature? A. This looks like my writing. Q. Have you any doubt of it? A. No - it is my writing. Q. Now do not read it aloud, but read it to yourself, beginning here, "I the said

             on oath say" - (he does so) - was the account you have now seen read over to you before you signed it? A. I do not recollect it being read over. Q. Was what you said before the Magistrate written down? A. I do not know, my Lord - I said that to the officer, I believe, what is written down. Q. Was it afterwards read over to you? A. I do not recollect its being read over. Q. Did you sign it without its being read over? A. I believe I signed it without its being read over. Q. Now having read that, do you now know who was the person who came to you in the morning with the letter? A. Came to me in the morning with the letter? Q. You said a person came to you and gave you a note? A. Yes. Q. Where was it? A. At the top of Gill-street. Q. Who was that person? A. The man looked very much like the man at the bar; but that is not the man. Q. Now I advise you to be cautious - who was that man? A. I have seen a man since very much like that man. Q. You believe that not to be the man? A. Yes, my Lord. Q. After you had gone to Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sewell, and the constable came back with you, did you see the man who was taken up, before he began running? A. No, Sir. Q. Did the man who was running, or did he not, beckon to you? A. No, Sir, I do not think he beckoned to me - I do not recollect his beckoning. Q. Did he or not beckon to you? A. No, I do not think he did beckon. Q. Do you mean to say you do not think he did, or that he did not beckon? A. No, he did not beckon. Court. Q. Did you, or not, swear before the Magistrate that the prisoner did beckon to you? A. No, I do not recollect swearing that he beckoned to me. Q. Now look again, and tell me whether you have not sworn before the Magistrate that the prisoner did beckon to you - read the whole of it again - did you swear before the Magistrate that the prisoner beckoned to you? A. I do not recollect it. Q. Read and see (he reads) - Now did you before the Magistrate swear that the prisoner did beckon to you? A. It says so there, my Lord; but I do not recollect his beckoning. Q. The question is not whether you recollect it now, but whether you said so then? A. I do not recollect saying so. Q. Did you state before the Magistrate that the prisoner was the person who gave you the note? A. (after some hesitation) I had my doubts whether he was the man. Q. Did you state that it was the prisoner who came to you, talked to you, and gave you that letter? A. I believe I did; but I was so frightened, I did not know what I was swearing.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Taylor and Co. - the defendant brought this letter to our counting-house; it contained a forged cheque. Tuson and I appointed to meet him at Poplar turnpike, where he said the man was waiting; we went and saw him walking up and down, looking for the person, and after some time he called out, "Here he is, here he is" - I saw a man run across the road, and immediately we all three gave him chase as the defendant pointed him out - we ran in different directions - I saw no more of the man or the boy till I met them at the watch-house; it was Thompson, who was tried here; the defendant was asked by Tuson, at the watch-house, whether that was the man, and he said, in quite positive terms,"Yes, it is" - the person he pointed out was the same in figure and dress as the man who was taken, but I only saw his back - I heard the defendant examined at the office; he swore positively that he was the man; his deposition was read over to him; he said it was true, and signed it - he appeared quite calm and collected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. I suppose you were very eager to apprehend the man? A. My object was to find the right man; I have talked to the defendant since, and never observed any timidity about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you not urge him again and again, to be sure of the man who delivered the letter, before he spoke about it? A.

                  </hi> I am a clock dealer. On 19th of June the prisoner came to my premises in John-street, Minories, about the middle of the day—he selected a clock, which he agreed to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for—he requested it to be sent home to No. 16, Queen's-row, Walworth, before eight o'clock in the evening, when he would be at home, and pay for it—it was decidedly understood between us that it was to be paid for on delivery—I did not mean to part with it unless it was paid for—I sent my servant, Howard, to carry the clock home (I think Howard had heard the bargain between the prisoner and me) and to receive the money—I will not undertake to say that on that particular occasion he was told so, but that was his general direction—he brought me back this memorandum instead of the money—I sent to the pre<lb></lb>mises on the Monday or Tuesday following, and I was told the prisoner had absconded.</p>

                  </hi> I am porter to the prosecutor. On 19th June I took a clock to the prisoner's house, at Walworth—it is a private dwelling—I was present in Mr. Holloway's shop when the bargain was made—the prisoner came and looked at the clocks—he asked how they were sold—Mr. Holloway said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the prisoner said, "They seen good ones; send this one home to my dwelling in the course of the evening"—I do not re<lb></lb>collect the words exactly—I was at the other end of the shop—I did not hear any thing said about paying—I took the clock—I was not to leave it without the money—the prisoner was not at home when I first took it—I waited till he came in—he then went in the room and told me to hang it up—he asked if ir would go well—I said, "Yes; to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge"—I asked him for the money, and he said he would call and pay Mr. Holloway, if the clock was what it was represented to be—I said it was not a customary thing to leave the clock without the money, and if I did so I should be accountable for it myself—I asked him if he would give me a memorandum to say that he had received the clock and would call in two or three days, and he gave me this memorandum—this invoice is in my writing.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's solicitor, and live in Church-court. I prepared a warrant of attorney, and saw it executed by Mr. Ogle, for 613l. - this is the warrant I hold in my hand - on the 26th of September, I attended at the chambers of Mr. Justice Vaughan, and made an affidavit of the due execution of the warrant of attorney - I left it in the custody of Mr. Wilkinson, the Judge's clerk; and finding there might be some delay in obtaining the signature of the Judge to it, I said I would send my clerk for it, and left it in his care, in the mean time - I sent for it a day or two afterwards, and did not receive it back - I went myself to the chambers on the Tuesday following, and saw Mr. Wilkinson, but could hear nothing of it. On the 1st of October, Twisden called at my office in Church-court - it was Wednesday or Thursday - he told me he understood a warrant of attorney had been missed, and he thought he knew a person who had it in his possession - he produced me this note, which he said was sent by that person giving him the information - he then said, as the person had been at some expense in obtaining it from the person who had found it, he wished to know if I would give any thing for the purpose of obtaining it- I said I certainly should not advance or pay sixpence to any body who I thought was connected with taking the warrant of attorney, as I was certain it must have been taken from the Judge's chambers - I would not allow any thing for it; but as far as he was concerned, if I found he was in no way connected with the party, I should have no objection to remunerate him for his trouble if it was brought to me - he then said it was a £5 stamp - I said that would make no difference, for I was certain the defendant would execute a fresh one, and I should get that allowed - he then asked if I would give two or three guineas - I said I would not give him a single sixpence, as I felt it a duty to myself to prosecute the parties connected with it, if I could find out who they were - he then left me, and said he should call again - I sent Mr. Weemys, who was waiting there at the time, to watch him - and in consequence of information from Weemys, I went to the Mansion House within ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and procured an officer - my attention was directed to a public-house, and I saw the prisoner, Amos, in the street near the public-house - I cannot say I saw him come out of the house - I was with the officer when he was taken into custody - we then proceeded to my office with the officer, and found Twisden waiting there - I saw Amos searched at my office in Church-court - he was taken into custody and searched on the spot- when I saw the affidavit it was on a whole sheet of paper, and the blank half of the sheet on which the affidavit was written was found on Amos - (looking at it) I believe this to be the half-sheet certainly - when Twisden was about to be searched, he put his hand into his pocket and took out the warrant of attorney, handed it to me, and said, "There, Mr. Knight, there is your warrant of attorney, and if you behave like a gentleman you will do as you said" - we went to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. When did you first send to the Judge's chambers after leaving the warrant of attorney there? A. I think I directed my clerk to call the following day - I called myself, three days afterwards, in consequence of a communication from my clerk - I did not go the same day - I left the warrant of attorney myself at the office on the 26th with Mr. Wilkinson - he was then standing in an outer office, to which the public have access - I suppose there were fifty persons there on business at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that document be of any possible benefit to the defendants, except by getting a reward from you? A. If they delivered it over to Mr. Ogle it would be of benefit to him; but I knew he had honour enough to execute another - Twisden said himself, before the magistrates, that he had been endeavouring to see Mr. Ogle several times as a party to that warrant of attorney - he did not say he wanted to inquire of Mr. Ogle where my office was - my address is in the document itself, and the affidavit states my description and address at full length - Twisden did not tell me, when he called, that he had been to Ogle - he said he knew the parties - the note did not contain my address - it says, "a Mr. Knight" - he did not say he had been to Ogle to inquire my address - he was taken the second time he came - he stated before the magistrate that he went to Ogle to inquire my address.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The representation he made to you was, that the warrant was in the possession of another person, and he applied that two or three guineas should be given for the trouble the party had who got it from the person who found it? A. Yes - Twisden did not tell me he had seen the document - he said he was acting under the instructions contained in the note - he said he would see the party, and endeavour to get it - he came to me as a man knowing the person who had the warrant of attorney - he came to my office of his own accord the second time - he did not produce the document as soon as I came in - I told the officer to search him - he searched Amos; and after finishing his search, and putting down the particulars of what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160062"></xptr>he found, he proceeded to search Twisden; and when he began his search, and not till then, Twisden put his hand in his pocket, took out the warrant of attorney, and handed it over to me - the officer had laid his hand on him before he produced it - I have the half-sheet of the affidavit - there is no writing on it, nor mark - to the best of my belief, it is the other half of the affidavit - it has the same watermark as my own paper, and there is the mark of a pin at the top, which I recollect pinning at the Judge's chambers- the affidavit has never been found; and there is a crease- it is the common way of creasing paper in the profession- the affidavit was appended to the warrant of attorney - if it had been lost, it would be likely to be lost with it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Twisden did not tell me he had called on Mr. Ogle - I understood from him, when he first called on me, that I was the first person he had been to. (Note read.) "Mr. Twisden - Sir, I will get you to call on N. Ogle, Esq., No. 58, Baker-street, Portman-square, and inform him I can return into his hands a document of the value of 613l. 15s. 3d., with a £5 stamp thereon; but I must know what reward he will give you to deliver the same into his hands, as I have had both exponse and much trouble in obtaining the same from the party who found it- I know it must be of value to him, but do not much understand such things - I do not find any name on the document except 'Knight,' the witness thereto. I expect he has nothing to do with it as to the value. - WM. B."</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Justice Vaughan. On the 26th of September, I received a warrant of attorney from Mr. Knight, with an affidavit annexed to it - he left it for me to take care of till he should send for it - he afterwards sent for it - I had not got it then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were you to do with it? A. To get the Judge's signature to the affidavit - I could not immediately get it signed by the Judge - I afterward obtained the Judge's signature, and had it in my care for Mr. Knight - he sent for it on the Saturday or Monday - it was given to me on Friday - I left it on my desk - I never took it out of the premises - I looked for it when it was sent for, and could not find it - it had not been out of the chambers - I replaced it on my desk with some other papers - the warrant and affidavit were pinned together - I have seen Amos about Sergeant's Inn frequently - I do not recollect seeing him that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your desk is in the outer office, is not it? A. Yes - a great number of persons have access to the office - there are generally a great number there when the Judge is in his chambers - there were a great many on the 26th, (Saturday) - the Judge was not there on the 27th, nor Monday - when it was applied for, I looked among a number of papers on my desk, expecting to find it - I occasionally go into the Judge's room, leaving my office with persons there - persons occasionally, of their own accord, take, from my department of the office, affidavits, which have been left, without asking me for them; but I know who they are - I cannot say whether any of those persons took this document.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was it left open? A. Yes - I should not think it could be taken up with other papers - I am quite certain I laid it on my desk - I never saw it afterwards, till I saw it at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. Q. You have been asked whether any body could go and take any papers; do you deliver out papers to people yourself? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON. Q. Did not you tell me people were in the habit of taking their own papers? A. They generally say, "I want such an affidavit" - I say, "Take it" - they are within arm's length of me, and I can see that they take their own paper - my desk is quite open - I can reach to the back of my desk without rising from my chair - there is another clerk in the office, but he has nothing to do with the papers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. May he have delivered out the document? A. I do not think he would without speaking to me first: he does not attend to that department - he gives out documents, certainly - he was there that day - he is not here.</p>

            . I am a cooper. I was in Mr. Knight's office on Thursday, the 2nd of October - Twisden came in, and, in consequence of directions from Mr. Knight, I followed him into Clement's-lane, and saw him join Amos - they appeared in close conversation together, about seventy or eighty yards from the office - I watched them along the new street from the bridge - they walked together, and stopped several times, and appeared in very close conversation together - I watched them into a public-house opposite the Mansion House - I went back to Mr. Knight's office - then went to the Mansion House, and got an officer - I saw them come out of the same public-house - they stopped near the Bank a few minutes, then crossed the road towards Mr. Knight's office, and went down the new street, stopping several times as before - Twisden left Amos at the corner of Clement's-lane, towards Mr. Knight's office - at that time Mr. Knight came up in company with a policeofficer - I pointed Amos out to the officer, and he took him to Mr. Knight's office, and I there saw Twisden - Amos was searched, and several papers were found on him - I cannot say whether this note was found on Amos or Twisden - I saw Twisden searched, and after the officer began searching him, he pulled a paper out of his pocket, thrust it by the officer, and presented it to Mr. Knight, saying,"That, I believe, is what you are wanting, that is the instrument; if you are a gentleman, I hope you will act as one," or words to that effect - while I saw the defendants in close conversation, something passed between them that appeared like paper - Amos had on a brown hat.</p>

Do you know Mr. Knight?" - I said, "Yes, I have heard Mr. Ogle speak of such a person" - he said, "Do you know his office?" - I said, "No; it is somewhere in the City" - he held up a piece of paper, and said, "I have a property here, 700l." - then called his words, and said, "615l." - I said Mr. Ogle was not at home - I went in, had my dinner, and then went into the City - I met Mr. Ogle, and told him what had passed - he went to Mr. Knight directly - when Twisden came to our house, I saw a person across the road - it was rather dark, and I could not observe his dress - he appeared a short, thick man.</p>

I had a letter for the lying-in charity, and left home about a quarter past nine o'clock, returned in an hour - went to my box to put the letter into it, and this property was gone. I do not think I had locked the room door - my children were at school. I found the sheets and a quilt in about an hour and a half, at Price's, but have found nothing else.

The prosecutrix and her husband came to me about half-past nine o'clock, and said they were robbed by a young man in a seaman's dress. I went to look for him - the prisoner came along Winfield-street, and seeing me coming towards him, he crossed over and ran away, I called to my partner, who stopped him. Mealings said,</p>

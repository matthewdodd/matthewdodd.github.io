                  </hi>. I am President of the London District department of the General Post-office. On 8th May I caused a letter to be written and addressed to Miss Eliza Barnham, Erbistock, Wrexham, North Wales, and put in it half-a-sovereign and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated 1826, which I had previously marked in two places—I sealed the letter and gave it to Peak, the officer, in the presence of Mr. Cole, the inspector of letter-carriers—it was stamped about three o'clock in the afternoon—if it was posted at the Isling<lb></lb>ton Post-office between four and five, it would be forwarded in the five o'clock collection, and would reach the Post-office at half-past five—I was there when the bag arrived—it contained no such letter—I then went with Peak to the Islington receiving-house, kept by Mr. Braden—we arrived there a little after six, and found the prisoner behind the counter, and two other young men—I asked who made up the five o'clock collection; who counted the stamped letters—one of the men said, in the prisoner's presence, he had <hi rend="italic">told up</hi> the paid letters—I asked the prisoner whether he had assisted with the stamped letters—he said he had not; that Edwin, who was up-stairs, had counted them—Edwin came down and said, in the prisoner's hearing, that the prisoner had <hi rend="italic">faced</hi> the stamped letters; that is, turned the directions all one way—I do not recollect whether the prisoner said anything, but I told Peak to take him into a private room and search him—I had mentioned, in the presence of all three, that a letter which I had given to the officer to post had not reached the general office—Peak searched the prisoner in my presence, and took from him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find my marks on it—I said, "This is my shilling"—he said, "No, it is mine; I brought it from home yesterday at one o'clock; I took it from the mantel-price with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I have had ever since; I spent 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in tobacco"—he was taken away in custody—the letter and half-sovereign have not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Alexander Braden, who keeps the post-office at Islington; I am eighteen years old, and assist in the post-office, and the prisoner also. On 8th May I took out the largest part of the letters at twelve minutes to five o'clock—the box closes at five—I took out some more at ten minutes to five, and the prisoner took the re<lb></lb>mainder at five—they are then <hi rend="italic">faced-up</hi>, tied in bundles, and sent into the back office—the prisoner wished me to go down and check the paid letters which were being stamped, to count them, and see if they are right—that is done at the end of the counter, and sometimes while they are being faced; it was so then—he said he would face them up while I checked the "paid"—he did so, excepting about twenty which I faced-up—there were 106 altogether, about eighty of which passed through the prisoner's hands—Mr. Stead had stamped them—they were then tied up in bundles and put into the bag—they were completed five or ten minutes past five, and the prisoner then went away, and was gone about half an hour—I did not notice any letter addressed "Miss Barnham, Erbistock, North Wales."</p>

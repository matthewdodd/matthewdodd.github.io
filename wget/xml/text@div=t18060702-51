             sworn. I apprehended the prisoner at the bar on the 26th; on going to Bow street she acknowledged she robbed the man and she had spent the money, and she had took the watch, it was hid in the house somewhere; I searched her room, I shaked the bed, I heard the chain of the watch jingle in the bed where the man said he was with her, I took the watch from out of the tick of the bed, it was amongst the feathers.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He told me he would give me the watch for an ilicit purpose, he having no money, he did not come with any money to me for three nights after he gave it me, and without he gave me some money I did not mean to give it him back again.</p>

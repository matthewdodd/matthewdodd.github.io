                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Lucas-street, St. George's. On the 5th of July, I went into a shop in Ratcliff Highway—the prisoners came in after me, and stood at my right side—I had my bag in my hand, which contained two sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, three half-crowns, and 6 shillings—I missed my bag and money as soon I got three or four yards from the shop—I went home, and my daughter went to the police-office, and gave notice—I did not take my bag out of my pocket in the shop, but I felt it while I was getting my halfpence—some children had come into the shop.</p>

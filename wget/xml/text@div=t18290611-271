               <p>and I asked how she could ask that for them, as they were not worth so much.</p>
               <p>MARY GRIFFITHS. I lost more property than this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where is Mr. Griffiths? A. He has been dead these three years; I am not married now; I do not live in the house with the prisoner - I know Hawksby, but I never asked through him for 2l., of the prisoner; I never said, that if the prisoner would give 2l. I would drop the business - I had no conversation with him about these things; I know the prisoner by sight, but I do not think I ever spoke to him.</p>
               <p>DAVID MCCRAY. I took up the prisoner in his father's house - he gave himself up to me; he said two young men came and asked him to pawn the parcel for them, and they would recompence him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS called -</p>
               <p>- KING. I am a butcher. I was talking to the prisoner, and two young men came up and called him away; I went home, and did not see him for an hour or an hour and a half afterwards - I did not notice that they had any bundle; I do not remember what day it was - I was at the corner of Adam and Eve-court, and he was called over to Playhouse-yard.</p>

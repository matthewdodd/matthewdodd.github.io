            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 20th of May, about eleven o'clock in the day, I was in Barbican - I saw the prisoner, and a person shorter than him, following a gentleman; I saw the prisoner go up to the gentleman several times, and make attempts at his pocket - they left that gentleman, went on to Finsbury-square, and then followed another gentleman up Chiswell-street into <placeName id="t18290611-351-crimeloc1841">Beech-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. So you neither have the handkerchief, nor the gentleman? A. No; I have never prosecuted for stealing from persons unknown before - I did not think I was justified in taking him for an attempt.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CLITHEROW. I am a City officer. I was crossing the street, and saw Craig with the prisoner; he spoke to a person who was with me, and asked if he was a City officer - he said No, and I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You saw no handkerchief? A. No; I searched the prisoner, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was searched, but nothing was found.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM CRAIG. Q.Did you see the handkerchief? A. Yes; and he ran across the road - I did not see it afterwards. <rs id="t18290611-351-verdict1842" type="verdictDescription">

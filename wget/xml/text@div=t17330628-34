Jacobs! your House is broke open! I got up and found the Till of my Shop broke; the Lock and Brass Tobacco-Box that my Money was in lay upon the Counter, but the Money (50 s.) was gone. I went backward and found my Casement, which neither opens nor shuts, was taken off, mash'd 10 pieces, and thrown under the Window; there was a Shutter belonging to it, which I had fastened myself over Night with a wooden Bar and Pin and Key; but I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280021"></xptr> found the Bar had been wrench'd till the Spring of the Key was broke, and so it was forc'd open. I found the Prisoner's Shoes in the Room, and going to the Stable in the Yard, I found him lying there without Shoes, 2 s. hid in the Hay lost.</p>
               <p>Henry Lane, Watchman. Being at my Stand I heard a Noise of a Window breaking ; I planted my Brother Watch at the Street-door and went backwards, and finding the Window broke open, I called the Prosecutor up: I went in; the till was open, and the Lock and a Brass Box lying on the Counter. A pair of Shoes lay by the Window, and one said, I know those Shoes and the Owner of them, and he can't be far off. We found the Prisoner in the Stable with his Head under the Manger, and without Shoes. He own'd the Shoes to be his. - The Stable is about 20 Yards from the Window.</p>

               <p>Palmer. He lived in the Lane; I saw him at Jacob's but the Day before, and he shew'd me his Shoes because they were so bad, and he would have given me 3 d. for mine, and he used to wear them shod, as you may see plainly by the hind Quarters. The Stable-door had been nail'd up for some Time, so that there is no way into it but by getting up into the Hay-loft ; so we got up and came down into the Stable, and there he lay in a muck Sweat, without his Shoes; I burst the Stable-door open with my Backside to get him out, and he own'd the Shoes.</p>

I had been drinking at the Prosecutor's till between 11 and 12 at Night, and then I was so overtaken that I could not find my way out, and so I fell asleep; two or three pushed me and waked me, and then they carried me into the Stable, and said I had better lye there out of the way; and I was surprized when they came in the Morning and charged me with breaking the House.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Gurney, of West Ham. On the 27th Dec, about 12 o'clock at noon, I was on the box of his carriage in Bishopsgate-street—there was no one in the carriage—it was standing still—I felt a jerk at the carriage—I turned round, and saw this man with half his body inside the door of the carriage—he had the shawl on his arm, and was in the act of taking a reticule bag and umbrella from the carriage—when I turned round he looked me in the face, snatched the articles from the carriage, and ran away with them down Camomile-street—I jumped down from the carriage, and followed him—he dropped the things in Camomile-street, as I was running after him—I followed him up St. Mary Axe, and came up with him just as the policeman stopped him—I had only lost sight of him as he turned the corner—I am sure the man who was stopped was the same man who ran off with the things—I saw him drop them, and a person took them up and gave them to me—they belonged to Miss Sarah Gurney, she had come up in the carriage that day—I had set her down at Houndsditch.</p>

About 10 minutes past 12 o'clock on the 27th Dec, I was on duty in St. Mary Axe—I saw the prisoner running—I heard a cry and stopped him—he said, "I did not do it; I know nothing about it"—I had not said a word to him about it—I was too much out of breath—these articles were in possession of the last witness.</p>

Q.</hi> There were a good many otter persons running? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in Camomile-street; 200 or 300 I should think—the prisoner was stopped in St. Mary Axe—I have made some inquiries respecting him—he gave a correct name and address, and some money he had on him he told me he had taken out of the savings bank, I found that to be correct—another person held out his arm and stopped the prisoner, and I came up directly.</p>

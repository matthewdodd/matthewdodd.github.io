On Sunday evening, the 14th of September, I went to bed at six o'clock precisely - my door was fastened with a spring-lock, but it has no bolts; I examined it with a candle before I went to bed - I have known the prisoner many years; he was in the habit of coming to my house till within a few months; about ten o'clock I awoke, and discovered him holding his hand over my head - I sleep in a press bedstead: my watch lays on the bedstead; he had a candle in his hand - I knew him perfectly well: his hand was reaching over to the top of the bedstead, where the watch was, with my snuff-box and brooch; I said,"You thundering villian, is it you? is it possible, Dick?" and he went out with the rapidity of a shot, down stairs; I found my watch was gone, and when I got down stairs the sideboard drawer was half open; I missed a shirt from it - I have not found any of the property: I went with the Policeman about one o'clock on the Tuesday, and took him at his lodging in a little court in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you any relation to the prisoner? A. He is the son of a half sister of mine; I often go to bed early - I had dined at a friend's, and left there at a quarter-past two o'clock; I drank once out of a pot of beer, but had no spirits - I then went home and read; I had dined in Fashion-street - I drank nothing at home but tea; the prisoner has seen my watch on the bed when he has called - I did not exactly know where he lived; I knew the neighbourhood: I inquired at the different pawnbrokers for my property on the Monday - I told his father of it on Monday morning - he did not live with his father.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Sunday evening, a little after ten o'clock, Prior came to me, and stated this to have happened about a quarter of an hour before - he gave me the name of the person; I went with him on the Tuesday, to No. 2, Golden Fleece-court, Minories; the prisoner denied the charge, and said he could prove he was at home; there was an altercation between the prisoner's father and the prosecutor, respecting a younger son of his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What about? A. He was to inquire through the younger son to trace the watch.</p>

            . I am a pew-opener of Aldgate church, and have been so for ten years. The prisoner lodged at my house in Golden Fleece-court. On the evening of yesterday week he was at Mrs. Jones', which is five minutes' walk from our house, till half-past nine o'clock - he came in about five minutes to ten, and went to bed; he did not go out any more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know where Prior lives? A. Yes, it is about five minutes' walk from our house; I saw the prisoner come in - I looked at my clock, and it wanted five minutes to ten o'clock; I had to get up early to go to work, and gave the watchman 1d. to call me, and when he called ten, the prisoner and his wife were in bed.</p>
               <p>- JONES. My husband works at St. Katharine's-docks - I live at the King's Arms, Shoreditch, about five minutes' walk from Conway's. Last Sunday week the prisoner was at our house all the evening, with his wife and three children; I let them all out while the watchman was calling half-past nine o'clock.</p>

            . I live in Onslow-street. On the 22d of April, between eleven and three o'clock, I was in and out of Tencham's room, and saw the prisoner there; I had seen him in Peter-street about nine o'clock, with Tencham - both seemed very much intoxicated; the prisoner had a flannel jacket, but no coat on. Between eleven and twelve I saw him go into the house with Tencham, dressed as before; I went in, and saw them both sitting together; Tencham took a coat, trowsers, and handkerchief out of his box, and hung on the line; and between two and three o'clock, as I sat at dinner, the prisoner passed my window with the same coat on as I had seen Tencham put on the line; Brooks, who was in my room, went out to stop him - they were tussling together; she asked how he came by the coat - he said it was nothing to her. I went out, laid hold of him, and saw part of the handkerchief hanging out of his hat; Brooks took his hat off, and took it out; we forced him into Tencham's room, and Tencham said, "John, take my coat off," which he did. The coat and handkerchief were brought into my place. I was with Mrs. Tencham on the 23d, and met him on Saffron-hill - we gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner tipsy when he left the house? A. Not that I saw - Tencham was with him when he had it on, walking in a friendly manner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did Tencham say about your stopping him? A. Not a word.</p>

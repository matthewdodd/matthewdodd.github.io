                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother William, and live in Wardour-street. We missed some lead on the 20th of Feb., when the policeman called—I have examined this lead—it is ours—the prisoner worked for me up to this time—the punch that these pieces are marked with I made myself rather in an unusual way, out of a flat chisel, and the ends of it are broken off—these holes were made on the previous Friday.</p>

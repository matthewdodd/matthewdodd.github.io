On the 6th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop making motions that he wished to see something for handkerchiefs; I left the prisoner and went to look for the articles, and when I returned I perceived him putting something in his pocket. I afterwards saw his jacket pocket projected out very much, and from the manner of his keeping his arm down, I suspected that he had stole something. I called Mr. Holford from the other side of the shop, he immediately went up to him, and took the chambry out of his pocket. The prisoner at first said it was his; upon Mr. Holford shewing him the mark, the prisoner endeavoured to get away.</p>

             waited upon him, to shew him the articles. In a few minutes he informed Mr. Holford, that he had reason to suppose that the prisoner had stolen something; Mr. Holford went up to the prisoner, and took it out of his pocket; I saw it hang partly out of his pocket. The prisoner denied having stolen it, he said he had bought it; he was then taken in custody, and taken to the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland</p>

               <p>Q. Was it not a natural colour for a foreign sailor to use. - A. Provided it was in handkerchiefs.</p>

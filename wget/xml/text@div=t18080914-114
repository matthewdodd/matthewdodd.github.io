On the 9th of August the prisoner came to my house, about five o'clock in the afternoon, he asked for a lodging; he looked like a decent old man, I let him have a lodging; he was to sleep where

             sleep there that night - A. He did not. About eight o'clock on the 10th of August he got up, he breakfasted and asked my leave to go and lay down again, he said he was poorly; I consented to it. Between ten and eleven o'clock I was coming out of the tap room. I met him just by the bar door, as he was coming from the stair foot; I thought he looked bigger than when he went up, his right hand pocket stuck out; I told him I thought he had something more than his own; he said he had not; I pulled out of his right hand coat pocket a shirt; he pulled out a pair of trowsers and a relief card, which this young man was relieved at my house, by the society of cork cutters; when they travel to town they give them so much money. Three handkerchiefs and a waistcoat was bound round his body; he was then taken in custody; I sent for Lewis, he claimed the things.</p>

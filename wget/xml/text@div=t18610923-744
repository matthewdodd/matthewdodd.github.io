                  </hi>. I am one of the City detectives—I went, on 12th September, with Robert Tilley, another officer, at about 1 o'clock, the dinner hour, and watched Mr. Parnall's warehouse, in Bishopsgate-street without—after I had stood there about ten minutes I saw Brown leave the warehoues and walk towards Bishopsgate-church—when about twenty yards from the warehouse he met Mead—they walked together to the White Hart public-house in Bishopsgate-street, and had something to drink together—then they left there, and walked arm-in-arm to Wormwood-street, turned into Union-court, and went into No. 11—I stood at the end of Union-court watching the door of the house in company with Tilley—we remained there about ten minutes—Mead then came out with a parcel wrapped up in brown paper—at the time they went in neither of them had a parcel that we could see—Mead was turning towards us in Worm wood-street—he saw us standing looking up the court, and immediately turned round and went the other way through another outlet into Broad-street—Tilley went round to meet him coming out at the other end—I went to No. 11, the back part of the house, and found Brown in the closet—Tilley then brought back Mead with a coat wrapped up in a parcel—we then told the two that we were offi<lb></lb>cers, and should take Brown into custody for having robbed his employed, and that we should charge Mead with receiving the coat—we then conveyed them to the station—I searched Brown, and in his possession I found six pawnbroker's tickets—one is for a coat pledged on 12th August, at Mr. Fryett's, 16, Whitechapel-road, in the name of John Mead; the other is for a coat pawned on 16th August, at Mr. Cotton's, in Hackney-road, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of James Layard—we opened the parcel at the station—it was partly open.</p>

I am foreman to Robert and Henry Parnall, of 18, Bishopsgate-street, clothiers—Brown was employed on our premises as a cutter—I have seen the coat produced—it is one belonging to our firm—it is the one that was taken from Mead by Smart—I had seen it safe at 10 o'clock that same morning—I may say it was safe at half-past 12 o'clock—my attention was first called to it at 10 o'clock—there are three coats here; I have previously identified the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mead's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows:</hi>—"Yesterday, when Brown gave me the coat, I was not aware it was stolen. He asked me to take it for him to my place, and I was to meet him in the evening and give it to him. As to the pledge ticket, Brown asked me to buy the ticket, as he said he thought the coat would fit me. I gave him half-a-crown for the ticket, and took it out and tried it on; it was rather too large; I was not aware it was stolen, and pledged it in Whitechapel for the same money; and Brown gave me the half-crown back again, and I gave him the ticket; I pledged it in my own name."</p>

A fortnight or three weeks; no man in our employ had quarreled with him to my knowledge - my foreman stopped him, and told him to come back to the counting-house - this duster was in his hat as well; he might have put it on without knowing they were in it; he was perfectly sober - he said at the office that he did not know they were there.</p>

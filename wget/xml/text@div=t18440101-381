                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 51.) On the 30th of Nov., about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in High-street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner and another—the prisoner took two rolls of Cloth from inside the prosecutor's door—I went after him—he was walking with the cloth under his arm—he was stopped by two of the prosecutor's shopmen, about fifteen or twenty yards from the shop—he said, "You would have lost your cloth, sir, if it had not been for me; a man threw it down, and I picked it up "—he was given into my charge—in crossing the street towards the station, he began scuffling with me, and kicked me several times—I then endeavoured to get him into the shop again; in doing so, he got his legs between mine, and struck me—we both fell, and some more got on the top of me—I held him for some moments on the ground, and tore the tail of his coat off, but I was so overpowered that he got away—I found him on Wednesday, the 13th of Dec, at the Star public-house—he then denied being the man, and said I had made a mistake—he was taken to the prosecutor's, and shown to the shop<lb></lb>men—I am sure he is the same man—when I first saw him I believed him to be the man, but would not swear to him—it was a very dark, foggy day—when I saw him the second time, I was positive he was the man.</p>

"and he said, "I think it is;" he said, "Come along with me;" I said, "What for?" he said, "For stealing two rolls of cloth"—I went to the prosecutor's shop; there were about ten shopmen; he showed me up the shop twice, and back again, and asked if they knew anything of me; they said no; but when he said, "Do you know anything of the man that stole the roll of cloth? up jumps one and said, "That is the man."</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Jacob Dudden and another. On the 30th of Nov., about a quarter-past four o'clock in the afternoon, in conse<lb></lb>quence of what a lad told me, I looked out, and saw the prisoner take two rolls of tweed, and walk away about sixteen or twenty yards—I ran after him, stop<lb></lb>ped him, and asked what he was about to do with them—he said he was going to take care of them—they are worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—they were just inside the door, and were the two top pieces of a pile—he was going away from the shop—I got the assistance of a constable, and he was taken back to the shop—Pipe came in, and he was given into his charge—I observed a crowd of about twenty bad characters round the door, and when Pipe got the pri<lb></lb>soner a short distance, the crowd pushed them up to the mouth of a court a few yards from our house, rescued the prisoner, knocked the policeman down, and very much ill-used him—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who took the cloth—he is differently dressed, but I can speak to him from his features and voice—he was in our shop five or six minutes—he was</p>

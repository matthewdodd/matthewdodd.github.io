                  </hi>. I live in Northumberland-passage. The prisoner came to me on a Wednesday morning, a little before dinner-time—he said he had got some <hi rend="italic">cabbage</hi> to sell, and would bring it down—he brought it at nearly nine o'clock in the evening, in a hat-box in a bag—he put it over my window at my shop, and I looked at it—I pulled out a dozen top-pieces, which had Mr. Stunt's mark on them—I put my hand into the bag again, and pulled out another dozen—I asked what he wanted for them—he said a sovereign—he said there were nine dozen heel-pieces, and nine dozen welts—I declined purchasing them—he said if I did not like to buy them, Mr. Gil<lb></lb>bert would—he said would I buy one dozen—I said no, I had no money, and if I had I could buy better leather for my use for a sovereign—he then drew the strings of the bag, and took it on his shoulder—a young man by his side said he never saw such <hi rend="italic">cabbage</hi> as that, and I said so too—I never saw such <hi rend="italic">cabbage</hi>, nor anybody else.</p>

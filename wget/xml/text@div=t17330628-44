I wrote to Mr. Brereton, and received his Answer the 16th of February, after which, Smith and Griffith came to me again; I told them we had agreed that the Sisters and their Husbands should all be conusant of the Fine; and as the two Estates were in the same Parish, to save the Charge of two Fines they were to join them in one. Griffith agreed to this Fine, and undertook to go next Morning into Essex (where he said Smith's Brothers and Sisters lived) and procure them to come up next Monday: And on Monday in the Afternoon he came and told me, that the Brothers and Sisters were come up, and desired me to get all ready against next Day. It happened my Lord Chief Justice was not then at Leisure, and so we agreed on Wednesday. I went on Wednesday to his Lordship's Chambers, and in the Evening Griffith came to me there, and said that Mr. Smith and his Brothers and Sisters were all below ; I went down with him, and he shewed me the Prisoners sitting on a Bench under the Arch of Serjeants-Inn: Are these they? says I; Yes, says he. I proposed that they should go to the Coffee-house, and be made acquainted with what they came about. It was agreed to, and we all went together into an Inner-Room.</p>

               <p>P. Coun. But you are not positive which is which</p>
               <p>Mr. H. The Prisoners were altogether in the Room, and I said to Mr. Smith, Are these your Brothers and Sisters who are to join in the Fine? he answer'd, Yes. Have you told them, says I, what they are to do? he said, Yes; and that he had paid them the Consideration Money. I ask'd the three Women if their Brother had paid them that Money, and if they were content to pass the Fine? they in general answer'd, Yes.</p>
               <p>P. Coun. But can you take upon you to say, that they all, or any one in particular, answer'd, Yes?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280023"></xptr>Mr. H. I can't say that every one in particular answer'd, that they had received a Consideration ; but Mr. Smith said, he had paid them the Consideration Money; and the Women said, in general, Yes. I think Prestidge said, that they were all contented.</p>
               <p>P. Coun. If they only said they were contented to pass the Fine, they might not be apprised of the Iniquiry of the thing. Can you be positive that every one in particular said before she sign'd, that she had received the Consideration Money?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. I can't be so particular. I produc'd a Paper, and wrote the Concord - The Precipe was in Latin, and I read it to them in English - I produc'd the Instrument at the same time that I ask'd the Questions, and desired Mr. Smith to write his Name first, which he did, and the others sign'd after him.</p>
               <p>P. Coun. It's laid that one personated one, and another another: Now what particular Person did Josias Reader personate?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. I think the Name of Scruby was sign'd by Reader. Court. Which is Reader ?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. He that stands behind there.</p>
               <p>P. Coun. How can you take upon you to swear that Reader, rather than any other Person, subscribed the Name of Scruby ?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. I believe it was he Court. Do you remember his Act of subscribing?</p>
               <p>Mr. H. I asked who was the elder Brother, and as I remember, Reader answer'd, and wrote first: I believe it was he, but I cannot be positive to a Man that I never saw in my Life before. The next Name is

               <p>P. C. Can you take upon you to say which of the Prisoners at the Bar, answer'd to the Name of Scruby ? Mr. B. I believe it was Reader, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you recollect the Act of each, and apply it to each ?</p>
               <p>Mr. B. No; nor do I remember the Identity of the Persons; except it be Pretidge, and, I think, I remember her, one of other of them answered to all the Names. I asked them if they were content to levy the Fine of the Premises within mentioned, and they consented. P. Coun. Are you sure they all answered? Mr. B. I cannot say whether they answered or bowed. Then the pretended Husbands withdrew, and the Women staid to be examined apart. His Lordship asked one of them, if she was willing to pass the Fine without Compulsion ? - She hesitated. - Upon which he asked her where she was born, and what her Maiden Name was? She appeared confused. Another of the Women who was behind, fell in a Swoon; and the third, which, I think was Prestidge, came behind the first, and told her it would be best<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280024"></xptr> to discover the Truth; upon which (before the Men came in) they confest the Whole, and said that

               <p>P. Coun. Was the sole Examination over? Had they perfected the Fine before the Discovery was made?</p>
               <p>Mr. B. The first Woman hesitated at the beginning of the sole Examination.</p>
               <p>P. C. Then the other two Women had not been examined at all?</p>
               <p>Mr. B. I think they had not.</p>
               <p>P. C. Don't his Lordship sign the Caption, when the Examination is perfected, and the Fines are acknowledged? Mr. B. Yes.</p>
               <p>P. C. And had he sign'd this? Mr. B. No.</p>
               <p>P. C. Then it was not perfected - Are not your Questions to them, only Preparatory?</p>
               <p>Mr. B. Yes; for after those Questions, his Lordship examines the Femme Coverts apart, and when that is over he signs the Caption.</p>
               <p>P. C. If a Woman refuses, would his Lordship sign it?</p>
               <p>Mr. B. No; it would be return'd.</p>

It was my Wife's Right, and I claim'd it by her. P. C. Do you know what a Fine is? J. S. No.</p>

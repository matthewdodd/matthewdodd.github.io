                  </hi>. I am a ladies' shoemaker, and live in Conduit-street, Regent-street. The prisoner's father manages my business, and the prisoner lived with me, learning the business under his father—I left a £10 Bank of England note in my desk, and two sovereigns, and some loose silver in another drawer—I saw them on the 17th of July—I went out of town in the evening, and returned on Saturday the 19th on account of receiving information that the prisoner had absconded—I examined my desk and missed the Bank-note and sovereigns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of having a description of the prisoner from Mr. Godfrey, I found him in Frederick-street, Hampstead—road—I made him no promise or threat—I asked him his name—he said, "Barnett," but there were two brothers of them—I could not find the brother—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and then told him there was a very serious charge against him for stealing two £5 notes and a sovereign—he did not make any answer at first, but afterwards be said it was not two £5 notes he took away, but it was a £10 note and a sovereign—I asked what had become of the money, as I could not find any about his person—he said he had spent it with some girls.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "24th September, 1875. Dear Sir,—I have sent several times to you respecting some brass banding that was taken from Buttealand Street when you removed your goods from there—I must re<lb></lb>quest you to inform me who removed them, so that I can make inquiries about it. Perhaps you can inform me whether they were taken anywhere by mistake. Kindly answer by return, as it is a matter of importance. <hi rend="italic">Hy</hi>. T. Warren") Young said "No, I don't remember removing such things"—I described them to him as they had been described by Warren to my son—he said they were too long, narrow boxes about 9 ft or 10 ft. long and about 5 ft. by. 4 ft.—Young then said "Yes, I did take those two boxes away"—I said "Well, you are putting me to a lot of trouble, and you are a great scamp if you removed these things, because you knew they were not part and parcel of Benson's goods. I suppose that is the reason you lost the key. Now, you go immediately to my premises and take them to Mr. Warren"—he said "I have not Mr. Warren's address"—I said "Here it is, on the top of this letter"—that was the letter I was showing him, but to prevent mistake I handed the letter to my son, and said "Write the address and give it to Young," and he did so—I can't give it you, because I did not see it, but I think it was somewhere in Gracechurch Street; I believe it was the same address that was on the letter—Young said that he would fetch them, and I said that as he was going there there were two or three gates in my yard that wanted easing, and he could ease them at the same time—he said he would—I never told him then nor at any time that 1 would make him a present of the boxes, or that I considered I was giving him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any words to that effect (I had given him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for letting the premises), or that he might do what he liked with them; nothing of the kind—he called again a little later in the day with his tools, and said "I shall have to employ a horse and cart to-remove those things"—I said "Well, you can take the pony and cart from Stoke Newington, and take them back to Warren's," and he left saying that he would do so—Holton was present on that occasion, and I believe my son and Mr. Walker—I went to Stoke Newington the same evening, and saw Young; he had done the few jobs I had told him to do, and he had carried the two long, narrow boxes and placed them against the stable attached to the house; that was the first time I saw the boxes—I then said to him "Now, see that they are delivered safely to Warren," and with that I left—that was all I saw with respect to those boxes; that might have been between 7 and 8 o'clock at night—about a week after that he came to my office one morning; I believe on that occasion Dr. Nicholls and Mr. Walker were present, and my son—I said "Have you taken those boxes back to Warren?"—he said "Yes, I</p>

(Alfred Holton is a porter in my employ)—I consented to his going with my father's pony and cart—my father said also "You may as well as you are up there go a little earlier in the day, as there are two or three gates in the garden that wont shut, and you can attend to them when you are there"—I was at Stoke Newington on the evening of that day—I saw the prisoner there—1 went home about 3 o'clock—I was there the whole of the afternoon—I saw the boxes fetched out—my father told Young to fetch the boxes, and he went down the garden and brought them up and stood them by the stable door; my father then told him to take them back to Mr. Warren—I was present the whole of the time—I did not hear my father say "I consider I have given you as good as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to<lb></lb>night;" I heard no words of giving the goods to the defendant on this occasion, nor that he might take them where he liked—I saw the goods put into the cart; my father was not present then, nor when the prisoner drove away—this was before Lord Mayor's day; about the 1st or 2nd November, I should think—I recollect subsequently having another interview with the prisoner at my father's when Dr. Nicholls was present—I recollect my father putting the question to the prisoner whether he had taken the goods to Mr. Warren, and he said "Yes"—after this, I recollect seeing the prisoner in Fore Street—my father fetched him, he met him in Redcross Street, close to Jewyn Street, and he said "Young, you ought to be locked up for this; here's Young selling the bands he ought to have returned to Mr. Warren"—Young said he had not sold them, he had only sent them round to Mr. McMillan and would deliver them in the morning—I went with my father to Mr. McMillian's, but he was out—a, day or two after I saw the prisoner again, and my father asked him whether he had taken the goods back again to Mr. Warren, and he said "Yes;" Mr. Walker was present on that occasion, and my father, myself, and the porter was sitting at the end of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, 60, Queen Victoria Street—I had some boxes of brass bands at 21, Buttesland Street—I called on Mr. Pilley in reference to the loss of them—I can't tell the date, I think it was within a fortnight after the sale; I saw him, and told him I had missed some brass bands from the premises, that I had heard that he had removed some goods from the premises with his goods, and I asked him if he could give me any information concerning them—he said he had not removed them and that if I saw Young perhaps he could tell me where the goods had been removed—I afterwards wrote to Mr. Pilley—I have not got copies of the letters; I furnished copies to my solicitor—I think I wrote four or five letters, at the least—I should not like to give you the date of the first letter unless I had my book—I think it was very shortly after I had called on him, within a day or two—the sale was on the 10th August, and I called on him about a fortnight afterwards and I wrote a few days after that—I corresponded with him during August, September, and (I am not sure) October—I should not like to say there was a letter in November, there was in December; my last letter was in December—I saw Mr. Pilley several times about the bands—he never told me that he knew Young had got them—I asked him to give me any information he could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen both the Mr. Pilleys; I saw the elder Mr. Pilley three or four times, three at least—I can hardly tell you the second time I saw him; I could not give the date—it was between August and November—the first time was in September—I should not like to say saw him in November, unless I had my diary.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 144). I recollect stopping the men in ewin Street on the 17th November—Mr. Pilley left us for a few minutes and he came back and said something to me—I asked him if he was going to charge the men with unlawful possession, and he said "No, it is all right."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-called</hi>). It is quite right what the policeman as said—I went back to him and said "All right"—McMillan told me hey should be taken to his premises for protection that night—Mr. Warren and Mr. Westoby had had some transaction—the only conversation I had with Mr. Westoby on one occasion was "I have allowed Warren to leave his goods."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Westoby had had a transaction with Warren apart from his matter—Westoby had bought an engine I believe of Warren.</p>

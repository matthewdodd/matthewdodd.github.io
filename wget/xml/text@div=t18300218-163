               <p>CHARLES SHARPE. I am a clerk to Mr. John Hodgson - he is a tobacconist in Budge-row. On the 19th of December the prisoner called for 2s. 8d., which was due to Mr. Gladwin - I paid him, and he gave a receipt for it; I am pretty positive he is the person - on the 16th of January he came again for 4s. 8d., which I paid him.</p>
               <p>JAMES AGAR. I paid two bills on the 6th of January to the prisoner, I believe, for his master, amounting to 1l. 0s. 7d. - he gave me these receipts.</p>
               <p>MR. GLADWIN. These receipts are the prisoner's writing - he never accounted for any of these monies: here is the 19th of December, but no entry to the name of Agar or Sharpe; in the week ending on the 9th of January, here is no entry from Agar, nor on the 16th of January from Sharpe - we missed some goods, and spoke to the prisoner; he made out a list of some money which he had embezzled - he did not deny the fact at all.</p>

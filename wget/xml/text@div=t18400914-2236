                  </hi>. I am a sadler. On the 13th of August I met the prisoner at Knightsbridge, and went with her to a house in the Great Al<lb></lb>monry, Westminster—I had nine shillings and a five-shilling piece in my fob when I went there—I had given her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides—we went to bed—I fell asleep—I was awoke in the night by the landlady, who inquired if all was right—I was half-asleep, and said yes—the prisoner was then gone—I heard the door shut, which awoke me—I felt my trowsers, and my fob-pocket was cut off jagged as with a knife, and the money gone—I dressed myself and went after the prisoner with a policeman—I found her in New Pye-street, and gave her in charge—I described at the station-house what money I had lost, and nine shillings and a five-shilling piece were found on her, with 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—the door of the room was locked on the inside—no one could have got in or taken it but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlady of the house. The prisoner and prosecutor came and had a room together—she came down about three o'clock in the morning, and asked me to let her out—I asked if her friend knew she was coming out—she said he was awake—I went up stairs and found him asleep—I asked if all was right—he said all was right, and I let her go—he afterwards discovered his loss.</p>

The prosecutor applied to me and said he had lost a five-shilling piece and nine shillings—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner at a ginger-beer shop, in New Pye-street, about ten minutes past three o'clock, and took her into custody—she said, "I have not robbed him, I have not got his money"—I found this purse on her, containing a</p>

               <p>On the 18th of January, I went out, between ten and eleven o'clock; I returned between three and four o'clock. When I returned, I found three or four letters on my table, which my servants said they received by the penny-post; this was one of the letters. Upon observing this letter, I thought there appeared to be an attempt to disguise the hand; and being satisfied it was the manner of the prisoner's doing his business at the custom-house. I indorsed it, as coming from him, and put the day of the month on it on which I received it.</p>
               <p>You are one of the Commissioners of the Custom-house? - Yes; the prisoner was employed in 1775, and in the year 1776.</p>

               <p>You never saw the prisoner write? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>The hand is not disguised at all? - It is not disguised to me, who know so much of his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>Explain what you mean by it not being disguised to you. - From being well acquainted with his hand, there may be some strokes disguised; but I have seen so much of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040063"></xptr> his writing, I cannot have the least doubt of its being his. ( Shown two other letters.)</p>
               <p>Are those his hand-writing? - Yes; I am satisfied they are both his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How often have you seen me write? - I suppose more than ten times; he has wrote more than ten memorials to the Treasury in my office.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Whether you have never said the letter was disguised or appeared to you to be disguised? - There are some strokes written with a larger pen.</p>
               <p>Have you or not said before a magistrate, that the letter was disguised? - I do not recollect that I have; to the best of my knowledge I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>You said it was not disguised to you? - There are particular strokes appear to me to be written with a different pen from what the other letters are written with; and some of the capitals are made in a different manner from his usual writing, but not sufficient to disguise it.</p>

I desire you will immediately get the account settled, that my children and I may obtain the most speedy justice.

Sir William, your immediate answer is required, shall not wait but a short space of time for it; you brought me into this trouble, must bring me out. In the mean time, believe me to be, Sir, your humble servant,</p>

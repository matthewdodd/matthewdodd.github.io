                  </hi>. I live as house-maid at Mr. Benham's, in Great Coram-street. The prisoner was the cook, and left on the 4th of May—this watch is mine—I lost it on the 28th of April, from the kitchen dresser—I took it down at eight o'clock in the morning, and missed it between eleven and twelve—on the 16th of June I went with the policeman to 'Squire Knatchbull's, in Kent, where the prisoner was living—I found her there, and the watch was hanging on a hook over the dresser—she had called at Mr. Ben<lb></lb>ham's three or four times after she left.</p>

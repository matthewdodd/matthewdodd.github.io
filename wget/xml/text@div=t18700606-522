                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of Half Moon Street, Biahopsgate—on 7th May I was going home, and when about 50 yards of my door, the prisoner, who was with another, snatched my watch and chain—he ran away, and I gave chase, calling "Stop thief!"—I lost sight of him and then I informed the police—three or four days after I went to the station and identified the prisoner from amongst about twelve others.</p>

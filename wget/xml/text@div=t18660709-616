I live at 41, Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel, and am a tailor—I know the prisoner—I did not know him before 24th June, to my knowledge—about twelve o'clock that night I was at the door of my house in the street—I heard a female voice crying out and making a noise in Bakers' Arms Alley, close by—I could not see up the alley from where I stood—I saw the deceased and his wife come out of the alley—the woman had a long-handled broom in her hand—I did not know them before—they came into the street, the wife defending herself—the husband hit her a blow in the face—she lifted the broom again—he stopped the broom, and hit her a second blow in the face—she did not strike him, because he defended himself, and she said, "You call me a wh—, and I am none"—they both fell on the ground—she fell from the blow he hit her, and he fell a-top of her—she dropped the broom and got up and hit him two blows with the right hand on the right cheek; then the prisoner came out of the</p>

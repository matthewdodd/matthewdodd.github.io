In consequence of a statement made to me, I caused the prisoner to be apprehended on Saturday, 2nd December, for violently assaulting his wife—he was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital by me and Cooper, who apprehended him about 9 o'clock in the evening—I took him to his wife's bedside—I knew her as his wife—she then made a statement—I first said to her "Do you 'know me?"—she said "I do"—I said "Do you know the others who are round your bed?"—she said "Yes, that is Dick"—I then said to her "Will you repeat what you told me this afternoon, so that your husband can hear it?"—she then made a statement, and I wrote it down as she said it.</p>

I had had a drop of drink. He struck me in the eye, and I came into the hospital on Tuesday last"—the prisoner then said to her "Now Jane, did not you tell me that you were ill last Friday week?"—she said "The blow was given three weeks ago, and last Friday week I told my husband that I was ill; he told me to go to bed. Dr. Champneys attended me on a parish order. Mrs. Patterson saw my husband strike me"—I asked her if she would sign this statement—she said "No, I can't, I don't want him locked up"—the prisoner said it was all false, he never struck her—on the way back to the station, in a cab, he said "It is a bad job"—I said "It is"—he said "I have never struck her since I had the three months"—he was charged at the police-station with violently assaulting her—he made no reply to the charge—the persons who were round the deceased's bed were the police constable, Mr. Archer the house-surgeon, and the sister of the ward.</p>

                  </hi>. I am opthalmic surgeon at St. Bartholomew's—the deceased Jane Cox was brought in on Tuesday, 28th November—she was admitted on account of a swelling on the right side of her nose and round the right eye—there was no wound or bruise—she was taken to the opthalmic ward—she made a statement to me—an operation had to be performed—she did not appear to suffer from the effects of that—it relieved her very much—the signs of improvement continued for about three days—I think the operation was on Saturday, 2nd December, and she was taken very much worse on Monday evening, the 4th—inflammation of the brain set in—she had convulsions, and lost the use of her left side, and from that time she was more or less unconscious until her death on the 7th—I can in no way connect her getting worse with the operation—it was merely the opening of an abscess—I made a post-mortem examination on Friday, the 8th—I found the bridge of the nose on the right side was broken—the bone was broken in two or three pieces—I found extensive inflammation of the bones behind the nose—the bones of the right eye were in the same state of inflammation, and the whole of the right side of the brain was inflamed—I believe that had spread from the nose—in my judgment the cause of death was inflammation of the brain,' caused by the injury to her nose—that was my decided opinion—those injuries were most probably caused by a violent blow—I think it must have been a violent blow—I think a blow with a fist would produce that kind of injury—had she fallen upon anything she would probably have fallen with great weight and have cut the skin—the skin was not cut at all—I think one well-directed blow would have caused all the injuries—I should have expected an external wound if she had fallen upon anything, still more if it had been done with any instru<lb></lb>ment—on the left side of the base of the skull, when I removed the brain, I found a hard, bony tumour, about the size of a walnut, attached to the bones of the skull—I should think that was of some years' standing—the brain above that was quite healthy—it had nothing whatever to do with the cause of death—on the calf of the left leg were the scars of two ulcers of long standing—I connect them with the mischief in the skull, but they had nothing whatever to do with the cause of death—I don't think the blow on the nose was a very recent one, because there was no evidence of blood around the bone; no bruising, in fact—I should say it could hardly have been more than three or four weeks old—from what I saw of her in the hospital while she was alive, I think she must have been a woman of intemperate habits—that would go far to account for the severity of her symptoms—I should like to add that Inspector Hodgkinson did not come to the hospital until we communicated with him—I was not present at the bedside when the statement was taken—my house surgeon was.</p>

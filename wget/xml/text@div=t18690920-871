                  </hi>. I live at Lake's Cottage, Plough Street Rother<lb></lb>hithe—there is a rosin and turpentine distillery, at Horselydown, belonging to Mr. Robert Slee—I am manager there—it was not used at this time and I employed a man named William Flatman to watch the premises—on 2nd September, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I received information, and went to the premises—I found that the worm of the condenser of the rosin still had been taken away, and that it was cut into six lengths, which were placed against the inside of the fence, ready far removal I went for a constable, and he watched the lead, with the watchman—I had seen the worm safe and in its place, between 5 and 6 the same evening—the weight of the metal was about 2 cwt.</p>

I live at Hughas Terrace, Rotherhithe, and am watch-man at this place—on the 2nd September last I saw the two prisoners hang<lb></lb>ing about the premises all the afternoon—I told Mr. Morris of it, and we searched the place, and found the six lengths of lead standing up on and against the fence—a constable came, and I watched the metal with him—we waited fox about a half or three-quarters of an hour, and then I saw the two prisoners come down the lane from the canal bank—they then came up the lane again and passed the lead—they came back again, and Bishop pulled himself up on the fence, just where the lead was Iying—he dropped down again directly—I was very close to them—Bishop said to Hunter, "You get over, and I will stop back and look out"—Hunter then got over to the inside of the fence, close to the metal—he picked up one length, and raised it on the fence, when the constable seized him—I jumped up and looked over the fence, and said, "There goes Bishop; I can swear to him—he was running away—I have known, him four years—I am sure he is the man—I knew his voice.</p>

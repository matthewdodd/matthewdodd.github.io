               <p>MR. MEARS. I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend the deceased on Friday evening the 10th of July, preceding her death; she died the next morning. I found her in a state of insensibility. There were external bruises on her eye, jaw, and on part of her head, near the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these bruises that you saw likely to produce death - A. It is possible. She died the next morning. I opened the head on the Sunday morning, and found the brain in a state of inflammation. The membranes of the brain were in a state of inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that inflammation in consequence of the bruises that you saw, or might it be the effect of excessive drinking - A. It might be occasioned by either.</p>
               <p>Q. Is thery anything to determine which might cause it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any such connection between any of the external bruises that you saw and the bruises next the brain, that induced you to determine what had caused the inflammation - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you to say, from inspection of the bruises there was nothing to determine in your mind which caused it, the bruises or excessive drinking - A. No; it might be occasioned by either.</p>

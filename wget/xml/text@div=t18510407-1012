I gave the prisoner in charge on the last case, and went with two policemen to No. 2, Rose-street, Russel-street, where the prisoner had told me he lived, and where I found his wife—we went into the bedroom, and found in a box four more pieces of the same linen, which had been made into towels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found this book (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) which had been lost four months, these rings, and all these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

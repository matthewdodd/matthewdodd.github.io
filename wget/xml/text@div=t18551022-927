                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 11). On Thursday, 6th Sept, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day, I was passing the end of Vine-court, Spitalnelds—I saw Sullivan standing, with his back towards the street, looking at something in his hand, and I saw a shilling in his hand—I went up to him, and when he saw me he closed his hand, and shut it—I caught I hold of his hand, and wrenched the shilling out of his hand—Hands was by but he ran away directly—I told my brother officer to follow him—I still struggled with Sullivan—he struck me several times in the face and about the body, and he threw away a paper, which was picked up, and given to me—I had not lost sight of Sullivan—these ten shillings were given into my possession—I saw them thrown down, and picked up, and given to me—this is the other shilling that I took from Sullivan—King brought brought back Hands to the White Hart public house, which is at the corner of Vine-court—King said, in Hand's presence, that he saw him put something in a paper under a cellar door, pointing to the place—I got the key, opened the door, and went in—I found two shillings in a piece of paper, and three shillings under the stairs—these are them—here are two shillings; three</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Sullivan. Q.</hi> Who picked up these things that you say I threw away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A stranger, and gave them to me—I did not say to him, "What is that? what is that?"—I said, "Give them to me"—after I got the ten shillings, you said, "I will be quiet now"—I did not say I could <hi rend="italic">smash a</hi> dozen like you—I said I would <hi rend="italic">smash</hi> you if you did not be quiet.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 22). On Thursday, 6th Sept., I was with the last witness—I saw the two prisoners in Vine-court—I saw Jackson take something from Sullivan, and when he did that, Hands ran away into the public house—I followed him, and saw him put something in a paper under the cellar door—he stooped down as he was running, and put it there—that cellar door is in the passage at the back of the bar—it is at the back door going out of the house—I did not see what it was he put there; I only saw paper—Hands left the public house—he went out at the hack door, and ran about 100 yards—I brought him back to the public house, and found Jackson having Sullivan in his custody at the back door—when I took Hands into the public house, I told Jackson that I saw Hands put something under the cellar door—Hands did not say anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Sullivan's Defence</hi>. This person who picked up the coins is not forth coming, because this officer should have all his own way; it is my opinion that he is kept out of the way on purpose; we were twenty minutes in the house, while Mr. Jackson was running about with a candle in his hand; Jackson said it was a stranger brought him the paper, and he said to him, "What is this?"and he said "Shillings;" he never asked the man any. thing about it, but hurried him to go away; how do I know but he was a accomplice? I own to the one thing that I picked up at the corner of the court; I had it in my hand, and this prisoner, Hands, wanted to pass; I stood up for him to pass, and Jackson seized me; he said that I struggled, and there were twenty or thirty persons in the court; could he struggle with me in this close passage, and not lose sight of these things that he said I threw? when they were brought to him he put them in his pocket; there was no struggle; I only said, "Mr. Jackson, that will do, I don't want to be killed by you;" he searched me, and found nothing but 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a bit of tobacco.</p>

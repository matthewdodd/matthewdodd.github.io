               <p>Englishman; and then he said he wanted to have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to redeem a letter which had just arrived from Brussels, containing a draft for 2,300 francs, accepted by Monsieur Gaillet, banker, at Brussels—he wanted the 5<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> to pay his landlord for his rent; the landlord having detained the letter containing the draft, and he wanted to redeem it—I told him it was certainly unfor<lb></lb>tunate to have a letter, containing such a draft, accepted by a banker, detained by his landlord, and that I was ready to lend him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he was quired, provided I might go with him and see the letter and the draft before giving the money—he then said, "Oh, for my honour's sake I would have the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give to my landlord without you, because it would be disagreeable to show to my landlord that I have not trust enough for 5<hi rend="italic">l."</hi>—I asked my partner what I should do, and he said, "You may lend him the 5<hi rend="italic">l."</hi>—he promised he would bring back the letter containing the draft; but, instead of bringing the letter, a few days afterwards he brought only the draft, and when I asked him why the letter was not with it, he said, "You do not want the letter, there is the draft accepted"—I certainly was not very pleased at such an answer in such a proceeding; but I could not have the letter because there was none—this draft he brought me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he came again two days afterwards, and asked for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I told him I could not lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more; but, after having talked with him, I agreed to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my partner received another bill, which the prisoner said was accepted by a Monsieur Boutroid, a merchant, of Paris—he told me he had some other drafts to make on other people, but not accepted; and he made out some in our office—about the 28th he came again; and we sold him a looking-glass, because we thought his bill was a genuine one—we afterwards sold him several looking-glasses—after he had eight of them, I went over to Brussels, I saw M. Caillet, the banker, there, at No. 9 Roe d'Auremberg—in consequence of what that gentleman told me, I returned to England, and on the Saturday night, two days after I had seen M. Caillet, I saw the prisoner at my office—I kept him in conversation while my partner went to fetch the police, and I gave him in charge—I told the prisoner that I had arrived from Brussels, that M. Caillet had declared to me that it was not his signature to the hill, and that he owed him nothing—when he saw he was in the hands of the police, he said, "Oh, Mr. Dase<lb></lb>ville, you ought to have said this to me before."—I said, "If I had told you this before, you would not have been here"—he also said he had acted in this manner to obtain some money, because he was in want—he was talking in French—what he said was, that he had done so because he was in want of money—he also said it was very likely we should be re-imbursed what he owed us if we left him at liberty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 30 Great Winchester-street, City, and agent to a Brussel's house—I am well acquainted with M. Caillet, the banker, of Brussels—his address is No, 9, Bis Rue de Auremberg—there in no other banker of that name in Brussels—he has no partner—he carries on business by the name of Caillet Jeune—I have seen him write very often—this aceeptance is not in his handwriting—I know that he has a brother who went to America some two years back—I think he never had any interest in the business—he is not a banker.</p>

Caillet—I have been to Brussels since 3d January—Justin Caillet had nothing to do at the bank—I have seen him at his brother's house—he was living with his brother—he was engaged in the army—I do not think he kept any account at his brother's—he had no interest in the bank—I know of his drawing some bills on his brother—he never accepted any for his brother; I never heard of it—he had some debts in Paris and he drew on his brother, and his brother made some difficulty about paying the bill, but at last he did pay it, because it was regular bill—I have seen Justin Caillet write, but not very often—I think there are eight or nine clerks in M. Caillet's office in Brussels—he has two cousins who sign for him by procuration in his absence.</p>

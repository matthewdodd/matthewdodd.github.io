On the 20th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190004"></xptr>April I went to bed a little before ten o'clock - I sleep in the parlour; my shop door was locked and chained. My wife awoke me about eleven o'clock (I have no children;) we laid listening some time, hearing a noise at the door; I got up, and saw Morgan in the shop, in the act of taking off my goods; I pushed him aside: Brown was in the passage. I ran and shut the street door, and shut them both in - my shop door is a side door in the passage; I called the watchman, who came: he searched the house, and found the prisoners up in the cock-loft; they had run up stairs while I was calling the watchman. They had broken the lock off the shop door - I had seen Morgan with both hands lifting my goods up; he was in the act of handing them out at the door - Brown was near enough to take them from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Does one Spearing lodge in the house? A. There is a little deformed man lodging there - I cannot say that Morgan visited him. I shut the street door before I went to bed, but lodgers come in and out as they like, and I cannot say whether they went out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. My name is Thomas Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no other name? A. My name is Thomas Reynal Mitchell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you use the name of Reynal? A. No, my Lord. I sign my name T. Mitchell. I have been married nine months, and was married as Thomas Mitchell - I have not signed my name as Thomas Reynal Mitchell for years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear your name is not put down in the parish books as Thomas Reynal Mitchell? A. I never wrote it so. I was married at St. George, Hanover-square; I have not written my name as Thomas Reynal Mitchell for three years. I cannot say when I used that name last, it is so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you hesitate when asked if you had any other name? A. I was confused; I did not think it would get the prisoners off if I had another name.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you seen the prisoners before? A. No. I had no light, but a light reflected from a gas lamp into the passage. I was certain when I saw them again that they were the same boys. I ran out to call the watchman, but kept the door in my hand all the while to keep them in; I was about five minutes in the street.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Mitchell called me about a quarter past twelve o'clock - I went to the place, searched the house with two more watchmen, and found the prisoners in the cock-loft, at the top of the house; nobody else was there: they were dressed. The house is four stories high. We told them to come down, which they did. I asked where the other two were whom I had seen with them opposite the house, at twelve o'clock - they said they were in the loft, but they were not. I had my lantern when I saw them at twelve o'clock, and there was a gas-light; I know them to be the same men; I knew them before; the parents of one live in Oxford-buildings, and the other in Gees'-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Spearing? A. There is a deformed man there - I do not know whether he is acquainted with Morgan. I have been five years on the beat.</p>

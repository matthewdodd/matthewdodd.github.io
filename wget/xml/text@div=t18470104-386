                  </hi> I am clerk to the Huntingdon Railway company; their office is at No. 14, Park-street, Westminster. On the 16th of Sept. I placed a check for 101. in the deed-box—I locked the box, and left it in the secre<lb></lb>tary's room at the office—there were other things in the box—I found the box locked when I came in the morning, but the check was gone—the pri<lb></lb>soner and his wife resided on the premises, and no other person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Swainson. On 27th Oct. the prisoner came to the warehouse with an order which he put into my hands, and the invoice to correspond; it is signed "J. Walmsley"—we had sent goods to Mr. Walmsley before—he is a fringe-manufacturer—I had seen the prisoner at Mr. Walmasley's, and at our Warehouse—(<hi rend="italic">order read,</hi> "I gross 17 1/2 in. orris to match, 27—10—51., J. Walmsley"—the prisoner took away the goods with him—that is the customary form of order in the trade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Walmsley of 12, King-street, Cheapside. The prisoner was in his employ from the middle of April to the middle of June this year, when he left—I manage the business in part—this order is not Mr. Walmsley's writing or mine; myself and one other clerk sign Mr. Walmsley's name—this is not the writing of that other clerk, or of anybody in the establishment authorised to make out orders—no such order was given—this order is in the same form as Mr. Walmsley sends them—while the prisoner was there it was his duty to take out such orders, obtain the goods, and bring them home; he never wrote orders—he knew how we did business, and how to make an order of this sort—no goods answering to the description in this order were brought to the establishment, on or after 27th Oct.—he was partly errand-boy, and partly in the warehouse—he fre<lb></lb>quently saw Mr. Walmsley's writing, and that of the other persons who used to sign orders; it is not at all like the writing if any of them.</p>

I was applied to to take the prisoner into custody—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him these three similar orders, with these samples pinned to them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all signed "J.

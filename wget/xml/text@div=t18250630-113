I superintend the works at the College of Physicians - I went to the lodge on the 25th of June, and saw the prisoner, who is a <rs id="t18250630-113-deflabel571" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>

I did not compare it with what was left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were you doing while the jacket laid on the stones? A. I was watching about the premises; I kept my eyes upon the jacket; no person went to it; there were persons at work on the premises, but not on that spot. Other persons might have gone to it; the prisoner could see me as clearly as I saw him. When he went to dinner I took his jacket, and I suppose he saw me, and at six o'clock he came and demanded his wages, and asked for his jacket; I told him it was at Mr. Lee's and he would pay him. I will not swear I did not ask him anything about the lead - it is very likely that I did. He was taken on the Monday following, at Mr. Lee's office, in Chiswell-street.</p>

            . I saw the jacket laying in the fire-place in a room called the porters' lodge, at the old College of Physicians; I told Mr. Wilson of it; I then saw the prisoner come out of the door which leads to the lodge, with something in his hand, which he dropped between some stones. I did not see Wilson take it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you see it there? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock; any other person might have gone there, but no person could have got the jacket after twelve o'clock, because it was removed.</p>

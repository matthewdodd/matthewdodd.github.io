               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you ever seen her before? A. Yes, I had seen her some years back, but never had any acquaintance with her. I received the money the day before, at Somerset-house. I had passed Friday night at home at my lodgings - I had had a drop, but I knew what I was about - I turned out on Saturday morning about seven o'clock. I went into another public-house, but did not go to sleep - I went home to go to sleep- I first saw her about six o'clock in the evening, at the Ship and Shears public-house. I had been home to lie down, and went out in the afternoon to buy some things, and kept myself sober - the prisoner and several others came in - I was in that house from six till near nine o'clock- I believe I drank with all the women; about a quarter of an hour before I went into the street, I had overhauled my money, and put the heaviest part of it in my bosom - the other change I put into my jacket; when the man came up to me he collared me, and asked what was the matter - I said I had been robbed, and he gave me a drive, which staggered me across the street.</p>

            . I am a seafaring man. I was coming along Ratcliffe-highway one Saturday night, about four weeks ago. I saw the prisoner, who had hold of the prosecutor's right arm; another woman was with her; the prisoner said, "I will take you home;" and he said, "So do;" there was one

I did not see that he fell down.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. Q. He was a little groggy, I suppose? A. He had been drinking, but not much.

I am robbed!" - I did not see him on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could he have been knocked down without your seeing it? A. No - I knew the prisoner before by sight, but never knew her name; she had a straw bonnet on, and a dark gown, and a shawl, but I did not notice that.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the Ship and Shears public-house; the prosecutor came into my house about the middle of the day, and left it about six o'clock, when we were lighting the gas. The prisoner and another came in - I asked where they were going; the prisoner made me some reply, but I told her to go along about her business, as she was one I never liked to see; she then went away, and the prosecutor immediately afterwards; he was not in company with her at all in my house; he had a sort of brown purse in his hand, and some one wanted him to leave it with me; and for me to give him a receipt for it; but he said, "I have worked for it, and I can take care of it;" he went out with the purse in his hand - I saw it had notes in it.</p>

            . On this Saturday, the prosecutor, who lodged with my father and mother, asked me to go with him to buy some shirts; we went out about half-past two o'clock; he went into a cook-shop, and asked me to have something to eat, which I would not; we went on, bought the things, and then went to Mr. Needham's: we got there about five o'clock; we had two or three pots of beer. I sat and drank with him about two hours or more - I gave the bundle we had been buying, to Mr. Needham's daughter, to take care of: a man then came in, and there was a bit of a wrangle; the prosecutor pulled off his jacket to fight, and he had his money in his hand - I said,"He will be robbed," and I wanted him to leave it there; he then went out of the house, I think between eight and nine o'clock: when he came to the door, there was a little woman there, but I cannot say who it was; he had paid some sovereigns for his goods, and there were some notes in the purse, but I do not know how many - I saw him go out of the house with the money in his hand - I went back and asked for the bundle at the bar; as he went out the little woman tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

On Friday, the 10th of October, I was down in the kitchen, at tea, and heard a slight noise in the shop; I went up and not perceiving any thing, went down again: in about two minutes I heard a greater noise than before - I went up and went to the window to see if the cat was there, (as it was in the habit of going there) the first thing I observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230015"></xptr>was a pair of men's slippers shaking about in the window; a pair of shoes were gone, and a piece cut out of the window; I went out of the door, looked towards the left, and saw the prisoner near the public-house - I did not lose sight of him till he was secured; he walked up, and stood still, at the corner of Well-street: I walked up, walked round him, and rubbed him down by his coat - he then dropped some shoes; I caught hold of his coat, he struggled and struck me in the face - I called Stop thief! persons came and assisted me in securing him; he was taken back to the shop, and a pair of shoes produced, which were stated to have been taken from his pocket - I found the glass cut or broken out; I saw no pieces of glass, either in or outside of the window - they were gone entirely; I had seen that part of the widow in the afternoon - it was quite safe when I went down to tea, (looking at some shoes produced by G. Knox) I know this one shoe to be one which I picked up in the street, after rubbing down his coat - it is one of my mother's; here is the fellow to it - here are two more pairs: they are all my mother's, and worth 20s. - the opening in the window was large enough to get them through.</p>

            . I live at No. 115, Jermyn-street. I heard a cry of Stop thief! went up, and saw the prisoner struggling with Vaughan, endeavouring to get away; I assisted in bringing him back, and observed him endeavouring to get a pair of shoes out of his pocket, which I prevented his doing, but when we got to the shop, I took them out of his pocket myself, and gave them to Vaughan; they were delivered to Knox.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I generally leave work about six o'clock in the evening, and take a walk for about two hours - unfortunately I went down Jermyn-street, and met two men who appeared to be intoxicated; they pushed against me, and had not got two yards, before I heard a window break- I turned round and saw the two men go from Vaughan's shop - I went up, saw the window broken, and the shoes on the area; I picked them up, and tried the door to get in, then went and stood at the corner for five minutes, thinking somebody might come out of the shop; I gave a whistle for my dog; Vaughan came up and looked at me; I looked at him, not knowing who he was - he laid hold of me, and I wrestled with him and dropped a shoe; he sang out Stop thief! I then desisted, and went into his shop. Now if I had a felonious intent, might I not have gone away with the shoes instead of stopping at the corner of the street? I am a shoemaker and have a wife and child.</p>

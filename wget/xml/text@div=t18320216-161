On the 5th of December I apprehended the prisoner in Portland-place- I asked his name; he said George Thomas, and that he lived at Bermondsey - I asked if he knew any thing of any cloth of Mr. Mines', Bedfordbury; he said No - he insisted on going into a public-house; I would not let him, and one of his companions brought him out a pint of beer - I got him to the watch-house, and he said, "Well, my name is Ross Carney, and what of it?"</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent to see if a bill was filed against me; the Policeman had the kindness to say No, and my friends are not here - I never was in Reading's employ, and how could I know who he dealt with.</p>

            </rs>. It was prov'd by Mr. Smith, who was appointed by my Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs, to super intend the Goal of Newgate, That the Prisoner had Leave to visit some of the Rebels; and in his Return, as he went by the Soldiers, he threw them a Shiling, and bid them drink the Pretender's Health by the Name of King James; upon which he call'd him back, and knowing him to be a Prisoner already, let him go; but told him he would take care to have him prosecuted for his Impudence. He took this Occasion to do the Soldiers Justice, who unanimously rejected the Proposal with the greatest Scorn and Contempt. The Jury found him <rs id="t17160712-4-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

               Indicted, for a Misdemeanor, in Printing and Publishing a Libel, call'd Weekly Remarks,&amp;c. in which are contain'd
            </rs> several Expressions, highly reflecting on his present Majesty and Government. The first Evidence was Mr. Squire, who depos'd he had the Papers from Mrs. Grover, and she, That they were brought to her from the Prisoner's Sister, to whom she paid the Money for his Use, which was a Guinea at one Time, and two at another, having been told she acted for him. That she receiv'd a Letter from a Porter, in the Prisoner's Name, in which were Expressions tending to prove him to be the Printer of the said Libel. But that she did not know the Prisoner himself, having always dealt with his Sister; nor could she swear the Letter was written by him. Then the Porter was sworn, but Mrs. Grover did not know him, which put aside his Evidence. And her Daughter depos'd, That she was abroad when the Letter came to her Mother, and did not see the Porter, but confirm'd that Part of her Mother's Evidence which concern'd her transacting Business with the Prisoner's Sister for his Use. Mr. Stakehouse depos'd, One Wright came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171607120003"></xptr> to the Stamp-Office with nine of these Papers (amongst which was the Paper in question) to pay the Duties from Mrs. Dalton, and to be enter'd, but not coming in Time it was refus'd. Wright swore he had them from one Withers, on Snow-bill, being directed there by Mrs. Dalton. Then Hawkins stood up again, and swore he was call'd, being a Porter, to Newgate, and a Man ask'd him what he would have to go to the Stamp-Office, and receiv'd 3 s. to pay for Duties, and had 6 d. for his Pains, but did not know the Man again from whom he receiv'd it. Then Mr. Squire farther depos'd, That when he took the Prisoner up, he own'd to him, that he printed the Papers under that Title, but did not that he printed that particularly mention'd in the Indictment. Squire also deposed that he afterwards found and took one of the very Papers in question at the Prisoner's House, where his Printing Press was kept. However the Evidence failing in fixing that particularly, for which he was cried, upon the Prisoner, he was <rs id="t17160712-4-verdict26" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper and live in Portland-place, Commercial-road—the prisoner was my shopman for a week or ten days—on the 3rd of March he told me he had some friends who required goods, and if I could spare him an hour he would go and sell some—he took out some, and amongst them a shawl and a table-cover—he returned and said he had sold the table-cover and the shawl, and he would bring me the money in the evening, when he was to take more goods—he went in the evening and I waited up for him—he did not come—I went to bed, and soon after twelve o'clock I heard a knock, but I did not go to answer it—in the morning one of ray shop men said, "Stone is off with his boxes"—I went out and saw him returning—I took him back to my house—he had left his boxes at the Metropolitan Parcels Delivery Company's Office—I went with a policeman and searched a box there—I found in it this pro<lb></lb>perty, (<hi rend="italic">examining it</hi>) which is mine, and has my mark on it—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were taken from my dwelling-house, which is in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney.</p>

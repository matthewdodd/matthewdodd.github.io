On Saturday the 18th of January, I was very much in liquor, and did not go home till between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Berwick-street, and I went down Charing-Cross, after that I went into a house, I don't know the sign of it, and there I staid, and had some liquor, and became quite insensible; I really cannot tell the sign, it is the right hand side going down, near the Admiralty; I got quite drunk, I don't know what became of me; at five o'clock in the morning I found myself in the watch house.</p>
               <p>Court. That was right enough, you ought to be taken to the watch-house to be sure. - I found I had lost my property, after that I asked them if they had any charge against me? they told me no, they told me where they picked me up, drunk in the street, at the top of Bow-street. When I came to myself I found myself in the watch-house, with no coat, hat, shoes, nor neek handkerchief on; they discharged me, they had no charge against me, at ten o'clock I returned to know if they knew any thing about my things; they told me where they picked me up, accordingly on Sunday morning I went to the Sun in Long-acre, and there was a watchman, and two of the justice's men, and the watchman said that he saw this man take my things.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got your property again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you? - I had two guineas and some silver, eight or nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you was sensible you had got that money about you? - Between six and seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether you was not at Charing-Cross, a treating of some girls of the town? - There were two women in the house at the time that I was there, and I drank with them, but they went out before I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Paul Biddle, a tallow-chandler, of Judd-street. On the 23rd of April I missed a pair of stays—I went to look for them in the prisoner's room—she was my servant—I found all the articles mentioned in the indictment, in a bandbox, which was partly open, under her bed—these things had been lying by for several years, in a chest in another room—I told Mr. Biddle—he had an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge—when I asked her for the stays, she said she had them on—she gave the articles up to the officer when he came, and he showed me a metal spoon—she had no business at the chest at all—it was not locked—she had been three weeks with me, and I had a very good character with her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called, and went into the prisoner's bed-room—she opened the box herself, and delivered the things to me—when I asked her to show me her box, she said these were the things—she was questioned about the stays before she went up, and said she had got them on, and said she had the things in her box which her mistress said she had lost—she was afterwards taken down into the kitchen, and said she bad left her shawl up stairs—she went up again, and there dropped a metal spoon from her dress—the stays were given to me by the female searcher at the station.</p>

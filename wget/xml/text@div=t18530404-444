                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Wesley. On the morning of 3rd March I saw the prisoner in the packing room—he was stooping under the board; I was sitting at it—in a few minutes he got up—he had one hand on his chest and the other hand under his coat behind him—he said he had lost a brace button; I took no notice of it—in a short time he went up stain and I picked up this invoice just where he had been—it is of two penholders, which were to be forwarded to Mr. Barrett to be put in a parcel to be forwarded to his customers in the country, with goods from Mr. Wesley—I had received the penholders myself—I showed the invoice to Mr. Wesley—I afterwards heard him ask the prisoner about them; he accused him of having the penholders; he said he bad not had them nor seen them—Mr. Wesley said, "You have, for here is the invoice"—he instantly put his hand in his breast, and said, "Oh, yes! I picked them off the floor this morning, and there was a wrapper round them"—he said it was the first thing he had ever done, and begged to be forgiven—these are the penholders, and this is the invoice.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 54, Paternoster-row. On 3rd March the last witness gave me this invoice—I accused the prisoner; I did not offer him any promise or any inducement—I asked him to give me the penholders; he said he had not got them, but at last he pulled them out and asked me to forgive him—these are the penholders; they were sent to me to enclose in Mr. Henry Barrett's parcel—he is an agent of mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Christopher Graham, and others, in New Bridge-street, Blackfmars, wholesale grocers—the prisoner was in their service. On the 17th of Sept. I went into the warehouse about five minutes after seven in the morning, and saw the prisoner in a room adjoining the warehouse where tea is kept—he had no business there—I asked what he was doing there—he answered, "Nothing"—I saw him in the act of putting his hat on, and asked what he had in his hat—he said it was all right—I asked him to take it off—he did so, and lifted the corner of the handkerchief that was in it, and put it down again, and put his hat on again—I took his hat off, took the handkerchief out of it, and 2 1/2lbs. of gunpowder-tea came out with it—there was a canister of that tea in the room—I compared it with that tea—it was the same de<lb></lb>scription—he went down on his knees, and said he hoped I would say nothing about it to our people—I said it was not likely I could let him stay there without saying anything about it—he had 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

            . The prisoner was in his employ on the 21st of February - our plate is kept in the pantry; I had seen it all right on Wednesday, the 19th, and on Friday, the day after the prisoner left, I missed a table-spoon - I have seen it since at the office, I examined it, and compared it with my master's spoons; this is it - I believe it to be my master's; it appears as if the crest has been rubbed out- here has been a rubbing where the crest has been.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Is he not a master-workman? A. Yes - there were seven or eight servants in the house; I missed the spoon on Friday, in consequence of what was told me - they were right on the Wednesday evening, about seven o'clock, after dinner; I did say before the Magistrate that I would swear to the spoon.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker, in Princes-street, Leicester-square. I have a spoon which the prisoner brought to our shop, about seven o'clock in the evening, on the 21st of January - he asked 6s. for it; I asked his name, and was going to make a duplicate out- he asked if I could not give more, and I said Yes, 10s.; he said I might as well make it 10s. 6d., and I did so - he then wanted to sell it; I said we could not purchase things that were in pawn - I then asked where he got it; he gave several different accounts; at first he said he bought it at Mr. Neat's, the pawnbroker, and he was borrowing money to pay Mr. Neat 6s.; he then stated that he had some more of them, and took us to his workshop to show them to us, but he could not show them - we then gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he took you to his workshop? A. Yes.</p>

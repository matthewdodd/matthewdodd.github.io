I am a watch-maker and jeweller and live at No. 2, Lime-kiln-lane, Limehouse—it is my dwelling-house, and I occupy it—on the night of the 13th March I left my house about six o'clock—there is a glass window to the shop—there is no sash to it—it is a fixed frame with a wire-guard before the lower part of it—the shutters were not up when I left—the door was shut—I returned about a quarter after ten o'clock—the shut<lb></lb>ters were then up, but on going inside I found the wire-guard had been taken down, and the window was broken—I missed from the window the articles stated, which were worth 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am thirteen years old and live in Mr. Leech's house—about ten minutes to ten o'clock on the 13th of March, my mistress gave me a saucepan to take into the yard—I passed by the shop, and as I was right opposite the window I saw a man's hand come through the third pane of glass—I did not see his person, but I saw there was a man outside with a round cap on—my mistress's mother went out and called "Police!"—I saw a ring picked up outside the window, and someear-rings were found down the court</p>

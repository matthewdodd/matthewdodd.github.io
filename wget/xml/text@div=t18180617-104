            . I am a pig-butcher, and live in Devonshire-street, Mile End. I have known the prisoner two or three months. On the 7th of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and another man brought seven pigs to me, to kill by next morning. I was not to kill them till I saw him again. The constable came to my house, and I shewed them to him. I told him I knew who brought them to me; but I could not remember his name. He drove the pigs to the watch-house; and kept me in custody about ten days. I then gave the prisoner up, as having received them of him. He had called about four days before, and said most likely he should have a job for me.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 7th of April, I was informed that some pigs had been driven into Thompson's house, I went there, and asked him if he had any pigs in his house? He said he had. I asked him who brought them? He said he did not know. I said that was strange. He said he believed he should know one of the party, if he saw him again; but they were going to be fetched away, and driven to Romford market next morning. I took him and the pigs to the watch-house. He was admitted to bail, to bring the man forward. I mentioned several names to him at his second examination. He said he believed Lunnun was one of them. I had mentioned Lunnun to him at the watchhouse; he did not then fix on him.</p>

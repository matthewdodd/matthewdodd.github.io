I was in Westminster-road, on the 27th of December, Sergeant Underhill was with me—we were walking in the road at twenty minutes before three o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two others about five yards behind him—they were not in communication then, but I had seen them frequently together before—we crossed over to the prisoner—the other two lads ran back—I told Underhill to take the prisoner, and I went after the other boys—I lost tight of them—I returned and took the prisoner—I caught him by both his arms, and took him into a broker's shop—I found in his right hand pocket three counterfeit shillings—he said two men gave them to him, and gave him sixpence to carry them—he did not describe the persons who gave them to him.</p>

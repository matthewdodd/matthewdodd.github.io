Mrs. Treves first came to lodge with me three or four months before this happened; she was absent at Richmond three weeks; I came to town on the 25th of September - I left home at twenty minutes after ten o'clock in the morning - I locked the house up and took the key with me - every thing was secure - Mrs. Treves' apartments were secure; I had information and got home by a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening - the doors were all shut, and the gate was shut but not locked. I am certain I had locked it. On entering the house I found Mrs. Treves' property taken out of the drawers and strewed about the floor; seven locks were broken - I found the prisoner in custody at the cage; Mrs. Hearn resided with Mrs. Treves.</p>

            . I live at Turnham-green, on the opposite side of the way to Yeomans, but a little distance from his house. On the 25th of September I saw the prisoner and three other men waiting about his house for some time, and at last two of them went into the house; they appeared to put a key in the door and open it; the other two were waiting about - I did not see where they went - I saw the prisoner in custody of Davis in about twenty minutes afterwards; he is one of the two who I saw go into the house.</p>

            . I am constable of Chiswick. I was fetched to the prosecutor's a little before two o'clock, and on the way there met Davis with the prisoner; I put him into the cage and gave him to Huntley, the patrol then began to search him, and found a pair of bracelets, a gold watch-chain, three seals, five rings, an ear-ring, gold neck-chain, a silver chain, mock pearl chain, and scent-box, a ring, two coins, and two paste ornaments. I had told him to stand up in the cage and let me search him; he immediately produced these things from his breeches' pockets, and said "I will give you all I have;" I sent for Huntley, and saw him find a number of pick-lock keys on him.</p>

            . I lived with Mrs. Treves during her husband's absence in the East Indies; she resided at Yeomans', but had gone to Richmand for the benefit of her health - I went with her: on the alarm being given I went to her apartments, found every thing strewed about the rooms, two boxes broken open and the drawers. I know all these things to be her property, except the coins, which I believe to be hers - this gold watch is worth 10 l. - her husband's name is Pelegrine.</p>

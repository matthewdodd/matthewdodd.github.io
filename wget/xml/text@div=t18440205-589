                  </hi>. I go on the river collecting fat from the boats. The prisoner, Howell, is my brother—Glenayne had been taken upon a charge of felony, and was discharged—I had some dispute with him, and he accused me of giving information against him—on the morning of the 24th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, I was in my boat at Ratcliffe—cross—the prisoners met me in a boat and challenged me to fight—I refused to do so, and Glenayne raised his paddle and struck me on the head—my cap came off'—they both raised their paddles together, and both struck me—I was knocked down in the boat—I called for the police, and when the police were coming the prisoners rowed alongside a tier of ships—Glenayne jumped out of the boat and ran away—my head was cut.</p>

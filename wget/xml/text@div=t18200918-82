I was sitting at work about half-past two o'clock, and saw a man go out of the shop with a piece of cotton under his arm - I did not see his face; he had a blue coat on, and was about the size of the prisoner. I cannot swear it was him. He is the man that was brought back.</p>

               <p>MR. SHARP. Barrand, a witness, who is not here, present, gave the calico to me, with the prisoner; he told me, in the prisoner's presence, that he saw the prisoner come out of my shop with this roll of calico in his hand - that he followed him up the street, and never lost of him till he was taken, that he saw him drop it just before he was taken, and he took it up, and still followed him. The prisoner made no answer, but said he hoped I should have mercy on him. The property is mine. I saw it in the shop the day before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

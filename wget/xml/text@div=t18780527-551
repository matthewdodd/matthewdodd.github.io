                  </hi>. I am a travelling clerk attached to the missing letter branch of the General Post Office—in consequence of in<lb></lb>structions I received I made up a letter on 22nd May addressed, " Miss Maria Laing, 10, New Bond Street, London"—I put 120 penny postage stamps in it, having previously marked them with similar marks—I posted the letter about 11.45 the same morning at the chief office—I called In<lb></lb>spector Clegg's attention to it before doing so—later in the day I received information in consequence of which I saw the prisoner the same after<lb></lb>noon, about 3.30, in a private room at the General Post Office—I said "My name is Stephens; I am attached to the missing letter branch—I posted a letter this morning addressed to Miss Maria Laing, 10, New Bond Street, containing 120 stamps—it was afterwards sorted to tour walk—I have ascertained that it is missing—do you know anything about it?"—he replied "No"—Butler searched him in my presence, and a number of postage stamps wrapped up in a piece of paper were found in his pocket—I said "Where did you get the stamps from?"—he replied "I bought them about a fortnight ago in the Strand; I was going to send them to my brother at Plumpton"—I examined the stamps, and found 120 bore my private mark—these are the stamps—I said "These bear my private marks, and are the same as I enclosed in the letter to Miss Laing"—he made no reply.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This is the half sheet in which the stamps were en<lb></lb>closed or similar—it bears the same stamp "ivory"—I said "They were in my possession this morning; would you like to see the date?" and I showed him the date—the marks are brought out by a chemical process.</p>

I am an inspector of letter carriers for the Eastern Cen<lb></lb>tral district—I knew this was a test letter, and I remember its coming to the office about 11.50—I stamped it and sorted it to the prisoner's walk, New Broad Street—the letter being addressed to New Bond Street ought to have been treated as a mis-sorted letter—I directed Newman to search to see if the letter was amongst the mis-sort, and in consequence of what he said the prisoner was called in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner was present when the letters were sorted, and I saw him take this letter to his seat—he would have eighty or ninety letters in his delivery, which would include Finsbury Circus—I did not mark the stamps similar to these.</p>

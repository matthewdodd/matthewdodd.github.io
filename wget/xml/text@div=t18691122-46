                  </hi>. I live at Queen Street, Bethnal Green—on 19th October I was in Brick Lane, near the Great Eastern Railway Station—about 1.20 I saw the prisoner there with a horse and cart—when I first saw him he was dragging a sack of oats out of Mr. Fieldhouse's shop—the horse and cart was opposite the window—I did not see him drive up—I first saw him in the shop—he was about three yards inside—he laid the sack just outside the shop, in the street—he went into the shop again after that—he called Henry George Fieldhouse out into the shop, and wanted him to serve him with some oats, and I took no further notice, because I thought he was a customer—the prisoner wanted a bag to put some oats in, and said he would lend some money on the bag; but Mr. Fieldhouse had not got a bag for the oats—the prisoner went out of the shop, got up in the cart, and drove away—Mr. Henry Fieldhouse pulled the sack of oats into the shop again, and put it where it was before—he did not see the prisoner drag it out—he could see the corner of the sack from the shop, while the prisoner was there—I did not hear what the prisoner said to Mr. Fieldhouse about the sack.</p>

Q.</hi> How do you know it was a sack of oats? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say that they were oats, it might have been chaff—I did not see you go into the shop and ask for a feed of corn for your horse—I saw you go in after you had dragged the sack out.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father, who is a corn dealer, at 162, Brick Lane—the sack in question contained four bushel of oats—it belonged to my father, William John Fieldhouse—his initials, "W. J. F.," are on the sack—it was standing about three yards in the shop—I did not see anybody move it—I was called into the shop by the prisoner, and he wanted a sack to put some chaff in—I said we had not got one—I saw him get up in the cart and drive away—he said he could get a sack from Mr. Sunman—I noticed the sack outside the shop, in the street, when he was there—he said he got it from Mr. Sunman, and was going to put some</p>

               <p>oats in the nose-bag, and he wanted some corn to put with it—I said nothing to him after that—he did not seem drunk—he was just as he is now—when he was in the shop I saw the two first letters of our name on the sack—I said it was our sack, and he said he got it from Mr. Sunman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not knock on the counter, and call you out to serve me with some corn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not think at the moment that you meant to steal the sack of oats—I should have given you in charge if I had.</p>

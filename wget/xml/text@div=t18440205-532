I reside in Castle-street, Leicester-square, and have a shop at No. 45, Dean-street, Soho, the door of which I left safely locked up at ten o'clock on Sunday morning of the 24th of Dec.—I received information from my landlord about ten the same evening, went to my shop, and found the prisoner in custody, and two turkeys and a goose lying behind the counter, which I had left banging on the hooks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the house where the prosecutor's shop is. On the 24th of Dec., between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my parlour, and hearing a noise in the shop, I went out into the passage and found the street and shop-doors open—Mr. Allwright's shop-door opens into the passage—the street-door is often left open for the lodgers—I closed the shop-door, and sent for a policeman—two came—we went into the shop, and found the prisoner there, and saw two turkeys lying on the floor.</p>

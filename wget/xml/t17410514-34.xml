             . I am Servant to Mrs. Barnes , and this Money was left in my Care. About 3 Months before this Money was missed, my Mistress told it over herself and locked it up, and then there were 25 Guineas, which she desired me to take particular Care of. On the 15th of last Month , I got up in the Morning to go to be blooded, and left my Mistress a-bed; the Prisoner, who was an Apprentice in the House where my Mistress lives, let me out, and went over Tower-Hill with me, and said he would meet me as I came back , but he did not. When I came back, my Mistress's Curtains were pinn'd together, which gave me a Suspicion that some body had been in the Room, so after Dinner we looked over the Money and missed 4 Guineas. I can't swear who took the Money , but afterwards 4 Guineas were found in the Prisoner's Box, and we thought no one could take it but him.</p>

             . I am a Barber and the Prisoner is my Apprentice. Mrs. Barnes missing some Money , and I hearing that the Prisoner had a private Key to my Door, I got a Constable, and took him up Stairs and asked him about the Key; at first he denied that he had any, and then I asked him about the Money, but he would not own that he knew any Thing of it, so I ordered my other Man to bring up the Prisoner's Box into the Room, and when he found that I would search it, he called me aside, and owned that he had taken 3 Guineas, and no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had I not more Money in my Box when it was opened?</p>
               <p>Keynton . Yes, there were 4 Guineas in Gold, and 7 s. in Silver.</p>

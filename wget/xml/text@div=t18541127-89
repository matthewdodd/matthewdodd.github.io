                  </hi>. I am the wife of Captain Inglefield—the prisoner was formerly in my service—she quitted in June, in the present year—the had been in my service from the previous November—I gave her notice to quit, for reasons which have nothing to do with the present inquiry—while in my service I missed a gold watch guard—I had hid it nearly nine years—I missed it about two months before she left—I spoke to her about it; she helped me to look for it, but it was never found—I also missed some Grecian lace—I had had that about eight years—I can hardly remember whether I missed that before she left; I do not think I did—I do not re<lb></lb>member ever speaking to her about it—during the time the prisoner was in, my service I had frequently seen it safe—that is my gold chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is my lace (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a peculiar sort: it came from the Ionian islands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of police for the borough of Devonport—in consequence of information I received, I went to the house where the prisoner was in service, on Saturday, the 25th of last month, at Tarpoint—I said, "My business is very unpleasant; I have come to make inquiries about a gold chain, lost by Captain Inglefield, some time back. It will be more satisfactory if you will allow me to look through your boxes,"—she said, "Yes; but about that chain, I had only one chain, that was a long one, that was given to Carr, Captain Inglefield's servant, to clean"—I said, "What chain was it you wore last Sunday, in this house?"—Miss Jef<lb></lb>freys, one of the young ladies connected with the establishment, took up the words, and said, "That was a silver chain",—the prisoner replied, "Yes"—I went up stairs, accompanied by the prisoner, to her bed room—she was a little in advance, and picked up a towel, and threw it on a chair by the side of the bed—I then asked her for her boxes, and she pointed them out—I searched the two boxes: in one I found the Grecian lace, the pattern of which I had seen before at Captain Inglefield's—I said, "This is Captain, Inglefield's lace"—she said, "Mrs. Inglefield gave it to me"—I said, "Very; well," and took possession of it—I then pointed to the chair, and asked if there was anything else; at this time there was a gown placed over the towel—I then took up the gown; at the same time I remarked, "I think there is something under the towel"—I took up this watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), and said, "This is Mr. Inglefield's chain,—she said, "Oh no, it is not; that watch and chain were given to me by a young man with whom I kept company, and he is now dead"—I said, "I am positive this is Mr. Inglefield's"—I produced a drawing, and compared them in her presence—she still denied that it was Mr. Inglefield's chain—I then went down stairs with her into the parlour—I saw the same lady, Miss Jeffreys—she made some remark with reference to the chain—she said, "I think you have found everything"—I said to the prisoner, "You told me the chain up stairs was silver"—she said, "No, I did not say it was silver"—I went with her to the house of the prosecutor in Devonport; when close: to it she said, volun<lb></lb>tarily,</p>

               <p>"I will tell you the truth; the chain belongs to Mr. Inglefield. About eight or nine months ago the children were playing with it, and it must hare been thrown into my box. I was not aware of it until I searched them at Saltash"(that is a place at Devonport, where she had taken lodg<lb></lb>ings)—"When I found the chain I was afraid to bring it back, because I thought my mistress would think I stole it"—when the prisoner came to the railway station, for the purpose of bringing her here, I saw that one of the two boxes was not the box I had searched, and that she pointed out as belong<lb></lb>ing to her—I said, "I hare not seen this box before, is it yours?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "You had better open it"—I took the key, and opened the box in her presence, and found two pieces of lace, a habit shirt, a necklace, four handkerchiefs, and a quantity of things.</p>

"I lived with Mrs. Inglefield, as upper nurse; the children whom I had care of were in the habit of having the chain mentioned, from their mamma, to play with in the nursery, and they must; have thrown it into my box; I declare I did not take it; but I admit not returning it when I found it in my box, fearing my mistress would not give me a character, and I did not venture it, because I thought she would think I stole it; my mistress had three years' character with me, and I have never been dishonourably impeached before; I never neglected my duty while in service; at the time of our removing from Woolwich to Devonport, the things got intermixed in the boxes, mine in mistress's, and mistress's in mine; a few of the things remained in my box, and I did not return them; it suffices me to say, I really regret it, and I hope mercy will be shown to me; I have been depending upon my industry for the last ten years."</p>

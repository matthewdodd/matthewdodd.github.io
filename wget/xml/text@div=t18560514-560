                  </hi>. I keep a china shop and deal in rags at No. 16, Richard-street, Woolwich—Smart was in my service as carman over twelve months—I have missed a great quantity of rags and other goods, and I have called his attention to it—on 10th April I was called in to my dinner—I was busy, and was not more than ten minutes—I went to the front door and saw Smart coming across the road—I had ordered him not to leave the back door, and that gave me suspicion—he had a bag and a screw wrench with him—I said to him, "Where have you been?"—he said, "Over the way to borrow this wrench"—I said, "Where have you been with the bag?"—he said, "Round the comer"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "Round the corner," and began to be very insolent—I said, "I insist on knowing"—I took it from him, and found that rags had been in it—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "From Dr. Stewart's"—I took him round to Dr. Stewart's, and I said to Dr. Stewart, in Smart's presence, "Have you seen my carter come in here?"—he said, "I have not, I have been sitting at the desk this last half hour, and no one has come in at all"—Smart appeared confused, and I said to him, "This satis-faction is not sufficient,"I took him to the station, and he was detained, and the inspector sent a policeman to make inquiries—I examined the bag and found some pieces of white ragin it—I went to the house of Mr. Seymour,</p>

               <p>who is a dealer in rags—some rags were shown to me there—I was able to identify two pieces as my property—one was a piece of dimity curtain, and the other was half a corded petticoat—I can swear to these, I had seen them amongst my own rags at my own place that morning—after that I went to Smart's lodging, which is at Perrin's house—I think it is called Myrtle-place—we saw Perrin—the sergeant asked her if a man lived there who worked for me—she said, "Yes"—he asked her what his name was?—she said, "Smart"—he said, "Have you got anything here belonging to him?"—she said, "No"—he said, "Are you sure of that?"—she said, "No"—we searched, and found some pans, which I identify as my property, with my mark on the bottom of them—I asked her where she got them from—she said she bought them at different shops—I said, "What shops? they are marked with my mark"—she said she did not know—I said, "They came from my shop"—she then said, "I will tell you all about it: Smart brought them in place of money for his board and lodging"—she said since Dec. he had not paid her any money—she said, "I will tell you all about it: here is some more in this box"—the box was then opened; it was a long trunk or box, like a clothes box, and in it was found this gilt tea service—these are things that have been in my place—they might have been sold—here is a dinner set—these things have at one time formed part of my stock—I will not undertake to say they have not been sold—here are six plates and other things—I can say the same with regard to them—here is a toy cup and saucer, which I can swear was in my place, and had never been sold—I had seen it in my place within two or three months—I missed it and spoke about it to all my men, and to Smart amongst the rest—here is a tea spoon, which I can swear was never sold; here is my mark on it—here is a square glass inkstand I can swear to—we sell these to Government, and supply cadets with them, no one else—when they came up I put them in a particular place—there were twenty-four of them, and I missed one of them—there were but twenty-three left—I had missed the one about a month before 10th April—here is a glass salt cellar, which I can identify—I find there is one of mine gone—with regard to this China tea service, I had not missed the teacups, but teapots and sugar basins I had missed—these pans are mine; I do not know when I missed them, we have five or six hundred at a time—I could not say how many rags I missed.</p>

            , jun. I have known the prisoner nine years - I boarded and lodged him for nearly eight years- since the death of his mother, which is five years ago, I have known him vary very much in his mind; several times while at dinner he has upset the table and broken the things, and ran out of the room like a madman - the night before this accident happened, he jumped out of his bed-room window, which was about ten feet from the ground; that was between one and two in the morning - he said there were people pursuing him, and coming in to rob and murder him - he jumped out of window, broke into the cellar, and got into my father's room - there was no pretence for his saying there were thieves in the house - two policemen saw him jump out of window - it was mere fancy on his part - he appeared to me not right in his mind - I did not see him myself that night - I saw him next morning - my father is ill, and cannot come here - I believe on that night he travelled to Highgate-tunnel and chucked his tools away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Tell us anything you yourself know of his not being in his right mind. A. I have seen him at times, while he boarded with me out of his mind - he is a cabinet-maker - he has been in constant employ, and was in very good circumstances - not in any distress at the time - he was working at his trade at the time - he was not hurt by his fall from the window - he fell on some mould in the garden - he was not much given to drink - he was in the habit now and then of having a little drop - I have seen him out of his mind without being in liquor - I do not think that he knew right from wrong at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by raving? A. Knocking the work about, and swearing; he did not know what he was doing - I had no conversation with him about what he had done with his tools - he continued working up to the day before this happened - he worked just as it took his fancy - he always bore an honest character - I do not consider him always in his right mind.</p>

The policeman said to him,"What have you lost?" he said, "I have lost nothing, but there are thieves and robbers in the house - they have come to murder me" he jumped down the cellar from the yard - he had jumped out of the window into the yard - when he said there were thieves in the house, he used an oath, and said,"I am not joking."</p>

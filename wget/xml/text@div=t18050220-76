               <p>Q. What noise? - A. I cannot describe the noise any other way than it was a little noise; I went to see what it was, and I observed a hand coming through a hole of the window; the window had been broken for a week before that, but the piece had been fastened with putty; I saw the same hand draw through the hole a snuffer tray: I immediately ran out and secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him? - A. Between five and eight yards from the door; I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on him? - A. While I had hold of him he kept struggling, and during that struggle he let fall two pair of snuffers and three snuffer trays, but before I came to him I heard one pair of snuffers fall, which he threw away; I thought they were snuffers by the jingle on the stones; I picked up the snuffers and the trays with one hand, and held him with the other, and brought him into the shop, and sent for an Officer, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the boy before this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The snuffers and the snuffer trays that you picked up were the property of the prosecutor? - A. Yes; I know they are his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss them? - A. Yes.</p>

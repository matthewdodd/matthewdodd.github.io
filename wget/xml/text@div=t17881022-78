               <p>He did not go by a nick name? - Upon my oath, I never went by any other name; I did not write the name of Cox, in my book.</p>
               <p>Did not some of you beg of us to keep the door shut, from the multitude of people that came demanding of money? - I swear that Hardman desired the door to be shut, on purpose that he might not be exposed.</p>
               <p>Court to Cole. Was you at liberty to depart during that time? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen, Prisoner's Counsel. Freshfield came afterwards? - I really cannot tell which came into the room first, I was so intimidated; I do not know there were four came in.</p>
               <p>How many more than four? - There were no more than four, except Hardman and me, after the room was cleared; there were a great many people in the office; and then we were turned out; I cannot recollect who came in first; they might be all in the room before I saw one of them; being such a multitude of people; I never saw Freshfield before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>- MARRIOTT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am employed at the assay office; I was informed that Cole was in custody; I went to the office immediately; there were about two hundred people about the door, and a coach waiting; I could not get admittance; this office was up one pair of stairs; I came, and the door was locked; I got in through the other house, and went up stairs; I knocked at the door where the officer and the clerks were confined; the door was opened of a jar, and I saw Mr. Foresyth, and one Mr. Newman, and Mr. Freshfield; Foresyth I understand is since dead; I did not see Wilson at first; I have known Freshfield a great while, and desired to speak with him; there was Mr. Cole, and Mr. Hardman; I was not admitted into the room the whole time; I particularly requested Freshfield; I told him I had a friend and a relation of mine, in custody, in that room where he was; I told him he had lived well in his life time; and had been in better employ, and I was very sorry to find him in that situation; I asked Mr. Freshfield what could be done? he told me he was only coming by; he had nothing to do with it; here were three constables; if he could render me any service he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220115"></xptr>do it; nothing else passed; he went immediately into the room where the prisoners were confined; he came out soon afterwards, and returned for answer, that they would take ten guineas to discharge the prisoner; that he had consulted them; and they would settle it for ten guineas; I brought eight guineas, and gave it to Mr. Freshfield, and desired him to see if that would not do for their releasement; Mr. Freshfield went into the room again, and staid some time; he returned again seemingly angry; and said that they would not take less than the ten guineas; and that I had much better get the other two guineas, for they would not take less; I gave him the other two guineas; he went to the other constable again; and in a short time he returned with Mr. Foresyth and Mr. Newman, into the other room; I then went into the other room; they brought a tankard of porter into the room, and asked me to drink; he said every thing was settled; I then went into the other room, where the prisoner was; then I saw Mr. Wilson, never till then; Mr. Foresyth came into the room, and followed me; and immediately says to Wilson, lay down them papers and books that you have, and come along with me, every thing is settled; there is nothing to prove; we can prove nothing.</p>
               <p>Who else was in the room? - One Mr. Hardman, four constables, and Cole; not till the business was entirely over.</p>
               <p>Did you hear from any one of these constables, what their charge against Cole was? - I did not hear any particular charge, any further than that he was detained as a rogue and vagabond; the first that came out to me was Newman; and Freshfield told me he was detained for doing business contrary to act of parliament; that the officers had three or four in custody; he had nothing to do with it himself he said; there was no appearance of any riot or disturbance in this room, every thing was very quiet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Freshfield told you he was coming by, by accident? - He did.</p>
               <p>You looked upon him as a mediator? - I did.</p>
               <p>It was Foresyth asked you to drink, and said, lay the papers down? - That was addressed by Foresyth to Wilson; Wilson had some papers.</p>
               <p>Freshfield. Did any body binder your going into the room, do you recollect? - I do not know that they did.</p>
               <p>Did I desire you to get the other two guineas? - You appeared very angry with them, that they would not take the eight guineas.</p>
               <p>You have known me for years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What Character did you look upon me to have? - A very good one; I never knew any thing of him, I have known him for years.</p>
               <p>Did not Cole go by the name of Cox? - I believe he might in the office.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I knew Mr. Cole by sight, I knew Marriott. On the 21st of February last I was in Aldersgate-street, and saw a mob of people about a lottery office; I went up stairs into the one pair of stairs room, the door was upon the jar, and Freshfield stood at the door with the door in his hand; I pushed into the room, there I saw Freshfield; I recollect Newman and Foresyth; I did not take Notice of Wilson: I asked what was the matter, and was informed there was an information against the office; I think it was Newman that told me; it was in the hearing of the others; I was then going out at the door, and Freshfield stopped me, and asked me if I belonged to the office, I told him no; and he turned about and asked Newman if he knew me, and he replied that he knew me by sight; accordingly Freshfield let me out: he stood with the door in his hand, and locked the door and opened it: after that I went down stairs, and I saw Mr. Marriott; I came up stairs and I saw him behind Mr. Freshfield in the back room, and I endeavoured to hear what they said, as I concluded they were going to make it up; but I saw that Freshfield avoided me as much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220116"></xptr>as possible: Marriott went down stairs and left me and Freshfield in the room together; I went up to hear how it was to be settled; I went into the room, but I could not hear the particulars of what they said: Freshfield told me he was very sorry to come there on such business, but that the other officers met him and obliged him to go with them; and he said he thought it was better to make it up than let the young man go to gaol, for he said the person who gave the information had a policy, and could swear to it.</p>
               <p>You are sure Freshfield said that? - I am: after that Mr. Marriott came up and gave him eight guineas, which I saw and heard: Mr. Marriott, in the presence of Freshfield, asked me to lend him two guineas, I told him I had not so much money, and he went down stairs and brought up four half guineas, and I saw them deliver up a parcel of papers and books, and things.</p>
               <p>Did you see where the officers went afterwards; - They went down stairs, I did not see them after I left the office.</p>
               <p>Did you see who delivered up the papers? - Newman delivered up some papers, and I believe Foresyth did, but I cannot positively say to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Boxley. I understood you that you did not know the persons of these two men? - I cannot say I know their persons, there were two hundred sworn that day, and two men of that name appear, by my minutes, to be sworn that day.</p>
               <p>To Cheesewright. You went of course into the front room; has it a door leading to the back room? - It has not; Freshfield was sitting inside the fore-room, and the door in his hand; I endeavoured to hear what they said but could not.</p>
               <p>And you give us this reason for it, that Freshfield purposely avoided you. - It seemed so.</p>

               <p>Then how do you account for this, that the very man who avoided you before should come up to you and say as you have said? - I cannot account for it, but so it was.</p>
               <p>You are landlord of this house? - No Sir; I did not let the first floor, it was let out, but unknown to me; I formerly, before Christmas, lived in these apartments; the man of the house had his goods seized on, and I moved out; I supposed I was to pay for the quarter though I did not reside in the rooms; but while I was gone to my new apartments the landlord of the house let them to the lottery office, without my consent.</p>
               <p>In what situation are you now? - I am a master taylor.</p>
               <p>I believe you was clerk to Blackburn, who kept one of the insurance offices? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>When might it happen to you to be so?</p>
               <p>Court. You are not required to answer any thing respecting yourself after the month of March last.</p>
               <p>For a few days before March last; I have acted so for an acquaintance, but I had no emolument for it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going by the office when they were there; after I had been there a quarter of an hour I saw Freshfield; he was there I suppose settling the business; I saw Wilson there, I did not see him do any thing there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. I wish to ask Mr. Cole whether any person all the time came near me, or whether any thing was mentioned of me during the whole time I was there.</p>
               <p>Court to Cole. You was in the room all the time with these constables? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I think you say that Freshfield and Foresyth went out at different times? - They did so.</p>
               <p>The question is this, whether when Freshfield particularly came in, or Forsyth, they held any conversation with Wilson respecting any money? - I did not hear that any money did pass till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. Can you recollect that I went out of the room at all? - He never was out out of the room at all.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember when Forsyth came in and gave me charge of the two prisoners? - I cannot positively say to that.</p>
               <p>Did they take Wilson into any part of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220117"></xptr>the room out of your hearing, so as to hold in private a conference? - I cannot recollect that they did.</p>
               <p>Court. What is become of Newman? - He was not a constable at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a question which a good deal imports the public, and therefore I shall send for Newman.</p>
               <p>- NEWMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>Give me a true answer; You, I understand, was one of the persons who went to the lottery office to apprehend the clerks of the office? - Yes, I went under the command of Forsyth.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - Foresyth, Wilson, and Freshfield.</p>
               <p>Freshfield. Did I go along with you? - I did not see him go in with us, he went with us to the house as one of the officers.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Freshfield called six witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

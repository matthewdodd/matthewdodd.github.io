The prisoner was in my service till within a month of the 12th of September - I had missed two spoons, and discharged her, in consequence of it; these are them: this one was in a pot of red currant jelly, and the other was taken from between the two drawers in the bed-room - when I missed them I asked if she knew any thing about them, and she denied it: I said, "If you have pawned them tell me, and I will say nothing more about them."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is Gibbons your name? A. Yes, but in my confusion I put my maiden name, when I went to Mr. Jenkins' to inquire about them - she had taken them from there, and put them into another place; she sent me to a pawnbroker's, in Edgware-road, and they sent me to Lisson-grove - in my fright I signed my name Broadway, and did so before the Magistrate, because I did not wish my name to be brought before a parcel of gentlemen. My husband is a picture-frame maker and cleaner; his name is not on the door - he does not go by the name of Broadway; I will not swear to that, or to any thing more than I have done.</p>

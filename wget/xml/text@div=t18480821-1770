               <p>Parr's Head, in Aldersgate-street. On the evening of 9th Aug., I was in the bar-parlour—the prisoner came in and had a pennyworth of gin—he took the newspaper and laid it across an ale-glass, and then put the glass into his pocket—I went round and said, "Take that glass out of your pocket "—he said, "Yes, I will ma'am, I took it to show you how you might be robbed"—I called my husband, and held the glass in the prisoner's pocket till my husband came and took it out—the prisoner then took out these two dram glasses, and tried to put them under the filter—one of the dram glasses had just been used—I did not see him take them.</p>

I went into this public-house, which I had been accustomed to do several times, to look at the paper; I had one glass of gin, and was waiting some time before I could get served with another; I took the glasses and put them into my pocket, and when the lady came I said I might have run away with half the shop. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He had not tasted his gin, and had no second glass—my daughter served him the moment he came in—he was not kept waiting—these are the glasses (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had never seen him there before.</p>

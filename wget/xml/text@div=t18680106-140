                  </hi>. I am inspector of sewers in the City of London, and live at Low Leyton, in Essex—I have a house there abutting on the Thornhill Road—there is a garden at the back running down to a wall, which abuts upon an open space of ground where they are building—there is a shed at the bottom of the garden, and beyond that a plot of ground upon which a house is being erected—adjoining my garden there is another terminating in a shed in a similar way—there is an outhouse adjoining my house—at the back, from that to the bottom of the garden is about ninety feet—on Sunday night, 24th November, I had some tools locked in my outhouse—on the morning of the 25th, about half-past seven or eight, I found the window of the outhouse broken and a quantity of tools gone from a bench just under the window: three planes, three hammers, a mallet, four gauges, and a number of other tools, and from the shed, at the bottom of the garden I also lost a hammer, chisel, and screw-driver—that shed had been locked, but the key was left in the door—the value of all I lost was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave notice to the police—I observed some foot<lb></lb>marks in my garden, commencing apparently from the shed as if they had come over the wall, going along a border for about twelve feet across the garden, then apparently on to the path, and again on to the border at the side of the garden, traversing the whole length of the garden close to the wall till stopped by a low fence, then round the fence to the outhouse, as if groping their way in the dark—I also found footsteps direct from the outhouse by rather a shorter cut across the border, and back again the whole track—the marks were very distinct, some were trodden into the other, but there were over a hundred I should think quite distinct; there were only the footsteps of one person, as far as I could see—the path would not leave impressions, as it was hard; they apparently went out of the garden in the same way, over the shed; the shed is within 100 feet of the house that is building—there is a small hut about two or three feet away from my shed, lower than my shed, and the house that is being built is beyond that—I afterwards saw a pair of boots in possession of the police-sergeant—I saw the prisoner at the police-court wearing those boots—I saw the constable compare those boots with the impressions in the garden; he made fresh impressions with them by the side of the others; they corresponded most minutely—the right boot was trodden over on the right side; it was a plain side-spring boot without nails, very much worn—the impressions precisely tallied; both impressions when measured were exactly eleven inches long—the impressions of the left foot were very. indistinct at the toe, the toes must almost have protruded on to the ground, and I observed those pecu<lb></lb>liarities both in the original impressions and in those made by the constable; they corresponded in every respect—the prisoner appeared before the Magistrate on the first occasion and was let out on bail—I did not see him leave the police-court—I never saw the boots after that—I saw him again, on the second remand, on 5th December; he was not then wearing the same boots, but others—I have not seen them since—I have seen a marking<lb></lb>gauge and a mallet in the possession of the constable—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are both my property—I can't say I saw these identical tools in the outhouse on the night of the 24th, but I had seen them very</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 739 <hi rend="italic">A R</hi>). On Monday, the 26th, from information I received, I sent a constable to Mr. Haslip's house—I did not go that day, I went on the Tuesday—I saw a number of footsteps in the garden—as far as I could judge, they were the footsteps of one person—I traced them from over a shed in a piece of ground adjoining Mr. Haslip's shed, and into his garden through a newly-dug border nearly at the end of his house, where the outhouse is, and then back again to the same place—a great number of the impressions were very distinct indeed—a person could get into the window of the outhouse, which was broken—I went round to the building at the rear, where a house is erecting, and saw the builder there and the prisoner's father, and entered into conver<lb></lb>sation with them—the prisoner was then at work in the front room of that house, which is about a hundred feet from Mr. Haslip's garden—he was working with his father as a carpenter—he did not speak to me when I went in, but he looked at me—I noticed his boots, and, from his peculiar appearance. was tempted to look at him—he looked at me and hung his head down, as if he wanted to avoid my seeing him—I did not speak to him, but on looking at his boots I judged they would make similar im<lb></lb>pressions to those I saw—I then left, and made inquiries as to the pri<lb></lb>soner's character, and on Wednesday, the 27th, I apprehended him in Roman Road, Old Ford—he told me that he was at work at Chadwell Heath—that is eight or nine miles away—he had the same boots on when I took him—I took them off at the station, and went and made impressions with them by the side of the others, in the presence of Mr. Haslip—they corresponded exactly—I noticed the peculiarities—the left boot was worn away so that the toes almost had come to the ground; the right boot was trodden over on the right side—I observed those peculiarities and the impressions both in going and returning, and they corresponded—I sent a constable to Chadwell Heath, and received from him a bag of tools, amongst which was the gauge I have produced—the mallet I got from a man named Green, who was working on the premises where the prisoner worked—the prisoner saw me take the gauge out of the bag, and he said he had picked it up in a shed at the rear of the house where he had been at work, at Low Leyton—he said he saw the mallet with it—I gave up the boots to the prisoner when he was admitted to bail, and on the remand he appeared in a fresh pair—I have not seen the others since.</p>

I am a carpenter and joiner—I am out of employment at present—I live at 3, Kenilworth Road, Grove Road, Bow—I have known the prisoner about four months—I was a fellow-workman of his for about two days—I remember Tuesday, the 26th November, well—about half-past seven o'clock the prisoner called at my house, and said he had got a country job down at Chadwell Heath to go to, on the following day, and he wanted me to go with him, as there was work for two, but before he went there he wanted to go down to Low Leyton to get his tools, and I went with him that same evening—when we got there we could not get his. tools—his and his father's tools were kept together, I believe in the house next door to where they were working—after knocking some time at the house, and receiving no answer, he said he would go to the place where his father had been working next door—after searching about for some time he found a smoothing-plane—he put that on one side, as he did not require it—he then said he would go to the back of the buildings where he and his father kept other tools—I went with him as far as the back door—he went into a kind of shed or outhouse, and when he came out he had this gauge in his hand, I am positive he had not got it when he went in—he said, "I have got something that belongs to my father, we shall want it to-morrow" and I said, "Yes, we shall, bring it" and he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, and am a carpenter and joiner, living at 75, Hewlett Road, Old Ford—I work anywhere and everywhere, wherever I can get a job—I have been working down at Low Leyton—when I first went there I used to put my tools into an out<lb></lb>house; there were two outhouses on the piece of ground, one with a lock and key, and one without—I frequently put them in both places, but for double security I asked the next-door neighbour to allow me to put them into his house, as we were in the habit of losing our tools so much, and he said I might do so—on the night of 26th November I put a few in there, and some I left in the outhouse, where it appears this gauge came from—I left there that day at dark, about five or a little after or before—I did not know of my son having a job at Chadwell Heath until I came home on the Monday night, when a young man living close by came to tell him of it—he went with him to see about it, and came back and said he had got it—he then went out to see Dawe—that must have been about half-past seven or eight—he said, "What am I to do about tools?"—I said, "I have some tools at home, no doubt they will answer your purpose for the time being" and he had my tools, and went to Chadwell Heath on the next morning—I believe the first train leaves about seven—I remember Saturday, the 23rd November; my son came home about eleven o'clock that night, and he remained at home on Sunday, the 24th, the whole day—I was not well that day, and never left home till half-past six on Monday morning, when I left to go to Low Leyton—I shook my son in his bed that morning to wake him, and told him to get up and go to a person named Dawe, in Green Street, Bethnal Green, to whom I had taken two saws to be sharpened on the Saturday afternoon, that I might take them with me on Monday morning—I have heard the witness Dawe describe the outhouse where this gauge was found—I know the place—I have been in it frequently, and have been in the habit of leaving my tools there.</p>

I am fourteen years of age—I have a bed in the same room where my brother, the prisoner, sleeps; it is not shut off, there are curtains round—I remember Sunday, 24th November—my brother was at home all day and all night—I saw him at half-past six on Monday morning, and again about eight, when he got up to breakfast—I was at the Stratford police-court, but was not called.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell the attorney what you have told us to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I knew what the charge was against my brother—I did not tell the lawyer I could prove he was at home and in bed at the time the tools were stolen—I supposed father had told him that—father knew that he was at home—I told my father that I knew he was at home all the night—my brother generally went with my father to work in the morning, but this morning he did not get up till eight—I don't remember at what time he went on the Tuesday—he went to bed on Monday night about half-past ten or eleven—I don't remember at what time he got up on</p>

               <p>Tuesday morning—he was generally in bed by half-past ten or eleven—I don't remember at what time he came home on the Monday—he generally comes home to tea about five—I think he had tea at home on the Monday—he did not bring his tools with him on the Monday; I am sure of that—I don't remember seeing any tools on the Monday—I don't know of his pawning any tools—I know that he pawned a saw shortly before this—I heard father speak about it—I can't say the day he found fault with him for it—I saw the constable when he came to leave a notice to tell my brother to have his boots here—I told my father of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Wells, of 19, Basinghall Street—I have had the conduct of this case—the witnesses who have been called for the defence, with the exception of Dawe, were present at the police-court, Stratford—I knew then what evidence they had to give; I have the notes of it—they were not called by the Magistrate, because there was no occasion—I wished to call them, and he said, "No; call them at the trial"—in consequence of that I did not call them—I have heard the statement about the boots—I had them in my possession, and I have them now, I believe, but I was under the impression that I had handed them back, and I came away from home this morning without them—until I got here I thought I had got them—I had them here last session in my bag.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why not ask your counsel to postpone the case until you had sent for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will do that willingly—I did not make any application to have it postponed—I said if it was necessary I could go home and fetch them—I am not acting as the attorney in this case, as managing clerk—Mr. Wells certainly knows about the case—he is paralysed, and is not able to attend to business—I do not act as Mr. Wells—Mr. Wells is paralysed down the right side; he cannot speak very plainly—his brain is not affected, merely his speech—I have been acting as his clerk I should think about three months—before that I was in the employment of Mr. Hicks; he was not paralysed—I did not act as Mr. Hicks at all—I might have been with him twelve months perhaps; I can't say exactly—before that I acted for Mr. Brutton—I have not been for years acting about this Court—it is very seldom that I come here at all—I do not go to the Middlesex Sessions, and very seldom to the Surrey Sessions—I can hardly tell how long I have been in the habit of coming here, perhaps ten or twelve years; not in the habit of coming, only when anything comes into the office—the office is at 19, Basinghall Street—Mr. Wells comes to the office—he lives at Angel Lane, Stratford—he does not come to the office every day—sometimes he is not able to come for a week or a fortnight, and sometimes he comes three or four times a week—the boots are not at the office—I took them home in my bag, and I suppose I took them out—I then resided at 13, Stanley Road—it was late at night when I left here, and I could not get into the office, and I took them home, and no doubt have left them there—I can tell you where they are, and an officer can go with me and bring them away—they are at 490, Hackney Road—I came from there this morning—I told my counsel before the case commenced, and he suggested I should send for them, but, having recently moved, I don't think they could</p>

               <p>be found without I went for them myself—I heard the statement of the witness Rebecca Moore—she made a statement to me in the presence of her father—we went into a public-house down there, where I met them, and I took it down from her lips and her father's—I have it here—I mean to say that I applied to the Magistrate to hear the witnesses—I don't know his name—it was at Stratford—I was not aware of the recent Act of Parliament about taking the evidence of the prisoner's wit<lb></lb>nesses—I knew that I could get the evidence taken down, and get the expenses allowed at the discretion of the Court—that was the reason I applied to have them examined—I misunderstood you—I told the Magistrate the witnesses could establish an undoubted <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>—I did not remind him that if he took their evidence I could get their expenses allowed—I was only there once, that was at the time of the committal—that was when I told him the witnesses could prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>—the police-officers were present when I said that, but I don't suppose they heard it, because it was a conversation at the table between the Magis<lb></lb>trate and myself—the Magistrate asked if I had witnesses, and I said I had, and I wished to call them—I told him I could prove a clear <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>, I swear that, and his answer was, "There is no necessity to call wit<lb></lb>nesses now, you had better call them at the trial"—Idid not say I had no witnesses to call—I said I had witnesses to offer—he did not ask me the question, but I told him so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MORI</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether the Magistrate is a stipendiary Magistrate or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is all I believe—I don't understand them down there—I believe he, is not a paid Magistrate; I don't know—I am quite positive I told the Magistrate that I had witnesses in Court to prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>, and that he said, "It is no use calling them now, call them at the trial"—I told you, just as the case was being called on, that I had forgotten the boots; you told me to go for them immediately, and I said I could not go, because I had to attend to the case—you said, "Send some<lb></lb>body else at once," and I said nobody else could find where they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you knew that if the witnesses were examined before the Magistrate they might have their expenses allowed, both for attending there and here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not press it upon the Magis<lb></lb>trate, because another case was called on—I know that by the Act of. Parliament the Magistrate is obliged to ask the prisoner whether he has any witnesses—he did do that—if I said he did not I misunderstood the question.</p>

                  </hi>. I could not repeat word for word what took place before the Magistrate, but I can tell pretty well what did take place—I heard the Magistrate ask if there were any witnesses to be called for the defence—the solicitor said he had a perfect answer to the charge—he did not say a word about an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>, nor did he say he had any witnesses to call—he said he would reserve his defence.</p>

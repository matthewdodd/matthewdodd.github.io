                  </hi>. I keep the Old Hicks Coffee-house, at the corner of King-street and Frith-street, Soho. The prisoner was twice in my employment—he first came to me in the latter end of May, 1836—I took him from his friends from school—he remained at that time till the latter end of January, or the beginning of February—he came again on Friday, the 13th of June, 1837, and continued up to the 19th of January last—he was a bar-man, and confidential youth—it was his duty to receive money for the things sold at the bar—on the night of the 4th, when I went to bed about one, or half-past one o'clock, as my general custom is, I counted every farthing of money I left behind me in my two tills, which are about two yards apart—I left two silver sixpences in each till, and about a shilling's worth of coppers in each till, with the addition of a few pence more—it may be 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I could not say to a few coppers—I left no more in the bar that night, but I left, on the marble slab at the back, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. counted in coppers—that was the whole—the amount of the monies left in the tills was not five shillings—the money on the slab is always there—it is stationary there—the money con<lb></lb>sisted of four silver sixpences, and the remainder in copper—then were two silver sixpences in each till, and about a shilling's worth of cop<lb></lb>per in each till; and there might be a few halfpence more—that was the whole of the money in the tills—I did not leave any shillings in the tills—it is the prisoner's usual custom to go to bed at ten, or half-past ten o'clock—he went to bed, I may say, two hours before me that night—I went to the tills again the following morning, from eight to half-past eight o'clock—it was not nine o'clock—I found the same money, with the addition of a few coppers extra—there was no more silver—only the sixpences that I left the previous night—I again examined the tills after I sent him to breakfast, about nine o'clock—I found the money I left on the slab exactly the same as I left it—it had been there for days and weeks.</p>

               <p>swear it—I mean deliberately to swear it—there is no mistake about it—I expect only what is right and just—that I swear—there were two shillings' worth of coppers on the marble slab—I said so from the first time I came into the Court—I have said what money was in the tills, and what money I left on the marble—I have always said so—I did not mention it to Sir Frederick Roe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say that the whole was under 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I left in the tills I confined it to the tills—I said that the money I left in the tills was under 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence on the slab—I do not think I mentioned the coppers on the marble slab before the Magistrate—I do not think I said any thing about the money on the slab before the Magistrate—the prisoner came down soon after seven o'clock, and had his breakfast a little before nine o'clock—his usual business was to clean the counter-tops, and serve cus<lb></lb>tomers—he was in the shop when I came down, soon after eight o'clock; and it was after he went that I examined the tills—not in his presence—I got some information from a woman named Gee, about the prisoner, on or near the morning of the 16th—she did not tell me at all—she told my wife, on the 16th—she kept an account of the day of the month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did she tell yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My wife told me the same day—I lad some conversation with the woman on the morning I discovered this robbery, the 5th of January—Gee came to me then, and I had no doubt who committed this robbery on the 5th of January, as she told me of it—the prisoner remained in my service after that till Friday, the 19th of January—I kept him from the respect I had for him and his friends—he was en<lb></lb>rusted to my care, that was the reason I kept him—I can conscientiously wear that—I never mentioned, between the 5th and 19th, to any of the boy's friends, that he had robbed me—I continued to leave him in his place trust till the 19th, occasionally watching him—I always watched him—did not mention to himself that he had robbed me on the 5th—I did be<lb></lb>fore he left me—I do not know whether it was on the Friday—his warn<lb></lb>ing was not out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did not the boy leave you in indignation because you accused him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I called those people who had accused him before his face, and mentioned it to him—that was not the woman Gee—I did not say that it was the woman Gee told me on the 5th, and that was the day he robbed me—Gee told me she had paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she told me that on the 5th of January; and on the 5th I discovered the robbery—I gave the boy a character when he left me—it was from the good feeling I had, and having brought him up in the way I had done, and taught him the business—I could not tell his friends, and I thought the best I could do was to recommend him to some other person, which I did—Mr. Rivers asked me for his character—he lives in White Lion-street, and is a respectable tradesman, I believe—the prisoner was going to a place of trust, I believe; but it is no rule because he robbed me that he should rob others—I heard, from information I received from respectable Persons, that he had been robbing me. for some time—I got that information, on the morning of the 16th, from my wife—there were three persons—they came to me—it was before I got this information that I gave him the honest character—I cannot say on what day I gave him the character—I believe it was Wednesday—it was before he left me—I called him into my presence before the person I gave him the character to—the gentleman asked me how soon I could part with him—I said I would leave it to himself—the prisoner gave me the notice to quit—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290152"></xptr>
               <p>I cannot say the day—I really cannot say the day—I think it was on Wed<lb></lb>nesday—I really cannot say what day it was—he quitted me on Friday afternoon—I will not swear it was not on Tuesday that he gave me the notice—the gentleman came on Wednesday or Thursday evening—it was before Mr. Rivers came to ask the character of the boy that he gave me notice—it was after I had seen Mr. Rivers that the three respectable people came to tell me he had been robbing me to a great extent—I cannot say the day of the month—he had not left me—I then went to Mr. Rivers, and told him—I swear that—it was before he took him into his service, I went to Mr. Rivers myself—my respect for the boy's friends had ceased after I found he had robbed me to such an extent—about half-past one o'clock on Friday I saw him do what was not proper, at my counter—I got up, gave him a box on the head, and sent him out of the house directly—I have a second public-house—I asked the prisoner to go and live there——that was before I gave him the box on the head—the day Mr. Rifen came to me, I said, "Why cannot you go to the other house and live with me, as well as go to Mr. Rivers?"—that was on Wednesday or Thursday—it was the day before he went—these people came to tell me he bad robbed me to a great extent on the Tuesday or Wednesday before the Friday he left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, as you must have heard from the three people on the Tuesday or Wednesday, that he had robbed you, why did you not tell Mr. Rivers when he came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was after I saw Mr. Rivers I made this discovery—it was on Tuesday I allowed him to go and seek for a situation—I think it was on the morning previous to his leaving that the three persons came—I cannot say to the day, but I think it was—I have sworn he left me on Fri<lb></lb>day—the morning previous to that would be Thursday—i said that on Tues<lb></lb>day or Wednesday the three people came—I cannot say the day indeed—it was a day or two before the boy quitted me that these three people came—I cannot say to the day—I kept him after that for the respect I had for him—I did not go and tell Mr. Rivers till after he was in the station-house—he never went to Mr. Rivers—he was taken to the station on Saturday night—it was not on that Saturday night that I went to Mr. Rivers—I went to Mr. Rivers on Sunday—a day or two before he left I had dis<lb></lb>covered he had robbed me to a great extent—on Friday he left, and on Saturday night he was in the station-house—on Sunday I went to Mr. Rivers—I did not give the boy a good character on that very Saturday—I gave him no character at all on Saturday—I mean deliberately to swear that—no gentleman called about his character on Saturday, upon my oath—I told a person on Saturday, that from the great respect I had for the boy I had previously given him a good character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, at ten o'clock on that Saturday night, that you had given him an excellent character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not at home at ten o'clock—I did not say so between eight and eleven o'clock—I am sure of that—I might have said on Saturday that I had given him a character to get a place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say on Saturday night that you had discharged him and given him an excellent character, and he had got another place, and was going to it on Wednesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot call to my mind whether I did on Saturday night—the policeman told me he was in the station-house—there was a gentleman with him who asked me if I had lost any thing, and I said, "Not to my knowledge"—they took me at a moment when I did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290153"></xptr>
               <p>not know what I was about—I was not twice deliberately asked the ques<lb></lb>tion, and I did not twice deliberately deny it—when the policeman come into my house, he said, "Have you lost a cash-box containing any money; have you lost any money?"—I said, "No, not to my knowledge"—he did not ask me if I had lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to my knowledge—I said, "I believe I have not lost any thing to that amount"—he did not—I told the officer that I did not know, to my knowledge, that I had lost any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And that after you had been told by three respectable people that he had been robbing you to a great extent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that to the officer—after I had given that answer, the officer told mo he had taken this boy into custody with a good many sovereigns on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not then say, "No doubt he has been robbing me?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Money is not my object in prosecuting—I did say that he had previously robbed me—I did not say that till the officer told me there was money found on the boy—I wished to protect the boy—I had previously wished to screen him from any thing he had done to me, and then the, officer put it blank to me—I did not tell the officer he had robbed me till he told me there was money found—I denied it when the officer came to fetch me, and said he was in custody—I did not say, "No doubt he has been robbing me, and I will go and recognise him"—the officer begged me to go directly—I said I would go with the officer—I went to the boy's lodgings, at the house of Mrs. Mary Ann Dickens, on Sunday morning, about half-past ten o'clock—his box was searched by the officer and myself—there was a bottle in the box—I said I would swear to it—I afterwards declined to do so, but I found when I got home that my wife had given it to him—I declined to swear to it before I left the house, or saw my wife, from motives of my own—I knew the bottle came from my shop; because I have so many like it—my good feeling towards the boy made me decline swearing to it on the spot—that was on the Sunday alter I had told the officer that he had rob<lb></lb>bed me—I did not say on Sunday morning, "I have no charge whatever against him"—I said I would not make any search—the officer was search<lb></lb>ing his box—I did not say, to my recollection, after the bottle was found, "I have nothing against him"—I believe I did not say so before the po<lb></lb>liceman and the prisoner's aunt—I cannot recollect saying those words—I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it when you first got into the room and saw the bottle that you swore to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was a small green bottle, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my observation about it was, "Oh never mind that, pass it over"—I have known the prisoner about two years next May—when the officer first came on Saturday I was very busy in my house—the house was full of customers—I think it was half-past nine o'clock—the officer said, "Your name is Smith, I believe?"—I said, "Yes, it is"—he said, "Have you not a barman who you discharged lately?"—I said, "Yes, yesterday afternoon"—he said, "He is taken to the station-house, and we are wait<lb></lb>ing for you, and you must come directly, before he is locked up, as he has been found in company with an old man with a great deal of money found on him"—he did not mention what amount at the time, but he asked me if I had lost a cash-box containing a quantity of sovereigns—I said, "I never had a cash-box, therefore I could not have lost it"—he asked me if I had been robbed of a large sum of money—my reply was that I had not been robbed, to my knowledge, of a large sum of money at once—I think that ended the conversation till I got on my coat—I am sure I said, "A</p>

               <p>large sum of money at once"—I said, "This is a very mysterious case, I will not go without a friend"—I asked a friend in my parlour to go with me—I said I had a very great respect for the youth, and I went with the officer to Bow-street with my friend—when I got there I found the boy arraigned before the bar, on the left of the old man—there was some money produced on that occasion in a box—I was taking stock at the time the prisoner left me—in the last six months I have been a loser of from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner never went to Mr. Rivers—on the Friday I was sit<lb></lb>ting eating my dinner in the small parlour with my door open, my wife was at the counter, and I saw the prisoner hastily put his hand into his pocket, and he drew a pint of beer for half a pint, and gave it for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I jumped up and gave him a box on the head, and sent him out—I did not make any mem<lb></lb>orandums of dates—I speak from recollection—it was before I had this in<lb></lb>formation from these people that I gave the character to Mr. Rivers—I was really desirous to screen the boy as much as possible—Mr. Rivers is a publi<lb></lb>can—I have no doubt about the money I left in the till on the night of the 4th, nor about the money I found in the till the next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time when you stated to the officer and the other person that you had not been robbed of a large sum at once, did you know of any spe<lb></lb>cific instance except the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From what my informants had told me—the prisoner's wages were 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when he went.</p>

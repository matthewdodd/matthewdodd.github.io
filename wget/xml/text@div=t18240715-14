On Saturday the 8th of May I left my apartments about five o'clock, and did not return till one in the morning - I then missed my great coat from behind the door, and a silk handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150009"></xptr>I was very tired, and went to bed, but in the morning I missed this chain and locket, with a number of other articles of jewellery, from my drawers. I had left the prisoner in the room when I went out; she had been in the habit of coming there for the last four months, to work for me, and go on messages, as I had been ill. I gave information at Marlborough-street, and she was absent for a month after that - I could not find her at her lodgings. I took her myself in Mary-le-bone-street, four weeks after, and asked what she had done with my property; she said she was innocent. The chain and locket were found at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say she wanted a servant, and I was to take that note to her, and that I could go to the Opera or play with her every night - A. I recommended her as a servant. I know gentlemen go there, but she keeps four servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you took girls home to live with you, and then recommended them to Wood - A. It is false.</p>

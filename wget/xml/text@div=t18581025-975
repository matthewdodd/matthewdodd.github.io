                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Cornelius Barham, a grocer in Spital fields. On the afternoon of 14th September, I was drawing a truck in Burr-street, Whitechapel-road—I saw the prisoner come behind the track, he turned round sharp, stepped aside, and said that the wheel was breaking down—I knew it was wrong—I stopped about two minutes after<lb></lb>wards and missed a parcel of sugar—I saw the prisoner running away with it under his arm, and called a policeman who pursued him, and he was taken on the 16th—the sugar was in a purple bag, and there were 14lbs. of it—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the sugar packed in the truck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a purple paper bag in a box in the truck—it was a bright day, there was no fog—when I saw the prisoner running back, he was about three hundred yards from me; I had never seen him before that day—the foreman of our establishment had loaded the truck; his name is Horton—there was in the truck about one hundredweight of moist sugar, 10lbs. of tea, and some coffee—the tea was in white paper—the other box contained some parcels—I did not load the truck, but I know by the bills what was in it—I did not put any of the parcels in myself—I had stopped half-an-hour before, and the sugar was all safe in the box; there was only a coarse sort of a bag over it—I took the cover off to see that all the things were safe—I always do so at a shop, and before that I had seen the things put in the box—I did not go to see if the sugar was there before I saw the prisoner running away—he had said that the wheel was breaking, that excited my suspicion—I stopped about two minutes after, and the prisoner was a distance of three hundred yards off—I uncovered the box and found the sugar was gone—I described the prisoner as well as I could to the police.</p>

On the 29th of December, I saw the prisoner Shade in company with the woman; she had something under her arm; she was going to a shop in King-street, Tower-hill. I stopped her; the man made off. I took the loaf of sugar from the woman.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120007"></xptr>I asked her how she came by it; she said she bought it at Mr. Vincent's, which was the house she was going into. I asked her what she gave a pound for it; she said, fifteen pence. I gave the loaf of sugar into Mr. Turnbridge's hands, he is the officer of the parish, and the next evening we went in pursuit of the man. We found him behind the Back-lane, in Thomas-street. Mr. Turnbridge went to the door, and asked if such a man lived there; they said he did, he was not within, and then I saw the prisoner coming along within four houses of his own door. I asked him if he lived at that door where the light was; he denied it. I took him to the door where the light was; the woman of the house said here is Mr. Shade. He took his key from his pocket, and unlocked his room door, which is the lower room. The officer searched the room, and found nothing. He made his escape while we were searching the room. I pursued him and brought him back; we then took him to the watchhouse.</p>

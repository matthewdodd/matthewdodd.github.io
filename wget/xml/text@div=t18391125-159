                  </hi>. I am butler to Thomas Metcalfe, Esq., of No. 24, Fitzroy-square, and have been so for sixteen years; I have the charge of his plate. I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years—he is a schoolmaster, and a teacher of languages—on the 9th of March last I employed him to teach me French, and he was teaching another person in the house reading, writing, and arithmetic—I used to take my French lessons in general in the butler's pantry—the plate we had in daily use was kept in a drawer in the pantry, and during the day that drawer was not locked—the prisoner was there twice a-week—between May and Septem<lb></lb>ber, several articles of plate were missing—on the 7th of November, Stan<lb></lb>nard made a communication to me while I was in the kitchen, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of that I requested the prisoner to walk up stairs—I said to him, "Le Maine, you have been taking my master's property"—he said, Do you suppose I would do such a thing?"—I said I was sorry to suppose it, but from the information I had, I was obliged to think so—he said, "If you suspect me, search me"—after a fork had been found on him, I begged him to confess that he had taken the things, and what had become of them, so that we might be able to get them so that we might be able to get them back again, and put them in their back again, and put them in their place—I said if he would tell me where they were, that we could get them back, and nothing further should he said about it—I placed 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into his hand, to go to a shop to get some of the property back—I appointed a friend to go with him knew nothing of it—I put my hand up to her throat, and she spat out two shillings and a halfpenny—I kept my hand to her mouth till we got to the station-house, and then found four shillings more in her mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live in Oxford-street. I know the prisoner—I first saw him on the 31st of May—on that day he brought two forks to my shop, and asked me to buy them—from their having a crest on them, I said, "It is not usual to buy articles with a crest on them"—he said, "Why?"—I said, "For fear they should be stolen"—he said, "I will satisfy you," and he gave me his card, "M. Le Maine, teacher of languages, No. 74, Wardour-street"—I said that was quite suffi<lb></lb>cient—I put the forks into the scale, and bought them for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put them in the window and sold them—I have here two tea-spoons, which I bought on the 7th of August, but I cannot say whether I bought them of the prisoner—here is a plated fork, but I do not know when it was brought, or whether it was brought by the prisoner—the plate had a talbot's head on it.</p>

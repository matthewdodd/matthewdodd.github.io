                  </hi>. I am a builder, and carry on business in Eglington, in Canada West—I have come over to this country on Mrs. Wilson's solicitation for the purpose of being a witness in this court—I saw, in company with Mrs. Allwood, a person who was going under the name of Gee—I knew that person before—I knew him in the year 1837, in the town<lb></lb>ship of York, Canada, about four miles and a half from Toronto—I knew him then under the name of Brown—he lived there for something like four years without interruption—it might be something less—I would not be positive as to that; it was about four years—he went away for a short time—I understood he went to Kingston—that in about 180 miles off—he came back—he was gone, I think, something like two years—I would not be positive of the particular date of his return—he certainly returned before 1843, or, at least, in 1843, not later—the last time I saw him, after he returned, he told me that he was living in Toronto, and that he had brought a wife from Kingston—I did not see the lady at that time; I saw her afterwards—he took a house two doors off, but he brought the lady to live with his brother-in-law, Mr. Brown, a builder—previous to taking a house he was serving his time with Brown, at the commencement of the arrangement—Brown married Gotobed's sister, and Jonathan was at that time serving his time to the building business with Brown, previous to his leaving—his wife's Christian name was Margaret—she was always treated</p>

               <p>by every one at his wife—they lived together as man and wife—they lived together at Brown's before he took a house for himself, and then he took a house and removed his wife into it, and they lived together in that house for a few months—I would not be positive as to how long; it is a long time since—I made a cradle for a baby that was born there, for Gotobed; it was born to him and his wife—I remember his leaving—he went away alone—I think it was in the fall of the year 1845, to the best of my recollection, and, I think, I have a pretty good recollection of it, for his brother-in-law, Brown, and I at that time had a contract jointly, that fixed it in my recollection; he had the brickwork and plastering of a private residence, and I had the joiner's work and carpentering—I do not think that Mrs. Gotobed was aware that her husband was going away—she lived in the house for some little time after he was gone—his work was not done when he left, and she was left very destitute—he tried to draw what money he could of a party who lent him some before he left—to the best of my recollection his wife did not remain there more than ten days or two weeks after he left; in fact, she had no means of living there, that is the truth of the matter—Mr. Brown removed her in a cart or waggon—I had no personal knowledge of the Guy family, except Mrs. Brown; I only knew there was such a family—that was the maiden name of the lady—when Gotobed came home he spoke of having been married at Kingston to Margaret Guy—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) I did not compare this certificate—my name is to it, and I had the Acknowledgments of the several parties—I saw the parties acknowledge their signatures—they must have been married about 1843—the last I heard of her was about 1850 or 1851, at the Provincial Fair; I did not see her—I heard it from Brown, her brother-in law—he had removed at that time from our neighbourhood, and met her at the Provincial Fair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, living at 8, Artillery-square—on the night of 10th April I was going down Dacre-street and saw the prisoner and a young man, the young man said to me, "You offended this young woman," I said, "No, I did not,"—I had not done or said anything to her, she said I did, and I said it was a lie, they then both struck me—the young man struck me first with his fist, and then the prisoner struck me—I could not tell what she struck me with at first, whether it was the knife or her fist—she struck me on the face, and cut me on the eye, through the eyelash and over the eye—I could not say how many times she struck me, there was</p>

               <p>only one cut on my face—a policeman came up and I gave the prisoner into custody—a woman went back and brought a young man who was with me, or she would have killed me dead on the spot, that was John O'Brien.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He came up and insulted me first, he was drank and struck me in the mouth, I forgot that I had a knife in my hand and it struck him in the mouth. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, I was not sober—I had some liquor taken—I had been drinking about two hours—I can't remember how much I had taken—O'Brien was in company with me before, but not at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the last witness at a public-house on this night—we were drinking our share of half a gallon of beer—I was not to say sober and I Was not drunk—I left him outside the public-house, and in consequence of something I heard I went back to Dacre-street and saw Jones and another man fighting against the wall and the prisoner was stand<lb></lb>ing in the middle of the road about four yards away, and he then ran up to Jones and struck him in the face with the knife—I saw the blood and caught hold of the girl and kept her and left the other two fighting—Jones struck the prisoner after she stabbed him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman A</hi> 244). I heard a disturbance in Dacre-street on this night, and went there and found the last witness holding the prisoner—the prosecutor charged her with stabbing him in the eye with a knife—I saw this knife in her hand, she dropped it and I picked it up—a person asked the prisoner if she had stabbed the man and she said, "Yes, I stabbed the <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> and would anyone else, he hit me"—going to the station she said, "I will do it, if it is for twenty years to come—I hare carried the knife all day, but somebody else has got it"—I understood her to mean that she had carried the knife to stab some one else—the prosecutor was drunk, O'Brien was sober.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Westminster hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on 11th April, at half-past twelve in the morning—he was suffering from an incised wound of the left upper and lower eyelid—I should say it was done with more than one stab, such a knife as this would inflict the wound—it was a very narrow escape from the eye, the lower lid was completely divided,. but the eye was un<lb></lb>touched.</p>

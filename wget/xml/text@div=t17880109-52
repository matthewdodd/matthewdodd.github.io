               <p>I know the prisoner very well; on the first of January I was going home to my lodgings; I was accosted by the prisoner in <placeName id="t17880109-52-crimeloc260">Lincoln's-inn-fields</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Have not you taken a false oath? - No, I never saw her before that night, I am confident she is the same woman; I had been enjoying a friend or two, but I was so sober, I can recollect every circumstance.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; the prosecutor applied to me, and said he had been robbed; I asked him if he was in liquor; he said he was a little in liquor, but not so much but not so much, but he knew what he was about; he gave me a description of the prisoner and her dress; I took her into custody; I found the prisoner and two more girls in bed, and a man with them; I ordered them to dress themselves, and asked the prosecutor to pick out the person, and he picked out the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw the person before in my life, I sell cakes; when he came into the room, he was a full hour before he swore to me, and the constable said, going along, if you do not swear to her, you will look foolish at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Constable. That is not true; I said to him, do not you, if you was in liquor, go to take the girl up; he said he knew what he was about; it was nothing in my way to take her up.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was there any light in the room when you went up together? - There was candle-light and fire-light in the room; when she went down stairs, she came up with the candle the first time, but the second and last time she came up without the candle.</p>

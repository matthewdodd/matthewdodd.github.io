                  </hi>. I live in South Conduit-street, Bethnal Green-road, and am a journeyman silk-weaver. I am the prisoner's brother—I remember going with him to get some money on last Thursday four weeks—I do not remember the day of the month—as we came down Bethnal Green-road, my brother hailed a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we went in it to Henneage-street, Brick-lane, and from there up Whitechapel, where he called out of the window for the <hi rend="italic">cap</hi>
                  <lb></lb>man to stop—he stopped at the public-house at the corner of Petticoat-lane, in which there was a Jew, or a man whom I considered a Jew, offering some clothes—my brother bought a pair of trowsers and a waistcoat of him for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had received some money in Henneage-street—directly after, as we were going to leave, the Jew pulled out a watch, and offered it for sale, and my brother purchased it for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was old-fashioned, similar to this one—it had the same figures on it—I cannot swear that this is the watch—I do not know the sign of the public-house.</p>

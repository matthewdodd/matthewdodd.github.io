               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house in March or April last? - A. I think it was the latter end of March, or beginning of April, I saw him at the Boar's Head, in Exeter-street; he had something to drink, but I cannot say what it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he pay for what he had? - A. Yes; he asked me for change of a pound note; I had not the note in my hand; I said, be so good as to put your name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce a note? - A. He had the note, as far as I recollect, in his hand; he threw the note on the table.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he put his name upon it? - A. I did not see him; I told my sister, who was in the bar, to be so good as put down a pen and ink for Mr. Gregory.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200078"></xptr>Q. Did you know his name then? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.He was no stranger? - A. He used the house as other customers did, backwards and forwards; I think my sister picked up the note, and put it in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your sister bring the pen and ink? - A. I turned my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or your sister take up the note to put it into the till? - A. I think it was my sister.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you or your sister take that note, or any other note, with the name of Gregory upon it? - A.Really I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether it was you or your sister? - A. I don't know that either of us did; it was a good while after before I heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that any thing happened about this note? - A. The note came in for payment to the Bank in May; I heard of it about the month of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Mr. Gregory, and had you any conversation with him about this note? - A. When I heard there was a note at the Bank with his name upon it, I asked him about it; I told him there was a note of his at the Bank stopped, with his name on it, and asked him if he would pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not threaten to summons him for it? - A. I said it was very hard that I should lose the note.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you settle it? - A. I dealt with Mr. Gregory; he sold linen; I took about thirty shillings worth of linen, and I paid the difference.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I apprehend this was above a twelvemonth ago? - A. I hardly recollect the circumstance at all, it is so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was a person using your house at different times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And continued to use it afterwards, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no account of the note, or put any name upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was put into the till, by whom you don't know? - A. I believe it was my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps taken out of the till, and put among a hundred notes? - A. I cannot say particularly a hundred notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever notes he gave you might be put among hundreds? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I am inspector of Bank-notes in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect speaking to the prisoner at the bar respecting his having uttered that note at Mrs. Goodall's, in Exeter-street? - A. Mr. Gregory, the prisoner at the bar, came down to the Bank to look at the note; I was present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was any Magistate present at the time? - A.There was not. The prisoner at the bar, Gregory, looked at the note, and said, that this was not his hand-writing; he brought a bit of paper down with his hand-writing upon it, and address; he said, that he had not passed a onepound note at Goodall's; if it was a Bank-note, it was a two-pound, it could not be a one; but he could not recollect changing any.</p>
               <p>Q.When was this? - A. I really don't know; I have made a memorandum in June last.</p>
               <p>Q. Not long after the note had been stopped payment? - A. No great while after; he denied then having uttered a one-pound note at Goodall's, if he had it must have been a two-pound; he said, that the writing upon it was not his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It is frequently the habit of persons who receive notes from others, to write the names of the persons from whom they receive them? - A.Frequently.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Were you groom to Mr. Trent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you first become acquainted with the prisoner at the bar, Gregory? - A.Sometime before July last.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any transactions with him, at what time, and of what nature? - A. Yes, I had; I was first introduced to him by another servant, Henry Nelland; Gregory bought a coat and a pair of boots of me, and paid two pounds for them. Upon the 12th of July I went off to Ireland with my master, and did not return till the 13th or 14th of November. My master took Lodgings in New Bond-street, No. 157.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner? - A. I suppose about the 17th to that of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200079"></xptr>20th of November; he called upon me, and gave me a card of his linen drapery; he was what you call a duffer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he call upon you? - A.In Bond-street, at the house; he told me he was very sorry he did not know me before I went to Ireland as he did then; he said, if he had, he would have given me something else than the two pounds which he had given me for the clothes, and that I might have had some pounds in my pocket on the road by it. I asked what it was; he told me he would call next morning, and let me know, between ten and eleven o'clock; accordingly he did, with Warren in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Warren before? - A. I had seen him with Gregory, but did not know him by name.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then? - A. He wrapped at the door, the maid came up stairs, and I desired her to send them down; Gregory and I went into the cellar of my master's house, and Warren stood at the corner of the area, looking down; he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and pulled out a onepound note, and asked me if I would like that and another in the place of the two-pound note he had given me for the clothes before I went to Ireland; he said, if he had known me as well then as now, he would have given me the two one-pounds notes in the place of that.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you make to that? - A. I said, I was perfectly satisfied with it; he told me he could let me have twenty of them for ten pounds, so I kept the pound note; I asked him if it was safe to pass it; he said it was perfectly so; he said, he would call upon me in a short time; they then left me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner again? - A.About two or three nights afterwards, he called at my stables in North Portland Mews, in Baker-street, in company with Warren; my wife was up stairs; Gregory went up stairs to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Warren and you had some transaction below? - A. Yes; I had notes in my hand when Gregory came down.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of notes, and how many? - A.Nineteen one-pound notes, and the one he gave me made twenty.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In his first conversation he left the one-pound note with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in the stable Warren gave you nineteen one-pound notes, together with the one-pound note that Gregory had given you, made up the twenty-pounds? - A. Yes; Gregory came down; we did not settle about the price of them; he asked me eight pounds for the twenty notes, so I agreed to give him between five pounds and eight pounds, and I gave him six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you pay for them at that time? - A. Yes, I did; I paid it to Warren, in the presence of Gregory.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you pay that six pounds? - A. It was in pound notes. I asked Warren who it was that made them (Gregory was by) he said, that he made every halfpenny worth of the things belonging to them except the plate, and that Gregory filled them up; Gregory then said, "when I am sober and free from drink, I can forge any man's hand in England;" at the same time I observed to him, that the numbers on one of the notes were very badly done; he put his hand into his pocket, and took out about twenty good Banknotes, and he shewed me one as badly written as the one he had given me, and he said, when they did them badly, he should do the same. Nothing more passed at the time; then they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Gregory? - A. Warren then brought me a bedstead, for which I paid him eight and thirty shillings. My master was going to Bath after Christmas, and Gregory called on me to borrow 15l. of me; I told him that I had it not by me at the time. My master and I went off to Bath the day after Christmasday, and returned in a fortnight from that day to London; Gregory applied to me a very short time afterwards, about the 15th of January, for the 15l. again, and told me that he would give me a respectable tradesman's promissory note for 15l. and I told him, I would give it him, and I gave him a bill of exchange upon Mess. Cowan and Son for 15l. 6s. and he returned me the six shillings; he gave me a promissory note of a person of the name of Phillips, Hungerford-market; I lost the note in two days after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Gregory? - A. Not till about five or six nights after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that you saw him again? - A. I suppose about a month after; he called at my stables first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him in? - A No, my helper, a person of the name of Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come alone, or Warren with him? - A.They were both together; they came to the Worcester-Arms public-house, the corner of the Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. You found from the conversation with them that they had been at your stables? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed between you and Warren there? - A. The conversation was about this 15l. note; I said, I was sorry I had lent Gregory the money, for I wanted it; then Warren told me, in the presence of Gregory, he would let me have plenty of money. I asked him why he did not give it to Gregory; he said, that he would as soon give it me, and asked me then to take 147 of these notes for 30l. and that he would deduct the 15l. which I had lent to Gregory; I told him, that I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200080"></xptr>pass any of them, and he said I should be very safe in passing them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who said that? - A.Gregory and Warren both, that I should be perfectly safe in passing them, as one night he and Gregory went to Vauxhall, and passed near twenty forged notes in the Gardens; on another night, at a dinner at Highgate, they changed a five-pound note for a farmer; Warren gave him three and Gregory two bad notes; and that Warren said, at the same time, he had been six years at it, and never met with a disappointment. Then the next time we met again, I went from Bond-street to Gregory's house; it was about a week after that.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it? - A. It was in the latter end of January, or the beginning of February, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to Newton-street? - A. I called on Warren and Gregory both, to let them know I had lost the note.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find them both there? - A. I only found Warren.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing in the house? - A. Yes, I did, in the workshop of Warren (it was a front garret) I saw a machine fixed there.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose name was on the door? - A.Gregory's name. The first thing I saw were these irons fixed on a table; they were high irons fixed on a table with screws.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the machine there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the trough? - A. Yes, and there was a wheel in it, and something at the bottom white, like thick milk; there was a wooden press, and I saw a copper-plate lay beside it upon the bench.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what was upon it? - A. Yes; it was; "promise to pay."</p>
               <p>Q. That was to impress these one-pound Bank-notes you saw? - A. Yes; I asked him where he got it. I saw some notes ready, all but the manuscript part; he shewed me one of those notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him again? - A. A short time after I saw Warren and the prisoner together at the Worcester-Arms; there was some company in the parlour (the very place where they always sat); we had two pints of ale, and, after some conversation, (I was in a hurry to go to my master,) Gregory and Warren told me that they could not at that time let me have what I wanted, and the next day he called upon me, and left a message with the helper, as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, what did you do? - I went to the Worcester-Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. Yes, sitting in the same place; after sometime every body went away but we three, when Gregory got up, and put his back to the door, and said, he had the notes fastened with a pin between the frame of the table and the leaf; he said he did not care a d-n for all the Bow-street officers in London; the notes were fastened at another table where the company had been sitting; we then turned down the Mews, and he gave me the notes, and desired me to count them when I got into the stable. These were the fifty notes which I should have told you of before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any agreement with Warren for the fifty notes? - A. No; the agreement was made for 147, and the fifty were in part of the 147. Warren and Gregory both said, that whenever they went out to pass notes of this description it was at night; that they took the pricker they marked the wood with, and they rolled up their notes in a lump of brown paper, and went into the necessary of the public-house, and fastened there backwards under the seat of the necessary, the back part where it was clean, with this pricker, and that they would come in every now and then from time to time as they wanted a note, as they could not be hurt if one only was found at a time upon them. Then Gregory called on me shortly after.</p>
               <p>Q. They gave you fifty notes in the yard to count them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any payment upon them at the time? - A. No, we parted; Gregory came to me at the stable about four days after, I think, and told me that he had passed a forged note to a publican, and to take care to destroy any papers in my room with his name upon them for fear of a discovery, for he had been brought to the Bank, and examined before an Inspector; that the Inspector put out his hand, and asked him whether that was his name, and that he had said it was not. We parted then.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened upon denying his name at the Bank? - A.Nothing; he was set at liberty.(Note produced and read.)</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Gregory? - A. Shortly after that I saw Gregory again.</p>
               <p>Q. What then passed? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and Gregory about what had passed with Warren? - A. No, nothing, that I can recollect at the present.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing with respect to that subject? - A. Yes, there was about the ninety-seven notes that remained; Gregory told me, that he would send Warren with the remaining ninety-seven; accordingly he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards? - A. I think it was about three weeks; but he said he had broke the handle of his machine, or that I should have had them before; I would not take the notes at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Gregory had told you about the publican's story? - A. Yes; I told him I had not passed any of the others; but I told him of a person who had passed some, and I would bring them together if he chose it; he said, he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200081"></xptr>not see him - that bringing too many into a thing of the kind, always made it turn out very bad; then he went away in a passion, because I would not take the remainder.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you afterwards, and when, see Gregory? - A.This man and I went in company to Gregory's house, but they were all out.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you afterwards see Gregory? - A. No, not till after he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever make any payment to Warren with the Bank-notes you received from your master? - A.All that I paid Warren was in money I had received from my master, Mr. Trent.</p>
               <p>Q.Now state what these payments were? - A. The first payment was four guineas in gold, and a one-pound note; the second payment was a twopound note, with my master's name upon it, and a one-pound note, which in all made eight pounds four shillings, and I owes the remainder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.How long have you been in custody-yourself upon this charge? - A. A month to day.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it that you first became acquainted with Gregory? - A.Before I went to Ireland, the 12th of July.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before last July - was it a month or two? - A. It was not a month, I am sure it was not a month.</p>
               <p>Q.You are quite sure, when you saw this press we have heard of, Gregory was not present? - A. No; Warren was.</p>

               <p>Q.How many conversations at different times had you about forged notes? - A. That I cannot tell; it was a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q.Though you did not pass any yourself, you gave them to others to pass? - A. Yes, another person did pass them.</p>
               <p>Q.You told him to do it? - A.No; he told me he was out of place, and he should be glad to get them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell him they were forged notes? - A. I told him what they told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you ever get delivered to you? - A. I got first 20, and then 147 after, in three different times.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon, you knowing them to be forged, did you give any intelligence to any Justice about it? - A.Not at all till I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q.So you had been receiving 20 and 147 notes, which you knew to be forged? - A. I did not know them at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you know them to be forged? - A. I cannot tell how long; at the first conversation I was told that they were forged.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell any Justice or constable about it the first time you were taken up? - A. I will tell you the reason of that; Warren told me, in the presence of Gregory, that if this man was taken, and I came forward, I was sure to be hanged - that I certainly would be hanged if I was to own to it.</p>
               <p>Q.How many examinations did you attend, before you were good enough to give that account to the public what you have been telling to-day? - A. I suppose three. He told me, at Liverpool a person was taken up for passing forged Bank-notes, Warren and Gregory both - that he had too guineas in gold in his pocket, and 200l. in forged notes, and he suffered to go through his trial rather than make a discovery, and that he was transported for fourteen years; and this very man wrote me a note in the prison in cold Bath-fields; I destroyed the note that the prisoner wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Gregory's hand-writing? - A. It is very hard to know it; I know the note was Gregory's hand-writing, because he wrote it with a pencil, and sent it up stairs to me; he requested of me, whatever I might say of the other man, to say nothing about him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you seen him write often? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You thought it was a better thing, when you were likely to be hanged yourself, to turn King's evidence? - A. No; Sir Richard Ford, in a very feeling manner, told me, that Warren and Gregory were in the habit of doing those things for a great while back, - that a great many knew of it, - that it was a pity to let such people escape, and that it was in my power to give evidence against them, which I did; I thought I was in duty bound to do it.</p>
               <p>Q.You know, by giving that account, you would be saved yourself? - A. No, I have no purpose at all.</p>
               <p>Q.You think you shall be hanged now? - A. I don't know it.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, don't you believe, in conlequence of the evidence you have given to-day, you shall be saved from prosecution? - A. I don't know whether I shall be saved, or hanged, myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You have been asked how long you have been in custody; had you ever been in custody for the Bank-note passed to Mrs. Goodall? - A.No; Sir Richard took me over, and swore me to my own confession.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that what you said, or meant to say, to this gentleman? - A.Certainly it was.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole account you have given here of the connection with those persons, is the truth? - A. Yes. (The press and trough produced.)</p>
               <p>- CROKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.Were you the officer that searched the lodgings at No. 14, Newton-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose name was upon the door of that house? - A. Mr. Gregory's.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find those things, now produced, in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200082"></xptr>Q.Tell us what part of the house you found the articles in? - A. In the front garret.</p>
               <p>Q.How were they placed when you first saw them? - A.This wheel was found in pieces.</p>
               <p>Q.How was the press and the table? - A.These two were found in one corner, but all the materials were found in the room, excepting these three things; one was found in the cellar window, halfmoons they are called; the other two were found under ground in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I should have supposed, but for what you have explained now, that all these things were ready in the state in which they are now? - A.They were all in one room, excepting these things.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the press in the condition it is now? - A.Not as it is now; it was not put together upon the table.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. It was on the Tuesday morning, the 29th, when you took these things? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.O'Loughlin was taken up upon the 28th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GARNETT TERRY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am engraver to the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that Bank-note; is that Bank-note engraved from the plates of the Bank of England? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you suffciently acquainted with the signatures? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you employ any other engraver? - A. I am the principal; it is not from any of these plates.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you conversant with the mode of making paper? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you look at that through and the wheel; is that an instrument that might be used in the making of paper? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. The materials of which paper are made, are first reduced to a pulp? - A. Yes; I found the pulp sticking about the corners of the trough.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the use of the wheel? - A. It appears to me to have been used as the hog for separating the pulp, and keeping it from floating.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you look at these instruments; would they be useful in impressing an impression on a plate? - A.They might, these two irons might; these two half-moons are for a printing-press.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are not a paper-maker, but an engraver belonging to the Bank of England, and you are capable of knowing that these things might be employed in papermaking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In all papers? - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Q.Might not they be used for any other purpose as well as making paper? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. That may be just as well used for copypaper and demy paper? - A.Not demy; it must be small paper.</p>
               <p>HENRY NELLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. In whose service were you last summer? - A.

            . I live at the Scepter and Crown in East-Smithfield, and have been there about ten or eleven months. I had been in Portsmouth from the 15th or 16th of January, 1749, and staid there till the 10th or 11th of March following, then I came to London again. The time I was at Portsmouth, the prisoner at the bar lodged at Mrs. Comings's house in Gosport-point, I lodged there also. I saw him every day there till I came away, and then I left him there, he was the last man I took my leave of. He used then to wear a dark brown coat, and a short brown wig, now I see he wears his own hair.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I am a seaman. I was on board the Winchester, commanded by Captain Chapman; also on board the Severn, a West-Indiaman.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she return?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I cannot justly tell. The captain left me on shoar in the East-Indies, so I came passenger to Lisbon in a Portugal Indiaman.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you imployed now?</p>
               <p>Peterson. Sometimes I work on board a ship to load, or rig, or haul a ship out of the dock, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Comings living?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I cannot tell.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230030"></xptr>Q. What did you imploy yourself about at Portsmouth ?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I spent my money as fast as I could. I did not work there at all. When I spent my money I came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. How have you lived since?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I work for one shilling and sixpence per day, victuals and drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Peterson. He is a cabinet maker, he used to wear an apron. I think he work'd at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him at work ?</p>
               <p>Peterson. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman do you take him to be?</p>
               <p>Peterson. He is an Irishman, so am I.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be sure of the day you went to Portsmouth and your return?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I had a memorandum to Mrs. Comings's house in my pocket-book, and what I was to pay her per week.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is that book?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I have lost it.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street, St. Martin's-lane, I rent a room there. January was twelvemonth I lived with my master at Lambeth, in the latter end of that month, the 27th or 28th, I went down to Portsmouth to work, and continued there till the beginning of April, and since that lodged at one Mr. Wood's a boatman, he lets out boats. I ply'd on the water from Gosport to Portsmouth, I knew the prisoner at that time. The first time I saw him was about the 16th or 17th of Feb. I was at work on the point and he came down to the water side, I had a fare over, then I said to him, how do you do Mr. Bride? I had seen him in London some time before, and carried him by water here. I saw him every day till the 25th of February, and that day I saw him on the point. That day I had an accident happened in carrying a man over to portsmouth, by oversetting my boat, between four and five in the afternoon, by which I was like to lose my life: the next day I saw the prisoner there, and told him what had happen'd to me. He said he lodg'd at one Mrs. Comings's, who keeps a brandy-shop, I have drank with him there, saw him I believe every day, and sometimes two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I have known him almost three years, I first came acquainted with him in the year 1748; he is a cabinet-maker, and I have heard him say he had been at sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live when you first knew him?</p>
               <p>Richardson. At London, but in what part I cannot tell. I have carried him by water here several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him wear soldier's cloaths?</p>
               <p>Richardson. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he went to Portsmouth for?</p>
               <p>Richardson. To work at his own business, I suppose.</p>

I gave her a Strict Charge never to open the Parlour Windows in a Morning before some other of the Family were come down Stairs, for fear some valuable Goods which I had there might be lost. But the Morning in which I was robbed, she got up earlier than ordinary, and opened the Parlour Windows betwixt 5 and 6, which was soon after the Watchman went off. I had a little black Girl in the House, and the Prisoner sent her into the Kitchen to light a Fire, which was not usual. My Daughter coming down Stairs, the Prisoner heard her, and cry'd out, Thieves! The House is robb'd! One of the Slashes was thrown up, and the Window Cushion was sandy, but seemed rather to be thrown on for a Pretence, than to be the real Mark of a Foot that had entred at the Window. Most of the Prisoner Sarah's Cloaths were sent away just before this Robbery, the Prisoner William being the Person that brought Sarah to me, and pass'd for her Father. I took an Officer and searched his House, where we found a Cambrick Handkerchief and a Sheet of mine, but cannot be positive that they were lost at the same time as I lost the Candlestick.

             depos'd to the same Purpose, and the Constable confirm'd the finding of the Sheet and Handkerchief. The Prisoner Sarah thus defended herself. My Master bade me get up earlier than usual, which I did, and opened the Parlour Windows, not thinking any Hurt. I ordered the Black Girl to make a Fire; but she being awkward at it, I went into the Kitchen, and staid Half an Hour to instruct her. When I came up again, I miss'd the Silver Branch out of the Parlour. I was frightned, and screamed out, and just at that instant my young Mistress came down.

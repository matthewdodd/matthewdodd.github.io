               <p>Sims. About ten minutes before twelve at noon, and the prisoner's pocket seemed to be heavy; I suspected him, and I bid the East India Company's elder porter search this Jones , but I did not see him searched.</p>

            . I am elder porter to the East India Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Sims desire you to search the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Frost. Yes ; and I searched him, and found six mother of pearl shells upon him, and the pocket was large , and uncommon.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the shells worth?</p>
               <p>Frost. four or five shillings, sometimes they are worth more, and sometimes less, I cannot set a value upon them; and I took him to the Castle in Mark Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose property they are?</p>
               <p>Frost. I cannot say, but I missed them out of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess where he had them?</p>
               <p>Frost . He said he had concealed them for a quarter of a year in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the shells you took out of his pocket?</p>
               <p>Frost. I cannot swear to them, but they are very much like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you seal them up?</p>

               <p>Mr. Letchmere, a warehouse-keeper to the East India Company, produced a letter the prisoner sent to him, directed to Mr. Letchmere, in Mark Lane, in which was a petition to the hon. the East India Company (which was read) in which he humbly acknowledges his fault, in taking six mother of pearl shells, out of the drug warehouse; and asks pardon of the hon. the East India Company, and begs of them to pardon him as being the first time, and assures them, that he never knew any body that robbed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this wrote with his own hand?</p>
               <p>Letchmere . Only the name I believe.</p>

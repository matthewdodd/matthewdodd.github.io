                  </hi>. I live at Furnish Pelham, in Hertfordshire—on Tuesday, 3d December, I came to London with my mare and cart, with a load of clover to the Curtain-road, Shoreditch, at a little before 12 o'clock—I there saw the prisoner with another man, and asked him to mind my horse while I went and fetched a paroel—I went into a public-house with the other man—the prisoner said, "Give me the whip"—I gave it to him, and said I should be gone five or six minutes—I returned to the spot in about six minutes and he was gone, and the mare, can, and clover, too—I had not given him any authority to take it away—I ran down the street to look after it—about 7 o'clock in the same evening I saw my brother-in-law, Lewis King, and he showed me the hone, cart, and clover, somewhere in Islington—it was the same that I had lost.</p>

I live at Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire—the last witness is my brother-in-law—on Tuesday, 3d December last, about half-past 1 in the afternoon, I was in Tottenham-court-road—I there saw the prisoner with my brother-in-law's horse and cart with another man—I knew by the way the clover was tied, that it came from our place—I thought my brother-in-law was with it, and went up and spoke to the men—the man who was with the prisoner said, "If you have more right to this horse and cart than I have take it," and be threw down the whip and ran away—I have known the prisoner all my life under the name of John Morrell of Whitford—I said, "You stole this horse and cart, and load of clover"—a corn-chandler was looking at it at the time—I think his name was Swindler—the prisoner wanted to run away with the other one, and I said, "No, I shall keep you"—I then took the horse and cart to the station-house, and then led it to Wright's place in Islington—I then went to look for my brother-in-law, and found him in the Kingsland-road.</p>

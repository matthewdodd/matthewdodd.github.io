I took the Prisoner to my door, and a little boy brought a cloak to me, said I, this is my cloak, and my number, (as I can prove by my number book) and he said, is this your cloak? I said yes. [Mr. Felton had the cloak in his hand.]</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any dirt upon it?</p>
               <p>Felton. Very little, my Lord. It was dropped at the woollen-draper's door, the corner of Aldgate; I suppose the other three cloaks were handed away. The Prisoner was carried before my Lord Mayor, and my Lord asked him what he was, and he said he was a draw boy.</p>

             . I am servant to Mr. Staines, a hatter and hosier, opposite to Mr. Felton's shop. On the ninth of February, about six in the evening, I saw the Prisoner lurking about for some time; a cart was coming by, and he took the opportunity to break the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the glass break ?</p>
               <p>Chipperfield. Yes, I heard the glass fall.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you observe him there?</p>
               <p>Chipperfield . About five minutes, and then I heard the glass fall upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken out?</p>
               <p>Chipperfield . No, I did not; there was a cart coming by when he broke the window?</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he broke the window?</p>
               <p>Chipperfield. Because I saw him run from the window as soon as the glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing under the Prisoner's arm?</p>
               <p>Chipperfield. I saw him have something under his coat , and he held the flap up.</p>

             . As I was fitting behind my master's Counter (I am servant to Mr. Staines) I saw a boy at Mr. Felton's window.</p>
               <p>Q. What boy?</p>
               <p>Wansborough. That boy, the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him?</p>
               <p>Wansborough. Yes, I have seen him that way several times. I saw him walking backwards and forwards before Mr. Felton's window five or six minutes, and he took an opportunity of breaking the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him break the window?</p>
               <p>Wansborough. No, the cart hindered that. Said I, there is a boy taking something out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body take any thing out of the window?</p>
               <p>Wansborough. No; but a boy came by, and said here is some of your goods.</p>

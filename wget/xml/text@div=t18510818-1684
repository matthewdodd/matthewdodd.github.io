                  </hi>. I am a bookseller and stationer, at 1, Watson's-buildings, Kingsland-road. Mrs. Mary Taylor boards and lodges with me—she is eighty-four years old—the female prisoner was our servant, and left of her own accord on 7th June—on 10th Jan. I went with Mrs. Taylor to the Bank, when she received her dividend—she received a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, of which I took the number—it was No. 9632, dated 9th Nov., 1850—on 27th April I saw that safe in Mrs. Taylor's reticule, in the drawing-room—I missed it about the middle of July—I went to the Bank to stop its payment, and found it had already been exchanged—I believe the male prisoner is the female's father, and is a porter in Cheapside—I gave information to the police, and went to 7, Sugarloaf-court, Thames-street, and there gave the female into custody—she said she knew nothing at all about it.</p>

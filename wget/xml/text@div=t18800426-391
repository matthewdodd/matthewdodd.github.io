                  </hi>. I am the father of Kate Rosenblatt, who was 18 on the 13th January last—she lives with me at 16, Floodgate Street, White<lb></lb>chapel—I had a notice of vaccination given me at the time of the regis<lb></lb>tration of her birth and also a certificate of her birth—I produced them at the police-court—I have known the defendant about nine months—my daughter pointed him out to me in the street about 12 months since—about nine months since he called on me and introduced himself as Jacob Barnett—he said he had taken a liking to my-daughter and wished to keep company with her—I said I thought it was rather a liberty on his part, not knowing who he was, and that my daughter was too young for any such thing as that, and I showed him the notice of vaccination—I had her registered in 1862—he was satisfied of the fact—at a third conversation I told him I would hear no more of it—a few weeks later I got ruined by a man named Butler—three or four days after the defendant asked ma again for my sanction—there is a ceremonial among the Jews of betrothal—on the 6th October I was quite ignorant of any intended marriage—I had no objection to him when I found there was nothing detrimental to his character, but my daughter not liking him I could not give my consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the police-court that I had known the de<lb></lb>fendant since he first followed my daughter—I knew of his existence five years ago—his financial position was immaterial to me if his character was good; certainly it was acceptable—the last time I saw the defendant before commencing the prosecution I think was when he assaulted my daughter with the intention of outraging her, and he was bound over to keep the peace—I borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on the 4th October—he gave my daughter presents before he so deceived her; he gave her a gold watch and chain which turned out to be brass—I first knew of the marriage on the evening of the 28th October—my daughter is now in her nineteenth year—I made inquiries at once, but finding that the price of proceedings would be ridiculous in my circumstances, I had to give up the idea until I went to that noble institution the Protection Society, and they have given me assistance—I believe they watched the case at the first hearing—they</p>

                  </hi>. I am Registrar of Births and Marriages for the Whitechapel district—I attested this notice of intended marriage on the 6th October (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I recognise the defendant—the notice was read to him, and he signed it, giving his name as Jacob Barnett, and the girl's name as, Kate Rosenblatt—he described himself as a bachelor, and her as a spinster, and his age as 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and hers as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent Registrar of Marriages for the Whitechapel district—I produce my book, containing an entry of a marriage which took place between the defendant and Kate Rosenblatt—I do not recognise, the defendant—he is described as 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have no recollection of the circumstance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Whatever replies were made to my test questions would be made by Kate—the entries in this register are taken down in the first instance from the notice duly entered and declared to by the parties—the Registrar next asks any additional questions required, as to the father's name and occupation—wherever a party is of the exact age of 21 years, it is my practice to ask certain test-questions of the party whose age is so stated—my form of question is usually in these words: "You are 21 years old last birthday, when was; that?" and the party questioned would answer—I have no doubt Kate Rosenblatt gave me the age of 21, but I cannot recall</p>

               <p>the exact circumstance, and this question not being always put in the same form, I am not in a position to swear—the marriage certificate is also signed "Kate Rosenblatt," in a woman's handwriting, undoubtedly in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The questions I ask are not obligatory—the certificate I issue is final—Registrar makes the entry—those are merely test-questions of my own after the issue of my certificate—my certificate is a sort of notice that 21 days have elapsed, and no caveat is issued, and that the parties may be married, and when they come to be married at my office I ask further questions.</p>

               <p>Q. So they did not stay to assist in robbing the woman?</p>
               <p>Evans. No; I did not stay five minutes, because I heard a coach or something. They ran away directly as I fired the pistol, before I jumped up into the chaise; the gentlewoman gave me the purse, and I took out 2 s. I believe there was more money; if I had had a knife, I should have cut her pocket off; after I had robbed her I came away. I overtook the prisoners in Gray's-inn-lane by chance.</p>

            . The two prisoners and Evans came into our house, and asked for a lodging; they went into the kitchen; I said do you know what you are to pay for a bed? they said, yes; I asked them what? they said a shilling a piece; I went to my master and told him of it; he said, may be they are apprentices; he came and questioned them; they said one of them came from sea, and they seemed to laugh at it; they threw down a 5 s. 3 d. and my master gave them 2 s. 3 d. change; they gave me 3 d. when they went up stairs to go to bed, they said they would lie all together.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was it?</p>
               <p>Humpedge. It was Tuesday, Michaelmas day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there on Wednesday night?</p>
               <p>Humpedge. No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Griffiths's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the affair; I know nothing about it; I am just come from sea; I knew Johnson before I went to sea; he was an apprentice in St. Martin's-lane; I have seen him down at Westminster; he asked me to take a walk; I went along with him; I went out to sea in the Queen, to the East Indies.</p>

            ; we went down to Westminster; we went into the Nag's Head; we saw Evans there; we had a pint or two of beer; Evans asked us if we would take a walk; he took us up to Hampstead and in coming back again this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Constable. You said there were two men on your side of the chaise, and one on the maid's side.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Constable. Yes.</p>

I was on duty at a quarter before eight o'clock on the 10th of Feb., in a mews behind Park-terrace, Islington—Mr. Figgins's stable and one other are in that mews—I saw Bolden come out of the mews with a truss of hay—he went towards High<lb></lb>bury-vale, which is about a quarter of a mile off—I followed him about 200 yards, and asked him where he was going with the hay—he would not give me an answer for several minutes, and when he did speak he asked me if I would forgive him—he said it was the first time, and he hoped I would for<lb></lb>give him, and not take him back—I said I must take him back with me—I asked him where he brought it from—he would not give me an answer—I asked if he did not get it from No. 19—he said, "Page must have told you all this"—Page is employed by Mr. Stanton—I took Bolden to Mr. Figgins's house—I knocked, and Richardson came to the door—he said, "Policeman,</p>

               <p>it is all right; don't make a bother about it; I lent the man a truss of hay"—Mrs. Figgins was there, and she directed me to take Bolden to the station—I afterwards met Richardson in the gravel walk, and took him.</p>

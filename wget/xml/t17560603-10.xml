               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. I was before the justice, when he was charged by Mr. Priest as having offered these diamonds to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Before what justice?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. Before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he came by them?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. He said he found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they produced by?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. By Mr. Priest.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these diamonds produced by him part of your diamonds?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Gifford there at the time?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. She was, and she thought so too.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these diamonds taken from?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. From a drawer in my chamber; but he was not my servant at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he left your service before you missed the bracelet?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. About a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you other servants in the house that had frequent opportunities of taking this thing?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. There was a charewoman that I took up, and had before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not committed upon this account?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. She was, to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she continue there?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. She continued there about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. Because I heard he had offered some diamonds to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular reasons to apprehend they were your diamonds, because one may be like another?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. They were very like what I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had them?</p>
               <p>M. Hust. About six months.</p>

            . I live with a jeweller. I had four large diamonds of my brother, and the prisoner brought me fourteen more. I ask'd him how he came by them; he said he had them of a gentlewoman that served the dutchess of Somerset. He wanted to know what they were worth. I took him to a jeweller in Greek-Street (my master not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175606030008"></xptr> being at home) but that jeweller did not know the value of them.</p>

               <p>G. Priest. In Dean Street, to the best of my knowledge, in a paper tied up with a packthread.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the time he told you he found them, and the time he was before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>G. Priest. About 5 or 6 days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about what he said concerning whom he had them of?</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Gifford there?</p>
               <p>G. Priest. She was, and said the four capital stones were the same, she believed, that she sold to Mrs. Hust.</p>

               <p>Priest. The prisoner told me he would bring me some more diamonds when he brought the four others; he said the gentlewoman whom he had them of, wanted two guineas on them; I said I would let him have one, which I did. The next day he brought fourteen more. The diamonds produced in court.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Gifford. I believe the four large ones are the same which were in the bracelet. I told Mrs. Hust.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Hust. Are these the same that were shewed before justice Fielding ?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hust. They are the same.</p>

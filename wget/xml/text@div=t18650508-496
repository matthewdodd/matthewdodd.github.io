                  </hi>. I am a seaman, at 5, Providence-alley, Aldgate—on the Friday before the 26th April, I was in Rosemary-lane, about half-past 11—I had had three glasses of stout—I do not consider I was the worse for liquor, because I knew what I was about—the prisoner came up to me just by the wall of the Mint and began to hustle me about, and 1 felt queer as if something came across me; I am certain something came across my nose—he asked me for some drink after knocking me about—I took him into a public-house to get rid of him—I went into the Blackamoor's Head, and gave him a glass of beer there; he then followed me out, and pulled me down a street, and tried to push me further down the street—my wife then came up to me—the prisoner asked her what she wanted with me—we came up to the door and we thought he had left altogether—a girl then came up to the door and turned my wife round, and the prisoner made a snatch at my waistcoat-pocket and took a purse con<lb></lb>taining 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the force of pulling it, I fell down and he ran away—I did not see him again till the Tuesday evening; there was a policeman present on the Friday, and a complaint was made at the time—he came in to see me after I was taken indoors—I did not complain to the police on the Sunday, I was insensible at the time—I next saw the prisoner at Leman-street police-station—the policeman came and told me the prisoner was taken, and I was to pick him out—the prisoner was placed with five or six others, and I identified him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on this Friday night I was called down by my landlady—I went down the street—my husband was at the top of the street with the prisoner—I recognised him again when I saw him at the police-station—my husband was pulling his left arm from him—I went towards them, the prisoner asked me what I wanted with the man—I told him he was my husband—he then left and we thought he was gone—we walked to our own door, 'about the middle of the street, and just as we were entering the door a girl pulled me round by the arm—I turned round and asked what the wanted, and with that the prisoner snatched the purse from my husband's waistcoat pocket; the violence of the snatch threw my husband down, about a yard from me, he remained insensible for some time.</p>

The last witness and her husband lodged with me in Providence-alley—on Friday night, in consequence of hearing some voices outside, I looked out, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner—the prisoner was jostling him—I went and told Mrs. Williams, and she went out—I saw the prisoner snatch the purse just by the door—Mrs. Williams went out—I saw the prisoner coming down the street with him, and when he came as far as the door this man turned round and slewed Mr. Williams round and snatched his purse—I am sure he is the person—I saw him again on the Tuesday night in Leman-street—I cannot recognise him for I was not many minutes at the door—I pointed out some other man—the prisoner is the size of the man.</p>

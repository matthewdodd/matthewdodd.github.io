After I recovered myself I got up, and walked about twenty yards, I saw the watchman, who asked me if I had lost any thing; I told him I had been robbed of my hat and handkerchief - He told me to follow him. I went as far as Ratcliff-highway with him, when he told me he had found the man with my hat - I was just behind him; when I came up he shewed me the prisoner and hat; I told him if it was mine, it was a China hat, and had the name of "J. Hoy," wrote in it. He shewed me the prisoner and the hat at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH KENDALL. I am a watchman. I was calling twelve o'clock in Back-lane, Ratcliff-highway, and saw four men coming up the road towards me, as soon as they saw me they turned back to the fields, nearly opposite to my box, they are called Blue-coat-fields; a woman came up and said, "there are four thieves gone on with a hat."<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170045"></xptr>As I went after them I met the prosecutor without a hat, he said he had been robbed of it; I told him to follow me - I went down the fields-the men were about three yards off - I noticed that the first three had no hat except their own; I then came up to the prisoner, he immediately ran towards a girl with the hat in his hand - I asked him what he did with the hat, he spoke to the girl and tried to conceal it - He said he picked it up in a kennel; I told him he must go back with me, and took him to the end of the fields and waited for the prosecutor - he came up - I said this man has got your hat - He said "if it is mine it is a Chinese hat with the name of Hoy in it." I took the prisoner to the watch-house. The prosecutor was a little fresh, but not intoxicated. The prisoner put the hat in the kennel and wetted it, to show me how he had found it.</p>

            . I am the watch-house-keeper of St. George's. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house about half-past twelve o'clock, Williams followed immediately after; he had been drinking, but knew what he was about; the prisoner said he was coming from the West India Docks, at Blackwall.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WILLIAMS, re-examined. The hat is mine. I met the watchman two minutes after the man ran from me-the prisoner was taken in less than a quarter of an hour.</p>

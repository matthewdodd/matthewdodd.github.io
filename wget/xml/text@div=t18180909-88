My trunk was in the three-pair front room; about half-past six o'clock in the evening, on the 27th of August, I heard a talking in the passage, I ran up, and found the prisoner in custody of my master. He was a stranger. My trunk, which contained the articles stated in the indictment, was just by him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHEPHERD. I am a constable. I was sent for, and found the prisoner in Mr. Fountain's custody-the box stood between them - He charged the prisoner with bringing it down from the garnet, the prisoner said he was told to fetch it; he said he went up, found the garret door open, and took the box.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A person said he lodged at the Marquis of Granby, and asked me to go and fetch a box. I saw a woman on the stairs, and told her what I came for, she said I should find it in the room. I was stopped in the passage.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHEPHERD re-examined. The prisoner at first said he was sent to the Dog and Duck; afterwards he said it was the Black Horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-factor, in partnership with my son, at 5, Muscovy Court, City—on 25th July I went there at 10 o'clock, and went in and out in the course of the day, and fastened the door with the latch, having a latch-key—no person can get in without a key—when I came in at 3.30 I missed a chronometer which had been fastened against the wall, also my coat, which was hanging up, and two sets of letter scales—I have no doubt that they were there in the former part of the day—I made a complaint at the station, and some days afterwards saw these scales produced at Seething Lane Station—one of the half-ounce weights was</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I have three rooms; they are on the first floor—then is only one door—my two sons and I also use the office—no lighterman uses it, no strangers used it—no violence was used, the door was opened by the key—I had left it between 12' and 2 o'clock—there are other office below—the housekeeper has charge of the house—I have not said since the committal that I should not like to pledge my oath to a set of scales—another set of scales were shown me at the police-office, but they were not mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at Mr. Stevenson's office, and hale cleaned it for 18 months—I know the articles in it pretty well—I have seen these scales there—on the Saturday afternoon when I was cleaning the office, I found a small weight like this on the desk, and put it on one of the shelves—I also missed another pair of scales with flat weights, a brass clock, and a meerschaum pipe—I am quite positive about these scales.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The key is left in No. 3 letter-box, and when Mr. Stevenson's son comes to the office first he calls for it—it would be in hit possession during the day—there are two keys tied together; one is the latch-key and the other the house-key—Mr. Key, a lighterman, has beta in the habit of going into the office—he would take the key out of the letter-box or ask me for it—I swore before the Magistrate that Mr. Stevenson's son came to me for the key on the morning of the 25th about the usual time, but that was a mistake, it was left in the letter-box—I know now that Mr. Stevenson's son was not there on the 25th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee dealer, of 4, Water Lane—the prisoner is also a coffee dealer—I have known him a number of years—I went to his shop with Mr. Heath the last Saturday or the last but one in July—he has a small place on the basement, one room divided off—we had some conversation outside on the pavement, and the prisoner said "Come, before you go let us do some business together; will you buy a clock or a coat or scales t"—Heath said "No, they are not in my line"—he then said to me "Howard, will you buy the scales?"—I said "No, I have no use for them"—he said "I will sell them to you cheap"—I said "They are positively useless to me"—he said that it was useless showing me the coat, because it would be three or four inches too short for me in the sleeves—these are not the scales he showed me; it was a much better set—I did not notice that a weight was missing, but he said "There is a weight short which would cost about ls. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and he took the scales to an optician and came back—he also offered me a clock, but I did not see it—I said "What extraordinary articles for you to offer me for sale? Are you going to open a secondhand furniture shop?"—Hall said "Or a chandler's shop; it seems something like it," and we left together.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 124). About half past 1 o'clock, on 17th Jan., I was going round my beat in Jubilee-court, Greenwich—I missed the pump that stood in the centre of the court—it was all gone but the boards—I found it up Slaughter's-rents—put it underneath the side of a house, close to the wall on the ground—I watched it till about 6 o'clock—I was about ten yards off—I observed the two prisoners come up to the pump, look at it, and go out into East-street again—they then went back again and took it up and put it on Brewin's shoulder, Tilling assisted him to put it up—I then came out of the court, called my brother constable, Stanton, and pursued them, I saw my brother constable take Brewin, and he threw the pump into the Thames—I took Brewin to the station, and went back to the place where the pump had been, and there saw Tilling, and said I should take him for being concerned in stealing the pump—he said he had just got up—I said I knew better, and I should take him—I am sure it was the same man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Brewin. Q.</hi> Did you see me do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I saw you heave it into the water—I did not say I was 200 yards off when you threw it into the water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Brewin.</hi> I did not throw it off, he knocked it off my shoulder.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Tilling. Q.</hi> How far off were you when you first saw me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five yards off the pump—when I saw you lift it on your shoulder I was about ten yards off—I am sure it was you, because I knew you, yon wore light trowsers, and a coat and cap—I have known yon for some time—I cannot say which way you turned, my brother constable saw you—it was about a quarter past 7 o'clock in the morning when you were locked up—I had 200 or 300 yards to go from the station to the river—I did not say before the Magistrate that it was a quarter to 7 o'clock, I said a quarter past 7 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 106). On this night, the last witness showed me the pump—about half past 6 o'clock I saw the two prisoners come from Lambert-street—they went right up to the place where the pump was, quite straight—it is only a thoroughfare to some houses that lie back, you cannot go through, it further than the houses—they stood there about a minute, and then went out down East-street—Brooker followed them in the same direction, and I followed them a nearer way, and gave them the meeting—when I was going to take Brewin he had the pump on his shoulder and threw it into the water—afterwards I saw Tilling—I knew him—when I was going after Brewin I saw Tilling some distance a Iad of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Tilling. Q.</hi> When you apprehended Brewin I was 200 or 300 yards from you; why did you not apprehend me when you could have touched me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because at that time you had not taken the pump, I thought it would be better to let you go for a little time—you were not twenty yards off when we started after you—when I saw you come down the court I could swear to you by your person—I knew you well—by your person I mean your dress and your features.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Tilling's Defence.</hi> About a quarter before 7 o'clock I got out of bed and dressed myself, and went down as far as Billingsgate, where there is much work; when I got to College-walk, I saw the two police constables looking over into the Thames, and I looked over, and the policeman said, "I want you, for being concerned in stealing the pump;" I said I had not seen <hi rend="italic">no</hi> pump, for I had only just come out of bed.</p>

The prisoner has been in his service for four or five months; there was another servant in the business, and a boy. This money was in the till. My master used to go into the country, and the other servant and I had the care of the till. On the 30th of July, about seven o'clock in the morning, I got up - the prisoner was always up before me. I asked my fellow-servant for the key of the shop, but he came down. I opened the door with the key, and then I opened the street-door, and in consequence of what he said, I slept in the shop the next night, and concealed myself behind some curtains all night; and in the morning, before the shop was opened, I saw the prisoner come with a strange key, and unlock the shop door - she then ran to the till, opened it, and put her hand in; I heard silver rattle. I had counted the money in the till overnight; it was 21 s. in shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns. She went away, into an adjoining room, and locked the shop door after her. I then saw her put the money in a piece of paper or rag; she then went away. I jumped down from where I was, unlocked the inner shop door, and opened the shop, and directly the other man came down, I told him, but never told her of it myself. He went off to my master's uncle, who lives at Vauxhall. She was taken up as soon as the young man returned from Vauxhall; and charged with this, in my presence, about half-past eleven o'clock, that night. I never mentioned what I knew, until I was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not stop her when you saw her commit this offence - A. I did not; I was always on good terms with her. I counted the money the moment my fellow shopman came down - there was only 15 s. 6 d. left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite sure it was not a man who took the money - A. Yes, positive. My fellow-shopman ordered me not to detain her. I did not go up and tell my master of it, because I was ordered not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever tell your master that you suspected the till was robbed - A. My master was often missing money. The shopman ordered me not to tell my master. He set off to tell my master's uncle, as we thought the uncle knew better how to act - we marked the money with a cross.</p>

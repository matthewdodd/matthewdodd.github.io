On Sunday morning, Lee showed me a sovereign; I went out with her, and saw her change the sovereign in a public house—we went to the King Alfred, and they accepted the change from Lee to take care of—I saw the prisoner with a man at the King Alfred, and heard the prisoner say to him, "You be here by 8 o'clock in the morning; she will come and get the money, and she always carries it in her hand; when she gets out, you hit her hand, and it will fly, and we shall get it, and let her have one shilling, no more."</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. James Farquhar of Charlton. On his premises there is a tool-house, where apples and things of that sort are kept—it is within the fence that encloses the ground—you can go to it from the house without going outside the fence—on Saturday the 26th of November, I fastened it myself, about five o'clock in the evening—the apples, walnuts, and baskets were all safe—I went the following morning about ten o'clock, and found some persons had entered by taking a pane of glass out of the casement, that would enable them to force back the lock of the door—it appeared that that had been done—I missed from seven to nine bushels of apples, two sacks, some seed peas, some walnuts, and a gathering basket—these apples are the same kind that were lost—I know this sack by the particular way in which the mouth is torn—I had used it a day or two before—there is the other sack—I know it by being a very large one—I am certain it is the same—the apples correspond with what they left—I have got a sample of them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 141.) I went to the prosecutor's pre<lb></lb>mises, and I saw the way the tool-house had been entered—I observed foot marks, and covered them over—they proceeded towards the place that had been entered, and towards a wood—they were plainly visible, and I covered them over—I afterwards went to the wood in company with the gardener, and found these two sacks of apples—they ware concealed in the wood, and covered over with the branches—there was a gathering-basket close to the sacks—I remained there from half-past five o'clock till about a quarter-past ten o'clock at night, when the prisoner and another man came—it was a very moonlight night—I had an opportunity of seeing the men—I am certain the prisoner is one—I and the other offered laid down, and the two men took each a sack on their backs—we got up, they ran away, and threw down their sacks of apples—we heard them fall—they made their escape—I took the basket, and left the other officer in charge of the apples—I went along the Woolwich-road towards the turnpike, and coming back I met the other man who had been with the priso<lb></lb>ner, coming out of a cottage where the prisoner lived—in consequence of what he said I went towards the White Horse, Charlton—I followed him, and just as we got between there and Lord Howick's I saw the prisoner and the other man coming along the foot-path together—that man went to meet the prisoner, and they returned together—five or six yards before they came to me the prisoner, left him, and went to the other side of the road—I bid them good night, and walked on—I then returned to the turn<lb></lb>pike-gate and met a young man who went with me into the wood—we were going to where I had left Smith—I heard two men talking in the garden of a cottage adjoining the wood—Smith held up his cutlass, and said, "Be quite"—the tall man that made his escape, came up a ladder, and put a dog</p>

               <p>into the wood—and followed him—Smith laid hold of him, and took him at that time—I saw the prisoner at the foot of the ladder, and pursued him down the walk of the garden—he ran—I came back and put the hand<lb></lb>cuffs on the other man—the prisoner left his hat, which I took up—he afterwards owned it—I after that went into the cottage, and saw the prisoner—I told him I should take him—he seemed rather con<lb></lb>fused, and said, "What apples?"—I said it was no use making any resistance, they should both go together—I looked about, and under the bed I picked up these shoes, they were wet and muddy—I asked whose they were?—he said they were his—he then said, "Stop, let me see"—he said, "No, I do not think they are"—I threw them under the bed among four or five old pairs—, "Now, said I look out your shoes," and he looked out the same pair again—when I went down to the cottage Smith brought the other man down the foot-path—I found the cottage fastened—the other man said "It is no use, open the door, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—we then went in—the next morning I went to the wood again, and found these other two sacks of apples—the sacks I found first were not Mr. Farquhar's, but those I found on the Monday morning are his—I found them close by the gap that leads from the garden to the wood, with some sheeps' feet and part of a skin and head—the walnuts were in the sack where the apples were—I afterwards compared these shoes with the marks I had previously covered over—they went into the footmarks as completely as possible—they could not fit better—I am certain they were made by them—the gardener also tried them—I conveyed the prisoner to Newgate last Tuesday—he said it was a bad <hi rend="italic">job</hi>, but they could not give him more than fourteen years.</p>

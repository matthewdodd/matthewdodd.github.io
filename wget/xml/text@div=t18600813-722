                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, carrying on business at Old Charlton in Kent—I have known the prisoner some two or three years—he has been in the habit of travelling round the neighbourhood—I have bought bonnet shapes from him—he came into my shop on 12th July, about 8 o'clock at night—he offered me some bonnet shapes for sale; I did not buy them, but gave him an order to supply me with other goods; at that time a boy named Brown was in the shop; nobody else—the prisoner re<lb></lb>mained in the shop some few minutes after I gave him the order—Brown came in for some ribbons; I stooped down behind the counter to get at them—I had some other conversation with the prisoner about the bonnet shapes, and a few minutes afterwards he left—he bad a bag with something in it—I could not ascertain what it was at the time—he had a few bonnet shapes with him; I think he had them out on the counter—he took them away in the bag; his bag was large enough to hold a feather bed—after he had left the shop about ten minutes I missed a piece of calico—it had been in the fitting of the shelf; I had placed it there about ten minutes before he came into the shop—I am sure nobody was in the shop at the time except the prisoner and Brown—I saw Brown two or three days afterwards and asked him some questions—on 3d July the prisoner came with the shapes I had ordered—in consequence of something that Brown had told me, I said to the prisoner, "The last time you were here I lost a bit of calico, and you took it; now if you took that from distress and were in want, or your family wanted a loaf of bread, I will forgive you"—he said, "No, I did not take it"—I said, "Confess the truth; I have a boy who saw you take it"—he said, "I did not take it"—I said, "I shall give you in charge and we will see whether you did or not"—when the policeman came he said, "Well, sooner than be locked up, I will say I took it"—I then gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was there not something of much greater value next to this calico? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was—the reason I did not see Brown before the Saturday was because he was a visitor from London—I knew where he came from, but I did not know where he was residing—he was not at the national schools—I said before the Magistrate that, as far as I could judge, there was from thirty to thirty-five yards of calico—I told you if you would apologize I would say no more about it—I wrote to the witness Brown to come up at your examination, but he did not get the letter in time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old—my father is a cutler in the Strand—I live with him, but occasionally go to visit my aunt at Charl<lb></lb>ton—I was down there on 12th July—I went to Mr. Aldritt's'shop to get some ribbon for my aunt, about eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the shop talking to Mr. Aldritt—I saw Mr. Aldritt stoop down to get the ribbon, and the prisoner took a piece of calico off the shelf behind Mr. Aldritt and put it in a bag which he had with him—he talked to Mr. Aldritt after that about a minute or two, and then went out of the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 353). I was sent for to Mr. Aldritt's house, and found the prisoner there—the prosecutor told me that he suspected him of stealing a piece of calico on 12th July—the prisoner said Mr. Aldritt wanted him to apologize, and he said he would rather say he had taken the calico than be locked up—he refused his address, and I found out that he had been called by the name of Bentley.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> What I took and placed in my bag was my own pro<lb></lb>perty. It consisted of shapes and a parcel. The witness is mistaken as to what I put in the bag. I talked to the prosecutor ten minutes after I put the things in my bag. I then went to a public house just opposite to have some refreshment; I afterwards went to another, and then to the railway-station, and had to wait a quarter of an hour for the train, therefore the prosecutor had ample opportunity to find me if he had chosen. There were two females in the shop while I was there; the prosecutor says there was not.</p>

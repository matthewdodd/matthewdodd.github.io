                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police, stationed at Woolwich. On 26th July, I received a warrant to search a house, No. 21, Wellington-street, Woolwich—I went there with two officers; Child was with me—I went to the front room which is fitted up as an office—I saw Saunders there—I found ten or twelve account books there which I here produce; eight of them were on shelves; this one was on a table—this one was to pieces; the greater part of the leaves were in the covers, some had slipped out; I have now tied them up—I examined the back of the books to see if any labels had been taken off—there is no doubt but a label has been taken off here; the top of this cover has been taken off about two inches—on three of these leaves there is the broad arrow—they were in the same state they are now, but I have arranged them since—this part was the back of the book—these two parts fit as if they had been one before they were divided—I have no doubt about it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness put both the parts in the covers and showed them to the Jury</hi>)—I do not believe here is the whole book, I think some leaves are gone—I found this label had been pasted on this order book; I took it off—I find here is on it "Day book, 1853," and under it a piece has been cut out of the leather—these two appear to have been one book, similar to this one, and cat down the middle—it is lettered similar to this, with the alphabet—these three books appear to have had the labels removed; here is the mark where the labels have been—this large book has had a label taken off; here is the place where it has been—I took possession of these books and have had them ever since—Saunders was taken into custody—I told him I should take him into custody for having them in his possession—on the following morning I saw Akers in custody—Saunders was present at the time I said to Akers, "When I took Saunders he said the books belonged to you"—Akers replied, "That is quite right, I bought them."</p>

I went there just before Christmas—I occupy the lower part of the house—I rent the house, and let the upper part—I occupy two rooms down stairs, and the upper room—I am a house agent, and collector of rents and debts—one of those rooms is fitted up as an office—I have known Akers about nine months; he keeps a canteen, at the Royal Marine Barracks—I have not known Arman very long—Akers has occupied a part of my house for the last four or five months; he has a wife and two children—I remember Arman coming to my house one Sunday morning; I think it was on 26th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock—when be came,. I was in the front office with Akers—Arman brought some books in a brown cover, not a very large parcel—he offered them to Akers—he opened the parcel in the office, and said, "Here are some books; I have them for sale, if you like to purchase them"—Akers looked at them, and opened them—Arman said they were his own property, and Akers need not be afraid to purchase them—Akers said he had but very little money without going up to his shop of business—I cannot say how many books there were; there might be three, or four, or five—they were very similar to those that are here—Akers then called to his wife, "Here is Sergeant Arman come to see you," and Arman went up stairs with Akers—I saw Arman when he came down; he bid me good day—I examined the books; they were just like these—there were no loose leaves—Mr. Akers brought some like these other books in my office—I do not know on what date—he brought one down at a time—I gave the books that Akers brought to the police—they were just like these—Akers allowed me to have them to put on a shelf to make a show—he said if I liked to have the use of them, I might; he said they looked very well, and I might keep them there till he required them—there were some labels on them when the police had them—I did not notice the state of the labels myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in the Storekeeper General's Office. It is the practice of the Storekeeper General to send stores to the different departments of the docks and barracks—(here are account books kept there, and they would be sent out on demand—the Adjutant's office is where the books would be sent—I have looked over the books taken by the officers, which are now before me—they are similar to those in store—when they are in store they are labelled for the purposes for which they are intended—there is no broad arrow on these plainer books, which are for writing in—the books are bound by contract for the Stationary office—the label is on the outside of the book, on the top—there is the appearance of the label on these books—this one has the mark of the label very plain—these are all quite new—I know of a number of books of this description being sent to the barracks at Woolwich—the last demand was sent to Woolwich on 4th July—these large books are letter books—this one is supplied as a general index—I keep these books in store—the label is still on this one—this is a book that we issue for orders—this had a broad arrow, in gold, on the first cover—these two sets of leaves appear to have been a book; the leaves are cut in two—these have the broad arrow on them—this is a printed book—the printed books have the broad arrow on them, but not the plain ones—this would be an embarcation book; I have compared it with the embarcation books, and it corresponds in every particular as to the ruling—these small ones are similar to what we supply for divisional order books—as far as I can judge these are Her Majesty's stores; I have no doubt of it—I cannot tell whether any of these were furnished on the last supply—they are made by contract—the value of the whole is about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

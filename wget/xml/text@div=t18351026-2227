                  </hi>. I lives in the house of Matthew Drake, in Wellington-street, King's-road, Chelsea; he is a master milkman—I am a painter—the prisoner lodged in the same room with me for five months—he went to bed on Saturday night at about eleven o'clock, and I saw him again on Sun<lb></lb>day morning at four o'clock—he was missing from the place, at about five o'clock, and then my clothes were gone—they were all safe at four o'clock—I missed a coat, two waistcoats, a pair of trowsers, fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver, two silk handkerchiefs, and a glazier's diamond—the prisoner never returned to his lodging—he had given no notice to leave—he left his working clothes behind him, but took his best clothes with him.</p>

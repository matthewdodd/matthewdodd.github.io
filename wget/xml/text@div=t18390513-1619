                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Great Carlisle-street, Port man-market.

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old. Mr. Priddle gave me a pair of boots and a paper to take to a customer about two or three o'clock—I went with his little boy, and near the Nightingale public-house I saw the prisoner, who I knew before, with a man named Barnes—I asked the prisoner the way to where I was going with the boots—he went into North Bank with Barnes—he then came running after me, overtook me by the Roman Catholic Chapel, put his arm on my shoulder and said he was a waiter at the lady's house where I was to take the shoes, and that he went to take orders for tea and sugar—he got me up by the Abbey-field, pushed me down, put his hand up the baby's cloak, and took the boots away—I went into the field because he said he was going into the house and that was the way—I tried to keep the boots from him—as soon as he got them he said he was going to see the steamer, and ran away—I saw a policeman afterwards and told him—I ran after him as far as I could—I am certain it was the prisoner—he had a white hat, a brown coat, and blue browsers, and whis<lb></lb>kers—but when I saw him before the magistrate he had no whiskers.</p>

I did not see him take any thing, but while my people were at breakfast, he went down to my salting-house, and took this leg of pork, which he put into his pail, and filled it with wash; as soon as he left the house, my waiter ran down to see if we had lost any thing. I then followed the prisoner, and when he got to Whitechapel, he put down the pails to rest - I asked him what he had got beside the wash - he said, nothing - I put my hand in and took out the leg of pork.</p>

            . I am waiter to Mr. Weston. We had missed several articles, and among the rest, two half rounds of beef. On the 12th of February, I marked eight legs of pork, and put them together - when the prisoner came, I went up stairs till he was gone - I then ran down, and missed a leg of pork - I told my master, who pursued him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Mr. William Cooper. On the 30th of March, 1836, I taw the prisoner at Winborn, in Dorsetshire—I was travelling there for Mr. Cooper—the prisoner resided there, and applied to me to supply him with some goods—I told him I could not take his order without a guarantee, and he offered me Mr. Topp, his brother-in-law, as security—I made inquiry, and found he was a very respectable man, and lived in the neighbourhood—on these terms, and on no other, I supplied the prisoner with goods—these goods were to be paid for in four months—I know they were supplied—I received no guarantee from the prisoner—it was to be sent before the goods were sent off, but it was not—on the 30th of July I applied to him to pay me, either in cash or in Mr. Topp's accep<lb></lb>tance at one month—he went, as he told me, to Mr. Topp's, and brought me an acceptance of Mr. Topp's, but I discovered it was only on a receipt stamp—I told him that was of no use, he must go and get it upon a regular bill stamp—I gave him the price of the stamp, and as I was getting into my gig he brought me a bill, and told me that was Mr. Topp's acceptance on a regular stamp—I believe this is it—I have no doubt it is the same—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)-"Payable at Glynn and Co. Accepted. Geo. Topp."—on my arrival at Poole I found it was not indorsed—I inclosed it in a letter directed to Mr. Topp, and requested him to get the prisoner to indorse it, and to forward it to Mr. Cooper.</p>

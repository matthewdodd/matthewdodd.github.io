                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 133.) On 23rd Dec., about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was in Aldermanbury—I saw the prisoner with a writing-desk under his arm—I followed him to Jewin-street, and asked what he was going to do with it—he said he had been to offer it for sale to a young man who was a porter to a wine-merchant, near Cheapside—I asked if it were his own—he said it belonged to his father<lb></lb>in-law, who had won it at a raffle some months before—I went to his father-in-law, Mr. Stapleton, where he directed me, and he knew nothing about it.</p>

I live at the Blossoms' Inn, Lawrence-lane—this desk is mine; I know it by some scratches on the top that I did accidentally myself, and the lock of it was out of order—I saw the prisoner at my bar on the Wednesday or Thursday—I could not swear whether I served him, or the servant—I saw this desk safe on the Thursday, and missed it on the Friday—I believe the prisoner has been in great distress—I never knew anything against him before.</p>

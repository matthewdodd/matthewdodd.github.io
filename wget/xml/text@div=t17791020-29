I deal in sugar, tea, coffee, and such things. On the 17th of this month I was at Chelsea, in company with the interpreter's father; we spent the evening, and returned a little after nine; coming by the Temple I lost my company; I met the prisoner in Fleet-street, and asked her the way to Tower-hill; I took her into a coach, and thought she would take me to Tower-hill; I fell asleep directly as I got into the coach; I waked and found myself not going the right way; I missed my watch; immediately as I enquired after it she ordered the coachman to drive to Hatton-garden; I charged the prisoner with having it, none being in the coach but she and me, and I knew I had it when I went into the coach.</p>
               <p>As you took a coach to carry you to the Tower, how came you to take a strange woman into the coach with you? - I enquired of many folks the nearest way to the Tower; nobody could inform me; she came to me; she spoke broken German; she told me she would show me my safe way home; when I missed the watch I went to stop the coachman as well as I could, and got out to see if I could find somebody to understand me, and as I got out at one door, the prisoner got out at the other.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch again? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any criminal conversation with the woman? - Not in the least. She was afterwards stopped by a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think it is not proper that that woman should talk to him in that language as she is an intimate acquaintance.</p>
               <p>To the interpreter. Have you, upon your oath, fairly interpreted every thing he has said? - I have.</p>
               <p>To the interpreter. How long have you known him? - A fortnight; no longer that he has lodged in my father's house.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker. Last Monday between the hours of eleven and twelve o'clock the prisoner brought a watch to me to pledge; she had been at our shop before, and I knew her face very well. I stopped her and the watch, and sent for one of Sir

            's men; she said the watch belonged to her brother, who was just come a prisoner from France.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the watch? - About seven pounds. I thought it a watch too valuable for her to come honestly by.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Was you sober or in liquor that night? - Not quite sober.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the woman who went with you in the coach? - It was dark; I cannot positively say she was the woman; there was but one woman.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with this woman before you went into the coach? - No; I only enquired of her the nighest way, thinking she might understand me; she took me by the arm, and led me to a coach. I spoke to her in German; she spoke to the coachman, but I did not understand what she said.</p>
               <p>How did you lose your company? - There was such a multitude of people coming through Temple-bar I missed them, I cannot tell how, and could not find them again.</p>

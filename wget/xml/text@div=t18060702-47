               <p>- GREGORY sworn. I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion to pass Mr. Walker's manufactory. - A. Yes, about five o'clock in the afternoon on the 2d of June, I saw the prisoner coming from Mr. Walker's manufactory, his pockets appeared bulky, and his coat seemed to hang heavy, I walked softly after him and hit his pocket with the back of my hands, I found it was something very heavy, I says where are you going my friend, he said he was going to the founder's he worked for Mr. Walker, he was not a yard or two from it; I laid hold of his pockets (he trembled very much), I told him he must go with me to the watchhouse; I took him there and sent for Mr. Walker, I searched him, and Mr. Walker claimed the property; he told me where he lodged, I searched his lodgings and found this basket of iron. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">PHILIP HARRIS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman F</hi> 169). On the afternoon of 16th March, from information I received, I went to Mr. Hughes, a wire worker, at 39, Drury Lane—I found four bundles of wire concealed behind an earthen-ware pan, and I concealed myself in the cellar—about 12.55 Skinner came to the place and took some of the wire away—he came three times, and took some away each time—I was about five yards from the place, behind the door of the coal cellar—at 1 o'clock the whistle blew for the men to leave the works to go to dinner—I left the cellar and went out of the front entrance, into Drury Lane—I then went to Wilson Street, to the workman's entrance, and saw Skinner leave—I followed him to 18, Paradise Street, Lambeth Walk—he went into a marine store dealer's shop, kept by Hubbard—I saw him take three bundles of wire from his coat, and put them into the scale—he took one bundle from his right-hand tail pocket—Hubbard put the weights in the scale, weighed it, and gave Skinner some coppers and a piece of silver, which I believed to be a shilling—he came out of the shop—I stopped him and asked what he had taken there—he said, "Nothing, only a bit of lead"—I said, "What money have you got?"—he</p>

               <p>said, "I don't know, you had better see"—I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from his hand—I then took him back to the shop, and said to Hubbard "What have you bought of this man?"—he said, "Nothing, only a piece of lead," and lifted this piece of lead off the counter—I said, "I want that copper wire that you bought of him"—he said, "I have bought none"—I said, You have, and you had better give it to me, for I am a police officer, and I shall search your place—I was in plain clothes—he said, "You will not search my place without a search warrant"—I said I should—I asked him again to give me the wire, and he said he had not got it—I then gave him into the custody of two uniform men I had called in—I searched the place and found, under the back of the counter, these four bundles of wire (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) amongst a lot of old rubbish—I said, "How do you account for these?"—he said "My wife bought them"—I asked his wife if she bought the wire, and she said she knew nothing about it—I found these two pieces of wire in a drawer in the counter—I then told Skinner I should take him for stealing the wire from his master, and I told Hubbard I should take him for receiving it, knowing it to be stolen—I asked him if he made any entries of what metal he bought—he said, "No, not such trifles as these"—his wife handed me a book, but I found no entries of copper wire—I asked him what name and address Skinner gave him—he said he did not take any name or address, he did not trouble about it—I then took them to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">WILLIAM HUGHES</hi>. I am a wire worker, at 37, Drury Lane—Skinner was in my employment as a labourer, to clean the wire—he had free across to my workshops—I have missed wire for some time, and I gave information to the police—this wire is my property—there is about 4lbs. of it—it is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—the two other pieces of wire found at Hubbard's shop I identify as my property—I saw it in this folded state before I com<lb></lb>municated with the police—I saw part of this wire safe at 10 o'clock on the 10th, the same day that Skinner was arrested—he worked in a small cellar, where the material was kept—the value of this bit of lead is about 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I manufacture my own wire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JOHN DICKINSON</hi>. I am a workman in the prosecutor's employment—on 16th March I went into the cellar where Skinner worked—I missed a tool that I was using in my business, and I discovered two bundles of wire concealed behind a vitriol pan—I went and told Mr. Hughes—I went down an hour afterwards and found there were three pieces—I was with the constable part of the time, and saw Skinner go away—I went to the place and found the wire was gone.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hubbard's Defence.</hi> I did not buy the quantity stated by the constable. I bought three pieces, and they weighed 2 1/2 lbs., and I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it. I should have only got 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by it.

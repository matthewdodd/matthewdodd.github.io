On the 3rd of September, I had a large dinner at my house, and in the evening, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came in, and went up to the club-room, where the persons had dined; I was in the bar - I sent him up three glasses of brandy and water, one after the other; I took up the last myself, and told him there were three to pay for - he pulled out sixpence, and threw down; I told him that would not pay for three, that they were 1s. each - he seemed to take no notice of what I said; I told him to put the sixpence into his pocket, and we would settle it when he came down - when he came down I was in the parlour; my wife called me, and said he was going away without paying - I went out and said," Sir, you have not paid for these three glasses of brandy and water; pay for them before you go" - he made no answer; I repeated it - he paid no attention to me, but gave Parnell a glass of gin, and had one himself; he paid for both, and directly took a penknife out of his pocket, opened it, and put it into his pocket again - my wife told Parnell of it, and he said,"Mr. Dowell, you have put the knife into your pocket, open;" he took it out, shut it, and put it in again, then opened the door, and went out - I went after him, tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him to pay for the three glasses of brandy and water; he then turned round, struck me in the throat, and knocked me down, with his fist - I went up, touched him on the shoulder, and collared him, to prevent his going away; he struck me again, a scuffle ensued, and we both fell together - I got up first, and when he was sitting on the ground, he said, "How much do you want?" I said, "Three shillings for the brandy and water," he put his hand into his pocket, and I thought he was going to pay me - instead of which be ran at me directly he got up and struck me with the knife - I put up my arm and received the cut in it; I fell from the blow, but did not know he had stuck me; he ran across the road and hallooed Watch! it was about eleven o'clock at night; the watchman was going to take me, till he saw the blood all over me, and then took him to the watch-house; I was taken to my doctor's, who stopped the blood - I lost about three quarts, and was taken home for dead - my vein was nearly cut through; the knife was found on him with a blade broken; it was a two-bladed knife - I do not know whether that was the blade that cut me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had he any thing besides the three glasses of brandy and water? A. Not at my house; there was no dispute about the price of the brandy - he was about half drunk when this took place, and seemed the same when he came in; the scuffle was about thirty yards from my house - I went to the office next day, about four o'clock in the afternoon, not earlier; I there charged him with a common assault - the prisoner was not there; the Magistrate did not refuse me a warrant; the prisoner surrendered here yesterday - I went and preferred this bill because I could not find him any where -I heard he was in Paris; he is an ironmonger, living near me - I did not look for him at his shop, but the officer did; I never told Mitchell, or any body, that I would make this up for 200l.; I did not seize him - I touched him on the shoulder in a civil manner.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRADLEY. I am a watchman. I heard a call of Watch! and on turning round, saw White and the prisoner running across the road; I went to them - they were struggling together, each having hold of the other; I parted them - White instantly gave Dowell in charge, desiring me to take him to the watch-house - I walked with him a few steps, turned round to my right, and saw blood running from White's arm: he became very wet - some people said he was stabbed; I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw them having hold of each other? A. Yes; they did not fall in my presence - at what time he got the wound I cannot say; I took the prisoner to Worship-street the next morning - White did not appear: he had been sent for - the prisoner was detained about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Can you say in what state the prisoner was? A. He was not so drunk but what I consider he knew well what he was doing,</p>

            . I am apprenticed to Mr. Kay, a surgeon. I was called up between eleven and twelve o'clock to Mr. White, who came to our house - there was a wound in the upper part of his arm, and a great effusion of blood; it appeared such a wound as a penknife would give - it was not likely to occasion death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long did you attend him? A.Perhaps for a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I spent the evening at another house, and went to inquire for Mr. Birch at this house - they said they expected him there; I had a glass of brandy and water, which I paid the lad 8d. for - I had two more glasses, and handed the landlord 2s.; I said I had paid the lad 8d. for the first, and should pay no more - when I went down, he said there was a mistake in my reckoning; it was 1s. instead of 8d. - I said I would pay no more; I was eating a pear up stairs, and came down with the pen-knife in my hand, and went away; he followed, and collared me sixty yards from the house - he said I must come back; I refused - he knocked me down, and kicked me; we had three or four scuffles, and I suppose the knife must have cut his arm and broke the blade - I called the watchman, and gave him in charge; he found his arm bleeding, and gave me in charge - the Magistrate took my word to appear when wanted; White got a surgeon to make him out too bad to attend the office - the Magistrate told me to take a warrant out at Lambeth-street, and indict his house for being open late; but he went, and took out this warrant to prevent me.</p>

The prisoner was brought into the watch-house dead drunk with scarcely a bit of shirt left; it was rent to ribbons - his legs were bleeding, as if he had been very ill-used and kicked about; the charge was for quarrelling - the watchman was so drunk that I told him to wash himself before he went to Worship-street with me, or I should be ashamed to go with him - before I went to Worship-street that morning I went to white to see what was the matter with him; I found him about in his shirt-sleeves, and a handkerchief on his head - he said he was not able to attend the office; the doctor, in my hearing, told him he was able - I said there was a coach standing at the door, why not go; he said he thought he should faint - I told the Magistrate this, and he discharged the prisoner.</p>

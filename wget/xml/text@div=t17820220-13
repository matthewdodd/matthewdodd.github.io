               <p>I am an officer at the public office, on the 11th of January we went to Mrs. Harris's, about a quarter past eight in the evening, to search for a portmanteau that had been taken away, cut, she lives in Butler's-alley, Grub-street, there were four or five of us, there were two doors, two went to one door, and M'Manus and I went to the other door, on listening at the key-hole, I heard some men's voices, I knocked at the door, it was opened, Mrs. Harris was at the foot of the stairs, when I got in, I found M'Manus, who had just got in at the other door just before me, there was the prisoner May sitting down upon a chair, he appeared to be doing something to his breeche's knees, Knowles was standing with his back towards the fire, there was not a yard between Knowles and May, there was a table between them with one cutlass upon it; M'Manus said, Knowles, don't throw any thing away, he put his hand to his pocket, I went up to him, and pulled out these pick-lock keys, (producing a bunch of pick-lock keys.) there was a cane stood reared against the chimney-piece; I asked Mrs. Harris, in the presence of the prisoner, who that cane belonged to, Mrs. Harris said, she did not know, she never saw it before in her life, I asked Knowles and May what they did there, they said they came there to see Mrs. Harris, about a person on board the lighters, May had eighteen guineas and two half guineas found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You did not go upon Hart's information? - No; we were upon other business; Knowles said he was going to carry something down on board the lighters, I believe Mrs. Harris's husband is there; I went over the house to search it, but found nothing more; there were a pair of new boots below, Mrs. Harris said were her's.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any other persons at her house? - Only one Rocket, a brother of her's, who was ill in bed, and had been so some time, to my knowledge; Knowles said, damn my blood what is this, I just heard it, I did not take any particular notice of their appearance; finding the pick-lock keys upon them, we took them up as suspicious persons.</p>
               <p>There was nothing struck you in particular but the keys? - No; this was a little after eight we went there, we were there three quarters of an hour, when we went out, we soon heard the clock strike nine, I should think it was about three quarters after eight; nothing particular struck us of their appearance, only the keys, I think Knowles had the same great coat off, they were sent to prison.</p>

               <p>Court. It is not less than three miles from Mr. Lewis's?</p>
               <p>M'Manus. I believe it was near eight o'clock, Carpmeal and I stopped at the door, listened, could hear nothing, we sent two men to the other door; a girl opened the door, and seemed to try to prevent my coming in, I pushed into the house, I said Jack, don't throw any thing away, he said, I will not; Mr. Carpmeal came in, I found these two keys, and I found another key under the woman upon the chair, when I had made her get up; I found the keys by the sender, just behind where Knowles had been standing, I saw nothing taken out of his pocket, when I turned round, Carpmeal said, he had found some on Knowles; we found this cutlass upon a little table between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200040"></xptr> them, May was gartering his stockings, there was no other cutlass but that one found, I asked May, does this cutlass belong to you he said no, I asked Knowles, he said no, then says I, I will have it; this cane was behind a chair that nobody was sitting on, rather between Knowles and May set on the other side, they both denied the cane and cutlass, Carpmeal went up stairs, and Mrs. Harris, when Carpmeal came down I went and searched the cellars, we could find nothing I thought we had a right to take away; I searched May's pockets, and found eighteen guineas and two half guineas, and what we came out in quest of that night was money; seeing them all good new guineas, I returned them to him again, Knowles had eighteen pence, Mr. Prothero searched Mrs. Harris, there were a great many new guineas upon her, we took the men and left her.</p>
               <p>I believe the house was searched very carefully, we asked Mrs. Harris who these things belonged to, she said they were not her's.</p>
               <p>If you had only found the keys, you would have taken them? - I should, as suspicious persons; nothing in particular struck me of their appearance; she being a notorious receiver, I should have taken up any body I found there.</p>

               <p>Q. Suggested by May the prisoner, asked by his Counsel of Mr. M'Manus, whether he did not ask leave to go into the yard, and whether he did not return? - He did; both had it in their power to go off if they would.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they appear over-heated, or, very dirty about the legs? - No; I said to May have you been running, as I saw him gartering up his stockings, that was the only reason I had for asking him.</p>

I took the girl into the house again where she came from, and locked the door myself, there was nobody in the house, I know Mrs. Harris's house, it was not the house she lived in, I cannot tell whether it was her house; I sent for Grub to come to my assistance, and tied up a great many things that are in the indictment; these things were tied up in these two bundles which belong to this business, the girl had them in her hand, we searched the house through; we found at Best's lodgings these stockings of Mr. Blacketter;

               <p>Court. I think it would be better to admit her as a witness? - She was asked, and said she found them.</p>
               <p>Are you able to fix who owns the house? - Mrs. Harris's sister, I heard from Hart.</p>
               <p>To Carpmeal. Did they know whose house this was? - No.</p>
               <p>To Grub. Have you had an opportunity of knowing whose house this was, where the things were found? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Blacketter. Describe the cane as particular as you can? - It was a round head and a black mark at the bottom of the head, as if burnt near the string, I don't recollect how far from the head it is, not above an inch and a half down.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect the mark of the cane before it was found? - Yes; I don't know I told any body of it before it was found; I had it in my hand almost twenty years.</p>
               <p>Was the mark an inch, or inch and a half from the head, or close under it? - I think it was quite close, and the mark came down about an inch, I believe.</p>
               <p>Did it run along the cane, or down it? - I think it runs down along side of the head.</p>
               <p>Are there any other marks, from which you could discover it, was it chased or plain? - There is a little raised work on it, I don't know the term, I kept it for the sake of the person it belonged to; it was at my bed's head, I had a short cane string to it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200041"></xptr> when I left it at home, it was a longish ferril, about two or three inches long.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether it was strait or bent? - A little bent.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You left it at your bed's head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You described this before you saw it as a gold head? - No.</p>
               <p>(The Counsel read the commitment from the calendar.) I told the justice it was General Amherst's, and I never said it was gold; M'Manus asked if it was gold, I said I did not know; all the time I had it, I did not know whether it was gold or not, he bought it at Bath; I will not swear to an inch in the length of the ferril; there is no other mark that I know of.</p>
               <p>(The cane shewed him.) That is the cane, I can safely swear this was Gen. Amherst's before he died.</p>
               <p>Court to M'Manus. That is the same cane in the situation you found it? - It is; it never has been out of my possession till now since it was taken.</p>
               <p>(The bundles were directed to be opened.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Blacketter said they were his things.</p>

               <p>Blacketter. Here is General Amherst's name upon one cambrick handkerchief; I have no doubt this is the very same. He took one out of his pocket, and said it was the same, he bought it for him at a Mr. Blunt's; there was General Amherst's name on them; there is H. S. C. upon these, marked with red ink.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 11th of January, on Friday night, I, May, Knowles, Best, and Munday, went to the best of my knowledge, about seven o'clock; we went to a house in Green-street, Knowles went up to the door and knocked at it twice or three times, and found there was nobody at home, he took one of the pick-lock keys, and tried to unlock the door, he could not undo it with the first key, he saw the window shutters open to the parlour, he said he would get in that way, he put Best over the rails, he shoved the window up and got in, went round to the door and unlocked it, we all went into the house together to a back parlour, a bed room, and took away the property; they all came out of that room, all the property was in that room, we all went out of the street door, all five, we got to the bottom of the street; I gave Knowles the keys, and to May I gave the cane, which I took out of the bed room that is backwards, even floor, we went into no other rooms but the back parlour that night; at the bottom of the street, Man and Knowles said, we will go to Mrs. Harris's while you three go back again, there must be some more property up stairs; we three went back, I, Best, and Munday, Best got over the area, the same as he did before, we had shut the door after us, before it went with a spring, Best got into the window and he let us two in, we went up one pair of stairs, there was nothing but a salt and a silver spoon, we heard some people at the door which alarmed us, and we came down, we came to the door and found it fast, we went into the parlour and shoved the window up, and jumped out of the window over the area into the street, I was taken in Park-street soon after, I was pursued and taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What property had you found in the back parlour? - Shirts and linen; they were all put into a brown bag, Knowles took them on his back; we all came out together, and we got as far as the bottom of the street before we three agreed to go back again; we were up stairs at first, came down upon the alarm, found it fast, they could not come in upon us, we had bolted it with inside, we unbolted it and tryed to pull it open, and somebody held it fast on the outside.</p>
               <p>Had you any arms? - There was I believe two cutlasses, Best and Munday had a cutlass each, I had a stick, May had a cutlass; when I first went to the house, to the best of my knowledge it was about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long might you be there before you all came out the first time? - About ten minute</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200042"></xptr>Are you pretty exact about the time you went there? - I believe I am pretty near the mark when I say seven o'clock, I had a watch and had looked half an hour before. These things were to be carried to Butler's alley, in Grub-street, to Mrs. Harris's.</p>
               <p>Grub and M'Daniel were ordered out of Court.</p>
               <p>Court. The things were to be carried to Mrs. Harris's in Grub-street? - Yes; when I was at the office I gave that information, I told them it, Mrs. Harris's, an alley in Grub-street, they said they knew it, I said it faced the ruins, they said it was, they had been there before, I told them if the things were not at her house, there was a house within a door or two lower where the property was conveyed to that she buys, after she has bought it.</p>
               <p>Who lived in that house a door or two lower? - I cannot say who lived in it; I knew Mrs. Harris's house well before, it is first carried to the house where she lives, and then conveyed to the other where she lives.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination by Counsel. I am going to twenty five.</p>
               <p>At what age was it you began thieving? - I don't chuse to tell that.</p>
               <p>Court. He is not clear as to all felonies.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester said, he cannot be indicted for any previous felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller and Mr. Recorder were both of opinion, that he was liable to indictment for other felonies, or a man might give evidence of a petty felony, and by that means get off from others; his being admitted to be an evidence, in one case, could not amount to a general pardon.</p>
               <p>Hart deposed, upon a farther cross-examination, that he was discharged in November from the lighters, that he began robbing again in December; that he had the good fortune to escape with a watch in his pocket; he knew Mrs. Harris's very well, that he had been there about twice or thrice in a fortnight, and that she purchased things of him; the moment he was in custody he began to squeak; when taken he had a cutlass in his hand, that he held Best's cutlass while Best came out; only two of them out of the three had cutlasses; that it was not him but Best that was catch'd by the spikes; that he was not the person that was struck with the candlestick; that the cutlass was not drawn, that he hurt the man with the butt end of it that was going to take him; that he had a stick first, which he let drop; that when he got out of the window he stopped half a minute, and saw the other coming out, then he went away as fast as he could; Best did not clear the rails quite, he hung by his coat, and tore it away; that as soon as the people at the door saw him jump out of the window, they cried stop thief; that Best was near them, he supposed they did not like his cutlass, and so did not take him; but they came after him (Hart.)</p>

             called again. Said, the first she saw of it was at seven in the evening; then she saw the man get into Mrs. Lewis's window, and let the others in at the door; she went down stairs and gave the alarm, came up again directly, and looked out of her window, and saw two men come out with bundles; it was a very little time after they went in; Lee came in after she had given the alarm to her fellow servants, and he went over to the baker's; that she saw the two men come out with bundles before Lee went over; that when she first gave the alarm, there were only women in the house, who were afraid to open the door.</p>
               <p>Lee called again. Said he went over to the baker's immediately, upon his fellow-servant telling him what she had seen; it was about a minute before he and Mrs. Lewis's maid went to the door; the three men appeared upon the fill of the window with cutlasses; he struck at the last man that came out with a candlestick, and that baffled him so, that he did not clear the rails; the rest ran away directly; he never lost sight of Hart till he got round the chair, where the chairman took him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this Hart the man that you struck at, and the man that you took after? - Yes; I am sure of it, there are several people to prove it; at the time the chairman took Hart, the chairman's mouth bled, there was a kind of scuffle; when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200043"></xptr> jumped out, their cutlasses were all drawn, he believed there were three drawn, two he was sure of.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Upon the 11th day of January I had dined at home, at the corner of Stanhope-street, I have got an aged father and mother, that have lived in a very good way; through misfortunes in life they have failed, they are not capable of taking care of themselves so well as I could wish them, they brought me up in a very good way of life; I went over with intent, as I have done for these two years past, since they have failed, to pay their little rent for them, they lived at one Mr. Green's, who is gone, unluckily for me, into the country, or he could have proved it I stayed with my father and mother I suppose till it was near six o'clock, in Kent-street, in the Borough; I paid the rent, which was two pounds for the quarter, he is a man of very great age; I came through the Borough about six o'clock, and over London Bridge, I met one Clark, who is a Custom-house waiter, or something of that kind, he is not here, I have had every body here since Wednesday that I could; I went into a house, many people know the sign of it here, it is called the Tumble down Dick, a public-house just before you come to the foot of London Bridge, there I staid and drank part of six pennyworth of shrub and water with Clark, I came over London Bridge at very near seven, it was not quite seven; I went and called at Red-cross-street, a very little way from Moorfields, from thence I went and called at Cashmore's, that keeps a house in Long-lane, Smithfield; I thought the best way was to go across Bishopsgate Church-yard, and across Moor-fields; I met my fellow prisoner who stands by me, I met him as he was coming along the City-road, I said, Knowles, he turns round, and said to me, how do you do, says I, I am pretty well, I have not seen you some time says he, I told him I had not seen him; he asked me to go along with him to call at Mrs. Harris's, and said, he would then go home with me; I had not been in two minutes (he turns round to talk to her, I never saw her before) while we were there, there was a knock at the door, in come Carpmeal, M'Manus, and two more; they said, hallo, what do you do here, I said I had called in with Knowles, says M'Manus, I must search you; I said you may, I have nothing about me that I am afraid of, I have nothing but a little money, which is my own; they took it out of my pocket, and gave it to me again: all my witnesses have been here since Wednesday in waiting, but they are not here now, the Court have heard the four that were here the last time I was tried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burt came to speak in his behalf, and gave him a good character; said he had known him fifteen years, that he had worked for him as a <rs id="t17820220-13-deflabel74" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

               <p>KNOWLES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Upon the 11th of January I had been in the city road; coming across Moorfields, I passed by May; he called to me by name, as being near sighted I did not observe him, I asked him how he did, as we had not seen one another some time; he asked me where I was going, I told him to one Mrs. Harris's, that lived somewhere by Grub-street, I wanted to call upon her to know how her husband did, as I had known him many years, I asked him to go with me, he did, and coming down to Grub-street, we met two men coming out of Mrs. Harris's door, as we were coming up the court, I knowing it to be Mrs. Harris's door, stopt, we heard the bolt go; we knocked some time before we could get in; Mrs. Harris asked from the window who we were, I could not make her understand, the maid opened the door; when I came into the house this cutlass that is produced in court laid upon the round table; immediately the maid says my mistress is gone up stairs a minute, she will be down in a moment; you must understand, there are two doors in the house, as the gentleman said that took us, one door shuts into the front kitchen, and at the foot of the stairs there is a back door; that goes out; I heard some talk above; Mrs. Harris came down stairs to us; upon her coming down stairs, these gentlemen came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200044"></xptr> and knocked at the door, upon hearing them come in, a woman that sat in the chair ill, said, God bless you take hold of these things, and put them in your pocket, (the pick-lock keys) thoughtless of what they were, as they were done up in a rag, I held them by my side in the rag, not in my pocket, Mr. M'Manus found several about the sender, that were put there as they came into the house; they asked me what I did there, I told them I was coming to ask Mrs. Harris after her husband, they said I must go with them, I said would go with all my heart, we went to justice Wright's, we were examined a part, and Mr. Wright was going as we thought to discharge us, he thought proper to keep us, we were at the Watch-house, and trusted out and in, but knowing ourselves innocent, we never offered to get away; we could have made off but we would not; he called for two witnesses, Harris and Smart, who did not appear.</p>
               <p>Court. For the sake of detection of offenders, and bringing them to punishment, for the preservation of the public, by disclosing dangerous confederacies of men in iniquity, it is held, that an accomplice should be, in point of law, an admissible witness; but the legislature, and those that have administred the law, feeling that such a person, who, in the very act of giving his evidence, acknowledging himself to be guilty of a great offence against the laws, stood in circumstances of considerable discredit, have also, that the lives of men might not be at the mercy of informers of that character and description, always held, that unless the evidence of the accomplice is confirmed by other material circumstances affecting the parties who are accused, upon that single evidence, no man's life or personal security should be taken away; and upon the single evidence of an accomplice, unsupported by circumstances, courts of justice will never permit a prisoner to be convicted. So much has that principle prevailed, and so thoroughly is it established, that the general practice is not to examine an accomplice at all, till some other circumstances have been given in evidence affecting the person concerned, which can lay a foundation for the evidence of the accomplice, and enable the court to say, before the accomplice is examined, there are circumstances that tend to throw a suspicion upon the party accused, which may confirm or destroy the story then to be told by the accomplice; therefore, the law for the sake of punishment of the guilty, admits the evidence of accomplices, but with great caution, and it is for the consideration of the jury, when that evidence is admitted, how far it is confirmed by other circumstances, and upon the evidence itself given by the accomplice, whether he is deserving of any, and what degree of credit; for the evidence of one accomplice may be so circumstanced as to be more deserving of weight than another; and the degree of credit the jury will give to an accomplice when examined, must be left to them in the circumstances he stands, and upon all the circumstances of the case; so far may he said, that if juries are, because a man stands in the light of an accomplice, totally to disbelieve all he says upon that account, and give him no credit at all, and not suffer his evidence to be considered as any addition to the other circumstances, it defeats the principle of law intirely, which admits the accomplice to be examined, for it would be perfectly nugatory to examine a man, to whom in no case you ought to give any credit; the credit of an accomplice is like the credit of another person, but certainly liable to circumstances of discredit, from his being an accomplice.</p>
               <p>In this case there is another circumstance respecting this evidence of Hart, which is an additional circumstance of discredit; he has been convicted of another felony, for which he has suffered the punishment of the law, and is restored to his competency of being a witness, but still his character is affected by that circumstance also, and the degree of credit arising from that circumstance as well as the other, is a matter for the consideration of the jury. As to his evidence in this case, you will consider how it stands, not totally rejecting it, but receiving it with caution, and carefully examining<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200045"></xptr>how far it is confirmed by other circumstances; with respect to that, you should understand this also, that the circumstances that confirm the evidence of an accomplice, are not merely those that relate to the commission of the fact, because being an accomplice, necessarily supposes he was a person assisting in the commission of the fact, and therefore he must know the circumstances that attend the fact; of which he was one of the perpetrators; therefore I don't conceive that those circumstances, which merely attend the commission of the fact; without serving to point out the persons who were concerned in that fact, are to be considered as confirming the testimony of the accomplice, because the point in which his testimony is to be confirmed, is not that a robbery was committed, but that the parties charged, were the parties together with him, committing that robbery; therefore you will consider in this case, what circumstances there are affecting the prisoners, with suspicion of being concerned in this robbery, and those, circumstances are to be taken in confirmation of the positive testimony of the accomplice.</p>

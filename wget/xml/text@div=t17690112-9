On the Saturday sevennight before this affair happened, the prisoner and two other men came to me, and hired a post-chaise of me, to go to Brentwood-Fair; they came back again at night, and lay at my house. Skinner rode a horse to the fair, and came back again on him: he staid at my house till the Friday or Saturday following. I imagined this horse belonged to the Jew, to whom I thought Skinner was servant. There were a little man and a lusty man, two Jews, that went with Skinner to Burntwood-Fair. I heard the Jew was named Gompy Humphrys, and on the Saturday, the little Jew came and demanded the horse. I was not at home. My wife said, there is a post-chaise, and Skinner's victuals and drink to pay for. He paid for the post-chaise and horse, and took the horse away; he refused to pay for Skinner, and said he knew nothing of him. This is what my wife told me, when I came home.</p>

I had a black pony which was at work on Thursday night, and turned it out on the common, on the 26th of May, 1820, with more horses. I missed it the next day, and found it in Smithfield the same day, in Sweetman's possession - it is worth about 3 l., it cost me 6 l. twelve months before.</p>

            . I am a horse-slaughterer, and live in Grub-street. On the 26th of May, 1820, I delivered a pony to Jones, at the Bear and Ragged-staff, Smithfield. I received it that day from the prisoner, who gave his name as Ripley, of Charlton. He came to my shop and said he was recommended to me by Hulk and Williams,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050022"></xptr>to sell me a horse, he said it was neither big nor little, that it was alive, and was at Westminster. I went there with him. As we went along, several men who appeared to be soldiers, spoke to him. I asked if he had been in the army, he said he had been a serjeant in the Coldstream Guards, and had his discharge. He took me to the Angel public-house, in Tothill-street; he went out and the mare was brought to the door, he said "Here it is, come over the way, we do not wish every body to hear our business;" he asked 3 l. for it, I said that was too much by half; I gave him 30 s. or 36 s. for it - we went and dined at a cook's-shop, and as I brought it home, the officres surrounded me in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray are you licensed to carry on this business - A. Yes; now, but was not then - I did not give any information to the Magistrate, I did not know it was necessary, I attended at the office a month or five weeks ago, I gave no information before that, all the officers knew it; I gave no information till the 3 d of November last. I went to Tothill-street the day after I bought the mare, and found he had given me a wrong name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Magistrate that you made the bargain at the Angel, public-house, but you did not know the name of the street - A. I do not think I did, my examination was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, in the examination, that you did not know the name of the street - A. I recollect I did say that.</p>

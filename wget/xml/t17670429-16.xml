On the 13th of March I went to bed about ten o'clock. after all my people were in bed, and the house was all made fast, and early in the morning the shutter of the kitchen window was broke; I have lately made it into a shop; I was alarmed by the watch between one and two; the watchmen informed me they had taken one of the men with one of the pots, and put him into Marybone watch-house; I went there and found it to be Elliott; he had worked with me about three weeks, about six months before; I then suspected the other prisoner, by reason I had seen them together at times: I went and got a search-warrant, and found the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment which I had missed, in Benham's room, under his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. from Elliot. How did I behave when I worked for you?</p>
               <p>Bramble. I did not suspect him wronging me, but he was a drunken man, and would cause the others to neglect their business by drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. from Benham. How long did I work for you?</p>
               <p>Bramble. Benham worked for me about four months; I cannot lay any theft to his charge while with me.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are you sure to the pots?</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipwright, of Church-court, High-street, Wapping—on 19th March I was in the Black Bull, Gravel-lane, and saw the prisoner there drinking—I was having something by myself—there was a bar full of people—I did not speak to anybody—at nearly 11 o'clock I went out the back way—the prisoner attacked me there, and tried to take the money out of my waistcoat pocket—I do not know whether he came out after me, or went there first—I had changed a half-sovereign at the public bar—he was then drinking with me—he did not get the money—I went through the public-house, left the house, and went towards home—he attacked me again in King-street, and tried to take the money from my waistcoat pocket, but I collared him, and sang out, "Police"—he bit my hand, but I told him I would not leave go—this was not two yards from Gravel-lane—we scuffled and fell, and I became insensible—I do not know whether I received a blow or a kick, but I found women washing my face, and found a scar—my money was gone, and I found my left hand waistcoat pocket turned inside out—I know it was the prisoner, because I was in company with him when he attacked me in Queen-street, and I collared him by the throat, and said, "You rascal, what do you mean?"—I had had a drop to drink, but knew perfectly well what I was doing up to the time I was attacked—the prisoner was taken four days afterwards—I have not the least doubt of him.</p>

I am a butcher's assistant of 3, King-street, Shad-well—between 10 and 11 that night I saw the prisoner and Wolf on the ground scuffling together—Wolf called "Police," and I ran out from home and found them struggling on the ground, the prisoner uppermost—he struck the prosecutor about the face and body with his fists, and then got up and bit the prosecutor's hand—Wolf was holding him at that time—I did not see anything taken—I am sure the prisoner is the man; I saw him plainly—Wolf was sober.</p>

               <p>—on Monday night, about a quarter to 11, I was going home with my washing, and saw Lyons and Wolf on the ground struggling—Wolf called for the police, and the prisoner hit him over the face and eyes, and took the money out of his right hand waistcoat pocket—a third man, standing on the other side, said that if I called the police he would knock my eyes out, but I called out "Police!"—the third man was not helping at all; he was only looking after him—the prisoner then took Wolf by the hair of his head and dashed him up and down on the stones—I called out "Police!" and the other man said that if I called again he would knock my eyes out—I called "Police!" again, and the other man struck me—Mr. Wolf was not the worse for liquor—I have spoken to him before.</p>

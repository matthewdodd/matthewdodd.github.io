            , Esq; Clerk of the Arraigns, it has been exanined by the original record, and it is a true copy. (The record read) I put the prsoner and another to be tried for a highway robbery, in September Session, 1783, I do not remember the day, but in December, in the same year, I put him to the bar, he received a pardon upon condition of being transported for seven years, and in my hearing he accepted the pardon, I am sure he is the same man; on the 31st of August on the left hand of <placeName id="t17840915-54-crimeloc268">Shire-lane</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. There may be another Barker besides me, I had people to attend here but they are gone.</p>
               <p>After the Court summed up the evidence, the Foreman of the Jury said, My Lord, the Jury beg to withdraw.</p>
               <p>Court. After having stated the evidence short, it does not become me to press any thing further to you, it is for your discretion, but it is my duty to say to you, this is the usual course of evidence, in cases of this sort, at the same time it is totally in your breasts, to say you are satisfied or not; and you are not bound to give your verdict, because numberless other Juries have given their verdict upon evidence of the same kind; for my own part, I never feel any difficulty when in a capital case, where a man's life is concerned, and a Jury pauses so considerably as you do, in such a case I never hesitate to recommend it to them to acquit the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. There was nobody up besides you? - A. Not then; Mr. Eyston came down and went into the place, I followed, and he brought out a box; it was not locked; he looked into it, and there he saw some black silk, which he claimed to be his own; I was sent to call the prisoner down, which I did; when she came down Mr. Crooke and Mr. Eyston asked her to walk into the parlour, I did not go into the parlour; she said, she must go down stairs, and they desired I would go with her.</p>
               <p>Q.To the necessary? - A. She did not go there; she went down stairs; she untied her pockets and gave them to me in a passage below, and in giving me her pockets she put out of her pocket a thread-case, with a pawnbroker's duplicate: I picked it up, and gave it to Kennedy; she asked me to go into that room and take the things that were in a box that was there; I told her I could not touch any thing that was there, and she put her hands together and said, then I am ruined, I am ruined; she went up stairs afterwards, and I did not see her any more for some time; after that I went up into the parlour, and saw her begging Mr. Eyston for pardon; he said, he could not pardon her, the law must take place; and I did not hear any thing more till the officer was going to take her into the coach; I took her cloak, and she begged him not to be too hard with her; and he told her it was not him that could hurt her, it must be those gentlemen.</p>

               <p>Q. You have known it perhaps before, when the key has been left in the door? - A. She never left the key in the door unless she went just by.</p>
               <p>Q. If she happened to be by. she has left the key in the door before? - A. Yes; but not to go out of the kitchen.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was my cook and house-keeper; she lived with me about nine months; I placed a considerable confidence in her for a considerable time; but I had reason to suspect her of having taken several articles out of the shop; and I discovered upon her a key which opened my bookcase; that was on Saturday the 16th; when I sent for her down stairs to examine her keys, she at first refused to let me see her keys, and she told me that I should not see them unless I had proper authority; I therefore sent for an officer; but in the mean time she said, I need not send for an officer, that she would let me have her keys; I went up stairs to her bed-room with Mr. Crooke, and she opened her trunk before us, and we did not find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260012"></xptr>any thing in particular in the trunk, but a new cloak trimmed with lace; she was told, I believe, by Mr. Crooke, that was stolen: she said, it was not; Mr. Crooke, I believe, asked her where she had got it; and she said, that her husband bought it for her; I had great reason to suppose her husband did not buy it for her; I cannot swear to that cloak; I after that took her down stairs into the parlour; I told her to produce all her keys, and I found a key that opened my book-case; in my book-case I usually deposited the key of the shop on Sundays, and other keys; and during the conversation in the parlour, she was asked what she had taken.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you then, or any time after, tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. I am certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did your partner in your presence and hearing? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor that it would be the worse for her if she did not confess? - A.No; early on Saturday morning I went down stairs to see if Mary Baker had got the keys of her, which I had the day before desired her to do, if she could by any means; I went down, and in this room, of which she kept the key, I found the several articles that are specified in the indictment, the officer has them here; several Monday morning we had found that several bundles had been opened, and that led me to suspect her, and she was frequently alone in the house on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found these things, you took her into a room? - A. Yes; Mr. Crooke and myself were there, and her; and Mr. Crooke asked her what was the reason of her taking those things; and she said, it was to pay her lodgings, that she had been in some time before; she went down upon her knees and asked my pardon, and hoped that I should be merciful to her; she afterwards said, she was very unwell, and desired to go down stairs; and I desired the servant to follow her, and take her pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What is your partner's name? - A. John Crooke.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other persons interested in your business? - A. There are not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am getting on for fifteen years of age, and am in the employment of George and Samuel Goode, tobacconists, of Newgate Street—I have known the prisoner since May 27; he was standing outside my master's place—he spoke to me and asked if I would get him some tobacco and he would give me eighteenpence a pound for it—I said, "No"—he then told me that I had been robbing my master—I said I had not—he said he knew I had, and if I did not get him four pounds of tobacco he would come and tell my master—he walked with me to the back of the Post Office—I afterwards went back to my work, and when I came out to tea at five o'clock he was still standing outside—he told me that tobacco was easy to be got out, I could put it in my shirt and in my cap—I told him I could not do it—he said if I did not he should come in and told the governor—I went in again, and when I came out at eight o'clock he was still standing outside—he said if I did not get him two pounds of snuff the following day he would come in to Mr. Goode—while I was with him at the back of the Post Office he told me he knew another boy about a year ago working at Mason's who used to get him some tobacco pouches, and he used to make 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and he also knew another boy working at a shoemaker's who used to take a pair of boots away every night—I saw no more of him till Wednesday, the 29th May, at one o'clock in the afternoon—he then asked me if I was going to get him anything—I said, "No"—I afterwards told my masters what had occurred, and by their directions I went out and told the prisoner that I would meet him at seven o'clock at the Post Office—Mr. Alfred Goode gave me half a pound of tobacco to give to the prisoner—I met him at seven o'clock at the Post Office and gave him the tobacco—ho put it in his pocket—the officer came up and took him into custody—he did not give me anything for it.</p>

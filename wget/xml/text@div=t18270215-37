On the 1st of February I saw my sheep safe in the field about four o'clock in the afternoon - there were sixty of them - they were south-down sheep; I went to look for them again on Saturday morning, the 3d of February, and found only twenty-seven - most of them were marked J. C. on the near hip, with a black mark; I thought they might have strayed out of the field - but could find no gap; I went to the gate, and found they had gone out there - it had frozen hard on the Friday night, and if they had gone out on Friday night, there would have been no marks; but the foot marks were very plain, and a man's foot mark after them - I went all round the neighbourhood to inquire, but could hear nothing of them; I sent my son off on horseback on Sunday - he came back about twelve o'clock, and finding something in the newspaper about sheep, I immediately sent him up to Queen-square - he came back to me that evening (Sunday) and gave me information; I went up to Queen-square on Monday morning, and found twenty of my sheep in the slaughter-house of a butcher named Peek - there were no others there - they remained there till Friday, when the magistrate ordered them to be given to me.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Rochester-row, Westminster, near Queen-square, On Friday, the 2d of February, the prisoner came, in company with a man named Skipper, who recommended the prisoner to me as having known him, and I let him my shed at 2s. 6d. per week; I gave him the key at ten o'clock that morning - he was dressed like a regular butcher, with a blue apron, shoes, and gaiters; and his hands were smeared with blood, as if he had been killing - he told me his name was Williams, and he lived at Vauxhall, or Vauxhall-road - about three o'clock that afternoon he brought a horse and cart, tied up four sheep, and put them into the cart - he must have brought the sheep there between ten and twelve o'clock, for about twelve I looked through the window of the shed, and counted them in a careless manner - I made about twenty - they were loose in the shed, and the door was closed - at three o'clock, when he had put the four into the cart, Pople came and took him; the four sheep were let loose with the other sixteen - they remained in my shed about an hour and a half afterwards, when Pople took them away - the prisoner had come two days before in company with Skipper, and Skipper said he knew a person who wanted a shed, and I then agreed to let it to the prisoner - he wanted possession immediately, but I could not give him possession till Friday, as I had not got the key; I told him I expected it the next day, and he came next day (Thursday) in company with one Coney - I told him he should have the key as soon as I could get it - he came again on Friday at ten o'clock, and I gave it him; I knew Coney - his father keeps an oil shop near me - the prisoner was dressed very respectably on Wednesday and Thursday, but on Friday he was dressed like a butcher - I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Friday afternoon, the 2d of February, between three and four o'clock. I went to the back of Rochester-row, and saw the prisoner with a horse and cart, inside some gates; within those gates was a shed - I saw him tying the legs of some sheep, and putting them into the cart - he put four in- the cart being too small, would not hold more; he was going to drive away - I went to him, told him to stop, and asked where he was going with those sheep; he said he was going home - I asked where he got them from; he said he had bought them that morning at Smithfield - I asked how many? he said "Twenty, I believe." I said "What is the salesman's name? and what did you give a head for them?" - He did not answer but seemed to hesitate; I pressed him to answer the question - he said he did not know that he should answer me, or words to that effect - I said I was an officer, and suspected they were stolen - I asked where he lived - he said, "You need not trouble yourself to ask me any more questions, for I shall answer none" - I then said, "If you bought these sheep at Smithfield this morning, how came you to go over Vauxhall-bridge, to Rochester-row with them" - as it was a great distance out of his way; he said he generally went the way that suited his purpose best - Pace, another officer, came in at the time - we secured him, took the sheep out of the cart, and put them into the shed, where there were sixteen more - he had got "G. Williams, Bermondsey, 16,516," chalked on the cart - we took him before the magistrate; he refused to tell the magistrate who he was, where he lived, or to give any account whatever of himself - on the Monday, Walker came and claimed the sheep, as twenty of the thirty-three which he had lost - they were not advertised, but I requested a reporter in the office to name the circumstance; we searched him, and found two sovereigns, and about 2s. on him, with one turnpike ticket of the Vauxhall-gate, one of the City toll bar, and one of the Marsh-gate - they are not dated.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you ask why he came over Vauxhall-bridge? A. I had received some information, before I found the tickets. I found eight sheep' skins at Kentish-town last Thursday - the person who had them is not here.</p>

            . I am certain the sheep were mine - there was no mark but the I. C. on them when they left, but when I found them they were marked with ochre down the back, and across the loins, but my mark still remained.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Friday morning, the 2d of February, I was in Smithfield, and bought twenty sheep of a man named Thomas Wood, for 31l.; I paid him thirty-one sovereigns, and drove them home; I had not room in my slaughter-house for them, and took them to the shed, which I hired of Wells. I have a witness named Portwine, who saw me buy and pay for them.</p>
               <p> - LUCE. I am the door-keeper of this Court. - At ten o'clock this morning a woman, who said she was the prisoner's wife, brought a man to the door, saying that his name was Portwine, and he was a witness; I said I would call him when he was wanted. I saw him in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150031"></xptr>yard since two o'clock, and when this case came on somebody said the prisoner's wife had been gone ten minutes.</p>
               <p>- WELLS. I am the wife of John Wells, the witness. When this trial was called on I told the door-keeper I would fetch the prisoner's wife, as I had seen her over the way at the public-house, but when I went for her she was gone.</p>
               <p>His Lordship postponed summing up this case to the Jury until after the subsequent trial, which occupied till past five o'clock - Portwine being then called did not appear.(See the Fifth Day.)</p>

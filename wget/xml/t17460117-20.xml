            (to Bartholina Crom arty.) When did you miss these Goods?</p>
               <p>Cromarty. Last Monday was sen'night in the Morning. We took her into our Service this Day fortnight about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your Goods upon her when you took her up?</p>
               <p>Cromarty. Yes. That Cloak upon her Back, and the Handkerchief, I believe, she has now round her Neck.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you know them to be your Goods?</p>
               <p>Cromarty. Yes. And when I spoke to her of them, she gave me very ill Language, and said, I might take them away.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the other Goods, a Long-Lawn Apron, two pair of Women's Pumps, one pair of Silver Buttons, did you find these?</p>
               <p>Cromarty. No. I said to her, how can you serve me so? She told me she desir'd to be banish'd, she was weary of living here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord. These People are very notorious, they keep a notorious Bawdy-House. Neither did I ever wrong them of any Thing. Mistress, did you not tell me, that you took two Creatures into your House that run away with your Goods. My Lord, I serv'd my Mistress two Years ago and I went to her again: She was making Complaint that she had lost several Things, and she said her Husband had got a Writ against me. My Lord I don't chuse to be arrested in a wrong Cause. My Mistress said to me, my Dear, pray don't get yourself into a Jail.</p>

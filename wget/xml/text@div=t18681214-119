I told him it was my wife's"—after I gave him the authority to get the bracelet from Hatton Garden, I received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—I also went with him and ordered some furniture, to a large amount—I should think about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I never saw the bill—it was to furnish my bed-room—he gave me some money when I went to Margate—we were very good friends after I had given him the authority for the bracelet—I have not seen him since last February until the other day—I always recived him, whether he had money or not—I knew he was in difficulties—we were very good friends after he would not tell me where the bracelet was, and after I had been to Mr. Barker—he might have done anything he liked with the bracelet, if he had told me where it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Bouverie, of Hill-street, Berkeley-square. On the afternoon of the 16th of January I was in St. James's-park, near Buckingham palace, about one o'clock, and missed my handkerchief, in consequence of the policeman speaking to me—I know it was safe a quarter of an hour before—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 82.) A little before one o'clock, on the 16th of January, I was on duty in the park, near Buckingham-gate, and saw the two prisoners in company together—I am certain Phillips was with the other—I watched them for a quarter of an hour, and saw them go to a gentleman, take a handkerchief partly out, and put it back again—they then went to the prosecutor, and Thompson took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it into his breeches—Phillips was covering him at the time—I was close to them, watching, and looked over Phillips's shoul-der—I found the handkerchief on Thompson—Phillips was close alongside of him at the time I took him—I had seen them talking together, and saw Thompson try a gentleman's pocket before that, in company with Phillips, who saw what he was doing, and remained with him till the prosecutor was robbed—I am quite satisfied they were both together concerned in taking it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Phillips</hi>. I was standing, looking at the Queen's carriage go into the gate—this young lad happened to be by my side—I did not know him at all—I walked away—he came and spoke to me, and said, "That is a nice carriage"—I said, "Yes, it is," and walked on—he followed me—I heard a scuffle with the policeman taking him, and stopped to see what it was, when they took me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I seized both together—they were both walking away together with the handkerchief—I had touched the gentle<lb></lb>man, and said, "You have lost your handkerchief," and they both walked away towards Pall-mall, quite away from the gate.</p>

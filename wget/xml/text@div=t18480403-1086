On 10th March I changed my dress to go to London with the carriage—I left my boots in the stable-window—I missed them next morning and informed the police—the pri<lb></lb>soner was formerly in my master's service—on 23rd March I saw him go by the</p>

               <p>gate with my boots on—I said, "William, I want to speak to you; I want to look at your boots:—he said, "What do you want to look at my boots for?"—I said, "I think they are mine; undo those straps"—he would not—I undid them myself, turned up his trowsers, and found he had my boots on—these are them—I took him into the stable, and said, "I shall take you down to the station"—he said, "Don't do that: I did not think you would serve me so; I will give you a sovereign, and buy you a new pair of boots."</p>

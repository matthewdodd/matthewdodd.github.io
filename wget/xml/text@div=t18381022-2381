                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker. At the time in question I resided in Lancaster-street, Burton-crescent—I rented the bottom part of the house—I had no shop—I belong to a Benefit-society, held at the Lamb and Flag, No. 2, Rose-street, Covent-garden—on Tuesday night, the 2nd of October, I and my brother were there until half-past one o'clock in the morning—I was one of the stewards, which caused me to be so late, as the money all passes through ray hands—I and my brother had got a very few steps from the house—we were walking even with each other—I was turning down the cuff of my coat, making the best of my way home, when two common prostitutes came in front, and one seized my hand—I do not recollect what she said, but I believe she said, "How do you do dear?"—or something of that sort—I said, "D—n you, leave me alone," and at that moment I felt a hand in my right-hand pocket—I suspected another girl who was behind me—I wrung myself from the girls in front of me, seized the arm of the hand that was in my pocket, and found it was a man's arm—I held it for a time, and received two or three blows behind me, and when I got the arm so that I could see the face, I shall never be<lb></lb>lieve anything but the person I gave into custody is the person—it west the prisoner, George Freegrove—I do not know any thing of the other—I held George, and called the police, and just as the police came up, I was knocked down—when I got up I seized the same man again—the police came, and I held my man, and my brother had got another—the police men took us all to the station-house—I was out of breath, and exasper<lb></lb>ated</p>

               <p>at being taken—we were asked no questions, but all sent backwards into cells—I and my brother were in one cell with another man—were<lb></lb>mained there above an hour, and I sat down by this strange man in the cell-in about an hour I called through the door for a policeman to move us to another cell, because it smelt so, which he did—I did not make any charge against the prisoners at that time—I did about an hour or two hours after, when I missed a sovereign and a half-crown out of my right-hand pocket, which was the pocket I had felt the man's hand in—he had forced the button off—when I left the house I buttoned my pocket up, with the half—crown and sovereign in it—when I missed my money I called to the police, and whispered through the hole, desiring him to search the men who were taken into custody—down to that time there had been no exa<lb></lb>mination by the Inspector—I was kept in custody till the morning, when we went over to Bow-street Office—the examinations were then taken.</p>

               <p>two from him, but I cannot say he is the man that struck me—I was struck several times by the party, but I cannot swear which—they were all friends together—there were six or eight of them about when I gave the prisoner into custody—I know nothing about my brother's case—I was excited at the moment, and took care of myself the best way I could—we were taken to the station-house—there were no questions asked, but we were locked up.</p>

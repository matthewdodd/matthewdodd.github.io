                  </hi>. I am a builder—about 11 o'clock, on 8th April, I was in the Three Mariners public-house, Castledon Road, Hackney, with the prosecutor—two men came in and asked for a pot of ale—they poured a glass out, and the prisoner walked in and drank it—he was not drunk; he had had something to drink before, I should say—he poked Fossett in the back with his umbrella, and said, "I have seen a b—<hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of yours"—Fossett said, "You have made a mistake; I don't know you, and you don't know me"—the prisoner said, "There is no b—mistake about him," and struck him in the back with his fist—the landlord then turned the prisoner out of the house, and they had a struggle—Fossett and I went out to go home, and as we went out, the prisoner ran at him, and <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> him in the eye with his umbrella three or four times—he ran at me, and said, "You b—I will serve you the same"—I hit the umbrella down with one hand, and knocked him down with the other—then we had a struggle on the ground—Fossett said, "My eye is out"—he was quite blind the next day—I saw Drake there; he was one of the men who came in for the beer.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186905030056"></xptr>
               <p>and it went into Fossetts eye—a constable came up, and he was given in charge—as Fossett went to strike him, the prisoner put up the umbrella to defend the blow—Fossett fixed him by the throat, till he was black in the face—the potman and all were on him—the prisoner was on the ground when they were striking him—Fossett was in the house then—Fossett came to the door, and rushed at him, and then the umbrella went into his eye—the prisoner was not struck after that—it was accidental—he put it up to save the blow—the prisoner had been knocked into the gutter before Fossett was struck with the umbrella.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer C</hi>). On Friday, 12th November, about 3 o'clock, a man named Daley came to the station and saw me and another detective—in consequence, a little after 9 o'clock in the evening, I went to Oxford Street (corner of Duke Street) and there saw Daley and gave him certain instructions—at 9.30 I saw the prisoner come up to him at the cor<lb></lb>ner of George Street and Oxford Street—I was about 20 yards off—I had Jacobs (201) with me—I saw Daley and the prisoner talking together for some minutes, and they had some words; they were talking very loud, and</p>

               <p>the prisoner was trying to get away—Daley would not let him go, and took hold of him once or twice—I heard the prisoner say "It was you, it was not me"—Daley said he would give him into custody, and I went and asked them both to go round the corner and tell me what it was about—Daley said "Didn't you want me to go to the jeweller's shop over the way and give the old man some chloroform, and rob the jeweller's shop?"and the prisoner said "No"—lie said "Didn't you want me to go and break into the jeweller's, shop at night?"—he said "No"—he said "It appears to be all."No"—I asked if he had anything about him—he said "No, only tools,"—I said "You will have to <hi rend="italic">go to</hi> the station"—on the way to the station he said Daley was as bad as he was, and he ought to be locked up as well, "but unfortunately I have the tools on me"—I took him to the station and searched him, and found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> wrapped in paper, a crowbar, a chisel wrapped in paper, a piece of candle, a table knife, and a box of matches (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the knife might be used to push back the catch of a window—I found some keys—I asked his address and he gave me 103, Cambridge Street, Chelsea; there is no 103, Cambridge Street—I afterwards asked him to give his address, and he said his father lived at 139, Vauxhall Bridge Road—I went there, and they said he didn't live there.</p>

I at present reside in the <hi rend="italic">Goliath</hi> training ship off Gravesend—I remember the morning of Friday, the 12th November, at 11.30—I met the prisoner at the Vine Street police-station—he was reading a hill about a great robbery—he said "Good luck to him, may he never be caught"—he entered into conversation with me—we went up Oxford Street—he told me he had been into a place in Oxford Street and opened a desk and had found the till of money, which he would have taken, but he put it back again—he told me going up Oxford that he was going to break into a jeweller's shop, and asked me whether I would help him to break into it with him—he then took me round to Hill Place—I cannot exactly remember the name of the place—he showed me a back entrance which we could get in, and pointed out Piggott's, the jeweller's, shop in Oxford Street, and said "There is where we will get in"—then, going towards Regent's Circus, he said "Will you meet meet me at Hall Allen's, drapers, in Oxford Street, at 9.30"—I said I would, and we walked down some distance, and we parted—I then went to a constable of the D division and told him all about it—he told me to go to Marlborough Street police-station, which I did, and made a communication to the police, and the last witness and Jacobs went up with. me in the evening to the appointed place—the prisoner met me—the police wore a distance off, still they could hear what was going on—the prisoner said "Well, you have kept your word"—I said "Yes, I have kept my word, I am very sorry that ever you thought of bringing me into such a thing"—when the prisoner found I did not want to do such a thing he wanted to go away, but I would not let him and said "If you don't mind what you're about I'll give you into custody"—he got very angry when I called Jacobs and Shrives and was going to give him into custody—they came up and began to talk and asked him what was the—matter, and they took him into custody—I am a light porter.</p>

On the 27th of February, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the kitchen passage, as I was going up stairs with the dinner; I asked him what he wanted - I do not know what he said; but I told him to wait a few minutes and I would be back, as I thought he came with the baker's bill - in three or four minutes I came back, and saw him coming out of the kitchen door; I asked what brought him into the kitchen - he said</p>
               <p>Nothing; he got between me and the door, and ran up five of the area steps - I ran and caught hold of the skirt of his coat; he said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go;" I said I would not, and brought him back into the kitchen; I called out and my master came down - the prisoner then took the milk-jug out of his pocket - I had seen it safe half an hour before.</p>

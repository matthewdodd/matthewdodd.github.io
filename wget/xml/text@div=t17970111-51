Yes; on the 6th of December, Mr. Larkin came out of the country, and stopped at No. 5, Fenchurch-street, the coach was ordered to Mr. Bonnett's coach-maker, Prince's-street, Soho; Mr. Larkin desired me to go with the carriage, and gave me a note to Mr. Bonnett.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be with the carriage? - A. I was not his servant then, I was out of place; I had been in the country on my own business, and returning, I got behind the carriage; I had not been long behind, before Mr. Larkin stopped the carriage, and asked who I was, he knew my friends very well. they live at the place he came from; I was, at that time, a total stranger to him, when we came to Fenchurch-street, he desired me to go with the carriage, the trunk was strapped behind; being very tired, having walked thirty miles that day, I got into the carriage, I kept a sharp look out behind, through the glass, in the back of the coach, we came through Cheapside and <placeName id="t17970111-51-crimeloc305">St. Paul's-church-yard</placeName>

             immediately released the trunk from behind the carriage, and Pryer took hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. In St. Paul's-church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he release it? - A. It was strapped on with two leather straps, the straps were cut; they took hold of it, one on one side, and the other on the other side, and ran away with it; I stopped the coachman and opened the carriage door, and jumped out in pursuit of them, they made up Cheapside, towards the Mansion-house; when I came to Cheapside, I enquired of a man, if he had seen any body with a trunk, and he told me two men were gone along Cheapside with one, I then saw them, and immediately ran after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same two men you had seen behind the carriage? - A. Yes; I catched

             fast by the coat, and asked him where he was going with the trunk, he replied, what was that to me; I told him it was to me, it was my property, at least it was in my care.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the trunk? - A. Both of them, they were together, going towards the Mansion-house, near Bread-street; they said, they would not deliver the trunk to me, they had picked it up; I told them, if they did not deliver the trunk, I would charge the watch with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Nearly six o'clock, I called the watch, but there was no watch set, they asked me if I had the key of the trunk, or could tell the contents; I told them I could not, but had sufficient in my pocket to shew it was in my care, I had the note then in my pocket, they said they would not deliver the trunk up, I was a swindling fellow, and wanted to cheat them out of the property which they had found; we had a bit of a scuffle, they were going on, a gentleman advised me to take them to the Mansion-house; I begged of them to go with me to the Mansion-house, they said, they would go with me; I went on to the Mansion house, and rang the bell, a constable attended, and I told him there were two men who had taken a trunk from behind a carriage, and I produced the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the constable here? - A. Yes, I don't know his name; he advised me to give charge of the two men, which I immediately did, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110077"></xptr>prisoners gave charge of me; they asked me, if I could swear that they were the two men that cut the trunk from behind the carriage; I told them, I was not going to tell them exactly what I was going to do; the two men were taken into custody, and I was taken into custody, till they sent for Mr. Larkin and Mr. Bonnett; I was rather flurried at the time, I might drop a few words that I don't recollect now, I might say, I could not swear to the men, I was quite confused, as the trunk was left in my care, I waited till ten o'clock, and Mr. Larkin came and released me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wooden trunk? - A. Yes; covered with leather.</p>
               <p>Q. That trunk was Mr. Larkin's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you heavy, as if it was full? - A. Yes, quite full; it appeared very heavy by their carrying it; one man could not well carry it alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. Mr. Wisdom, I must have a few words with you; for these men have both friends and character - As soon as the gentleman was out of the carriage, you took the hint and took his place? - A. I was not desired to ride inside or out; I had walked from Malden that day, and from town the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Larkin desired you to take particular care of that trunk, to see it safe to the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had condescended to go on the outside, the trunk could not have been taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not deliver that note to Mr. Bonnett? - A. No; I delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You neglected the safer way, and got within side? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Through the back of the carriage, you saw all that passed? - A. Yes; I put back the pad, and saw through the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you look through? - A. All the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the faces of the men that ran after the carriage? - A. No; I took particular notice of their garments; one had a light drab coat, the other a blue or a black coat.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not light enough to discover the colour, was it? - A. It was lamp-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a rainy night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That gave you a better opportunity of seeing colours? - A. I think it did; the lamps gave a light, that the stones shone from the water.</p>
               <p>Q. This gave you a better opportunity of observing? - A. Not better, full as good.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not an opportunity of seeing their faces? - No, only the garments.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear, the two persons you saw in Cheapside, were the persons that took she trunk off in St. Paul's Church-yard? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I will give you a caution; I have four witnesses to call, who will prove that you said the contrary - Did you not say to the Mansion-house constable, you could not swear that these were the men that you saw in St. Paul's Church-yard? - A. I did not tell him I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell him they were the two persons? - A. He did not ask me; it was the prisoner asked me if I could swear to them; I might say a few words; I was confused, having the trunk in my care, if it was lost, what might be the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell my Lord, these were the two men that took the trunk? - A. Yes, I said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so to the constable? - A. No; I did not say so to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you say so? - A. I told it to the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you tell the constable so or not? - A. I told the constable, when he opened the gate, here were two men who had taken a trunk from a carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the constable these were the two men that took the trunk - How came you to say you were so flurried, you could not swear they were the men - Was not Church, the constable, there? - A. I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there another constable there of the name of Newsom? - A. I don't know either of their names.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Church; is that the constable? - A. That is the man I delivered the note to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not that man ask you if you were certain these men were the persons that took the trunk; and whether you did not say they were the persons that had it in their custody, but you could not swear they took it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said they were not the persons that took the trunk away? - A. I told him they were the persons that took the trunk from behind the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was this? - A. Nearly six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up with these men, they asked you whether you could produce the key, or were the owner of the trunk, did they not? - A. They asked if I could produce the key, or knew the contents.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether they did not propose going to the Mansion-house? - A. No, they did not; they were not the first proposers of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make any objection to taking the trunk to the Mansion-house? - A. No; they did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110078"></xptr>Q. Did they ever attempt to leave the trunk, or run away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give charge of them to any body? A. No; the watch was not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask any body to assist you? - A. Yes; they made me out to be a swindler, and they would not take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have let the trunk down and ran away? - A. No; they went to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the constable take you to the Compter? - A. They said, if the constable took charge of them, they must take charge of me; and if Mr. Larkin was a gentleman, they found the trunk, and supposed he would make them some recompence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say at the Poultry Compter, that you could not say that these were the men that took the trunk away in St. Paul's Church-yard? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. At what pace was the carriage travelling, when you saw those men coming after it? - A. It was going on a jog trot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know that man, Bamford; did you say before him, that you could not say these were the men that took the trunk from the carriage? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were particularly desired to take care of this trunk, and left the best care of it and got within side, you expected a great deal of anger if you did not find the persons that took it? - A. Certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not six upon somebody? - A. Mr. Larkin did not want me to six upon any person, if I did not save the property.(The trunk was produced by Henry Church.)</p>

             sworn. - I am gate porter at the Mansion-house, and a constable: On the 6th of December, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoners at the bar came to the Mansion-house, accompanied by Mr. Wisdom; he gave charge of them for cutting the trunk from behind the carriage; I asked him how it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in the hearing of the prisoners? - A. Yes; he said, going along St. Paul's Churchyard, he heard a noise behind the carriage; he looked through the glass, and saw some person or persons attempting to cut the trunk from behind the carriage; that he called to the driver to stop as soon as he could, and he could not make him stop till he broke one of the glasses in the front of the carriage; when he got out of the carriage the trunk was missing; that he went towards Cheapside full run in pursuit of them; that coming out of St. Paul's Church-yard, he met a gentleman; that the gentleman asked him what he was running for; that he told him he had lost a trunk from behind a carriage; that the gentleman told him he met two men in Cheapside with one, one hold of each handle; that somewhere about Bread-street he overtook them; he demanded the trunk; they refused to deliver it without he could produce the key, which he could not, and they came very quietly with him to the Mansion-house; I asked Mr. Wisdom if he could swear they were the men that cut the trunk from behind the carriage; he said, he could not, but they were the men he found it upon, therefore he gave charge of them; they went very quietly to the Compter; I asked Mr. Wisdom at the Compter, where the gentleman lived that belonged to the trunk; he could not tell me the name of the street; he told me he was a servant out of place, and he was sent to take care of this trunk; as he could not give a proper account of himself, the prisoners gave charge of him, and I took him into custody; I found out where Mr. Larkin was in town by the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wisdom give you the note? - A. Yes; I found him at Mr. Hankey's, in Fenchurch-street; the note was only a direction to the coach-maker for the coach to be repaired; Mr. Larkin came to the Lord-Mayor's, and released Wisdom out of the Compter that night.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are in trust at the Mansion-house, and can have no interest in this business? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure you asked him if he could swear they were the men that cut the trunk from behind the carriage, and he said he could not, but that he found it in their possession? - A. Yes; he said that two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the Compter when Bamford came there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Wisdom say in the presence of Bamford? - A. He said he could not swear to the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110079"></xptr>Q. What did Wisdom say, respecting whether they were or were not the men that cut the trunk from the carriage? - A. He said, it was cut from the carriage by some body, he could not swear that they were the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you state the very words what he said relative to their being the men or not, that cut the trunk from the carriage? - A. He said, he could not swear they were the men, that he found the trunk upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Newsom by at the time this passed? - A. Yes; all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners supoenaed you on their part as well as the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Shepherd's defence. I was at work very hard all day; I can appeal to God for my innocence, and I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Pryer's defence. I am innocent, but I wish to leave it to my Counsel.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the George and Vulture tavern, Corn-hill. The prisoner came there on the 18th of April to have dinner—my servant gave me information—I went to him, and said, "Will you give me those spoons you have in your pocket"—he took them out of his coat-pocket and gave them to me—I do not think he said any thing—these are them.</p>

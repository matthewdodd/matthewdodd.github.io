                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live in Ashton-street, Poplar. On the 27th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, I was at the Harrow public-house—the prisoner came in when I was going to give another girl some gin—the girl who was with me gave the prisoner some gin—the prisoner was quite close to me—I took my watch out merely to see what time it was—it was a double case silver watch—I held it in my hand, and the prisoner took it out—I was sober, and I believe she was sober—I asked her to give it up, and another girl came in and wanted her to give it up—she said she would not—the other girl fell on her—I pulled the other girl off, and the prisoner ran away with my watch—I ran after her, but did not overtake her—this is it.</p>

About two o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, on the 27th of April, in consequence of something I heard from the prosecutor, I went to No. 2, Red Lion-court—I found the prisoner in bed with a girl named Neale—I told the prisoner I should take her for taking the prosecutor's watch at the Harrow—she said, "I am not dozey Poll"—(which is a name she goes by)—the other girl said, "I am dozey Poll"—I took them both to the station-house—the prisoner first said she knew nothing about the watch, but at the station, she said she took it, but there was a scuffle, and she dropped it, and did not know what became of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger. On the 14th of July I was in company with the prisoner—I had the box and silver in my jacket pocket—I was walking and talking with him in the street, and when he left me I missed the box and silver—I am sure I had not given it to him to take care of—I was sober—the prisoner is a friend of mine—I never knew any harm of him.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 16th, two days after the robbery—he said, "I know; I took the money and the box, and if he had waited I would have given it him back"—this is the box—I found it in his pocket—he said on his way to the station that he had swallowed two sixpences.</p>

On 20th Nov. the prisoner Kilsby came about 25 minutes to 9 o'clock for a half quartern cottage loaf; I had seen him peep in at the window before he came into the shop—he gave me in payment a bad half crown—I taw it was bad; I tried it in the detector and bent it—I told him it was bad; he said it was not, and he had taken it just above—I took it from him, bent it again, and took the piece almost off—I went round and took hold of his coat—I said he was a <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>, and I would give him in charge—his coat gave way, and he got away; he walked away quietly—when he went out, a boy named Brown came across, and I sent him for a policeman—I did not see the boy again that night—this was on Saturday night, and on Sunday morning he brought me the same half crown that I had bent—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, and live at 32, Great Prescot-street. My wife died in May, 1849—the female prisoner was then a servant in the house—the male prisoner afterwards married her, and slept in the house—on Wednesday, 28th May, I went to Gravesend with the male prisoner, leaving the female in possession of the house—I returned home about eight o'clock, and she was gone—I looked about, and missed two sheets, two blankets, two pillows, and a great number of other things—I saw the male prisoner again on the following Saturday, and asked where his wife was—he said he did not know—I never gave her any of the property—I am seventy-three years old.</p>

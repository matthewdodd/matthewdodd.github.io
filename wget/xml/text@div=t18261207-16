I had often heard them quarrel, and did not think it necessary to interfere, as their quarrels were very frequent; I could not judge who provoked the quarrel, it was before I got upstairs; she always appeared to me to be a woman of easy temper, from what I heard of conversation which has passed, when I have been in my room. I got up at seven o'clock on Sunday morning, and heard the prisoner walking in the room and talking to himself, which was cus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070013"></xptr>tomary; I went out about half-past ten o'clock without seeing him; I returned at eight, went to bed at half-past eight, and hearing a noise, I suppose he was in the room, but I cannot say; on the Monday morning I got up between seven and eight o'clock; I heard him walking in the room; he went out two or three times, locking his door after him, and came in again - I went out, and did not return till ten o'clock at night; I heard nobody that night; about a quarter to seven, on Tuesday morning, Mrs. Jay, the landlady, called me down-stairs; I was then getting up, and heard Robinson and Jay come up-stairs- Robinson went into the prisoner's room and called out,"O, there she lays!" I went in afterwards, and saw two chairs placed at the side of the room, with a sack hung over the backs, and then I beheld the body of the woman laying on the floor at full length against the wall, at the side of the door; I suppose it was three yards from where I heard the fall; it laid on the right side, and a deal of blood appeared to flow from the head; a flannel, or dishcloth laid under her head to sod the blood up; she appeared very much bruised on both temples, and looked very black on the neek; and from the door, to the place where the body lay, there appeared blood; there was also blood against the wall; I am certain I heard her fall against the door, as the lock made a noise; and after that fall I heard nothing more from the woman; I heard no other blow afterwards; there are only two rooms on the floor.</p>

            . I am a bookbinder, and live on the first-floor in this house. I knew nothing of this affair till the Sunday morning; I saw the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock; he brought a flat-iron down to my room, which I had sent my son up for; I asked where his wife was; he said she had been out all night, and was gone to her brother's; that he was going to dine at his son's at Hampstead, and had got a piece of pork and some French beans, which he would sell me cheap; I said I was provided, and did not buy it; he went up, and brought down the beans, and asked if I would accept of them, which I did; he went up-stairs again, and afterwards went out; I believe he was out all day, for I was at home all day; I saw him between six and seven o'clock on Sunday night going up-stairs; and heard him moving about in his room on the Monday morning; I went out about nine o'clock that morning, and did not see him afterwards; I went into the room on Tuesday morning, about seven o'clock, in consequence of what I heard from Mrs. Jay; I went up to call Thomas, but instead of knocking at his door, I put my elbow against Ambrose's, and it opened; I held the door in my hand, put my head in, and saw a bonnet and shawl on a table; I saw nobody in the room; I went down and told Mr. Jay I thought all was not right; we went up into the room; I turned round, and behind the door stood a table cross-ways, and a sack over two chairs, and there I saw the body laying straight; Jay fetched Barnsley, the beadle; I went up again with them; I know nothing more.</p>

            . I am surgeon, and live in Hatton-garden. On Tuesday, the 12th of September, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was called to see this body; it lay in the room, with one chair placed at the head and another at the feet, and a sack hanging from one chair to the other, before the body - there appeared a great many bruises about the head, face, and temples, and some small ones on the body - some were recent, and others appeared old - those on the head appeared recent; there were several on the back part of the head; they were bruises, but I cannot say whether they were inflicted by blows or falls, one is as likely as the other - a person receiving a blow, or push, and falling against a hard substance, might occasion them; or falling down and moving about afterwards. I examined the head and found no wound in the scalp, or fracture in the bone; there was no blood from any wound, but a morbid fluid appeared to have run from the nose and mouth, but that had flowed since death - it certainly might be the effect of a violent blow beating the body down and stunning it - it might be occasioned by a fall as well as a blow; I could find no mark of any particular blow, for the face was discoloured, both from bruises and dissolution; I opened the head, there was no fracture.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you open the head? A. On the same day - we found some extravasated blood between the scalp and the pericranium; on removing the skull-cap or bone, we found a quantity of extravasated blood on the brain, and some on the ventricles of the brain also; we thought that sufficient to cause death; and, in my opinion, the extravasation was caused from ruptures in the blood vessels of the brain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The fluid you saw on the floor, might have passed from the mouth and nose after dissolution? A. Yes, as it generally does; it is called dead purges by the common people - a discharge from the mouth. In cases of apoplexy the extravasated blood will in some cases flow from the small vessels; persons who are in the habit of drinking a great deal, or have a full habit of body, are subject to apoplexy.</p>

About half an hour afterwards he brought a geranium-tree, which he said came from Lord Mansfield's - he took it away, and I saw no more of him till Monday, at one o'clock; he then asked me if his mistress had been at home - I said I had been out, and had not seen her.

            . I did not live in this house. On Tuesday, at two o'clock, I went down to No. 4, Lilley-street, to see Mrs. Jay. I went up in the deceased's room, with Read, the officer, of Hatton-garden. I saw the deceased laying on her right side, between sacks. I did not see the prisoner - this was before the Magistrate came; the body had not been touched. I washed the body - she was very much bruised about the head, body, and shoulders; there was a piece out of her arm, and marks of teeth on her left arm; it appeared to be a fresh mark - there were bruises, as if she had been beaten with a rope or stick, all about her arms, shoulders, and body; there was a piece of flesh out of her left thigh; I could not tell whether it was bit or not - it was about as large as a shilling; I did not look whether there were marks of teeth there; it might have been the mark of rats, but I could not tell. I went up with the surgeon. I washed her with soap and water.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD re-examined. I observed these marks, and it appeared as if rats had been at her - this is no uncommon occurence; there was a case the other day, when a rat was obliged to be killed - it got up the body.</p>

I asked him, when he awoke in the morning whether he found her there - he said that when he awoke he found that she was gone; I said, "Where was she gone?" he said he found she was dead - he said he stopped in the room from Saturday night till Monday night; he told me, on taking him to Clerkenwell prison, that he had been trying to make away with himself two or three times, but he could not do it - he knew he should be hung.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written.) I had lived with the deceased for above eight years; at times she was in the habit of getting most beastly drunk - she was then very abusive and violent in her temper; to procure drink she would take my wearing-apparel and articles of trade, and pawn them. I very often wanted her to leave me, and from time to time changed my lodging, but she found me out, and when drunk she would insist on living with me, and was very abusive, accusing me of being connected with other women, of being diseased and lousy; she died on a Saturday night - on the evening of that day I went out, and bought a piece of pork for our Sunday's dinner; when I returned home she was out; she shortly after returned home; I told her I had bought a piece of pork, on which she said that I had been out with other women, and they might cook the pork, for she would not - this caused words and a quarrel, and the deceased coming up to me, I gave her a push; she fell, and her head struck against the door; I thought she was in liquor, and, expecting more abuse, I went to bed; on the following morning, when I got up, I found her dead - I was much alarmed, and not knowing what to do I concealed the body with the bed-clothes, and on the Monday morning I left my home; although this circumstance may appear most strange, and I must admit it is; yet, in my distressed state of mind, I knew not what to do, and I do most solemnly declare, before my God and you, that what I have stated is true.</p>

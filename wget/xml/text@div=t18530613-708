Annuities—I think I received the last dividend on 22nd Oct. 1847; since when having no occasion for the dividends, I have not received them, thinking it was safest to leave them in the funds—the signature, "T. Davidson," to these two dividend warrants, No. 141 and 142 is not my writing, nor is it written by my authority—they purport to be warrants for the half yearly dividends, Oct; 1851, and April, 1852, and are for 291<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., each, deducting income tax.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the Dividend Office, Bunk of England. The course pursued with respect to dividends is this; the party applying is asked the name, and then, "What amount of Stock?" if he answers the right amount, the book is turned round for his signature, and he signs it—if a man signs instead of a woman or a woman instead of a man, or a child of ten years old, I should stop it—with those exceptions we take it, that the person applying is the right person, except in cases where the dividend is above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when if the clerk does not know the party it is his duty to refer to the former signature, and if it corresponds, the dividend is paid to the party applying—and further than that, we have to put our initials</p>

               <p>against the signature in the former dividend book to show that we have referred to it—unpaid warrants in arrear are checked every three months from the dividend book—if the dividend book in any instance purports not to be signed by the party who signs the warrant, we take it out upon what is called the query sheet—the dividend book is signed at the same moment that the warrant is delivered—on 31st July, in consequence of a communication made to me, a comparison was made between the dividend warrants remaining in the drawer of the reduced stock, and the dividend books, upon which it turned out that the dividend book in respect of two warrants for Mr. Davidson's dividends, Nos. 141 and 142 had not been signed—I went to the check officer, and examined the warrants which were attested by Joseph Farrall—in Nov. last I again examined the dividend book as to the 141st and 142nd warrant of Dr. Davidson, it was still unsigned, and I reported it to my superior officer, Mr. Palmer—the 143 dividend book was made up about 4th Oct. last; I did not make it up—I made a memorandum in the book respecting the two preceding dividends to call the attention of the clerk who paid them to it.</p>

I know Powell, he ordered a horse and a dog cart there; I cannot say the date—Philcox brought it back the same evening, with the tire of one of the wheels broken—I did not see Powell afterwards that evening, nor Farrall; bat next evening I received orders from Farrall to have a horse and gig at Mr. Baxter's house at six o'clock in the morning; in consequence of which I took the horse and gig there at 20 minutes before 7 o'clock, and Farrall came out, got into the gig, with a portmanteau and carpet bag, and a hat; he wore a cap with a little black peak, and drove away—the horse and gig were brought back by a stranger, about two days afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer, attached to the Mansion-house—the prisoner surrendered himself to me on 28th Feb.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did he come to the Mansion-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was called from the justice-room into my office by my nephew, and found Powell there—I do not know whether he bad been there the day before for the purpose of finding me, and giving himself up—my nephew is not here—he said, "I am advertised, and I come to give myself up; have you got Saturday's <hi rend="italic">Times?</hi>"—I do not recollect that I had seen the advertisement at that time—Saturday's paper was sent for; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; there is an advertisement for Powell in it—I put it down, and he looked at it, read it, and remarked upon it—a reward of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is offered for him—I do not recollect that he at first wished to see the Lord Mayor privately, nor that he said that he had been the day before—the Lord Mayor was not in the chair, and I went and mentioned the matter to Mr. Goodman, and then returned to Powell—he told me he had left town with Farrall, and that they had slept at Keston—prior to mentioning that, he said he was desirous of giving some private information about Farrall, and telling all he knew about him—he said he had left Farrall at the Red Lion at Stoat's Nest, and he believed he would be found there; and also that Farrall had left his portmanteau at Keston, and when he left there, he had only his carpet bag—I sent for a <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw's Guide</hi> to see about a train to Stoat's Nest—the prisoner described Farrall's dress, and I took down the particulars—I do not know Farrall by name; I do not know whether I know him by sight; I know a great many of the clerks in the Bank of England—he gave me other information about Farrall, which I took down—my nephew, Powell, myself, and Bovill,</p>

               <p>all went to Powell's mother's house, to see if any letter had come from Farrall; we did not find any, and returned again to the Mansion-house—this was on Monday, 28th—I went down to Stoat's Nest, and found that Farrall bed left on Saturday, the 26th—I found that the information Powell had given me was perfectly correct—Powell went with me—I got some information about Farrall, and followed him to Merstham; I ascertained that he had left there on the Saturday evening, and was supposed to have gone to Croydon—I found a bag with more than 100 sovereigns in it at Merstham.

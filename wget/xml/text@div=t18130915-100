They were two white pigs, one was larger than the other. Woodberry, the officer, pursued them. The heads of the two pigs were brought to me by Woodberry. The pigs had rings in their noses when I bought them. I observed, before they were taken out of the sack, if they were the heads of the pigs that I had lost, one was larger than the other. On the day before I lost them one of the pigs had got the ring out of his nose. The other the ring was in, and when the heads were brought to me that which had the ring before had got the ring in; that was the larger pig. I have no doubt of their being the heads of my pigs. They were of the value of twelve guineas.</p>

            . I went to Panton's house on the 4th; I saw the head laying on a dresser in a back shed; the entrails were in a tub. I found none of the carcase besides four feet. One of the heads had a ring in its nose, the other one had not.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 187). On 31st January, about noon, I saw the prisoners together in Aldersgate Street, near Little Britain—I followed them about 10 minutes—several people were looking in the shop window of a newsagent's, No. 162, Aldersgate Street—Lane went to the prosecutor's right side and put his left hand to his ticket-pocket—I was on the opposite side of the road—he drew his hand away and both prisoners went towards Goswell Road, Lane apparently looking at something in his hand—I sent a man to inquire if the prosecutor had lost anything, and I followed the prisoners and told them I should charge them with picking pockets—they said nothing—when I caught hold of them Lane put his hand in his right-hand trousers pocket—I called to several persons by to look out, as I thought he was dropping something—before I apprehended him I saw him hand something to Matthews—I searched them at the police-station—on Matthews I found a halfpenny and a knife, and on Lane an old ring—I saw nothing drop, but from the movement of the hand in his trousers I have no doubt when he dropped it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Matthews</hi>. I caught hold of both of you—the other policeman followed us afterwards—he turned into the court when I was bringing you—that court leads into the Goswell Road and into the Golden Lane—the crown collected in Aldersgate Street—you were allowed to get so far away because if I had taken you in custody we might have lost the prosecutor—he had his arm in a sling—you were both running.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was standing on the opposite side of the road—my attention was attracted to the prisoners—Lane placed himself on the prosecutor's right side; he was amongst a crowd of people looking in a newspaper shop window—I saw him put his right hand under his left arm and put his finger in the ticket-pocket—Eagen, the officer, had previously communicated with me and I was watching—Matthews stood close behind Lane—Lane came away and walked some 8 or 10 yards, when Matthews joined him, and Lane showed something to him—then from what Eagen said to me I went to the prosecutor and took his name and address—the two prisoners were taken in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Matthews</hi>. I took hold of the other prisoner from Egan, and handed him over to 184 Z—five policemen followed afterwards—the crowd got together at the corner of the court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I saw the prisoners apprehended and a crowd followed them immediately—I was with Egan—he handed the small prisoner over to me and then I handed him over to a City constable.</p>

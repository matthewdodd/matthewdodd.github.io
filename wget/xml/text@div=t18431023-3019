                  </hi>. I live in Chichester-place, Gray's-inn-road, Dodge was my charwoman—she did not sleep in my house—at seven o'clock in the morning of the 10th of Oct. I was awoke by an officer—Dodge was then in the house—I went down to the butter-cellar, and found the key in the door, which was unlocked—I had three or four hundred weight of soap there—this soap is very much like what I had there—I cannot swear to it, there is no mark on it—I did not miss any—I can swear to this pencil-case—I saw it last on the counter, some time the week before—I usually kept it in the drawer in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shop-boy to the prosecutor. On the night of the 9th of Oct., I locked the cellar-door where the soap was kept, and put the key in my candlestick, when I went to bed, and left it on the kitchen drawers—I was of first in the morning—Dodge came about seven o'clock—she went and lit the fire in the kitchen—after that, Fletcher came to the door, and asked to see Dodge—she spoke to Fletcher outside the door—Dodge had nothing with her then—shortly after a constable came—I then went to my matter, and saw the key in the cellar-door—no one was up till he came, but Dodge and me.</p>

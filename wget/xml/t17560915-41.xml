            . I live at Marybone, and lodge at the house of William Green. I lost upwards of 40 l. but there is a mistake in the indictment for instead of 3 guineas it should have been 30; there were upwards of 30, which I lost along with the foreign gold pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the money taken from?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. It was all in one drawer, in my lodging room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. She was my servant about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the drawers lock'd?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. They were, but by taking out the upper drawer the board it run upon was broke; so she could put her hand down and take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose it?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. It was in January was twelve months. She left my house upon it, and I advertised her directly. When she was taken, she confessed the fact to me. I asked her how she came to rob me. She said she took all the money, and was sorry for it. I asked her what she had done with it, and she said she had squander'd it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention any of the particular pieces ?</p>
               <p>Limbrick. No, she did not. She said that after she had taken it she went to a house in Drury-Lane, where she gave a woman four guineas to go and buy her some things.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.</p>

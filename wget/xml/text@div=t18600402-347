On Saturday, 25th February, about half-past 12 in the day, I was in Gloster-terrace with another constable in plain clothes, named Newsom—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and the prisoner and another man ran into my arms—just before the prisoner came up I saw him throw something into the area of 52, Gloster-terrace—I took Layton and gave him in Newsom's charge—I then went to Gloster-terraoe; and asked if they had found anything, and got these nine florins and two pieces of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the cook.</p>

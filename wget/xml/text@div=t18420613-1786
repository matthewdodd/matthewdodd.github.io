                  </hi>. I am the wife of Walter Pringle, a tobacconist in Lower-street, Islington. On the morning of the 7th of June I was in my parlour behind the shop—as I passed from the back-door through the parlour, I saw the prisoner inside the shop—I saw him take a bundle of cigars from the window—he had a bundle of cheroots in his band at the time—he was out of the shop before I could get up to him—I called to him, and he ran out—I called "Stop thief," and missed a bundle of cheroots and a bundle of cigars—they were my husband's property, and are worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am a greengrocer, in Lower-street, Islington. On the morning of the 7th of June I was opposite Pringle's shop, heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner run out of the shop with a bundle of cheroots and a bundle of cigars—I ran after him, and saw him throw the cigars down—I picked up about a dozen of them, and gave them to the policeman—I saw the prisoner stopped.</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop thief on the morning of the 7th of June, and saw the prisoner running——I followed him down Macclesfield-street, Clerkenwell—he turned into City Garden-row—I lost sight of him for about a minute—after I got into the City-road he was stopped by a gentleman, and I took him—he said he had just come up the City-road—I had seen him running down Macclesfield-street, and followed him—I am sure he is the same person.</p>

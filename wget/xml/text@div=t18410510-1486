                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in New-street, Dorset-square. The prisoner has been in my service about five months—in consequence of information, I watched, and gave notice to my ser<lb></lb>vants—on the 21st of April I gave directions to Groves, who is in my employ—the directions applied to the prisoner, as well as to any body else—about eleven o'clock that day I was attending two ladies in the shop, and I saw the prisoner come in from going round for his orders—I observed be took down five legs of mutton—he weighed some of them, but not all—I cannot exactly say how many of them he put into the scale—he chopped some of them—he then put the five legs into the cart —I distinctly saw him put the five legs in, besides other joints of meat—he then drove the cart away—I went to Groves, and on examining the order book, as to the prisoner, I found only three legs of mutton were entered—this is the book—here is the date of the 21st of April—here is one other leg of mutton booked to the prisoner, in the earlier part of the day—it was his duty to take out one leg and one shoulder of mutton for chance of custom—in the whole of that day there is no more booked by he prisoner than the four legs—I was in the shop when he returned from taking the goods, about a-quarter-past twelve—I then looked into the cart,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100138"></xptr>
               <p>and there was no meat of any description in it—I had set a policeman to watch—the two legs were worth about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had no authority to take out any more meat than he had orders for.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not sometimes happen that when your cart is at the door, if persons come in and buy across the counter, that they might say, "Put this meat in the cart?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Meat is frequently put into the cart, and some<lb></lb>times without being booked—I am not sure whether a gentleman named Elmsley was in the shop, but he always books his meat—he runs an account—I do not know whether he bought a leg of mutton that day—supposing he had, and it were booked, and he wanted it carried home, it would have been given to the prisoner, but it would have been weighed to him first—I saw the prisoner take down most of the five legs of mutton, and I saw the whole five of them lying on the board with his meat—I did not take them down—I will swear that—I saw him take them down and put them amongst the meat—I cannot say how much more meat there was in the cart, nor how many of these legs were weighed—I indicted one of my men here last session—I swore that I saw the man take the meat on that occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you then obliged to admit to my learned friend, Mr. Phillips, that if the man bad come back and restored 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of his wages, you would not have prosecuted him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I did not know whether I should or should not—I might have said I would not—I did not accuse my fore<lb></lb>man on the 26th—I did not call him up into my room, nor make any charge against him—he was charged in my presence by one of my family—I saw the prisoner return on the 21st, but I said nothing to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Wood—I have heard what he has said about the prisoner taking out a leg and shoulder of mutton on the 21st—he returned about eleven o'clock—he then booked the leg which he had taken out to Mr. Austin, of Harley-street, and brought back the shoulder, and he booked with me the orders he had received—here is the book—he then booked three legs, one to Upper Montague-street, another to Baker-street, and another to Manchester-square—he has sometimes taken out joints beside those he had got orders for—he went out about a quarter past eleven—he weighs the meat himself, and tells me the weight—I have booked the weight of the three legs that went out that morning—I have put the weight of each leg opposite the name of the customer—he did not give me the weight of any more than three legs.</p>

               <p>he had five other joints that morning besides these legs, with chops and steaks besides—he was to book his own orders, but he sometimes takes out meat that is not booked—I did not go to the cart that morning to see what meat was in it—I may have asked him on a preceding day where such meat went out to.</p>

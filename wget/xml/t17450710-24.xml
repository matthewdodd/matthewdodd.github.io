            . On the 16th of June my wife and I went out for a day's pleasure; I was informed my house was broke open, and my drawers stripped: when I heard of it, I said the prisoner was the person that did it, for she was standing at the door when I went out at five o'clock in the morning. I got a warrant, and had her taken up at her lodgings in Newtoner's Lane: there were several of the things found upon her. She owned she broke open the house, and in what manner she did it: she said she attempted to take down a shutter, but she could not, so she took out the pannel of the door with a casement hook.</p>

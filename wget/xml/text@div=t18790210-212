                  </hi>. I live at 15, Brunswick Place, Commercial Road, and am the wife of Thomas Knowles—I went to bed about 11.15 on the 11th January—the street door and windows were fastened—I got up at 7.30 the next (Sunday) morning, when I found the panels of the door broken in, and the parlour window had been forced—it had no catch, but a nail had been put in and that was broken off—I then missed an oil-painting and looking-glass—they were safe at 11 on Saturday night—I identify them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 637). At 1.30 a.m. on 12th January I was on duty in Narrow Street, Ratcliff, when I saw the prisoner and another man approaching me—the prisoner was carrying something under his arm, and the other was also carrying something on his shoulder—they came to within 20 or 30 yards of me, when they looked at me, turned round, and ran away—the prisoner turned down what is called the "four-foot way" leading to the Thames, and the other man threw down a picture and ran along another street—I gave chase to the other man but lost sight of him—then I met a Thames constable, and we searched for the prisoner—down the narrow way we found a looking-glass—we then went on board the barges which were lying about 20 yards from the narrow way—it had been snowing and freezing, and we traced some marks into the cabin of the barge "Jane Dale," and there we found the prisoner lying down very wet and steaming, as if he had been in the water—we had got there by going round a considerable distance—I said, "What are you doing here?" he said, "Nothing"—we took him ashore, and asked him what account he could give of the picture and looking-glass—he said, "I met a man at a coffee-stall in Commercial Road: knowing he was going my way homo and seeing he was carrying these things, I consented to carry the looking-glass"—he also made the same statement at the station when the charge was read over to him—the spot where I met the men is about five minutes' walk from Brunswick Place—the prisoner had 30 or 40 yards to run before he turned into the narrow way—I examined Mrs. Knowles's house, and found the panels of the door had been forced in, and the window had been forced open from the outside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>."Last Saturday night week I was going home with a mate of mine, Charley Merritt, who asked me to go up and have a cup of coffee with him. While I was standing with him drinking my coffee this man came up with a picture on his shoulder and a looking-glass in his hand. He seemed to be half intoxicated, and got singing</p>

               <p>I have often seen his face, and knew him as Ted the Boilermaker. When I told him to go home, he might get locked up, I said 'I will see you home; I will come a little way with you. It will all be on my way, as you say you live at Millwall and I live at Limehouse.' On going along he says, 'Give me a spell with this wanting me to carry the picture and the looking-glass. I say 'No; I will take the looking-glass, in case you break it.' I got him round again the White Swan, down London Street, into the narrow way, that being the nearest direction to go. We got half-way up this narrow street, and I was walking ahead, when all of a sudden I heard a crash. On looking round I saw he had dropped the picture and was walking away as fast as he could. Presently two policemen ran by me. I stood for a moment and didn't know what to do. I put the glass down, and stood again this alley way when the policeman rushed over towards me. I backed down this alley, and before I knew where I was I was in the water. I sank down and came up again. I struggled on the ice. I saw a rope, and I grabbed at it I crawled on to the barge, and there I said insensible, and I remember no more not before I felt a blow, and on looking up I saw a constable and another man with him—he told me the charge, and I went and told him all I knew about it".</p>

At 12 p.m. on Saturday, 11th January, I met the prisoner at the Lord Nelson, and asked him if he was going up to have a cup of coffee—we went up to the stall and had some coffee, when a man came up to the prisoner with a large picture on his shoulder and something else on his arm—he and the prisoner left the stall and I went home.</p>

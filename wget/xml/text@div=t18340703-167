            . I was in Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner and another lad standing at a show - one of them had a handkercheif - they then went on - I followed them- I saw them crowd together against the prosecutrix, and the prisoner was rummaging about her clothes - I saw his hand in her pocket-hole, and he took something out - I then saw her pocket hanging out - the prisoner ran off - I told the policeman, who ran and took him - he said he had nothing about him, and he had not, but a young man got a light, and we found this purse just by a grating where the prisoner fell down - we heard it fall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him turn her pocket out? A. Yes; she was going along in the crowd - she was not sensible of what was done till another lad went and told her - I did not tell her that his hand was in her clothes - I was waiting for a policeman - I had just left work - I had not been home - I saw my sister, who said my father was not at home, and I went to take a walk - it was not very dark - I saw him put his hand into her pocket, and heard the purse fall.</p>

               <p>What day of the month are you speaking of? - I cannot tell because I did not set it down; it was a Monday; the same day I applied to Mr. Hankins. The prisoner and two more took me down into a cellar, there was a large hole under ground, and they took the glasses and hammer-cloth out; I said I would not buy them unless they told me where they got them; they said of a coachmaker: I told them I had not money enough, but I would take some of the property and go and fetch some money; the prisoner said to me, don't stay long with the money, I have some things in pawn I want to fetch out: I went and delivered the things to a constable, and enquired among the coachmakers till I found where they were taken from.</p>

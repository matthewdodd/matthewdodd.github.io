               <p>Q. All these were in the cupboard in the pantry in the house? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the place where your master kept his wearing apparel, in the prisoner's room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the prisoner's room were these things in? - A.They were in the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more bottles of wine found than these fifteen bottles? - A. One day it happened I went and shut up the bed in the prisoner's pantry, and there I found seven more, and on the 2d of September I went to scour a dresser down, and under the cupboard I found eight more, making altogether thirty bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Q.

They had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Hancock.) Q. I wish to ask you about the pantaloons; did I not tell you that I had a written order from Mrs. Lewis to send all my master's wearing apparel down into the country, and when I had sent my master's razors, and some other things, my master reprimanded me, and said, I had no right to send any thing down till I had orders from him; these were some of the things, and that was the reason they were down stairs? -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know any thing of an order his mistress sent? - A. They were sent according to order.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 30th of August, did you go to your brother's house for the purpose of discharging the prisoner? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into his pantry before you sent him out of the house for the purpose of seeing whether he had any thing that he ought not to have? - A. Yes, for that purpose; I went into the pantry, I requested him to give me the key belonging to the pantry; I went down into his pantry, he opened two cupboards, and the first thing I saw were these pantaloons of his master's, they were uppermost, and under that there were eight bottles of wine; I particularly asked him whose property that was; he said, it was his master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Under that you found eight bottles of wine? - A. Yes, and a powder flask; in another cupboard were seven bottles of wine.</p>

I asked him particularly why he put the wine there, and why he secreted it in that manner; he said that he was a very distressed man; he was very sorry for it, he hoped I would have mercy on him.</p>
               <p>Q. After that an officer was sent for, and he was taken before a Magistrate? - A. Yes; I requested my brother's cook to make search about the pantry, to see if any thing more was there, and in his trunk were found, two files, a pair of pincers, a turn-screw, and a bunch of keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To witness.) Q. Were not these pincers about the shelf, and the two files in the top cupboard; you looked and found the pantaloons in the housekeeper's drawer in the house-keeper's room? - A.No, they were in your cupboard.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you assist in bottling off this wine? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was removed to Russel-square, to Mr. Lewis's new house? - A. Yes; I found a deficiency immediately that I had done bottling it; I found only fifty-one dozen and two bottles, which I conceived to be deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. When you counted the other pipe, what was that? - A. Fifty-three dozen and one.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you had reckoned them, you found a deficiency? - A. Yes; I am certain of the quantity, it was put into baskets which hold fifty-six bottles; the prisoner at the bar had been with me all the time, and when I counted it out first, I found it fifty-two, and the other ran fifty-three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Were you able to know there was a deficiency afterwards? - A. I did not reckon it before I had done bottling the pipe, it was taken away before I had done bottling it; I was in the cellar, and they went out of my sight with it into the wash-house adjoining the wine-cellar; I make no doubt but it is part of the wine, by the freshness of the corks, and they being wet when Cook called me, and the bottle of sherry, I have no doubt of it, it was sealed; there were no more than six bottles of sherry in Mr. Lewis's cellar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Bowen.) Q. Whether I was not sent into the street at the time this wine was sent out to stand by the cart; I went out to the baker's for bread, and I went for beef-steaks? - A. You were not sent away the first pipe that was counted and found deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me go into the pantry with any wine, or any other place? - A. I could not see him; Mr. Tuck walked backwards and forwards after the first pipe was bottled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To prosecutor.) Q. What is the value of a bottle of this wine? - A. Three shillings a bottle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had not moved the wine there at all; I can prove that those cupboards in the pantry were all the whole day open; Mr. Tuck and his man breakfasted with me in the housekeeper's room, after which we went into the kitchen; I fetched the newspaper for Mr. Tuck to read in the housekeeper's room; I fetched water and rolls; at this time the wine was laying about, in a manner, all over the place; from the first pipe till a considerable time after breakfast, there were two sash windows open, one in the pantry, the other in the room adjoining, in the yard, while I was going to answer the street-door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (To Tuck.) Q. Whether Mr. Tuck did not say to Mr. Lewis, that pipes run commonly so short? - A. I said to Mr. Lewis, that the pipe did run short; in such cases as these we must say something to gentlemen (I had a hint from Mr. Lewis); it wanted a gallon when it went into the house, and it was in as good condition when I bottled it off, as when it came in; I had the whole care of it when it went into the house, and I attended the bottling of it; there was no leakage; I have one thing to say - the prisoner made an observation to me, that he never admitted any body into his room, not even the housekeeper, and wherever he had lived, he never associated with any of the servants when the family were in town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Tuck observed that the pipe was not filled up; the pipe was not guaged before it was drawn off; he said it was a very common thing for them to waste, standing so long a time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tuck. It had been a twelvemonth in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. It did not leak at all? - A. No; and the two pipes both came in at one time, and the other ran that quantity.</p>
               <p>Jury (To Tuck.) Q. Had the pipe of wine been a twelvemonth in the cellar after it was guaged, or guaged previous to its being bottled off? - A. It was guaged a twelvemonth previous to its being bottled off.</p>

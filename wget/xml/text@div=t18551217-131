I went to No. 7, Harcourt-street, Somers-town—I found Sarah Hyde, the prisoner's wife, in bed, and she was dead—her eye was black—I did not see any one in the house—I went about a quarter past 9 o'clock the same night to No. 24, in the same street—I asked for the prisoner—they said he was not there—I would go in, and I found him in the back room, sitting behind the door—he appeared to be asleep—I said to him, "You are the man I want, is your name Hyde?"—he said, "No"—he afterwards said, "I am the man you want"—and he went away with me—he did not appear to be drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the house, No. 7, Harcour-street, Somers-town. I went to bed on Tuesday night, 26th Nov., a little before 11 o'clock—after I had been in bed a short time I heard a noise in the prisoner's room—I went up, and found the prisoner and his wife lying on the floor—they were both dressed—the prisoner was in liquor—his wife appeared to me to be quite sober—they were struggling, and I had heard a</p>

               <p>heavy fall—the wife said, "Separate us, Mr. Short"—I took hold of the prisoner and assisted him in getting up, which he did instantly—he was bleeding from the mouth and forehead, and he seemed angry at the time he got up—they had come in after I had been to bed—when I had separated them, Mrs. Hyde went down stairs with my daughter, and very soon I followed her—she staid down stairs half an hour, and then went across to her mother, who lives at No. 24, Harcourt-street—everything was quiet after that, as far as I know—I heard no more noise through the night—when Mrs. Hyde was down stairs she pointed to a lump that was rising over her right eye—it seemed to me as if it had taken place lately—it was swelling at the time—as far as I am a witness to it, when the prisoner was sober he was quite quiet—when I took hold of him, to separate him from his wife, he said to her, "I will kick you down"—and she went down stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter—I am twelve years old. On 20th Nov. I was in the room with my father and mother—I saw my father break a baking dish across his knee—no quarrelling had taken place before he broke it—I do not know why he broke it, he was tipsy—when the dish was broken, my mother took up the pieces and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them in my father's face—it hurt him—his face was bleeding—my mother then went and laid hold of my father by the neck, and they both fell together to the ground—my mother fell on her back, and she turned round quick and knocked her eye against the corner of the drawers—I did not see any blows struck what ever—my mother fell almost directly after laying hold of my father's neck—she thought my father was going to strike her, she turned her head quick, and struck her eye against the corner of the drawers—she afterwards Complained of her head, and I put cold water to her.</p>

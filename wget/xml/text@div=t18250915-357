            . I am an officer. I was on Ludgate-hill on the 13th of September - I saw the prosecutor, and the prisoner and three others closed upon him, and followed him - I saw the prisoner, whom I knew before, lift up the gentleman's right-hand pocket, and take something out, but I could not see what - I crossed over and asked if he had lost any thing; he said Yes, his handkerchief; the prisoner had got on as far as the Belle Sauvage inn, where I took him - his companions had turned towards St. Paul's - one of the other boys were taken, but he was discharged by the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Ludgate-hill, towards Bridge-street - I stopped for a minute by the Belle Sauvage, as it was wet, and the officer took me.</p>

               <p>to doubt it—some of the money I sent I looked on as a loan—the Charity Organisation Society addressed me first, I believe—there was a difference in the handwriting of the letters, but they were all signed Douglas or Annette Stewart—I have no recollection of any signed by Grant. (<hi rend="italic">These letters were dated some from Warner Road and some from Lorrimore Road, and were similar to the others, requesting small sums by way of loan or otherwise to pay out executions and to assist in preparing works for publication.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Newcastle Street, Strand, and am a tailor—I am proprietor of Nos. 18 and 19—I know both the prisoners—in September, 1876, Stewart took a shop and parlour at No. 19 for Mr. Bay<lb></lb>mond at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as for a publishing office—Raymond turned out to be Grant—Stewart told me that he was servant to Raymond—the rent was paid for some time—people used to come backwards and forwards, and there was the appearance of a business being done up to within about three months before January, 1878—I took possession of the place in January—Stewart bad left over three months then—there was an office boy to answer people who came—Stewart told me that he had had a quarrel with Raymond, that he had left him without a penny piece, and he had nothing to depend upon—Raymond used to come backwards and forwards after Stewart left, but I could never see him—I met him several times in Fleet Street and asked him for my rent—27 weeks' rent was due when they left.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 152, Fleet Street—on 25th May, 1879, Stewart took a room from me as an office at a rent of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—after he had been there a month he took a room on the lower floor at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—he remained till Christmas, and then left without notice or paying any rent—he carried on a publishing business—I saw a case of books arrive there from Ireland—when I took possession I found no books, nothing but taste paper and rubbish—I never saw Grant there.</p>

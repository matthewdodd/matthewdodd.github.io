                  </hi>. I live at 15, Ton bridge-place, New-road, in the parish of St. Pancras. On the night of 23rd Aug. I went to bed about twelve o'clock—the premises, kitchen, and shoe-house were perfectly secure and the shoe-house window was not broken—the bolt of the door is about twelve inches from the window—the shoe-house door leads into the area, and there is merely a door between the kitchen and the shoe-house, the roof of which is the stone at the front door; when you get into the kitchen you get into the house—about half-past one some one awoke me—I looked out of window and saw a female coming from the road up the front garden—she was within the enclosure, and there were apparently one or two more persons out<lb></lb>side—I went down and opened the street-door as quickly as possible, and saw a female in the area inside the shoe-house, the door of which was open—I am quite sure she was inside—I leaned over the area railing, and said, "There you are"—she did not make any noise, and I said, "Come out of there—I I gave the same person in charge to M'Kenzie—I will not swear to the pri<lb></lb>soner, there was not light enough—I dressed and went to the station, and after that went to the area, and found the glass of the shoe-house window broken near the sash—some of my family had fastened the door up again—a geranium-pot</p>

About half-past one o'clock, on 24th Aug., I heard a cry of "Police!"—I went up Mr. Piercy's garden, and saw the prisoner standing four steps up the area ladder—I said, "Halloo <hi rend="italic">Polly!</hi> what have you been at now?"—the prosecutor was in front of the area gate—I laid hold of her—she pretended to be very drank, laid down on the flower-bed, and said, "The thieves are in the kitchen"—I left her with Mr. Piercy, and went with Collins, his nephew, to the kitchen—I found the door bolted and barred inside—I went out and found the shoe-house door open, and a square of glass by the side of it broken—another constable came—we led the prisoner out of the garden—she said she could not walk with the other constable—she walked five or six yards quite straight—in my judg<lb></lb>ment she was sober—when we got to the station she said she should get <hi rend="italic">lagged;</hi> she should get seven years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of deceased, and live at Red Lion Yard, New Brentford—on Monday, 6th January last, I was at home between 5 and 6 p.m.—my father came home an hour before mother, who remained at the Catherine Wheel public-house, where they had been drinking together—he went back an hour afterwards to fetch her, but she remained, and he went again, and persuaded her—she came home—I made tea for her, and while having tea they had a few words, and mother aggravated father—they were both very much intoxicated—he slapped her face twice, and struck her a slight back-handed blow on the stomach, about the navel—she was sitting in the chair, and fell out twice—she was so intoxicated she could not hold herself up in the chair—she fell out of it the first time he slapped her face—I picked her up and put her in the chair—she remained sitting in the chair when he slapped her the second time—she fell out of herself the second time—that was before he struck her on her stomach—she then went to bed—in the middle of the night she complained—my father was then upstairs—he went up about a quarter of an hour after her—I was not at home at 6 a.m., when my aunt Maris Cornish came—my mother also fell down twice as she was coming home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My father and mother had been down to Collier's public-house, and mother remained behind—father went down to her a second time, and she refused to come home—I succeeded in getting her home, but on the road she fell three times—I was in the room until mother went to bed—I do not know what they were quarrelling about—I have told you all that my father did to her—there was no kicking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of Brentford—on 8th January I saw the deceased; she was suffering from bruises on the abdomen and side of her face, and from shock—there was a large bruise to the right of the navel; that was the only bruise on the abdomen—she was very weak and in danger for some days; she partially recovered, but subsequently took fever, from which she died—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found one bruise on her abdomen and two on the side of her face—the bruises had nearly healed, and there were no signs of inflammation from them—she vomited a great deal before she died; that was due in the first place to the blow on the stomach, and in the second place to the fever—the bruise was about two inches to the right of and below the navel—the prisoner was not present on the first day I saw her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The fever set in on 20th January, and she continued to suffer from then to the day of her death—there was an abrasion of the skin over the bruise on the abdomen, and slight inflammation of the bowels at one part, but not where the bruise had been—I made inquiry of every possible cause of fever, and found that she had been sucking during the week, ice obtained from the River Brent, where the water is impure.</p>

She was very weak and in danger for some days; that was from the injuries—it had nothing to do with the ice—I attributed the typhoid fever to the ice, being unable to find any other cause for it—there was paralysis of the bladder during the first week, which I attribute to the injury on the abdomen, which might be occasioned by a blow.</p>

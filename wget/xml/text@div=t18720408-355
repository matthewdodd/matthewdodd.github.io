                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 600). About 5.45 on the evening of 26th February I was on duty in Upper Thames Street—Trig Wharf is 29, Upper Thames Street—I have ascertained that part of Trig Wharf is in the occupation of Messrs. Miles, Gold, &amp; Co., iron merchants, and the other part in the occupation of Messrs. Rathbone &amp; Co., corn merchants—there is no internal communication between the two premises—the corn ware-house overhangs the street, so that you can let down corn from the ware-house into a cart underneath—about 6 o'clock on the evening of the 26th my attention was called to a horse and cart which was being driven by</p>

               <p>Barker along Upper Thames Street, in the direction of London Bridge, away from the wharf, about 300 yards from it—I asked him what he had got in his cart; he said "Some oats"—I asked him how much; he said "Six quarters"—I asked him if he was sure that was all; and he said "Yes, quite sure"—I asked him where he got them from; he said "From 29, Upper Thames Street"—I asked him who gave them to him; he said "The foreman of the stables"—I asked him where he was going with them; he said "To Tulse Hill"—I asked him where that was; he said "Brixton"—I said "Who are you taking them to?" he said "To Mr. Gold"—I said "What is Mr. Gold going to do with them?" he said "To give them to his horses"—I said "I am afraid all is not right; you had better come with me to the station"—I asked him whether he had a delivery note; and he said "No"—I wanted him to go to the station, and he wanted me to go to the stables—he said "Come back to the stables, I will make it all right"—I persisted, and took him to the station—on arriving there, I found there were seven quarters, that is fourteen sacks—the name of Rathbone and Webber was on the sacks—in consequence of what the prisoner said I went to Mr. Gold at Tulse Hill—he is a member of the firm at 29, Upper Thames Street—Mr. Gold gave me this letter, which was read to the prisoner when I got back. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "164, Tulse Hill, Surrey, 26th February, '72. To the Inspector of Police. I understand you have a man in custody who said he was going to bring some oats to my house, which I beg to state is an untruth; he had no business with anything belonging to us, or to anyone else. Your obedient servant, Wm. Gold." (The prisoner was kept in custody and charged with this offence—I went afterwards to 29, Upper Thames Street—I saw Hyams there in the stable, and said something to him—I have not been able to find him since that time—I looked for him the next day, and from that time up to the present I have not been able to find any<lb></lb>thing of him.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cloth Fair—I am an iron porter, in the service of Messrs. Milts, Gold &amp; Co.—I have been there about eighteen years—Barker was in their employment as carman—Hyams was stableman in Messrs. Rathbone's employ, and Aslin was delivery foreman there—on 26th February I arrived at the wharf at 6.30—the usual time for beginning work is 7 o'clock at both wharves, the corn wharf and the iron wharf—I saw Barker standing in Messrs. Golds' cart, under the loop-hole of Rathbone's, stowing corn away in the cart in sacks—I saw Aslin lower the sacks down from the second floor of Rathbone's granary—Aslin was by himself—I stood there about ten or twelve minutes—I was about seven feet from the wheel of the cart—I then went into a public-house called the Barley Mow, and had a cup of coffee—when I came out the cart was still there—I saw my foreman, Dyer, and called his attention to the cart—the prisoners were loading the cart at that time—Barker covered the load over with a sheet about ten minutes to 7 o'clock—he then turned the horses' head towards Blackfriars Bridge, and backed the cart against the stable gates, they burst open and the cart went in—the door was shut, and I did not see any more—I went to work—the coach-house is just inside the gates—I have known Barker for about eighteen years, and Aslin about three—I am quite sure they are the two men—I have always been on friendly terms with them—</p>

Rathbone's with a load of dung to go to the country—I was not surprised to see the cart there so early—I have often seen the cart load there—I did not know there was anything wrong—I thought they were going to the governor's house.</p>

Rathbone's warehouse in Upper Thames Street—there might have been eight or ten sacks in the cart at the time I passed by—the sacks were coming from the loop-hole of Messrs. Rathbone's granary—I did not see who was lowering them—I did not look up—Riley called my attention to the cart, and I saw Barker in it, and the corn coming down, but I did not look up to see who it was at the loop-hole—I knew Aslin very little—he was almost a stranger to me—I knew him very well by sight, and I knew he was foreman at Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 4, South Crescent, Bedford Square—I know Aslin—on the Sunday night before Thanksgiving Day, I sat up at his house—Aslin sat up till about 12 or 1 o'clock—I sat up with Mrs. Aslin and a child—I called Aslin the next morning about 6.30, and he came into the room about ten minutes after and shook hands with me—he lives at 8, Union Place, very near Shoreditch Church, off the Curtain Road—I should think it would take about half an hour to walk from there to Upper Thames Street—I left in the morning about 9 o'clock—I was exa<lb></lb>mined as a witness before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at Aslin's house all night—it is not a common practice of mine to be there all night—I have been there before all night—I don't remember what night it was particularly; two or three nights before that it was; I don't remember which—I sat up two nights the week after<lb></lb>wards—I think it was Wednesday and Thursday; I am not quite certain—I know it was after Thanksgiving Day that I did sit up two nights—I know I sat up on the Wednesday, but I don't know whether it was the Thursday—I remember the Sunday night so well going up to spend the evening—I went up in the afternoon to tea and stayed all night, and on Monday I wanted him to go to the procession the next day, and he said he did not know whether he might have a holiday or not, and I sat up on the Monday night with him—on the Sunday I was there and had tea with Aslin and smoked a pipe with him; I left late at night, and on Monday I asked whether he was going with me to see the procession—I did not sit up with him on Monday night—it was Sunday night that I sat up with Mrs. Aslin; the Sunday before Thanksgiving Day—it is not true that I went to tea and smoked, and went away late at night—I was confused just now over it—it was on Sunday night, I remember it perfectly well now, it was on Sunday night that I stayed there—I sat up with Mrs. Aslin—there was no one else sat up; there was a woman going out and in—Mr. Aslin went to bed about 12 o'clock and I sat up all night with his wife—there was a sick child in the house; in the same room—the sick child was seventeen or eighteen—his daughter was in the next room—she went to bed some time before her father—I am very intimate with them—I sat up because Aslin had been sitting up for several nights—I could do no good, but death was expected, and in the case of death, I might have been of some use—I was a long way from home, and so I did not go home—my home is in South Crescent, Bedford Square—I did not go there at 9 o'clock in the morning—I went to Queen Street, Cheapside, into the Fleece public-house—I did not sleep at South Crescent the night before—I forget now where I slept—I don't wish to mention where I slept—I did not sleep at my own lodging—I have given 4, South Crescent as my address, and I gave it at the Police</p>

               <p>Court—I will swear that I have slept there during the last twelve months—I was there last week, it is my home and address—it is the only home I have got in London since I was unfortunate in business—my letters are addressed there—I sleep there sometimes, and am always to be found there—I can't remember when I last slept there—I have slept there many times within twelve months, and within six months—I have always got my bed-room when I go there—I have not a room reserved for me—if you wanted me, and sent to 4, South Crescent, I should get the letter—I call or send for my letters; that will find me at any time—it is a very delicate matter to ask me about—when I went there a week ago, they did not tell me that Green, the officer, had been there—Mrs. Fusman is the landlady's name—she said something about a gentleman calling and making inquiries about me; there are so many people call for me—she did not say that she had told the officer that I had not been there for twelve months—that is my address—I had no watch with me when I sat up—there was a clock, and I looked to see what time I should call Mr. Aslin.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> A daughter of Aslin's was ill, and had been for a consider<lb></lb>able time—she was very dangerously ill—Aslin had been up some previous nights with her—I was told so—I was some distance from the place I usually slept at, and I remained up all night.</p>

Miles, Gold &amp; Co.'s employ—I have since been discharged—I entered their service in 1855—Barker was a carman in their employment—on the day he was arrested, the Monday before Thanks-giving Day, he came to the wharf about 7.30, as near as I can say—I got there about 6.30 or 6.40—I saw Barker arrive—I was there before Skipper, the watchman, left—as soon as I got there, I did what was necessary to my own horse, and then I mucked Barker's horse out and fed it, because he was not there—Barker had not arrived when the watchman left—I know Hyams—I have not seen him since he went away—I was in Messrs. Gold's employ<lb></lb>ment seventeen years—I was discharged, as Mr. Druce told me, because I did not see this affair, and I ought to have seen it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was Barker's usual time, about 7.30—I generally used to feed his horse of a morning—I fed him because Barker was not there in time—there was no time-keeper, but the watchman knew that I was there—I don't know that the time was ever booked—I kept my time in a regular way—I fed Barker's horse and mucked him out—it was not part of my duty at all, as far as that goes, but I generally did it—there was no cart there—the cart was usually kept on the wharf, and I believe it was there that morning—I can't say that I saw it—I saw it when I went out with my cart at 8 o'clock—I did not see any cart outside at the loop-hole, and I did not see any cart brought in through the gates—I was in the stable from about 6.30 or 6.40, close to where the gates opened, and I mean positively to swear that no cart came in there at all—Barker came from his</p>

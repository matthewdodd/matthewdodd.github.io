                  </hi>. I am a carman—on 11th August, between 11 and 12 in the day, I was in Pudding-lane, and saw the prisoner and deceased standing up a court—they were both porters about the market—the deceased was trying to get away from the prisoner, and at last he managed to get away—the prisoner kept pushing him as if he wished to keep him back, but Cooper got away, and came out into Pudding-lane, and went towards Thames-street—the prisoner followed him, went across Thames-street, and caught Cooper by the coat, and pushed him—they both fell; Cooper under<lb></lb>most—they got up again, and the prisoner got hold of Cooper by the neck and chest, and threw him on the pavement stones, just by the gateway—the prisoner said nothing at first, but afterwards he said, "You b——; I will be the death of you"—Cooper became insensible—he never spoke or moved till he was lifted up, and then the prisoner went into a public-house, got some cold water, bathed his head, and assisted to get him into a cab——he got into the cab with him, but the policeman took him out again and took him to the station—he had been drinking, but could walk—Cooper was perfectly sober—I knew both of them before—I saw no <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>—Cooper's name was William Samuel.</p>

I am a warehouseman in the employ of Adams and Co., of Pudding-lane—I knew Cooper, and saw him come out of Pudding-lane, and cross Thames-street—there was a horse and cart there, and the pri<lb></lb>soner ran round the horse's head, took hold of Cooper by the breast, ran him backwards about six yards, and he fell on the back part of his head against the kerb——he was obliged to fall by the force he was going backwards—I did not hear anything said in consequence of the rattling of the carts—I ran for assistance, and when I came back they lifted him on to the pave<lb></lb>ment</p>

                  </hi>. On 11th August I was house-surgeon at Guy's hospital—Cooper was brought there about half-past twelve, insensible, and bleeding from a wound at the back of his head—towards night he became partially conscious, and about ten o'clock he appeared conscious—I was called to him, about one o'clock in the morning, as he had become suddenly worse, and he died—I made a post-mortem examination; the only bruise was on the back of his head—I found a very considerable fracture of the skull, from which death was caused by pressure of blood on the brain.</p>

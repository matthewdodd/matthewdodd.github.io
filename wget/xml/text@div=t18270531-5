The prisoner was in my service - she attended to my child. I went out about five minutes before seven o'clock on a Tuesday morning in March - it was before Easter - I left her in the room, with my child, and left the key with her; I returned about eleven o'clock, and could not get into the room; I heard the child crying - I got my landlady's key, and found the child in the room, but the prisoner was gone. I found a box which I had left locked was broken open, and missed a 10l. Bank note, several sovereigns and half-sovereigns, some half-crowns, shillings and sixpences, a cloak, two gowns, a shawl, petticoat, and apron - they were all my husband's property, and I am certain I left them locked in the box - every thing was on the Sunday, when I went to the box, and I kept the key in my possession. I saw my petticoat and one gown at Bow-street. My money was not marked - I know we had altogether 45l. 5s. 6d.</p>

            . I live in Short's-gardens, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields - my husband, whose name is David, rents the house; Coffee and his wife lodge with us. Between seven and eight o'clock on the morning in question I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner come out of the passage into the street - she had a cloak on - it was on a Tuesday morning, but I do not recollect the date; I saw no more of her: Mrs. Coffee came home about eleven o'clock- I lent her some keys; the child was locked in the room, and crying - she complained of missing her property. I did not examine her box.</p>
               <p>JOHN COFFEE. I am the husband of the first witness. I received a 10l. note, about June last, from Mr. Lockey, a hatter, in change for a 20l. note; I gave it to my wife to put by - I saw it in the box several times since - there was 45l. 5s. 6d. in all. I saw all the money safe on the Sunday afternoon, about three o'clock; I took it out of the box and put it in again - it was stolen on Tuesday, the 13th of March - my wife's clothes were also in the box on Sunday.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Police at Cork. I saw the prosecutor at Cork in March last, and on the 21st of March, in the evening, about six o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner at Cork, at her sister's house - her sister delivered a trunk to me - the prisoner saw the trunk; I asked if it was hers - she said it was: she ran into the next room - I left her there in the care of Coffee and a gentleman while I examined the trunk; I found in it a cloak, a shawl, a petticoat, a gown, and a small box inside, containing a 10l. Bank note and seventeen sovereigns, which I have had ever since - I delivered them up before the Magistrate; I put the box and all the property into the trunk, which I corded and sealed - Coffee was present when I examined it. I brought the property to England, and delivered it to Alderson.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I say the money was his? A. She said all the property was his - she did not mention any thing in particular.</p>

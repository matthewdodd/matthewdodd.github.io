            . I am a constable. The prisoner was in my charge; and the next morning I told her Mr. Hill thought the waiter had something to do with it; she said, Yes, he had; he gave her the box, and told her to put it against the window, and he would call for it at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master said, if I would confess who I had taken the property for, or given it to, he would not prosecute me, but kick me out of the house, and discharge me. There is in the box, an apron, a handkerchief, and several things belonging to the waiter who was discharged that morning - he had given me the box to take care of, and was to call for it - mistress said he would never call, and what he had left might be divided among the servants.</p>
               <p>COURT to MRS. HILL. Q. Does any part of this property belong to the waiter? A. Yes, this apron and this handkerchief - there was some tea and sugar left in a caddy, belonging to me, and I said the servants might have it between them; the prisoner came to me as a single woman, but I afterwards found she was married, and has four children; I went into the scullery, and saw her putting the lid on the boiler - I said, "What are you doing?" she said, "Nothing;" I lifted up the lid, and said, "Whose box is this?" she said, "Mine;" I said I would have it opened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was so horror-struck that I did not know what I said; the box is not mine, nor any thing in it - I never saw it till that day, nor ever saw the contents till it was opened in the bar.</p>

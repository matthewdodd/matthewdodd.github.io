                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the deceased, by the Coroner's direction, two days after the death—he was a large, powerful man, nearly six feet high—his body was very much decomposed, and extensively bruised about the shoulders and back—around the scalp of the lower and back part of the head I found a quantity of extravasated blood, and on the surface of the brain a corresponding extra<lb></lb>vasation, and another extravasation between the bone and its membranes—the skull was not fractured—the head was unnaturally loose on the spine, and the ligaments which connect the cranium with the spine had been damaged—the cause of death was pressure on the junotion of the brain and spinal cord, caused by the extravasation of blood and the loosening of the ligaments—falling heavily would have caused the bruises; but, I believe, the injury to the ligaments of the neck was caused by his falling doubled up in some way, or by some one falling on him when he fell in a half sitting posture—a fall which caused the head to be doubled on the body would do it; if the upper man fell with his chest on the deceased's head, that would have caused it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After such a fall at you describe at might have caused death, could the man have had another round, if in an intoxicated state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not; I believe this injury occurred in the last fall, which was distinct—it is impossible for me to say whether it might have occurred in a previous fall—it is possible that he might have received the injury and gone on struggling a little longer, but I think not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not think the injuries to the neck would have caused Incompatibility of fighting afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think they would—a large quantity of blood had poured out, and caused pressure on the brain and its ligaments; that blood would have taken some minutes to flow out, and it is possible that during that time the man may have had another round—it is possible that there might have been some exertion during the slight interval that intervened—the injury I found would cause the death which I found; a slow snoring death, and a gradual cessation of breathing.</p>

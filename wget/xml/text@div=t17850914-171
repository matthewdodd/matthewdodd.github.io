               <p>The prisoner lodged in the same house with me, I had not seen her for a year and an half, I lost the things in the indictment the 2d of September, 1783; the shirts belonged to a gentleman's servant, I had them to wash; I found the prisoner out, and went up to her lodging; I found nothing but one handkerchief that was on her neck, which I can swear to by an iron-mould; I asked her what she had done with my clothes; and she fell down on her knees, and said she had sold my clothes the corner of John street, to some Jews; I said I should be happy to get my things again; I made her no other promise; she said she was drunk or mad when she sold them, and sold them for nine shillings.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner in her room, I went with the prosecutor, I asked her which was the prisoner, as there was another person in the room, the prisoner said I am the unfortunate person; I made her no offer or promise, and I asked her what she had done with the clothes of Mrs. Montcrief's; and she instantly replied, she had sold them in the street to a Jew or Jews; she begged very hard not to go to the watch-house; and Mrs. Montcrief said, if she would promise to be found on Monday she would not take her; I saw her afterwards before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Montcrief. She promised to walk with me, and she did, and I gave her a breakfast, and kept her till Monday.</p>

               <p>I am innocent, the prosecutrix came to me and asked me to breakfast, and she brought a common girl, a lodger of hers, a prostitute, and she told me of her loss: I had not seen her since the 7th of May: as for handkerchiefs, I have no more than this that I borrowed of a young woman.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. Did anything pass about a handkerchief? - I do not recollect, I was a very little while in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She is a very bad kind of woman, she has been saying in the Old Bailey yard now, that all she wished was to take away my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Do you live with your husband? - I have lived with him ten years.</p>

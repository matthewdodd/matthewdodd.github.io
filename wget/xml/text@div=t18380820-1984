                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Greening, who is a writer, and live in William-street, James-street, Westminster-about half-past eight o'clock on the night of the 7th of August I was in Birdcage-walk, and met the prisoner—he used indecent language—I told him he was mis<lb></lb>taken in the person, and told him to go on—he still accosted me, and I turned round to go back to his guard-room to complain of him, when he snatched my umbrella from my hand, and ran off—he took it by force—I could not resist, he took it so suddenly—I told a young man who stood by to run after him, which he did, and called "Stop thief!" and the policeman took him—this is my umbrella—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Leicester-place. I was in Birdcage-walk, and saw a soldier and a female standing there—I had not gone many yards before the female called out that the soldier had taken her umbrella, and was going away with it, and asked me to go and get it from him—he was walking away with it—I called to him, and he com<lb></lb>menced running—I called "Stop thief"—the policeman asked what was the matter—I said he had taken an umbrella, and he pursued him—he was little in liquor I think—it was the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" and went up to Birch, who told me that the soldier had run away with the umbrella—I went after him, and overtook him in Cartwright-street—I asked him who the umbrella belonged to—he put his back against the rails, and tried to drop it down the railings—I took it up, and took him back to the prosecutrix—I asked if it belonged to her, and she said "Yet"—he said he had taken it for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>.</p>

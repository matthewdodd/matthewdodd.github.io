                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Barber, a boiler maker, who occupies rooms at 4, Cahir-street—Mr. Cannon is the landlord—I know Patrick Smith—he lives at England Cottages—I also know Mr. and Mrs. McGeehan, who live in Kingsbridge-place—they are in the same line of business as my husband—on Saturday evening, 3d December, Patrick Smith and my husband and I, went to Mrs. McGeehan's—it' was nearly 12 o'clock when we got there—we stopped there about half an hour—there was a person named Connolly there—Smith and my husband and myself walked home together as far as the corner of England Cottages, where there is a pillar post letter-box—when we got to that corner we stopped walking to bid good-night; and while doing so, I saw two policemen on the opposite side of the road—one of them crossed the road—that was Aaron Clares—he pushed Smith in the neck, and asked him what he was doing at that hour of the night—he gave him a good push—my husband said, "If you were doing your duty you would not do that"—Claret then turned and struck my husband on the mouth—the other policeman, the prisoner, then walked across the street with his baton in his hand—I then said to my husband, "James, run"—the prisoner might be then about a yard from him, or less,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501110078"></xptr>
               <p>and Smith was nearer to him than I was—on my saying, "James, run," the prisoner said, "I will do for you," and struck me on the temple with his baton—I said that I was killed—I should have fallen, but for Smith—I told my husband again to run or they would kill him—he was running backwards towards Cahir-street, keeping the police off him—they were following him—he might hate run backwards three or four yards—he then turned and ran—the two policemen followed him up, and I went up after him to Cahir-street—the policemen were standing at the corner of Cahir-street when I got up—I heard them say, "She is coming; watch where she goes, and we will find the Irish b,----"so I went past my own street, and went against the Great Eastern public-house, but they would follow me—I was then getting weak, and turned back to my own street, they still following me—I went down Cahir-street to No. 4, and the two policemen were close upon me when I went in at my own door—my husband was at home then—there was some conversation in the passage with Mr. Cannon, the landlord, and I saw my husband leave the house for a doctor as soon as I went in—I saw nothing in my husband's hand—he went out—I think the door was on the jar—I went to the door some minutes afterwards and saw the two policemen attack him again—they had their batons in their hands—I ran out crying for him to run, and Mrs. Reid came to me in the middle of the street, and asked me what was the <hi rend="italic">to do—she</hi> took me in again, and Mr. and Mrs. Reid took me to Mrs. McGeehan's as soon as Mrs. Reid had her bonnet and things on—we left the house together in about ten minutes—when we got to Mrs. McGeehan's my husband was there—I did not see his watch at that time—I then went in a cab to Poplar Hospital—my husband went with me, and was in my sight—they washed my head there and shaved the hair off the cut—they went to put strapping on it, but it would not stick—it had stopped bleeding when I went there, but it began to bleed again—Mr. Serjeant dressed it on the Sunday morning—that was the first time it was dressed—he told me to go to bed, and I did so at Mrs. McGeehan's—I believe I was in bed a week; some days—it might be four days before I went out of doors, I went to the Thames Police-court—I cannot say on what day—I do not think I had been out of doors between the Sunday when I went to Dr. Serjeant's and when I went to the Thames Police-court—the shawl and apron which Mrs. McGeehan has are mine—I had them on on this night—I had not been drinking at all, nor had my husband, or Patrick Smith—they were sober—I received no violence that night, except from the defendant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William McGeehan, a boiler<lb></lb>maker, of Kingsbridge-place—I know Barber and his wife, and Smith—on Saturday night, 3d December, I saw Mr. and Mrs. Barber in their own house, between half-past 11 and 12—I went there close upon that time, my husband was with me there, ho came in with Mr. Barber—we all went together to my house, my husband, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Mr. and Mrs. Barber, they stopped at my house till I took the candle, and told them it was twenty-five minutes past 12, and in a minute or two they went away—about 1 o'clock, a few minutes before or after, I was sitting in the kitchen, my husband opened the door, and Mr. Barber came into the kitchen to me—he bad a walking-stick in his hand—he showed me his watch, and his hand where he had received a blow—I went out afterwards, and met Mrs. Barber and Mrs. Reid, who arrived soon afterwards—Mrs. Barber was bleeding very much, here is her apron and shawl; the blood was dripping from her in my passage as she came in, and along the kitchen floor—I was going to fetch a cab, but I waited a few minutes; I was afraid I should meet with the same assault, and I sent my boy for a cab—my husband went in it, and Mr. and Mrs. Barber, and I am not sure whether there was not a young man who lodged in the house—we went to Poplar Hospital, and returned together to my house—I put Mrs. Barber to bed, and, I believe, Mr. Barber left next day between 12 and I—before he went away, I had been to Dr. Serjeant—Mr. Debenham attended her next day—I afterwards went to Mr. Charles Young, the solicitor—next day, Tuesday, I saw a gentleman from Mr. Morgan's office—Mrs. Barber went out on the Tuesday week afterwards—I know Clares and Brown—the prisoner gave me his number the night previously—I had seen him the night before, and he is a very insulting fellow—I knew their numbers, I did not know their names, and I was told to go to the station and ascertain—after I had been to the inspector I knew their names—I saw them on that Saturday night, both standing together between the pillar letter-box and the Vulcan public-house, nearer to the Vulcan, but the Vulcan is on the opposite side to the pillar-box—it was then close upon 12 o'clock.</p>

I have been in the police nearly twenty-two years and inspector over eleven years—Clares came to my office at the station at a little after three in the morning, and in consequence of his information I went to 4, Cahir-street with Somers, Edwin Cleave, and the other witnesses—we found Mrs. Reid there—I immediately asked for Barber, and she said that he was not at home—I went into the passage and said, "What is this blood doing here?"—it was just outside the parlour door—she said that Barber and his wife had been fighting—I am sure those were her words—she did not make a word of complaint at that time of any assault by a constable on Mr. Barber—with that information I left and posted two men not to leave the house during the night, but to apprehend Barber—on complaint being made to me of an assault on the police, I im<lb></lb>mediately take the complaint down or tell them to write to the Commis<lb></lb>sioners—I took down what Clares told me on this occasion, and made a report to the superintendent—the usual course is to go to the inspector and make a report—I made a report to that effect to the Commissioner—I ap<lb></lb>plied to the Commissioner for a warrant, as we could not apprehend Barber—that application caused delay, and at the moment the constable was able to attend the police-court I directed him to go there—the usual course was adopted on this occasion, the Magistrate declined to issue a warrant but granted a summons, and at the end of the time they returned it, but there was no person there, I then applied to the Magistrate for a warrant; that was about ten days afterwards—it was obtained then—Brown was very weak, before he could apply to the Magistrate I had to wait for the surgeon to certify that he was fit—I have known him some years in the police, and ten months in Poplar—he bears an excellent good character in the force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you present when Mrs. Barber applied for a sum<lb></lb>mons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know that when a summons is applied for against the police the Magistrate requires a letter to be written to Sir Richard Mayne, but I dare say he did in this case—I do not know that Barber ap<lb></lb>plied personally, I only know what passed by hearsay—I saw him come to the examination before the Magistrate on the 29th, when the case was sent to the Sessions—he was examined before Clares, I made an application to the Magistrate about that, but the Magistrate overruled my suggestion—the men on duty are visited during the night—Mrs. McGeehan came on 8th December for the names of the policemen on duty—she did not apply to me but to the sergeant, and I ordered him to give the names and addresses to her at once.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K.</hi> 372). I have been in the police nearly nine years, and have been acting-sergeant for the last two years—there is a difference in the pay of a sergeant and an acting-sergeant—I went with In<lb></lb>spector Allison to 4, Cahir-street—we got there between half-past three and a</p>

               <p>quarter to four—going round Brown's beat that morning I missed him—I met No. 257 coming from the station, and then sent for my inspector, and went with him to 4, Cahir-street—I saw Mrs. Reid there—the inspector asked her if Barber was there, she said that he lodged there, but was not there then—I saw some blood in the passage leading from the street door to the door of the room that Barber occupies—the inspector asked Mrs. Reid how the blood came there, did Brown go there?—she said "No, Barber and his wife have been fighting"—she made no charge at that time against the police for injuring Mrs. Barber, not a word—I have done duty with the prisoner three years—he is a quiet, inoffensive man, and a man who I could always trust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the inspector ask whether Brown had been in there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when he saw the blood—I went straight to 4, Cahir-street, but no other house in Cahir-street—Clares told me to go there—I was not in Court when this case was inquired into before the Magistrate—I was not examined before the Magistrate—Mr. Cannon was present and two or three other people belonging to the house—I told the inspector the same morning that Barber and his wife had been fighting, and he said, "Well, I heard the same thing said"—I have never mentioned it from that time up to the present hour—I do not know that the inspector was present before the Magistrate.</p>

On the morning of 4th December I was on duty at Millwall, and Inspector Allison came and took me to Cahir-street with him—I saw some blood in the passage, the inspector wanted to know how it came there, and Mrs. Reid said that Mr. Barber and his wife had been fighting—I remained there till seven o'clock in the morning, to see whether Mr. Barber came back, and to apprehend him if he did—I went there again on Monday morning at two o'clock—I saw Sarah Reid and inquired for Barber—I waited there and he did not come back—Mrs. Barber made no complaint that night of any assault being committed on her by the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon to the police, and have the care of the K division—on 4th December, about four in the morning I saw Brown—he complained of an injury he had received, in fact I could see it plainly, for he was covered with blood—I examined him; he had two lacerated wounds on the side of his head, one two inches and a half long, and the other three inches—in my opinion one blow of a poker would produce both these wounds, but one blow of a stick would not unless the stick was irregular—I believe if a poker was wild violence struck on his head it would produce such a wound as I saw.</p>

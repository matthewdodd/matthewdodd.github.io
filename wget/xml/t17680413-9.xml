            . On the 29th of March, which was on the Tuesday, I left a bag on the table below stairs, in which were five louis d'ors; another servant of mine carried it up into my room, and put it into my breeches pocket; after which, when I came to take my money out on the Thursday I found but three.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Panchau. He was my <rs id="t17680413-9-deflabel51" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. What country man is he?</p>
               <p>Panchau. I believe he is a <rs id="t17680413-9-deflabel52" type="occupation">Dutchman</rs>

               <p>Q. How long had he been your servant?</p>
               <p>Panchau. At different times he has served me six or eight months; he does not live with me, I am often backwards and forwards abroad.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Panchau; I know he had five louis d'ors in his bag; I carried the bag up stairs, and put it in my master's pocket, and on the Thursday following there were but three; we had a suspicion of the prisoner, on the account of his going to change one at a public-house, as the publican told me; after he was taken up, I heard him say he took my master's money, and that he was in liquor when he did it; and he added, he was a lost man, for he had robbed him. On the Wednesday night before, I lent him 2 s. he saying he had no money; and on the Thursday morning a hatter brought a hat home for me, and the prisoner lent me 3 s.</p>

               <p>That 3 s. that I lent him, I received that very day of a Frenchman that my wife washed for; as for the louis d'or, I do not deny that I offered Mr. Turner's wife that for her to change; I had served a gentleman that belongs to Prince Charles of Lorrain; he came over here to buy horses, he gave it me.</p>

Upon Evidence it appeared, that the Prisoner kept a Garden in the Parish of Stepney, in the Hamlet of Bednal-green, and that the Deceased came to Rob his Orchard, and the Gardener shot his Gun off in the dark, and kill'd him. Some Neighbours that heard the Noise of the Gun, went to see what was the matter, and found the said Abraham Knight lying dead under the Tree, with his Pockets full of Apples. The Gardener, upon his Defence, proved by Witnesses, that his Orchard had oftentimes been Robbed, and the Night before by three Soldiers, having sustained great Losses before; That the Gun was but a Birding-piece, and that he called out, Who is there? No body answering him, the Piece went off accidentally, and that he had been threatned to be kill'd by several Thieves before.

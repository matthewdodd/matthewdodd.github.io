                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Johnson, an auc<lb></lb>tioneer, who lives in Gracechurch-street. On the 19th of Nov. I missed a double-barrelled gun from his plate-room—this is the gun—I had seen the prisoner there on different occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons pledged that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell—from 150 to 200—I cannot tell who was the person who pledged before the person who pawned this gun, nor the person after—the person who pawned it took the ticket for it, and went away—that was all the time I had of seeing him—I do not know all the persons who come to pawn, but if any person pledged a thing that was stolen, I might by con<lb></lb>fronting the party, know them—on the morning but one afterwards, a po<lb></lb>liceman came to me about this—I saw the prisoner again on the Saturday week after the gun was pawned—he was not pointed out to me as the person who was taken into custody on suspicion of stealing the gun—I was taken to a yard at Clerkenwell prison—a number of persons were turned out, and I selected him amongst all the number—I did not notice his dress, I noticed his features—I have no interest in his conviction—if he is convicted I shall lose my pledge.</p>

            . I am a constable of Uxbridge. I took the prisoners about three hundred yards from Mr. Prior's shop. I met Mr. Prior in the street, he told me that he had been robbed of a pair of high shoes; he described the men, I took them by that description. I searched them, I found a pair of high shoes in Rawbone's pocket; Rawbone said he bought them; Mr. Prior claimed them in the prisoner's presence.</p>

               <p>Rawbone said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Grainge's Defence. I am a soldier, I was recruiting in the town. I met the prisoner in the afternoon, he is a stranger to me. In the course of the evening he told me he was going to buy a pair of shoes; he went to Mr. Prior's shop; he tried a great many pair on; I did not know that he had a pair of shoes about him.</p>

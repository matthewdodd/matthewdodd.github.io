               <p>"form of law, shall be adjudged justly of</p>
               <p>"death". The crime is to personate a real proprietor of stock, by way of transferring, or endeavouring to transfer it.</p>
               <p>It is necessary that the Bank should take up prosecutions of this kind, who are the guardians of our property, and if the facts are proved to your satisfaction, you will then pronounce the prisoner guilty: Those facts I shall shortly mention to you not by way of directing your judgment, but of guiding it towards them.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say in my defence; I wish to ask Mr. Hatwell another question: Did you say you would do such a thing again any time, as to fell the stock and not know the person you sold it to?</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know that is any way material at all.</p>
               <p>Hatwell. That I should presume, my Lord, is rather irrelative to the matter in question, but as to that, I made no declaration of that kind.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You see the charge against you, is for personating Mr. Eaton, and selling this stock, and receiving the money, now whether he said he would do it for any other person or not, has nothing to do with the case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is very strange that the person who transferred the stock cannot remember me as well as the broker.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Can you give any account how you came by this money that was found in your possession, that will be very material for you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the money of my friends, and a particular person in the town that was left to conduct my cause, has not got my witnesses as he ought; I have witnesses to my character.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Eaton. What has been the prisoner's general character? - He was a very good young man, he was very much in my favour, he was very industrious, he attempted to marry a relation of mine, and I said to her, you cannot do better than have him, as you want to have a baker, for he seems a very industrious young man, and not above carrying the basket.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, in the first place there can be little doubt but that the crime has been committed, and that this sum has been transferred by some person personating Mr. Eaton; then it will remain for your consideration only, whether or no there is sufficient evidence to affect the prisoner, and to satisfy you in your minds that he is the person guilty. Mr. Hatwell the broker, swears expressly to him; and it was necessary that he should take particular notice of his person, because he was to witness the transfer himself after it was made, and because in case of a forgery, he was the person to whom the Bank or the party injured were to resort; and you find gentlemen, Mr. Hatwell did not immediately go and make a transfer, but he had a conversation with the prisoner first; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140073"></xptr> asked him, who recommended him, and did not undertake to make the transfer, till he mentioned the names of one or two persons that he knew: now Harvell has been cautioned over and over again, and he swears expressly and positively that the prisoner at the bar was the man; but added to this you find that a five hundred pounds note a few days afterwards, had been changed at the Bank for a three hundred pounds and four fifty pounds, and that

             the person with whom the prisoner lodged, was the depository of those notes for the prisoner, by his desire; that she afterwards returned those notes to the prisoner, and after he was apprehended, this three hundred pounds note, and these four fifty pounds notes were found in his coat pocket, in his trunk in his lodgings, by Mr. Acton, the solicitor to the Bank; they were in his possession, and they perfectly correspond with those notes changed by Field for that five hundred pounds note; now it would be very material for a person in his way of life, who was an apprentice to a baker, and who never appeared to be a master, to shew how he came by the money: but the prisoner has not shewn us that; the prisoner says, by way of observation and defence; that Trotter, the clerk, who attested the transfer did not recollect him again, and he thinks it very strange that Trotter should not recollect him as well as the broker; but you observe these two men were in very different situations indeed; Hatwell was the person to be responsible, it behoved him therefore to know the person again; whereas it was no business of Trotter's at all, he depended, as he tells you, on Hatwell; and it is not wonderful that a man that does not take notice of another should not recollect him again: upon the whole, therefore, gentlemen, if the case be clearly and satisfactorily made out to your judgment, I am afraid good character cannot avail, because it too frequently happens in this place, that men who commit very bad crimes indeed have had a good character; but if you think the case any way doubtful, if the positive testimony of Hatwell, corroborated by the circumstances of these notes being found in the custody and possession of the prisoner, do not carry sufficient conviction to your minds that the prisoner is guilty of this charge, you will in that case acquit him.</p>

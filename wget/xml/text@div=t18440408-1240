                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of the "Magnet" newspaper, in the Strand. The prisoner was in my employ in March, and had been two or three years, as clerk and publisher of my newspaper—it was part of his duty to receive money when persons came for newspapers—when he received money from the agents it was his duty to enter it in the daily cash-book, which I have here—it was his duty to pay me every day as I might require it—I do not find any entry of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Brooks, of Warwick-square, on the 21st of March—if he has received that money he has not paid it to me or accounted for it, except stating in a memorandum that he had received these monies, and had not accounted for them—that memorandum he sent on Saturday, the 22nd—I do not find any entries on the 22nd of March for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Woodward, or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Thomas—the prisoner has paid no such sum or accounted for them, except as I have stated—he left on Friday, the 22nd, and had no opportunity of making any entries afterwards—I desired him to make up his account, and I would have nothing more to do with him as a servant—I took his money away, and had some strong suspicion</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospi<lb></lb>tal, when the prosecutrix was brought there, between 10 and 11 o'clock on this Saturday night. She had two slight wounds on the scalp, one in front, the other behind; the bleeding had then stopped—the wound in front was about three quarters of an inch in length, rather jagged; the one behind was an inch and a quarter in length—they were dressed under my superinten<lb></lb>dence, and she went away again that same night—they were not serious wounds—she might have been insensible from loss of blood—I saw her again on the Monday, and I then took her into the hospital in obedience to the Magistrate's request—she complained of pain in the stomach, and of having spat blood—I admitted her from that reason, not on account of the wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general salesman, of High-street, Sydenham. The prisoner was in my service three months—my premises have been lately rebuilt, during which the stock was taken to my brother-in-law's opposite, and was brought back when the premises were rebuilt, the prisoner being em<lb></lb>ployed to help in wheeling them on a barrow—the last time he was so employed was 1st May—I had a stable there, some distance from my premises—I went there on Sunday 2nd May, about half-past 8 o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoner crossing the yard, going in the direction of the stable—he had on a cloth coat which I recognized as similar to some I had in stock, and a waistcoat which I had worn several months—I told him I wanted the horse got to—I then made inquiries and gave him in charge—I said I believed the clothes he had on belonged to me—he said he bought them in Petticoat-lane, and I was mistaken—I told the policeman that if the prisoner's boots</p>

                  </hi>. I was a policeman at this time, and received the prisoner in charge—he was wearing this coat, trowsers, waistcoat, and boots, I found this handkerchief in his pocket—he said he bought the coat in Petticoat-lane, for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the waistcoat he had picked out of a basket of rubbish, belonging to Mr. Adams—that he had had the cloth the trowsers were made of three years, and his sister made them up—here is a mark where a ticket has been torn off—I produce two waistcoats besides.</p>

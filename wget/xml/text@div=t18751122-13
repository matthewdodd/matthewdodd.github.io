                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Royal William public-house, Essex Road—from about 11 o'clock to 11.30 on the night of the 21st October the prisoner was at my house, and tendered a bad shilling in pay<lb></lb>ment for some rum; I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and afterwards he had some more rum, for which he also tendered a bad shilling—while I went out of the bar to call the barman, who was asleep, prisoner went away—he tendered me a third shilling which I took to be bad and I did not give him the change; but about ten minutes afterwards he demanded the shilling or the change—I followed him into the street, and he was ulti<lb></lb>mately given into custody—I marked the two shillings and took them with me to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know whether the prisoner had the third shilling, but I gave it to a customer to inspect and did not receive it back—prisoner struck me, and put the shilling into his month just as he did so—he did not test it and say it was good—I did say at the police court "The third shilling had been taken from my hand and the prisoner has put it into his mouth"—I marked a shilling which I thought was the third, but which I afterwards found was good—I heard the prisoner say "I did not know that they were bad, but if so I must have taken them on the racecourse."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was paid in coppers when I served some other customers—I am quite sure I did not give the shilling back to the prisoner—these I identify as the ones I handed to the police-constable—the third shilling was taken from prisoner's pocket—the one I marked, thinking it was bad.</p>

            . I am a constable, I was sent for on this occasion; when the Mayor committed Thomas, he put him under my care; when we had taken him out of the room, I believe I said to him, it will be better for him if he would confess; then he said, Lord have mercy upon me, I am a poor unhappy creature, that man that is committed by the name of Barton is my own brother; I had a wife, and she is dead, I have two small children, and grow poorer and poorer, and I have been urged on to do this; then I carried him back to the Mayor again.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were before the Mayor were there any promises or threats made use of to him?</p>
               <p>Osbourn. I went in and told the Mayor of it, then I brought him in, and he made his confession immediately.</p>

               <p>I told Mr. Mayor that my uncle had left it me; he told me if I came by it dishonestly I had better tell him; I told him I came by it very honestly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070059"></xptr> that was not so, it was not left by my uncle; I had been up to London, and I found it in the main road upon Blackheath, about seven days before I came to Maidstone; I thought if I had it cried, somebody might own it, that had no more right to it than I; I carried it to Mr. Harris's to sell, and as they were strangers to me, I thought if I told them I found it they would stop it, and have it advertised, and so I have no recompence for finding it; my brother never saw me find it.</p>

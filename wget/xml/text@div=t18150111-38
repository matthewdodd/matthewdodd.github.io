On Saturday the 17th of September I went to her, at Mrs. Bloomfielda, I saw the prisoner mangling, I asked her for the things of mine that she had a week or ten days before; she said, they were wet and dirty, and not washed; I said she had had them a considerable time I would rather take them with me; she went back again into the house directly, she then came to me again, said she had received a twenty pound note of a lady that had come from her husband in the country, that her husband had left to him a considerable property, that her husband's father was dead, her husband had sent her up a twenty pound note by a lady that lived in Gough square; she then went to the Birmingham coach at the swan and two necks; I saw her go off.</p>

            . I am chief constable in Birmingham, I was so in September last. On the 18th of September, in consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner; I first said to her you have robbed Mr. Bloomfield of a twenty pound note, in Gilt-spur-street, London; she made no reply; she put her hand into her bosom and pulled out seven one pound bank notes, she said these are all I have got left of it; she said she had changed it in London, I do not recollect she said at what place. I then asked her how she accompted for the difference there was thirteen pounds deficient; I searched her pockets, in her pockets there were eighteen shillings that I gave her back again; I asked her again what she had done with the remainder; she said she had paid three pounds at the swan and two necks Lad-lane for herself and child, and she had paid two pounds more at the coach office Birmingham, to carry her down to Warwick; and she said on coming down from London she had supped, and had given a five pound note instead of a one which she had not discovered untill afterwards; and she had bought some things amounting in the whole to seventeen pounds, she accompted for the whole, with the seven pound I had got; to the amount of seventeen pounds; I told her I had got a warrant to detain her, she wished to go to her husband in Lancashire, no doubt she said her husband would advance the money and the prosecutor would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the money nor touched it, the money I had was my own property I had it gave me, I thought it was a one pound note when I came to look at it, it was a twenty pound note.</p>

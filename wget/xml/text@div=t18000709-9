             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 30th of May, about the hour of ten at night, I, in company with Haynes and Holebrook, and Cook, were coming down Lemon-street, Whitechapel, and as the prisoner passed us, I saw he had something under his coat; I immediately took hold of him, and found it was a tea-kettle; I afterwards went to the prosecutor's house, I think on the Monday following, and he claimed it, (produces the kettle;) Lemon-street is about five or six hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Boddy. I am sure this is the same kettle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went up the alley to case myself, and I saw the spout sticking out from some straw, I looked and found it was a tea-kettle.</p>

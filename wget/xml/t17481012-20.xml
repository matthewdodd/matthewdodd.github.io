               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. I live with my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a housekeeper or a lodger?</p>
               <p>Mawhood . He lodges in Mr. Bedell's house, and this woman took the money out of a chest of drawers in

               <p>Q. Was the chest of drawers locked?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. Yes; for I put the money in that very morning, for I had been to receive a little prize money.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out then?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. I went to Tower Hill to receive some prize money, and I went to put more money in, and I missed my money that I had put in before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chest of drawers open when you came back?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. No, it was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you recovered any of your money again?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. The prisoner returned me 14 guineas again, and said it was the first fact, and hoped I would be favourable to her, and she said she was very sorry for what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with her?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. Between ten and elaven o'clock at night, coming from Goodmans Fields Wells .</p>
               <p>Q. Was she c oming back to the house?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. No, she would not come back to that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge there?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise to be favourable to her?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. I told her if she returned me what she took, I would be favourable to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you what she had done with the money?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. She said she could not tell what she had done with it, only what money she had laid out in clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the room locked?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. Yes; but the key hung upon a nail by the room door, for my father was gone out, and the key of the chest of drawers was in a lower drawer, which was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner lodge in the house before that?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. About a fortnight or three weeks I believe, I had not been there above a month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That night he lay with me, and he told me where the key of the chest of drawers was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lie with her?</p>
               <p>Mawhood. I never lay with her in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did indeed, and please you my lord.</p>

I know nothing of the fact; only I saw the fourteen guineas told to the prosecutor out of the corner of a handkerchief, and she said she took it, and that she was very sorry for what she had done, but she denied it at first; and she said she would give him the clothes, and all the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she charged with it then?</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman. The prisoner occupies the house, No. 25, Vinegar-lane—I lodged with her for five weeks—I gave her notice to quit three times, and on Thursday the 27th of May, I was going—I went out the first thing in the morning, and when I returned, she called me most dreadful names, and said she would have her revenge before I left her house—we went out together—the prisoner wished Thodie to go out with her to have a drop of porter, and wished me to drink with them, and make it up, and say nothing more about it—I said no, I would not drink with a person who had threatened my life as she had done—they had a pot of porter between them, and I had half-a-pint to myself, because I would not drink out of the same pot—I went home, and was having a mackarel and a pair of soles for tea, and while at tea, she called me down stairs, and said she wished to speak to me parti<lb></lb>cularly, and to take a pinch of snuff with me—when I entered her room she had a poker concealed under her apron, and struck me on the head with it—I do not recollect any thing further till the doctor came—I lost my recollection—I cannot say how soon the doctor came—my clothes were very much stained with blood—I cannot say whether I fell with the blow—I recollect nothing after the blow.</p>

Green went over the water to see her sister—I came home after one o'clock—when she came home, she and the prisoner had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and she said she would have no piece of work with her, she intended to leave her—the prisoner said she would be revenged of her before she did leave—she <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with a knife, and pointed it at her—I took the knife from her, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it down on the floor—we made it up then, and I said, "Come, Sarah, let us have no words, let us make it up," but she would not—we went to a public-house, and Green had some beer to herself—we went home—I went out to get a halfpennyworth of vinegar, as we had some fish with our tea—when I came back, I looked through</p>

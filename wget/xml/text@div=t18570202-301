                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop at Hillingdon. On Saturday night, 15th Jan., I fastened up my house about a quarter past 11 o'clock—there is a cellar flap on the path, which was fast—it had not been opened for more than a week—there was a cask of beer in the cellar—I was called up between four and 5 o'clock by a policeman, went into the cellar from the house, and found the flap broken open—it had been fastened with a bolt across underneath—it had been wrenched up, so that the bolt slipped away when they pulled—the vent peg had been taken out of the head of the cask, and the beer was left running—the policeman found a large stick in the cellar, which was not there the night before—there is a back window there, and the putty had been cut out of one of the squares, but the glass was not removed—they had wasted nine or ten gallons of beer.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 212). I am stationed at Hillingdon. On Sunday morning, 18th Jan, about a quarter past three o'clock, I saw the prisoners together ten or twelve yards from the prosecutor's house—Andrews, who was with me, went round one way and I the other, and we then saw Stringer walking away from the cellar flap, close to it—it was then about half past three—he walked away before I got up to him, and passed me—I did not know then that he had done anything—I went to the cellar flap, and heard a noise—I went down, Andrews followed me, and I found Madigan concealing himself in a corner of the cellar—I asked him what he was doing there—he did not answer me, and I handed him up to Andrews—I found this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the cellar—I then went in search of Stringer, found him, and took him into custody; his cap was all over cob<lb></lb>webs—I said that I wanted him for breaking into Stone's house with another man—he said that he knew nothing at all about it, or about the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Madigan.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 16). I was with Sudbury, and saw the prisoners about a quarter to three o'clock, standing together about twenty yards from Mr. Stone's—we searched them and found nothing—I have heard the account that Sudbury has given, it is correct—I took Madigan in the cellar, and Sudbury went after Stringer—as I was going with Madigan, he said, that if it had not been for his fool of a mate, he should not have been there at all, for he wanted to go to a gentleman's house in the country, where they would have had a good haul—he also said, "If we had not for<lb></lb>gotten some lucifers, we should have had the crib turned over before you came up"—he also said that if the landlord had come down, he would have quieted him with this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), pulling it out of his pocket—I took it from his hand; and he said, "If you had handled me roughly I should have put it into you; I would as leave be hung out of the way as I would live; we had to pull up some sweet turnips out of the road; me and my mate had some beer, but we could not very well get it; we were obliged to get it out of the peg, but if we had had a pot we could have drank it—I found nothing on him, but he said that he was a ticket of leave man—I asked him to show me his ticket, and he pulled it out of his pocket and gave it to me—(<hi rend="italic">This being produced, was for a military offence, striking his superior officer, and was dated 31st July</hi>, 1856.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Madigan. Q.</hi> Was not I handed up to you from the cellar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went down; it is about four feet deep, it is not seven feet ten—I had my lamp alight—you were stooping in the corner, trying to conceal yourself, and I took yon by your collar—I did not see the beer running, nor did I see you drinking any—you used no violence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Stringer. Q.</hi> Did you not go one way and the other policeman the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We lost sight of you, and I went to see whether you were going down the road or not—I got over a hedge, and then came round, and saw you go away from Mr. Stone's door—you did not pass me, and I did not take you then, as you had got too far, and I heard somebody in the cellar.</p>

               <p>there was an entrance, I went down, and was asleep for about half an hour, but did no damage; when the policeman found that he could not make a crime out of it, he very likely took the plug out, for he said, "Now I will make a crime of you, and make a little money of it; I think I can make up a story as well as any policeman can;" the two policemen went down and drank their bellies full, and then passed off their crime on us two old soldiers; I have been wounded, and have got a medal.</p>

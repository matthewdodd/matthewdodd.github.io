               <p>Q. Did you know them before. - A. Row had used my house about four or five days, he worked for a livery stable over the way, they called for a pot of porter and sat down in one of the boxes to drink it, Row came to me in the passage, he said here is a man owes me ten pounds, he has got a twenty pound note, and if I cannot give him change now perhaps I may never get it. If you will give me change, or let me have ten pounds till I get the note, you shall have the note and give me the difference when you can, I immediately replied if it was a good note I thought I could give him change, he then returned to the prisoner Jones, and in about a minute or two he came again, he said here is a comical joke, he will not part with the twenty-pound note until he has got the ten, in the mean time Jones came to the bar to my wife with the false note so as to shew the word twenty, it was doubled up in four parts, here, said he, you need not be afraid, you see it is a twenty pound Bank note, I saw the note, and heard him say it, I said this is a comical piece of business, but I shall be sorry for the man to loose the money for the want of ten pound, I went up stairs and brought a ten-pound note down, I held my hand on the table with the note, I said here is my ten-pound note, where is your twenty, the note was snatched out of my hand by Row, Jones immediately took it from him, Jones doubled up the note, put it in his pocket; he threw down the false note; here, said he, is the note, it is not worth two pence, that fellow has swindled me of ten pound, and I have got it again, I do not care a d - n.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover the note. - A. One of the Marlborough Street officers searched Jones and took it from him. I never parted with the note, it was snatch-out of my hand.</p>
               <p>CROKER. I am an officer. I searched Jones, I found that ten pound note upon him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my note.</p>
               <p>Row said nothing in his defence</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. John Row asked me to give him ten pound on a note, I gave him nine pound and one pound the next day, but I should not have done it if I had not thought it a twenty pound note. On Row I demanded ten pound, the prosecutor lent him ten pound, upon getting that I returned him the twenty pound note again. Had not the prosecutor been warm I should have given him the note again, although I should be a loser.</p>

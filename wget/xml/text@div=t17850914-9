               <p>I am shopman to the prosecutor, the prisoner at the bar came into Mr. Atkinson's shop, July the 15th, in the dusk of the evening, he desired to look at some black silk handkerchiefs, he went to the other end of the shop, and he agreed for a handkerchief, he left me sixpence, and was to call again, he walked down the shop, I walked behind him, and something under his coat appeared rather bulkey, I went to Mr. Atkinson, and mentioned it to him I went after the prisoner, I pursued him about fifteen yards, and brought him back, and desired him to enter the shop, and as soon as he came back, the piece of print dropped from under his coat in the shop, as soon as he entered.</p>

               <p>Where had it laid before he took it? - I cannot say, we were very busy that day.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take it at all? - No, not at all, I had no suspicion of him till I saw it bulkey under his coat.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to buy a black handkerchief, I said, I would call in about ten minutes, I was going out, and the gentleman came and patted me over the shoulder, then he asked me for the money for the handkerchief, I saw a friend that gave me three shillings, and I paid him for the handkerchief; I did not think my trial would have come on, I have nobody to my character.</p>

The handkerchief pawned at Button's is ours. Here are three shirts and a shift pawned at Croft's. The two gowns pawned at Mills's are also ours.

            'S Defence. It is customary for me to get up about 4 o'clock in the morning, and as I was going to Battle-bridge, about half-way down Gray's-Inn-lane, a person stopped me, and asked if I wanted to buy any shirts. I asked to see them. He showed me four, and wanted 10 s. for them. He put some more things out of his bundle - petticoats and other things. I said they were of no use to me; he then said he would sell me the whole bundle for 2 l. I said I had but 30 s. I bought them of him for that. I was in bed on the night of the robbery.</p>

            , and while there these two men came in, and asked me to pawn the things. I asked if they were their own? They said Yes; and I took and pawned them in my own name; where I am well known. I never lived with either of the men, but merely had a slight acquaintance with them. I gave them the money and duplicates.</p>

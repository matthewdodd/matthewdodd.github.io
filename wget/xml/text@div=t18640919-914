                  </hi>. I am a wood-sawyer, of 12, Pottier's-place, Bermondsey—I have known the prisoner for several years—as far as I know, he has been a man of good character—my aunt had died previous to this occurrence, and her funeral was to take place next morning—I wanted some gin for the purpose of taking to the <hi rend="italic">wake</hi>—I went to the Anti-Gallican in Tooley-street, and the landlord let me have a bottle—I went with the prisoner to the next house, and he took it away from me there; I could not positively say which man took it., there were several before the bar—I asked the prisoner to give it me back, or to give me a portion of the gin—he did not, and laughed it off—I did not take much notice of it—I went back to the Anti-Gallican and got another bottle, and was going borne with it, when a man pressed me behind and nearly strangled me—I had never seen that man before, but I should know him—the prisoner was with him, and he took the second bottle of gin out of my jacket-pocket and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my waistcoat-pocket—I know I had the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. safe in the first public-house, and I had told him I had it for my aunt's funeral—I can't say positively whether he or the other man took</p>

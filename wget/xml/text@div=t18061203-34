            . On the 6th of November I wanted some money; I took the watch to Mr. Page, a pawnbroker, in Liquorpond street, and pledged it for five shillings. When I looked for the duplicate on the 10th, I could not find it. I had put it in a tea chest, there was no lock to it; I went to the pawnbroker's, and told them I had lost the ticket; they told me it was fetched out.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that you never dropped this duplicate. - A. I am sure that I never took it out of the tea-chest after I put it there. Mrs. Husband drank tea with me on Thursday the 6th of November; she was backwards and forwards till the Saturday; and on the Friday Mr. Husband drank tea with me.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of November in the evening the prosecutor informed me that he had lost his watch. I went with him to the pawnbroker, and got a description of the prisoner Husband. I went to Mr. Hughes, the truss-maker in Holborn, where he worked; I took him in custody, I found a key upon him. I took him to his room, I searched the room all but the bed; I found a number of other things which I brought away, after leaving him in custody of a brother officer; I was bringing the things away, and as we were coming out of the door she (Mrs. Husband) came up to the door; the prosecutor said, that is Mrs. Husband. I then told her I was an officer, I had come to take her in custody. I took her into a public-house there she called God to witness fifty times that she knew nothing of it. There was a parish officer there that told her not to be such a foolish person, but to quietly go with me. She then said, I will tell you the truth, I did not steal it, I found the duplicate, and gave it to my husband to take out. She said the watch was in the bed between the sheets where she had left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know that the husband had it at all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you do not know that she took it, no more than she told you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- I am a pawnbroker, servant to Mr. Page; on the 8th of November there was a man came to fetch out a watch. I cannot swear to that man; he paid me five shillings and a penny for the watch.</p>

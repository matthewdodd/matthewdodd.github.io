               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. I suppose you had a good opinion of him? A. Yes, when he lived with me; he went to live with my mother-in-law - she did not require a recommendation, and did not ask my opinion- I do not recollect his receiving a remittance from the West Indies while in my service; I heard yesterday that he has relations there - he called on me after I returned from France, and said he heard I had expressed an opinion that he was concerned in the robbery, and he had called to justify himself - he said he had been to the west end of the town on the day of the robbery; I did not personally make any inquiry whether that was correct - I had no evidence against him then, and suffered him to go at large.</p>

            . I have been fourteen years in Mr. Yatman's service. On the 28th of August, 1829, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock, and left the house secure, and on the 29th I got up between seven and eight o'clock; I found it broken open; there are no outside shutters - they had entered at the back kitchen, by breaking a bar; there was then space enough for a man to get through, and a bolt was forced back on the back kitchen door; a person could then get into the house - I found the wood work of the drawer in Mr. Yatman's room, all broken from the look; no property was taken except what was in the drawer - I knew the prisoner in master's service, and he had been at the house several times afterwards; he was there about three weeks or a month before the robbery -I have employed the prisoner to put down carpets in the house, but not in the room where the drawer was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was in the habit of calling after he left - was he not paying his addresses to the housemaid? A. Not in the house; I may have seen him in the house later than three weeks before the robbery - I saw nobody about in front of the house the day before; the prisoner always conducted himself as a respeotable young man - I have been told since the robbery that he has received a legacy from the West Indies.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you communicate any message to him from his master, about his not coming to the house? A. Not to my recollection.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Little Russell-street, Covent-garden. This gold watch was pawned with me on the 18th of September, 1829, for 5l. - I cannot take upon myself to say it was by the prisoner; I gave the person a duplicate; on the 10th of October 2l. 10s. more was advanced on it - the first duplicate was given up; I have it at home - another was given for 7l. 10s.; whether that was given to the person who first pawned it I cannot state - on the 17th of the following March there was a further advance of 1l; I gave a duplicate for 8l. 10s. - I cannot say whether it was given to the same person as the second; I have the second duplicate. On the 7th of February Mr. Dryden produced to me the duplicate for 8l. 10s.; he looked at the watch, paid me the interest, and I granted him a fresh duplicate, which I now produce, and also the former one - the watch was redeemed the same day; I cannot say who by - it was not Dryden: it was first pawned in the name of

On the 7th of February I examined a watch at Townsend's; I took a duplicate with me, which I received from Noble; I told him my idea of the value - it was out of repair, and might be worth between 10l. and 12l., as second-hand; this is the watch.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Little Guildford-street. I gave Dryden the duplicate to examine the watch, and redeemed it myself the same evening, from Townsend's; it was in February, 1831 - the prisoner had offered me the duplicate for sale the day before; he said he had been out of place some time, that he had heard of a place, and secured it, but every thing he had was in pledge and he was not able to go to the place for want of linen - that he had been better off, had been in good places, and had a gold watch in pledge - that it was his last resource: he offered me the duplicate for 4l.; I asked how he came by the gold watch - he said he had bought it of a butler who had been out of place some time, and was obliged to part with it - he gave me the duplicate, and I gave it to Dryden to inspect the watch; I got his answer, and then gave the prisoner 2l. for the duplicate, and redeemed the watch; he said it was in for 8l. 10s., but did not say whether that had been advanced at one time or more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose the duplicate stated 8l. 10s. was advanced? A. Yes; he occasionally used my house, and conducted himself well, as far as I could see.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I received this gold watch from Noble, and have produced it here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord, I am innocent of the crime; it is the first time I have ever been in this situation - the robbery was, as I am told, committed on the 29th of August, 1829 - a long time ago; they said some plate, sovereigns, and rings were taken besides the gold watch: I lived with Mr. Yatman, and a year and a half before the robbery I left - I served Mr. Yatman honestly, and when I left he recommended me to his mother-in-law, Mrs, Mitchell, No. 10, Chinawalk, Chelsea. When the robbery took place I lodged with Mr. Rawlings, Gloucester-mews, Portman-square - I heard of it, and that they said I had something to do with it, whereby I went to Mr. Yatman, told him I had not, and where I was on the day and night of the robbery - he seemed quite satisfied; Mr. Yatman will say this. My Lord, the watch I never stole, but bought it of a Mr. Tester, who kept the Little Bell, in St. John-street, Smithfield, for 10l. - Mr. Tester died eight months ago, but his brother remembers something about the watch; he drives a coach on the north road, and promised last Friday to see the widow, and will be in town tonight with his coach, and bring word; how Mr. Tester got the watch I do not know - I had money from the West Indies, and so I paid the 10l. for it. Mr. Yatman's housekeeper must remember I had money: I was out of place, and so I soon wanted money, and pawned the watch - then I got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050017"></xptr>more money upon it, 2l., and then 30s. more; at last I sold the duplicate to Mr. Noble, as I could not redeem it. My Lord, this is the truth, and my character stands good - I am a young man, twenty-eight years of age, and have a respectable mother living: I have always done justice to my employers that I have lived with. The worst crime I ever was guilty of was getting tipsy.</p>

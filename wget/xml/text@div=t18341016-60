            . I am a hair-dresser, and live next door to Garrard. I was in my shop on the night in question, and heard a scuffling in the passage - I went up and saw the prisoner with a tub of oysters under his arm, the prosecutrix was pulling him down the stairs - they got into the street - the prisoner let go of the tub, and made a blow, which she avoided, and he got away - about an hour afterwards he was coming by again - I was at the door, and told the prosecutrix of it - the policeman came up at the time, and took him - I am sure he is the man - he was taken to the station-house - he tried to get away, but could not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you a stick? A. Yes; and I used it as well as I could - I knocked a man down two or three times - I did not tell the magistrate I knew the man by a hurt I gave him in the lip in the scuffle- I told him I might do that; by putting the stick in his face I might push the skin off - I did not say that was the sign I knew him by - I gave as a reason, that I pushed the stick in his face - I likewise know him by his face and his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate that you knew him by his features? A. I told him I knew him perfectly well - I knew him by his dress - I told him that was the coat he had on that very night - he had not a jacket on, but a coat, either blue or dark, and he had a hat - I do not know what handkerchief he had - Mr. Irving has given me one of the pigs as a present - it is worth four guineas - I never had a present of a pig before.</p>

            . I am constable of Ashford - I was called at three or four o'clock that morning - I heard the cry of "Murder" - I ran to the spot - I saw a hat there, and five pigs in the ditch - I did not see the horse and cart there - I drove the pigs to the King's Head, where I found the witness all over blood - the horse and cart were there - I put them into a yard till daylight - there was no name on the cart - I then got in the cart and let the horse go where he liked - he came on from there to Hammersmith, stopped at the toll-bar till the man opened the gate, and then he went on again to a house in Fulham-fields, where he stopped - I did not go in, but I described that house to Trumper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go with Trumper? A. No; I might have gone in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What description did you give of the house? A. I said it was in Fulham-fields, and was rather by itself - it seemed to me to be a square house let in different tenements - it appeared to comprise four separate houses - there were several doors to it - I went round two sides of it - there were other houses within about fifty yards of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Which side of the way were the cot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200064"></xptr>tages? A. On the left - the yard was in front, and the horse wanted to go in there - we had come about fourteen miles.</p>
               <p>- TRUMPER. I am constable of Fulham - I know the prisoner, he keeps a house in what is called Star-lane, Fulham-fields - there are some small cottages on the left hand.</p>

            . I live in Noman's-land, Fulham-fields - my husband is a carpenter - I have known the prisoner twelve months - on the 16th of January I went to his house to play at cards - he was there - I did not leave till a quarter before one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is the prisoner? A. A carpenter - he never had a horse and cart to my knowledge, nor my husband either - I take in washing, the same as the prisoner's wife - I go to his house perhaps three or four times in a week to play at cards - I did not go to tea - I went about ten o'clock - I supped with him and his wife - we had some cold beef and some porter - we played at cards after supper - Joseph Cleaver, who is here, came to my house, he went to the prisoner's with me, and we all played at cards - I am sure it was on the night of the 16th I went, and on the morning of the 17th I came away - I heard no more till yesterday, when the prisoner's wife asked me to come here - there are four houses and a cottage close together - I have one of them, and pay rent and taxes - there are two yards there which a horse and cart could go down.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are there yards belonging to other houses? A. Yes, there are some cottages about fifty yards off - I never saw the prisoner with a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the cart without a name on it? A. No, Sir - I had been washing about two hours that day - I left off about four o'clock in the afternoon - we played at All-fours - I did not win any money.</p>

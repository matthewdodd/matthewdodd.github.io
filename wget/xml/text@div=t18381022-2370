                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and work in the St. Katherine's Docks. Between twelve and one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 7th of October, I was on my way home, at a quarter past twelve o'clock—I finished at the Docks at four o'clock, and then my wife was taken ill—I went out on business, and was going home—there was. no one with me—I was turning the corner of Osborne-street—four young men came behind, and pushed the prisoner Smith against me—he crossed his hand round me, and caught the ribbon of my watch—I caught his hand with the watch in it—the other two prisoners were with him with another whom I could not recognise—they pushed me—my hat fell off, and I was pushed five or six yards from the hat—I took the watch out of Smith's hand—I could not swear that it was done with the intention of depriving me of it—it might be to keep himself from falling—he was pushed against me—I put my watch into my fob again—they upbraided me with my country, and I fol<lb></lb>lowed them to Brick-lane, and lost sight of them—I met them again, in about twenty minutes, in Spitalfields, coming out of the market, and fol<lb></lb>lowed them to Brick-lane, towards Osborne-street—I met a police<lb></lb>sergeant, and gave them into custody—I did not lose my watch.</p>

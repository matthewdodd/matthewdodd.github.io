               <p>Mr. Richardson. On the 27th of January, about Two in the Afternoon, my Chariot was stopp'd on <placeName id="t17330404-51-crimeloc227">Finchly-Common</placeName>

He held a Pistol to my Breast, and demanded my Money, and threaten'd to shoot me dead if I did not deliver. I gave him two Guineas; and I am very positive to his Person, for I look'd full in his Face all the Time he was robbing me, which was about a Minute, and I have since seen him at Hertford.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Clothes had I on?</p>
               <p>Mr. Richardson. A great Coat, with a large Cape; but I can swear more positive than his Clothes, for he had no Mask, nor any manner of Disguise, not so much as the Cape of his Coat turn'd up.</p>

            . I was behind the Coach. The Prisoner rid up to the Coachman, and said, If he did not stand, he'd shoot him thro' the Head that Moment. Then he went to the Coach-Door, and putting his Pistol into the Coach, he demanded my Master's Gold, and said, he would shoot him, dead if he did not deliver that Moment; my Master gave him something; but he was not contented with it, for he said, he must have more, he would search himself; and then he put his Hand into the Coach. He had a brown Cape-Coat, with the Cape down; he had no Disguise, and I had a full view of his Face, and am very sure that this is the Man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you never own to your Master that you did not know me?</p>

            . I was on the Coach-box; the Prisoner came leering along, and gallop'd up to my Horse's side. Damn you, says he, Stand! or I'll shoot this Minute. Then he went to the Chariot, and said to my Master, If you don't deliver your Money this Minute, by God I'll shoot! He was bare-faced; I observed that his Hand shook, and I thought I had seen his Face before, but I could not recollect where, nor when.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you came to see me in Hertford Jail, you said you did not know me.</p>
               <p>Jones. No; I told him I had seen him before; and upon that he turned about and said, I might see him behind too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said the man that did the Robbery had Grey Eyes and Grey Eyebrows.</p>
               <p>Jones. I never said any such Word; I pick'd him out from half the Jail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You had no Occasion to view me a second time, if you had known me at first; but I shall prove that I was in London when the Robbery was done.</p>

               <p>Court. What Business do you follow? and where do you live?</p>
               <p>Kenny. I live at the White Perriwig in Duke-street in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; I am a Perriwig-maker, and the Prisoner is the same Trade.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a Housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Kenny No; I keep a Shop there, but not the whole House. I have been there 2 Years. I served part of my time at the Corner of Bow-street, and lived there five Years for my self.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the Prisoner was all Day at your Shop on the 27th of January.</p>
               <p>Kenny. He was my Journeyman from September last to the half an Hour past 8, on the 14th of February following. On Friday Night, the 26th of January, we lay together; he got up to Work next Morning at 7 o'Clock, and he worked with me till 8 that Night. We both work'd at one Table, he at one end, and I at the other, and I was not out of his Company in all that time, except about 2 o'Clock, when I went to the King's-Head over the way to get a Pint of Beer, but I was not absent above half an Hour.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take such particular Notice of the 27th of January? was there any thing remarkable in that Day?</p>
               <p>Kenny. The 27th of January was a Saturday, which is always a very busy Day with us; and therefore he could not be absent that Day without my taking particular Notice of it. Then he went out of Town the 14th of February, which was but 2 Weeks and odd Days, and 4 or 5 Days afterwards he sent me a Letter that he was in Hertford Jail, and this put me upon recollecting the Day.</p>
               <p>Court. What Countryman are you?</p>

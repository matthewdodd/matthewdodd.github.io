               <p>I was in bed with Stanton—Rowbotham came to Stanton, and whispered something—I could not hear what—I am certain it was Rowbotham—I got up, and put my jacket, waistcoat, and trowsers between the sacking and the mattress—between five and six the next morning I saw Rowbotham come and whisper to Stanton again—I did not hear what he said—I saw him go to the beds, lift up the pillows, and take Stanton'a and Clax<lb></lb>son's clothes from under the pillows, and go out of the room with them under his arm—I am certain it was Rowbotham, because he came and spoke to me, and said, "Who is this?"—I said, "Lockey"—after he left the room, I awoke Claxson, who looked under his pillow, and his clothes were gone—I did not see Penfold during that time.</p>

I am master of the West London Union work-house, When boys or paupers are brought in they are clothed—I have the charge of the clothes—the boys have no right to take them away—when, they leave, the clothes are handed back to me—on the Monday morning I went to the beds and found five boys were naked—I found three persons had made their escape that morning, and the prisoners were two of them—persons frequently make their escape that way—I have endeavoured in vain to discover how they have disposed of the clothes—I found the box of the lock of the door leading to the sleeping-room was broken off, and some bricks broken out, and that was where they had escaped—I gave information, and the prisoners were caught in Drury-lane—the third Person was caught, but he got away—I have taken him since.</p>

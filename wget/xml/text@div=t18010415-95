             sworn. - I am the wife of William Lovemore: On Monday, the 16th of March, I lost these things from my lodgings; I had seen them about two or three hours before they were taken; I saw them at twelve o'clock, and missed them about three; the prisoner was a stranger to me; I saw the property at the pawnbroker's the next morning; the prisoner was then in custody, and as soon as he saw me he begged for mercy, and said he would take the things out of pledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - A. No, I did not; he owned that he went into the room to take them; I received the property from Mr. Perryman. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>- PERRYMAN sworn. - I took in these things from the prisoner on the 16th of March, between one and two o'clock, as near as I can guess; they are pledged in the name of John Jones, No. 5, Hemming's row; the prosecutor lives about four hundred yards from our shop; I am sure the prisoner is the man; Mrs. Lovemore came to me in the evening, and the next morning the prisoner came with a Jew to sell the goods out.(The property was identified by Mrs. Lovemore.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 17th of March I saw a Jew pick up a paper in Hemmings's-row; I asked him what he had found; and he said, a duplicate of a gown, I told the Jew I would buy the gown of him, and I went with him to the pawnbroker's; the pawnbroker said, he believed I was the man, and sent for a constable. <rs id="t18010415-95-verdict535" type="verdictDescription">

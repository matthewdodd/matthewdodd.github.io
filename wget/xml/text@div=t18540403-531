                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am now living in London, I do not know the name of the street. In Nov. last year I was residing at Brussels, at No. 18, Rue de la Marche, with a Madame Louise—I was following the occupation of a milliner—I saw the prisoner there—I do not recollect about what time, it was in the autumn—I had been living at Brussels about three months, or three months and a half, when I first saw the prisoner there—before that I had lived at Lille; I was between six and seven years of age when my mother died—my father died about two years ago—I believe myself to be sixteen years and a half old—I was in the habit of keeping my birthdays, since two years I have not done so—it was on 16th Aug., two years ago, that I last kept it—my sister and several other parties made me some presents on that day, I was then fourteen—that was the last birthday I kept—I first met the prisoner in the gallery de St. Hubert at Brussels, I was with two or three of my friends at the time; they were girls about my own age—he did not say anything to me on that occasion—one of the young girls I was with knew him—I saw him again one or two days afterwards, at the same place—I think he spoke to me on the second occasion; he asked me if I would like to go to a house of business where I would gain plenty of money, and be well off and work at my profession—my friends were with me at that time—I answered that I did not know if I should go, that I did not much like to go—I did not like to go, I did not consent—while the prisoner was talking to me about this the girl he knew was present, and she told me a great many things in order to determine me to go; I do not recollect exactly the words she said, but I know there were a great many things in order to engage me to go; I saw the prisoner again, I think it was the next day or the day after—I had not then made up my mind to go, I was not determined, but I had it in my head to go—he said on the third occasion, that he would give us money on the railway before starting—there was another young lady with me—he showed us a purse filled with gold, or at least with some gold in it, and said, "I have received a letter, and I must start immediately"—he then took a railway ticket, and then he said he had not enough money—it was on the third occasion that we went to the railway—I saw him in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030071"></xptr>
               <p>gallery of St. Hubert, and we went together to the railway—he took three railway tickets—the young lady who was with me asked him for the money which he had promised to give, and he gave her a twenty-five franc piece, but nothing to me—he said he had not money enough, or he would see if he had money enough when he had taken the tickets—the companion who went with me went by the name of Leoni.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In reference to what the prisoner said to you, what induced you to leave Brussels? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was very dull on that day; I had some quarrel or some words with Madame Louise where I was living, and I was very sad, and Harrison told me so many nice things that I was induced to go—I believed that he was going to take me to a house of business in London, because he said so—this was either the end of Nov., or the beginning of Dec—we arrived in town about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—we went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to a place that I now know by the name of Denbigh-terrace, No. 3—Leoni was with me, when I arrived at Denbigh-terrace—I saw Madame Denis at the window of the house, I did not know her at that time—Madame Denis opened the door to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner with you all this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he put the luggage in the dining room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you got into the house, who did you see? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw Madame Denis, Monsieur Denis, Monsieur Deseaux, the father, and Madame Bradley—when I got in Madame Denis said, "Ah! you are arrived, there you are; have you passed a good voyage, or did you suffer much of sea sickness?"—Leoni, Harrison, and myself dined with them that day; I think Harrison stopped the whole evening; I do not know exactly, bat I think he said he had to carry some goods somewhere, which he had brought from Belgium; some boots or shoes—from the time I arrived I remained there, with the exception of being a fortnight at Paris, until I escaped—the next day after I arrived was Sunday—Madame showed me a piece of calico, and said, "As you are here, now begin to make this or that," showing the calico—we did several articles of crochet work, for some days; there was another girl from Paris who was there—Harrison came there every day to dinner—until I escaped, Madame and Monsieur Denis and Deseaux were always residing in the house—Leoni and the French girl also resided there during that time—I know a girl named Elvire Cerckell; she worked at Berlin wool work, not as servant in the house—Leoni, and the French girl, and I lived in the second floor front room—I slept in the back room, third floor—Leoni slept with me all the time I was there—Elvire Cerckell lived down stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Harrison came to dine every day, did you hear him and Madame Denis talk together about the clubs, or anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; very often Madame Denis said to him, "Have you been to my lord this or that name? have you been to the clubs?"—he then said, "Yes, I have been;" or, "They are in the country, and it is no use to go there"—besides the clubs, the park was mentioned, and something was said about the houses of parliament; one day Madame Denis said to the prisoner that he ought to go up to the houses of parliament, and say some hard words to, or blow up, one of the gentlemen there, because he did not pay—after I had been there about a month, Madame Denis introduced me to a gentleman—before that time I had suspected a little what sort of a house it was, but I was not quite certain—from the day I entered the house, up to the time that I escaped, I could not have got away; I never found means to do so, because I did not like to speak to the little girl Elvire, fearing she would tell it to Madame, or speak to Madame</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030072"></xptr>
               <p>about it—I could not come down stairs and go out of the house; any time that I was going down, they made me go up instantly; and Madame was always watching down stairs—often it was the father (Deseaux), and often it was Madame Denis who said, "Will you go up stairs directly!"—Deseaux was the whole day with us in the room which we inhabited—he allowed us to go out of the room, but not to go down—he did not say anything if we went out of the room into our bedroom, but he did not allow us to go down—he used to smoke, to read, and to walk about the room all day; if we went to the window, he took us by the arm and made us go back—he said, "Go back directly from the window, because ray daughter will see you, and will scold me"—Madame used always to be in the dining-room; that is quite near to the street door—if any one went out at the door they could be heard from the room where Madame sat; they could not alone hear, but see, because the door of the room was oftener open than shut—after I had been there about a month, Madame introduced me to a gentleman, who was called the Greek prince; he was in the drawing room—Madame said to him, "I introduce you here to my sister"—when I went down into the drawing room there was Madame, the French girl, and the Greek prince present—the French girl had gone down first; I went down a very long time after her—after Madame introduced me to the Greek prince, she opened my gown—the French girl was not then in the room; Madame and me were alone with the prince—she undid the hooks, opened my dress, took the hand of the Greek prince, and showed my breasts, and said, "Look here, does she not resemble me? she has quite the same breast as I have"—Madame took his hand and put it on me, and made his hand touch me—the prince said, "Let me alone, you dirty procuress; she is not more your sister than she is mine"—I went out of the room, and went up stairs, and Madame afterwards scolded me, and said, "You have no manners; you are a stupid fool"—I did not consent to the prince or Madame doing this—I heard Madame tell Harrison, either that same day or the next morning, that the Greek prince had been there—I do not recollect what Harrison said to it—I was not introduced to any man there after that—some days before we went to Paris, Madame asked the French girl to come down; something was wanted, to try on her dress, or something—I went down, and saw an old gentleman there, near the fire; Madame said it was the old marquis—Harrison came up once to the room where we sat, to write a letter for Leoni to her mother, and then he came several times on a little commission, to fetch a dress for Madame, or something—Deseaux was there at the time Harrison came up; after that I went with Monsieur and Madame Denis to Paris—Madame said she wanted to go to the country to see some friends, and as it was me she liked best, she wanted me to accompany her—she did not say where she was going; she said to the country, to some friends—I went to Paris, in the company of Monsieur and Madame Denis—while I was travelling from London to Paris, I was not out of the control of Monsieur and Madame Denis; she was always at my side—I had never been to Paris before—I knew nobody at Paris—while I was there I knew no one but Monsieur and Madame Denis; we went to the Hotel de Valois, Rue Richelieu; we occu<lb></lb>pied the first floor—whilst I was in Paris, a man was introduced to me by Madame Denis—I do not know who he was—that might have been one day or two days after we got to Paris; I rather think it was two days after our arrival—that man had connection with me; it was without my consent—Madame Denis was present at the time—I heard Madame Denis say to him, "I have a bill to pay, and you must give me so much"—I am not quite</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030073"></xptr>
               <p>certain, but I think the sum mentioned was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and she said, "To my sister you do not give so much as you gave to that little girl Marion"—I returned from Paris with Monsieur and Madame Denis in a fortnight—from the time I went to Paris to the day I returned to Denbigh-terrace, I was always under the control of Monsieur and Madame Denis—I went back to No. 3, Denbigh-terrace—after we came back, Madame wanted to give me some medicine, but I did not take it—she said, "If you don't take that, you won't have anything to eat"—I saw Harrison afterwards; he had a dispute with Madame—I did not see him so often afterwards; he did not come any more to dinner—the dispute between him and Madame was, first of all, that he did not guard the house well in her absence; and secondly, that he had let the servants know or see that the Greek prince came—Harrison said that he had kept and guarded the house well, and that he only left it for a little message—the other subject of dispute was about 100 francs, which Harrison wanted from Madame, as his part of the money she had received in Paris—Madame told him that he had spent a great deal of money in her absence, and that he had drunk or taken a bottle of Cognac, which was sent for a sample—I do not recollect what Harrison said to that—after I returned I was again taken to the Greek prince by Madame—he was in the bedroom that time; it was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening—the Greek prince was in bed—Madame pushed me near to the bed where the Greek prince was lying, lifted my dress up, and put the hand of the prince on my legs—that was without my consent—on the first occasion when this happened to me, I complained to Madame, and told her that I was not brought up for this, and that I did not like it—I had always thought to escape since a long time back, but eight days after my return I was quite determined—I spoke to Elvire Cerckell—after that, I remained oftener up stairs in my room than before—during the last eight or nine days that I was there, after coming from Paris, I was constantly crying; not always, but often—Madame saw me crying, and one day she took my bonnet and shawl and locked them up, and said, "If one thinks to escape, one will not do it."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During all the time you were in London were you never allowed to go out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I went out once with Deseaux, and I went another time with him to see the opening of the Houses of Parliament, that was twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that before or after you went to Paris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Once before, and once after—I do not know the date of the day that I escaped—Elvire Cerckell, and a boy named Antoine, helped me to escape; and Madame Cerckell also came to the house the last week, for the purpose of helping me to escape—a little girl named Mary Murphy also assisted—I could not possibly have escaped before I did—I went to Mr. Watkinson, a person who I afterwards knew to be a policeman; I had on a woollen gown and slippers when I escaped, and nothing on my head.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a public house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told you that it was a house of some middle class people, and a house of that claw is not a public house; it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030074"></xptr>
               <p>a house where they did nothing in it—they did not sell wine or brandy or anything—I lived there with a widow named Louise—Madame Louise had the whole house, I lived there, and I had a bedroom to myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did other girls live there besides yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only myself, and a little daughter of Madame Louise—I only worked at home with her, no-where else; I was not paid for my work, I worked with her—the agree<lb></lb>ment was that I did not work for anybody, nor any particular sort of work; I was to work in the house, and my sister paid for my food—my sister went away before I met Harrison; I do not recollect how long before—I do not know exactly when my sister left, but it was a few days after the arrival; she left directly, she left an address where I was to write to her—am I obliged to give it?—I should not like to give it, my business is not that of my sister—I owed Madame Louise some money when I left Brussels, it was money which she had lent me to buy some ribbon for my bonnet; I do not know how much, only some francs—I left Brussels without letting Madame Louise know that I was going—I do not even myself know why I did so, because Harrison put some fine things in my head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you thought you were going to a millinery business, why could not you let Madame Louise know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because she would not have allowed me to go—I have two sisters—the other is travelling with an American family—it was between two and three in the afternoon when I met Harri<lb></lb>son in the Gallery of St. Hubert—the girls I was with were some friends—I cannot recollect where I met them—I cannot recollect all these little particulars; if I had known I was obliged to recollect them, I would have given more attention to it—when you were of my age, where did you find your friends? I made casual acquaintances, and through one I made ano<lb></lb>ther—it was a girl named Louise that was a friend of Harrison's, she said she was a friend of his; it was Louise that persuaded me to go—she said the same that Harrison said; and besides that, she said that several other girls who had been with Harrison were very well off, and that Harrison was a very respectable man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said, that when you were in Denbigh-terrace, you heard Madame speak about going to the Clubs; just tell us what you actually heard her say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said to him, "Well, Harrison, have you been to the Clubs?" or, "Have you been there?"—she did not say for what purpose; but he said, "I don't think that he is in town"—it was after this that I went to Paris—we went by the railway to Folkestone, and to Boulogne—we had to pass the Custom-house—I thought at that time that I was going into the country—Madame said that we were going to the country, in Scotland, and that we had to pass that way—I was doubtful at the moment; and when I heard them speak French, I said to her, "They speak French very well here;" she said, "Yes; it is a little town in France which we have to pass to go to Scotland"—I did not believe that Boulogne was the way to Scot<lb></lb>land, I doubted it very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you willing, or not, when you got to Boulogne? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was going to the country, and the country was great pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What, with Madame Denis, after you had been treated in the way you have stated with the Greek prince? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because I thought to go for a pleasure party—we went to the railway station at Boulogne—I found that they spoke French very well there, for Scotch people—Madame took me to the Hotel de Paris, at Boulogne, and said to me, it was just because it was the Hotel de Paris that they spoke French—afterwards we went to the railway, I did not hear anybody speak there at all—I did not give</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030075"></xptr>
               <p>any attention to it; I could not hear, because Madame Denis and I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the railway, and when I went out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> Madame Denis took me by the arm instantly—she did not go to get the tickets; M. Denis fetched the tickets, and Madame went direct with me into the railway carriage—I certainly heard somebody speak at the railway, but I did not give any attention to it, because Madame said, "We are passing a little town, in order to go to Scotland"—I had no idea that we were going to Paris, but I thought it very curious that we had to pass France in order to go to Scotland, which belongs to England—we stopped at Amians, and had something to eat and drink—I was surprised at the language they spoke there, but I always doubted the whole time—she always made the same answer as before, if I asked her, that we were going to an old castle in Scotland—I heard of Amiens several times while I was at Lille—we got to Paris in the evening—I did not think that we had arrived at the castle in Scotland—I said to Madame Denis that we were now in a French town, because the soldiers had red dresses—I had nobody there to whom I could complain—Madame took me by the arm, and passed me as her niece, and I certainly would not go and complain to a stranger, or any one passing by, or the soldiers—in the way from the railway to the hotel, Madame kissed me, and told me we were in Paris, but begged me very hard not to say so, or tell anybody—she promised me a great many nice things, and begged me very hard not to tell anybody, not even her father or Harrison, when we came back, that we had been to Paris—the Hotel de Valois is a large hotel; it is a public hotel; it is an <hi rend="italic">hotel meublee</hi>, a furnished house; there was not a common dining room—Madame and M. Denis and myself dined together—I did not know that a gentleman would come to see me, but I knew that a gentleman would come to see Madame Denis—I swear that the man had connection with me entirely against my will—that was the only time he had connection with me—I saw him afterwards, I think it was twice; I saw him often when he came there—he had connection with me twice afterwards, on different days—on both those occasions it was against my will—the gentleman gave me eight pieces of gold; Madame Denis took that away from me—he also gave me a bracelet, a cross, and a ring; Madame Denis allowed me to put on those things the day the gentleman came, but the day before we started she took them away from me, and said that those things were of no use on the voyage—I was not angry at her taking them away from me; I did not care about it—I knew we were coming back to Eng<lb></lb>land; Madame told me so—I did not make any communication to anybody on my way back; I could not, because I was always seated between M. and Madame Denis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Belgian. I know the house of Madame Denis, No. 3, Denbigh-terrace; I have known it about seventeen months—I went there for the first time about seventeen months ago—Madame Denis was living there at that time—I went to do Berlin wool work—from that time until this year I have been in the habit of going there daily to do Berlin wool work, and to do errands, and, when there was a new servant, to show her how to do the work—Madame Denis did not pay me any regular wages;</p>

               <p>she gave me what she liked, sometimes one thing, sometimes another—I did not sleep there—I went in the morning, and came away at night—while I was there I used to see some gentlemen come to the house—I frequently saw gentlemen coming to the house; sometimes they came in the afternoon, and sometimes in the evening—I have seen women living there, who slept in the house; sometimes they stopped a few months, and sometimes a few days—I do not recollect any women coming and sleeping there only for a night or two—I know the prisoner—I used to see him there frequently, during the whole of the sixteen or seventeen months; he used to be there mostly every day—he took his meals with Madame Denis—Madame Denis generally sat in the dining room, next to the street door; that room is so close to the door that she must have heard persons coming in and going out—the door was mostly open while she was sitting in it—I knew of a person coming there who was called the Greek prince.</p>

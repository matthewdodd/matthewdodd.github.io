                  </hi>. I am a horse-dealer and horse-slaughterer. On 10th May I was in partnership with Thomas Fishpool, that partnership is now dissolved—I have an agreement to that effect, it is dated 15th June, 1848—I hired the prisoner on 11th May, to go and buy some horses—he was to tare 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and he drew 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account—he went down with me to Hertford—I was taken ill there, and obliged to stay at an inn—on 12th May 1 gave him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, in a bag—he went to Hertford fair to buy horses—he came to me at the inn in about an hour, and said he could not buy anything there, the best way would be for us to get to Smithfield—we came up to the Shareditch station—I went home, because I was ill—the prisoner had the</p>

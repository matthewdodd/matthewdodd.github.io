             sworn. - I am a painter by trade; I live in Jewry-street, within a few doors of Mr. Champante: On the evening of the 11th of December, about a quarter before five o'clock, I was going down Jewry-street to my own house; I saw a man stand at the door of Mr. Champante's warehouse; I thought at first he was peeping through the window; I stopped for a moment, and saw him open the door in a very gentle manner; that raised my suspicion. I stopped about half a minute longer, and saw him shut the door in the same gentle manner, and before he had shut the door, I saw him take a bundle of paper from behind the door; as soon as he had shut the door, I opened it, and gave the alarm to the first person that I saw in the warehouse, which was

               <p>Q. What had he about him? - A. He had a bundle of paper with him; the clerk took it from him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the door was close fast too? - A. It was upon a single latch; he went up close to the door, trying to open it, in a kind of fly way.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course you have plenty of that paper; is there any private mark upon it that you can possibly distinguish it from any other paper that might be found at any other wholesale dealer's? - A. I cannot pretend to swear to any particular mark upon it, I can say I saw it in the warehouse that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell us any particular mark? - A. There is no particular mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Did you miss any paper before you heard it was gone? - A. I only knew it through my neighbour, I was up stairs at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pays the rent of the house? - A. Myself and partner; we pay jointly in proportion, I allow my partner something for the dwelling, and the partnership comprises the whole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been distressed, and several times Mr. Champante has thrown me back, though he has had thousands that came from my father abroad; I have been put on one side as a beggar; I unfortunately lost a trifle of money, I have applied to him upon several occasions, and could get no relief.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What answer do you make to this charge, because no distress should make a young man like you do this; tied to no country, you could get your bread any where.</p>

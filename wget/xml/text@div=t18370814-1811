                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, in Burlington Arcade. I had a person in my employ of the name of Burroughs, who was transported last January—I know nothing of the prisoner—he was taken into custody about nine or ten weeks ago—I saw these articles produced, and knew that they were my property—this pair I missed April twelve month—I had them in February twelvemonth—I had a fire, and these things were removed in April—I called Burroughs, who was my foreman—these were not sold by me—Hayes gave me information in the December following, and I made some inquiries, which led to my finding these boots, and others as well.</p>

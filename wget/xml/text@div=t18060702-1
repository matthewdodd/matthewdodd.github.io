             sworn. I attend at Mr. Williams' as one of his clerks; I was going into Mr. Williams' back gate, I met a woman coming out, I perceived she had something bulky under her cloak; Mr. Young, another clerk, came up, we asked her what she had got there, she said nothing, she had been speaking to the lady; I said there was no lady, she then said the young woman; we let the prisoner go, and asked the servants if they had seen such a person; they said no; they went to see if any thing was missing, and as soon as they found any thing was missing, four of us went in pursuit of her different ways, I went the wrong way.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was brought back did you know whose property the caddy and the desk were. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman at the bar the person whom you saw the desk taken from. - A. Yes.</p>

             YOUNG sworn. Q. Do you live with Mr. Williams. - A. I do; I saw the prisoner pass by the door as I was sitting in the counting-house, and as she was going out I went and asked her what she wanted, she said nothing, she had been speaking with the lady; I asked her what lady, she said the young woman, and from something that I saw projecting under her cloak I had some suspicions; I went and enquired of the servants if they had seen such a person, they said no; the first witness then went into the room to see if there was any thing missing; he immediately missed the tea caddy; we then went in pursuit of her, she was brought back to the house, I saw the tea caddy and the writing desk in her possession, and I went with her to the officer.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On the 30th of May I was sent for; Bishop and I went to Mr. William's house, I found the prisoner in the yard, and received charge of her and took her to the office; I received the tea chest and the desk at the office from Mr. Mackenna, they were tied up in this apron, which the prisoner said was hers.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mackenna) Did you know them before you saw them in the possession of the woman. - A. Yes, I can swear that they belong to Mr. Williams, they were taken from the back parlour; I missed the tea caddy immediately the alarm was given, I had seen them she morning before, one of the seals in the desk was marked with a W, the other is a wafer stamp; I have no doubt but the whole is Mr. Williams' property.</p>

            </rs>. Wherein are contain'd Expressions denying His Majesty's Title to the Crown of this Realm, and asserting the Pretender's Right to the same, highly reflecting upon the whole Body of the Church of England as by Law Establish'd, Bishop's , inferior Clergy and Larty , denying the Validity of their Ordination and all their Offices, and representing them all Schismaticks excommunicated info facto , and saying they ought to be all treated as such; asserting, that whosoever went to the Parish-Church, and performed Holy Duties with any of them, their Prayers, Sacraments, and Holy Duties were all Sin; and several other Things of the same Nature: and that none were of the True Church of England but the Nonjurors ; that none are true Minsters but they that have their Ordination from true Bishops , and none were true Bishops but the Pretenders; and several things of the same Nature. The instrument of his Ordination was read in Course, sign'd Georgin Hictes, under the Denomination of Bishop of ford . The Council for the Prisoner was Mr. Kettleby , who indeed did not at all go about to justify any one of the seditions and scandalous Patlages contained in the Libel ; but only argued against the Libel's being found upon the Prisoner, being a Publication according to Law. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Bilssington, two Messengers, deposed, that having receiv'd Orders to take Mr. Howel into Custody, they went to his Lodgings and seized about a 1000 of those seditious Libels, and the Manuscript Copy from which they were composed; and that the Prisoner tore part of the Manuscript Copy in pieces before them, but they secured some part of it, which was produced in Court, and appear'd to be the Original Manuscript from which the Libel was composed.

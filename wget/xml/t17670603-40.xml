               <p>April 11.</p>
               <p>"My Lord,</p>
               <p>"If ever pity touched your generous breast,</p>
               <p>"(as sure it has) let that pity move in compassion</p>
               <p>"towards me, a poor distressed creature, that am</p>
               <p>"indebted to your Lordship for all the favours</p>
               <p>"you have been graciously pleased to bestow upon</p>
               <p>"me, and for which I humbly thank your</p>
               <p>"Lordship; and I hope, from your former goodness</p>
               <p>"to me, you will lend this once a gracious</p>
               <p>"ear to what I will relate, which is as follows:</p>
               <p>"My Lord, it pleased God before the honour</p>
               <p>"of knowing your Lordship, that I fell down</p>
               <p>"and cut the main artery of my right-arm, which</p>
               <p>"has almost deprived me of the use of it, so that</p>
               <p>"I am unable to perform any place of service,</p>
               <p>"for I have tried and could not; but I have married</p>
               <p>"a woman that is a black milliner, that is,</p>
               <p>"one that makes hats and bonnets; so that if</p>
               <p>"you please to give us money to set us up in our</p>
               <p>"business, I never will trouble your Lordship</p>
               <p>"again; I have sent this petition by my wife,</p>
               <p>"for I have sent several before, and could not</p>
               <p>"get any answer from your Lordship, for I suppose</p>
               <p>"your servants have kept them, and you</p>
               <p>"have not seen them, so by that means I have</p>
               <p>"made my wife privy with that unnatural freedom</p>
               <p>"which your Lordship has taken with me;</p>
               <p>"and your Lordship knows, such freedom makes</p>
               <p>"persons take such impertinent liberty; for I am</p>
               <p>"sure of this, if you had not taken such freedom</p>
               <p>"with me, I had not taken such liberty in sending</p>
               <p>"any petition to your Lordship. But I verily</p>
               <p>"believe, that as God thought good to deprive</p>
               <p>"me of the use of my hand in manner he</p>
               <p>"has, so he, in the dark abyss of his providence,</p>
               <p>"brought it about that I should come to you in</p>
               <p>"the manner I did; and I hope, that as God</p>
               <p>"has blessed you with abundance of this world's</p>
               <p>"goods, I hope your Lordship will incline your</p>

               <p>M. Quin. He gave it me in my own house, and he brought me a gown to go in: he said I should have a guinea if I would carry this to the Marquis, and he shewed me the way to Southgate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. It was on a Sunday morning; Williams the prisoner went along with us; Preston shewed me the door; they put up at an alehouse after he had shewed me the door, and I left them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030032"></xptr> there and went to my Lord's house. I offered to deliver the letter, the gentleman would not take it in, and I came back to them, and told them the letter would not be accepted, and delivered it to him again. He made a riot and a disturbance, and said he would write another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between Preston and Williams there?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. They had some conversation, but I am thick of hearing, and could not hear what was said. Williams helped me up upon a post to see the garden, while Preston was writing in the alehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams there when Preston made the riot?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. He was. Preston said he would write another letter; I had not seen Williams above six or seven times, I asked him if he would go instead of me; he said a woman might do it better.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Preston and Williams seem to be acquainted?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. Yes; I asked Preston if there was any danger in going with that letter; he said, no, none at all. Williams was by, and he said there was no danger at all. After they had both assured me there was no danger, I carried the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you Preston's wife?</p>
               <p>M. Quin. No, I am not; I don't know whether he is a man or a woman.</p>

               <p>Brown. I am a constable. I was sent for to the Cherry-tree at Southgate, and charged with Williams and Preston; Preston said he received four letters from Lord Carnarvon, when he was in the coach coming to town, and he had a 10 l. bank note in each of them, and he would not be his secret-keeper no longer, for he was a sodomite, and d - d him. He said he had wrote to my Lord several times, and he would again. I asked Mrs. Quin what she came for; she said she came for profit, and so did Williams; Williams said he came for a country walk, (I knew nothing of the design they came upon then.) Said Preston to Williams, you persuaded me to write a letter over night, and you put words into my mouth; Williams said to him, you have brought me into a fine premunire here.</p>

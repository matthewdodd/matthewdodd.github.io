                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Humphrey, who keeps a newspaper-office in Theobald's-road. On Saturday evening the 5th of March, I was in Drake-street, Red Lion-square, and saw the prisoner—he asked me if I would go into the shop, and get a twopenny loaf, and he would give me a halfpenny—I said, "Yes"—he gave me a shilling—he told me to say it was for my father—I went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mr. Hacker's—he had not got a twopenny loaf—I came back, and told the prisoner so—he sent me back again to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> a threepenny loaf—I got it, and gave Mr. Hacket the shilling the prisoner had given me—he said it was a bad one—I went back to where I had left the prisoner, and Mr. Hacket with me—the prisoner was then gone.</p>

            . I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, at a public-house in Ratcliffe-highway. I said I believed he was the man I wanted for robbing his lodging; he said he had not. I asked where he lodged; and he mentioned some name, not the prosecutor's; he had two waistcoats on. I asked where he got them, and how long he had had them: he said he brought them from home, out of the country. I found a purse, a sovereign, and seventeen and sixpence on him, which he said was his wages; the waistcoats answered the description I had received. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man, I shall send for the prosecutor;" he then said, those clothes did belong to his landlord's son, and he had brought them away that morning from Henry-street, and the money was what he had received for part of the things, at a shop at the bottom of the Minories; he took me next morning to Searl's, at the corner of Rosemary-lane; they denied buying any of the things.</p>

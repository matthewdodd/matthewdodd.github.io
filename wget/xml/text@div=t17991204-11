             Esq. sworn. - On the 31st of last December, in my way to town for the winter, about nine miles from town, on the <placeName id="t17991204-11-crimeloc61">Uxbridge-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. What were his words? - A. B - t your eyes, give me your money directly, or I will blow your brains out; I said, do not be in a hurry, and I immediately drew my purse and gave it into his hand; he then said, d-n you, your pocket-book, and your watch; I answered, that I had neither, be repeated that two or three times; he said to my son, who was in the carriage, look another way, or d-n you, I will blow your brains out; don't look at me, look another way; he then looked up to the coachman and said, look another way, you b - y rascal, b - t your eyes, or I will blow your brains out, if you do not look another way, and upon turning his head, upon that occasion, gave me an opportunity of seeing all the bottom part of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to the chaise? - A. Close to the window; at half after three o'clock in the day, or nearly about that hour; the handkerchief fell down in consequence of the position in which he put his head, when he looked at the coachman, then he rode away a full gallop; I handed him some half-pence and silver, and walnuts; I said, I suppose you will not think of taking such things; upon which he snatched at them, and some of them fell, and also a watch, and he took that, but that was not my property; he took from me a purse, containing two guineas, and eight shillings; in consequence of a recent attack near the same spot, I attended at Bow-street, to identify three men, and upon that occasion I saw the prisoner, and know him to be the person that had robbed me upon the 31st of December; I have not the least doubt upon earth; I am confident that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This robbery was on the 31st of December last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Almost twelve months ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040009"></xptr>Q.Had the person who robbed you a round hat or a slapped hat? - A. A round hat, and that pretty low over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. About half after three in December, it begins to be duskish? - A. It did not happen to be so that day, for it was a very great frost, and snow upon the ground, and there was sufficient light to distinguish his features.</p>
               <p>Q. There has been no property found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went to Bow-street with a full persuasion that you might find some persons there who had robbed you? - A. I had had a note to say that some persons were taken up who answered the description I had given.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoner from December till October? - A. I rather think I did see him on the 12th of October.</p>
               <p>- ARABIN sworn. - I was with my father in his carriage, on the 31st of December last, when this transaction took place; I was awaked by the stopping of the carriage, and a voice, exclaiming, b - st your eyes, I will blow your brains out; I almost instantly saw a man on horseback at the carriage-window; he demanded our money in the same menacing tone; I saw my father give him his money; he at the same time demanded mine, and swore he would blow my brains out, if I did not; I fixed my eye and my attention particularly upon the prisoner, so much so that he frequently b - d my eyes that he would blow my brains out if I did not turn my head another way; during the whole of the time I observed him, and I have no doubt that the prisoner at the bar is the man who robbed the carriage; I did not lose any money myself. He had a hat on not quite so low as his eye-brows; and he had a handkerchief, such as ostlers usually wear, a kind of a snuff-colour, tied over his chin, but it was so loosely tied, that from the motion of the horse, and his own agitation, it continually dropped off; I had then an opportunity of seeing the whole of his face, which was very strongly imprinted upon my recollection; I have no doubt in my own mind in the least, that the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were alarmed out of your sleep by this robbery? - A. I was napping.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were alarmed? - A. I cannot say I was alarmed, for I am used to these kind of things upon that road.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no more opportunity of observing the man than your father? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen the person of the prisoner until you came to Bow-street, at least not till September? - A. Not till September.</p>

            , in December last: Coming from Drayton, a man came up to us on horseback, caught hold of the horses reins, and stopped me, and said to me, look the other way, two or three times over; he then turned his horse's head round and opened the carriage-door; he then said, your money or your life directly; he said, your money again; whether the General was asleep or not I cannot tell; he then said, your purse directly, and look the other way.</p>

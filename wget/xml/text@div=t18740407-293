                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 40, Chancery Lane—Mary Elizabeth Stokes is my sister—in January 1872 I sued the defendant for a debt due to my sister—he was then living in Richmond Road, Bays-water—an appearance was put in to the writ, and Mr. Alfred Watson was the attorney acting for the prisoner—I produce the judgment dated 26th February, 1872, for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. debt, and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. costs—I also produce a letter from Mr. Watson—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 29th February</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">and stated that the defendant had no means of paying the debt or costs, and asked for time that an arrangement might be made which was the only way in which the plaintiff could get anything</hi>)—I went to Richmond Road in March, 1872, a few days after the judgment, and the defendant had left—in consequence of something I heard I went to 2, Chichester Road, Maida Vale, within a day or two, and the defendant had been there but had left—I do not know where he was between February 1872, and March 1873—he made no com<lb></lb>munication to me—in March 1873 I found him at 138, Finborough Road, West Brompton, upon which I took out a summons before a Judge at Chambers on the Judgment—I saw Milhardo on the subject before the return of the summons—Mr. Henry Phillips, who was then acting as his solicitor, asked me a day or two before March 27, 1873, if my client was willing to entertain the proposal he had made for settling the matter—I said "Well, you have said that the furniture in the house at Finborough Road, belongs to Gertrude Milhardo, the daughter, and that if my client takes her collateral security she will get her money"—to that, both the prisoner, who was present, and Mr. Phillips assented, and we then had a discussion as to how the amount was to be cut up—that resulted in a con<lb></lb>sent order—this is it "I do order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment creditor 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in four instalments of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each"—I also re<lb></lb>ceived this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), from Gertrude Milhardo as colla<lb></lb>teral security—the first instalment was due on 10th July, 1873, which was paid—the costs at the time of drawing up that order were 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with interest—the second instalment was not paid, and I wrote to Finborougb Road—I had leave to substitute service and serve a writ on Miss Gertrude Milhardo—there was no defence to the action against Gertrude, and I got</p>

               <p>judgment, and levied execution on the furniture at Finborough Road, but got no proceeds, because a claim was made to the furniture by Mrs. Milhardo, the mother, the prisoner's wife—when I was told in March, 1873, that the furniture was Gertrude's, I believed the statement, and that was the only reason I had for taking the security—on 17th January, 1874, an inter<lb></lb>pleader action was tried before Mr. Justice Brett, Mrs. Milhardo was the plaintiff. (The Court <hi rend="italic">considered that this had nothing to do with the case</hi>)—a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days after judgment had been signed against the debtor Mrs. Mil<lb></lb>hardo came to my office with some papers which she said were shares, but I did not have them in my hands until the trial—I knew nothing about details of the shares or the Company in which they were—the prisoner was present at the trial, and Gertrude Milhardo was called as a witness for her mother—as soon as I found out what the particulars were I applied at Hammer<lb></lb>smith for a summons against the prisoner for this offence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I offered to take the amount on account—the debt was incurred in 1870 and the beginning of 1871—the Master decided that the judgment was good, and that that was not a proper offer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mrs. Milhardo produce the shares? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She produced the certificate, but Mr. Stokes was told that there was a preference dividend to those shares—he knew what shares they were, and he knew that I was proceeding to recover a large amount from the company at that time—the whole name of the company was perhaps not mentioned in his presence—it was not stated whose shares they were. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew quite well that there was a judgment debt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not know the time at which it was incurred—I did not know at the time of the judgment that the prisoner had got shares worth 940<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Mr. Stokes that the furniture was Miss Gertrude Milhardo's, but not as an inducement to him to take it, and he did not attach any importance to it—I did not say that she was a young lady of property and that the instalments would be met, because I had no means of knowing it of my own knowledge—I was employed by the mother to make the claim on the furniture in November, 1873—in December, 1873, I knew from the prisoner that some shares had been sold at a considerable sacrifice to get the money to pay into Court; 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought to me to pay into Court, and I paid 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it myself—I did not know then that the remainder was 940<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of preference shares—I was present at the trial on January 17th, 1874—no doubt I had seen Miss Gertrude Milhardo before she was examined; I did not take any proof from her—I knew she had made an affidavit in the suit—I never heard her say that she never had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and had no money of her own—I attended at the police-court and sat very near Miss Milhardo when she gave her account—I do not recollect mentioning to her when she came under examination the name of Julia Milhano—I may have suggested that</p>

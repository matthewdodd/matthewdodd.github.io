                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, New-street Hill. I was formerly in the police—I have had a great many cases of this description here—on Saturday, afternoon, 7th of May, about half-past six o'clock I was on Hol<lb></lb>born-hill, and saw a gentleman going up the hill, and the two prisoners following him—M'Carty laid hold of his coat-pocket, took out a handker<lb></lb>chief, and gave it to Connell, who tucked it in his trowsers pocket—it was raining very hard at the time—I looked up and down the hill to see if I could see the policeman that was on that beat—I at last saw him standing under Union-court gateway—I ran and told him—I then followed the prisoners to the corner of Hatton-garden, and gave them into custody to the policeman—in going to the station, I followed behind, and saw Connell slip the handkerchief out of his trowsers-pocket, and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it in a door<lb></lb>way in King-street—I do not know who the gentleman was—I tried to speak to him, but lost sight of him while speaking to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Connell.</hi> He said at the office, that he knew the gentleman. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not—I said I should know him again, and would try to find him—I thought he had gone into a linendraper's shop on the hill—he had a blue bag on his back, and an umbrella in his hand—I inquired at the shop, and they did not know such a person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a city policeman. Thorpe gave me informa<lb></lb>tion, and I took the prisoners—I received the handkerchief from Thorpe at the station—he said Connell had thrown it down—I did not see him do so.</p>

Bank-note, No. 90,609, between the folds of the letter, put it in an envelope, and addressed it to Mrs. C.

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable, attached to the post-office. I received this cancelled 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note on 13th Feb., No. 90,609, dated Nov. 2nd, 1848—in consequence of that, I saw the prisoner at Stratford-green on 15th Feb.—he was a police-constable there—I asked him where he got the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note that he gave to Mrs. Hawley—he paused for a moment, and then said, I "I found it," and pointed out a place in the road near the post-office at Stratford—I said, "You found it in a letter"—he said, "No, there was no letter"—I said it had been stated by a young man at Mr. Morgan's that he put it into a letter, and posted it—he again said, "There was no letter"—he then said he was very sorry for what he had done, he said he had found it about five weeks back, early in the morning—I tried the letter-box at Strat-ford with a cane, and in my opinion a letter might easily be taken out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Hawley, a policeman; we live in Harrow-green, Leytonstone. The prisoner lodged with us—in Jan. he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note to keep till the next morning—I asked him where he got it—he said it was his own, and he had saved it—he had been in the habit of giving me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week previous to that—I should say it was nearly twelve months since I received any of him before—next morning he asked my husband to allow me to go with him to purchase some clothes—I went with him to Mr. Wakefield's, in Sun-street, Bishopsgatc—I gave him the note myself.</p>

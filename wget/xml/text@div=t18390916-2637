                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Mrs. Hope's, at Acton. On the 17th of September the prisoner slept in the same room with me—I had three sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in a bag in my box—when 1 got up in the morning I took a half-sovereign from the bag, and put the bag into the box—I had lost the key, and was obliged to break the hinge off to get it—I left it so—I went to London, and on Wednesday morning I missed three sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—the prisoner was in the room when I put the money back, and could see what I was about—a policeman was sent for, and I gave him in charge—he said, sooner than be locked up he would pay me the money back again—another person slept in the room with us—he is not here—he was gone out to work before I left the room—he would return to the room the same night—I did not discover my lost till the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hope, and live at Acton. The prisoner lodged in my house—Ball went to London about half-past six o'clock on Tuesday—the prisoner came down about seven o'clock, and had breakfast, and just as he was going out of the house he put his hand to-had pocket, and said he must return up stairs, for he had left his money there—he went up, and was gone two or three minutes—I heard a noise, as if a stool or the box was moved—he went out directly, came back at twelve o'clock, brought in a cane and a new cap, and sent me for a pot of beer—he said he had been to his master's, who had given him a good scolding, and he was to go to work next morning—he was not at work Tuesday or Wednesday—when he came in on Tuesday evening he had Ball's great coat on—he went out about half-past five o'clock next morning, which was earlier than usual, leaving the prosecutor in the room, and when the pro<lb></lb>secutor came down he complained of his loss—no stranger had been in the house before the loss was discovered, and I was not out of the house—on the Friday previous to the Tuesday I fetched a pint of beer for supper—the prisoner gave me a penny, and said it was the last penny he had—he owed me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the Monday before the robbery he paid me—on the Sunday, he asked me to give him change for a sovereign—I said I could not, but he changed half a sovereign at dinner time—he had taken his wages on the Saturday night.</p>

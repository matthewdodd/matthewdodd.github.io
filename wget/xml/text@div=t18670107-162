Hutching's office—Duck was apprehended by Roskelly, on 5th October—he told me where he was employed, and I pointed him out to Roskelly as he left his work—I have no doubt that he remained at his work at Jackson and Graham's the whole time—I had about three interviews with him—I went there because he said he would endeavour to look for the man—I gave him my card and told him if he did not come quickly to give him in custody and bring him to the Old Jewry to me—the Sun is an ordinary-sized public-house, and is frequented by working men—I went there once or twice when I did not see him—I did not go to Jackson and Graham's to see him—I understand he went to the Old Jewry to see me—that is my police address, and is on my card—I have no doubt he called once—I do not know who he saw—there are something like twenty detective officers there, and perhaps 200 people call every day—there is a little brass box or pigeon-hole, and'if it is a matter of importance the clerk or messenger writes it down and puts it in my compartment—I have inquired since the last trial, of the two station sergeants and the messenger, but they have no recollection; perhaps twenty people call in a day for me—I believe, from what Duck has told me, that be called, and from what Tay<lb></lb>lor told me also—there is no question that they actually went to Dent's, I suppose that was to get an interview with Mr. Allcroft—Taylor said that he went there to produce Duck—I said, "It is no use; you should go to Messrs. Lawrence, the solicitors"—I believe the managing clerk would not receive Duck's statement—Taylor and Duck went to the solicitors for the prosecution, and wanted an interview with the managing clerk; that was between the 5th and the 12th, because on the 12th I went to Scotland, and it was before that—I was examined on the former trial and stated all that I have to-day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 68 <hi rend="italic">E</hi>). I took Duck on the evening of the 6th October in Oxford Street, at the corner of Charles Street, as he was leaving his employment—I told him I had a warrant for his appre<lb></lb>hension, and he would have to go with me to the station—he merely said that he should like to go home—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him a pocket-book, which has been given up, in which was this paragraph cut out of a newspaper—I put my initials on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you produce this piece of paper on the last occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not know that I had got it—I thought I had given up the whole of the papers, and I said so, but I found out afterwards that I was mistaken—I found it in this enve<lb></lb>lope—I recollect your putting the question, and I said that to the best of my belief this was given up also—I was aware it existed, because the name of Turnbull is on it—I put it with other memoranda of my own in my desk in this envelope—I took it out of the pocket-book at the station when he was charged—there was nothing in the pocket-book</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070021"></xptr>
               <p>in reference to this charge, but I picked this out of the lot and left the pocket-book at the station in Sergeant Smith's custody—I gave him all in the pocket-book except this paper—I believe I found it in the envelope, but I have executed fifty warrants since, and I really forget—the moment I found it I went to the solicitor and put this writing on it—the pocket-book was given up to the prisoner, and a receipt taken in the usual way next morning, and I thought this was given up—this is my writing on the back, "The advertisement <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Turnbull"—I wrote that subsequently—I took it from his pocket-book, read it, and handed it to the inspector—it was in a plain envelope, and I did not take much notice of it—I recollect showing it to Brett at the time, who said that it was of no importance—I did not read it—I only know that Turnbull name was there, and that Turnbull was the name on the receipt—I do not know how this paper came into my possession again—I found it in my desk—I did not hand the things over to the prisoner, Sergeant Smith did, and this paper must have 'been then put into my hands—I found it in an en<lb></lb>velope and knew what it was, and put it in my desk at the station—when I said on the last occasion that to the best of my belief it was given to the prisoner I did not know that I had it in my desk—as soon as I found it I sent it to the attorneys for the prosecution, and since the last trial I put this on it—I looked in my desk and found it after your questions on the last occasion—I did not know where to go and find it, I had great dif<lb></lb>faculty in finding it because it was among a lot of other papers—these are my initials, T. R.—the moment I found it I put my initials on it, that I might know it was the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were not the officer engaged in the case, you were only executing the warrant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was all—it is my duty to take all property found in a prisoner's possession, and I did that duty in respect of the prisoner Duck, and the property was pnt with the acting inspector, the sergeant on duty at the station, who has a private cupboard for such things—the things taken from Duck were put in that private cupboard, and when he was bailed they were restored to him, which is the practice, unless there is anything particular—I did not attach the slightest importance to it until I was asked about it on the last occasion.</p>

On the 19th September I appeared before Mr. Commissioner Goulburn as a bankrupt; it was an application for discharge—I know nothing about this receipt or the transaction to which it relates—I do not know that I ever saw either of the prisoners—I have not had rheumatism in my hands or anything to prevent me from writing.</p>

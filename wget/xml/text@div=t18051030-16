               <p>Q. What did he say to your boy? - A. He said he was one of the people that took his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the little boy put in charge of a constable? - A. No; I got the hat away when he found it would not fit him; I had seen him drunk different days; this was a very dark night, and he called out, thieves; then he flew to my child.</p>

             from Bengal, he was discharged from the ship on Sunday; he first came on shore at Gravesend on Saturday night, he supped at Gravesend, and on the next day, Sunday, he came up to London, and lodged at Mr. Poltry's, who could prove when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>

            (To Macklewell.) Do you take upon you to say that this man had been in the neighbourhood before? - A. I can safely say so; it was on Monday night the affair happened, I had just left my work, and my boy came to the door; this man pledged his watch two or three days before in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. Because a person told me so at the London Dock.</p>
               <p>- NOWLAND sworn. - I am an officer: On the 27th of September, I went along with the prosecutor and the interpreter to Mrs. Macklewell's house; on the 25th, I believe, the prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to know how long this man had been on shore? - A. No; I asked Mrs. Macklewell if she knew of a foreigner having been robbed at her door; she said she saw him surrounded by four or five chaps, and one she knew, he squinted; they ran away, and the squint-eyed one was the last that staid by him; Smith stood by, and Cadouza's nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say whether she saw any thing taken from him? - A. No; she said he made a great noise, and they ran away, and he snatched hold of her boy, and took his hat off his head.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What did you hear Mrs. Macklewell say? - A. I heard her say, the squint-eyed one, Moses, was up and down the lane, and there were four or five about him.</p>
               <p>- CADOUZA sworn. - I heard Mrs. Macklewell say she saw people about him, and that the squinting-eyed one, Moses, was the last about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she then represent herself as being present at the time when that which has been represented as a robbery took place? - A. Yes.</p>

            (To Macklewell.) You have heard what these three witnesses have said - do you take upon you to contradict what they have said, and to state that you never mentioned of your having seen them about him? - A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Not to your recollection - this is a circumstance that you cannot be ignorant of - upon your peril state that you never held any such conversation? - A. I do not know that I did, I might say many things in my fright; a squint-eyed man, it is impossible that I could see in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so? - A. Not to my knowledge, I do not know that ever I did.</p>

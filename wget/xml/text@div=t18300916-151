On the 3rd of September I had in my drawer six sovereigns, two crowns, six half-crowns, and six shillings, and on a cloth at the top of the drawer was another shilling - I had seen my house-keeper mark two of the sovereigns, and between eleven and twelve o'clock I placed them myself in the drawer, which I locked, put the key under the cloth, and locked the room door; it was the first floor back-room - the window was shut down; I locked the key of the room-door in a cupboard, and put the key into my waistcoat-pocket - I went up stairs between two and three o'clock, in consequence of what my house-keeper told me, and found the money gone; she had before that applied to me for the key of the room, and found the drawer open - I found a piece of paper, which I had wrapped the money in, laid carelessly on the drawers; the window was open - I saw foot-marks in a chair under the window, with brick and lime on it; the prisoner was my apprentice - I immediately made my loss known to all the lodgers, and went before a Magistrate that evening, to complain against two boys, who were discharged; when I returned from the office, the prisoner was at home - I did not charge him with it; he went to bed shortly after, I came in, and left the house next morning; he knew I had been robbed, and that some of the money was marked - he was brought to me on Sunday morning by a lodger; I sent for an officer - he was searched, and a gold pin found on him; it was not mine; after he was taken to the station, the officer (Shepherd) brought his lace-up boots, and compared them with the foot-marks, both on the chair and on the leads outside the window - they appeared to fit it; I could see the length and width of the shoe on the mark - he was examined on Monday, and remanded; on returning from the office, Hunderiakes, Jane, and Thomas Stott, and other lodgers were in the house; the house was all searched - we found a small hole, about an inch and a-half long, in the prisoner's pillow, and inside the pillow

             found a sovereign wrapped up in a bit of paper; I believe it to be one of those I had marked - he sleeps under the shop counter; I found a crack in the shop flooring, and under that a crown piece wrapped in a piece of paper - I saw Jane Stott find it; this was on the evening of the 6th.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been with you? A. From the 4th of March, 1826 - I did not know he was going to leave; I had had no words with him - I suppose the gold pin was worth about 3s.; I had never seen him with it before - my housekeeper always had access to the drawer, as the key was always under the napkin; I am sure the window was close down when I went out - it is a sash window; there is no fastening to it - I have recovered no more money.</p>

On the 3rd of September I was living in the prosecutor's house, and saw him place this money in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160072"></xptr>drawer; I had marked two of the sovereigns, one on the head side over the ear with three little marks, the other with a cross on the side of the horse's nose or mouth, that it the one found - I had marked that one on the Sunday previous, and I saw the mark on it after eleven o'clock on the Friday; I went out, returned, and got the key from the prosecutor; I went to the room about two o'clock, and found the window and drawer open - the window was shut down when I left the room at eleven o'clock with Wilkinson; finding the window open I went down without looking for the money, and brought Wilkinson up - I saw the mark on the chair and on the leads; I was present on Monday when the sovereign was found in the prisoner's pillow, and knew it to be the one I had marked the Sunday before - the prisoner left the house on Saturday morning, between seven and eight o'clock; I came down about half-past seven - he was then in the shop, but I did not see him any more: I did not speak to him, and did not know he was going away.</p>

            . I lodged at Wilkinson's, and am out of a situation. I apprehended the prisoner in Smithfield on Sunday morning, at half-past eight o'clock, with another boy - it was the fair time; I saw him searched at his master's, and a gold pin and two had halfpence found on him - I made him no threat or promise; I asked him what he had done with his master's money, which he took from the drawer - he said he did not take it, and knew nothing about it; I said none of the lodgers knew any thing about it - he then said it was lost to the housekeeper for ever, and then he said his master had it - I asked him about the pin; he said he had found a brooch in Smithfield, all trod-over with mud and bent to pieces - he showed it to me; I said it was a pin - I was present when his boots were compared with the marks on the chair, the leads, and on the wall; they fitted the marks in those places - I saw the sovereign and crown-piece found; the pin was not bent when I saw it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, declaring his innocence and stating, that he had left in consequence of receiving brutal treatment from his master, because he paid more respect to the prosecutor's wife than to the housekeeper, with whom he cohabited.</p>

            . The Prisoners and I agreed for some hundred Weight of broken Glass Bottles; they came to take them away, and I missed seven Bottles of Cherry-Brandy. - I missed them before the Prisoners went away, and sent for a Marshal's Man to take them up; there were three of them; one of whom made himself an Evidence, but I have not seen him since; they had a Boat which lay at Whitehall-Stairs, which they carried the Glass to; there was eleven or twelve Hundred Weight; but they had not taken it all away, when I missed the Cherry-Brandy. They took it away by a Bag at a Time, of about an Hundred Weight. While they were carrying the Glass away I missed some Bottles of Cherry-Brandy, and I found two in the Boat, and another in the Bag, which they had not taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dixon. I never was out of the Prosecutor's House all the Time, I was all the Time in the Cellar.</p>
               <p>Borwick. I believe he was not out of the House all the Time for he held the Bag, and he that made himself an Evidence filled the Bag.</p>

I would not desire to bear a better; he was a Dray-Man to Mr Thrale the Brewer; he left off that Business because he broke his Leg; he was not turned away for any Fault. - He bears as good a Character as any Man in the World.</p>

                  </hi>. I arrived by the Birmingham train at the Euston Hotel, on the 25th of Nov., 1841—my luggage consisted of six packages, among which was a gun and case, a powder-flask, and other things named in this indictment—I counted all my luggage after I arrived, and it was correct—the parcels were brought by two porters from the Railway station, and put in a heap on the floor of the hall of the Euston Hotel—this is my gun-case, powder-flask, and shot-pouch—the ease then had a gun in it—the proprietor of the hotel paid me 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my loss.</p>

The prisoner was hall porter—the prosecutor arrived, and I saw his luggage safe in the hall—I marked his luggage, and the gun-case among the rest, with the number of his room—I saw it safe at eleven o'clock, when I went to bed, under the window in the hall—I missed it in the morning when the prosecutor went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a locksmith, and live in Drummond-crescent. Three or four weeks after Christmas I was sent for to No. 20, Southampton-street, about a gun-case—I found the prisoner there—I did not know he lived these—I saw a gun-case there in his presence—his friend had sent for me to open it, and fit a key, and when I got there the prisoner told me to open it—it was very much like this gun-case—there was a man named Lowe there, who came for me—I opened the case, and there was a double-barrelled gun, a powder-flask, a shot-pouch, and some copper caps, in it—I went with the prisoner to a beer-shop in Chapel-street, and had some drink—Lowe lived in the room in which I opened the case—Lowe sent for me twice, and the prisoner the third time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might it have been three months after this before the prisoner left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might possibly—we should not have kept him if he had not conducted himself honestly—I did not have a character with him—I had several references, and I did not think it worth while to make any further inquiries—on the occasion of his being discharged, he had been out on Sunday, and got drinking, and did not return till the next morning—the information about this gun-case was received anonymously—I have found out the person who sent it—I shall not state who it is—I have the communication here, but I shall not hand it in, nor state whether the person I received it from is em<lb></lb>ployed about the Railway or not—I have not found the gun—mistakes have frequently been made at our hotel about the luggage—it cannot be avoided—a great number of persons come by every train, and porters bring in luggage at all hours.</p>

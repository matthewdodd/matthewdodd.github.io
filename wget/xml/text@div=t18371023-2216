                  </hi>. I was at work on Friday, the 18th of September, at the railroad at Hillingdon, and about twelve o'clock in the day I took off my jacket, smock-frock, and waistcoat—I saw Kelly come and take them—he ran off for half a mile—I ran after him—I only knew him by light—he went into a public house—I went after him, and asked where my things were—he said he did not know—I looked about and found my jacket under the settle, and the smock-frock was in Turner's arms—I did. not say any thing to him—James was in the privy, and Turner went to him with the frock—I stopped till they came out—Turner came out first, and then James came out with it on his back—I asked him for it—he said he would not give it me, that he would be back by-and-bye—Turner and James then both went away—I told them it was mine—I think I found them on Monday, at a public-house near the iron bridge at Hillingdon—I asked Kelly whether they were going to find my smock again—he said, "Yes"—I asked him when—he said he did not know when—Turner took my hat off on the Thursday night before the robbery, and after a bit be came to me, and pretended he was drunk—my handkerchief was on my neck, and he took it off.</p>

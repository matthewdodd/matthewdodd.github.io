                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Lancet, a tailor, of 12, Crosby-row, Walworth—in Dec. last we were living in Steward-street, in the liberty of the Tower, the house of Mr. Hyman, my brother-in-law; the prisoner was his servant. On 10th Dec. I missed my purse, containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a silver coin with a small hole in it, from the pocket of my dress, which I left on a chair in my sister's bed-room—on Saturday, 13th Dec., I went to my sister's to search for the money—I looked in the cupboard in the kitchen, and saw the prisoner's box there—I know it was hers because she claimed it—I found in it a purse, which was not mine, which contained at one end 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in gold and silver, and my coin, and at the other end 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and this ring—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the coin I lost—I had had it about twelve months—I told the prisoner there was my money in her box—she made no reply—afterwards she said it was her own; that was about a quarter of an hoar before the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale-furrier—I married the sister of the last witness; she has been living with us twelve years. On 13th Dec. I came home, about 2 o'clock—my sister-in-law showed me a purse and a ring, which belonged to my daughter, who is twelve years old—I went down to the kitchen, and said, "Mary, this is a bad job; how is it you have been stealing Miss Julia's purse?"—she said she had not done so; it was her own money—I asked her if the ring was her own, and said she had better tell the truth—she said she found the ring when she was making Miss Rose's bed—this is the ring; it is of very trifling value—there is no mark on it—my daughter had not worn it—she only used to have it to play with—the prisoner's wages were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she had lived with us not quite three months, and had had about a month's wages—I had not paid her as much as 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but she had about half a guinea given to her in presents, when we had a party—we had a very good character with her.</p>

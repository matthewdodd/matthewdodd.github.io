                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Hames. We keep a beer-shop at Hillingdon—the prisoner came there about half-past three o'clock on 5th Aug.—he asked for some beer and bread and cheese—I took it in in this plate and knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he went away, and as soon as he was gone I missed the plate and the knife—I sent Clarke after him.</p>

                  </hi>. I went after the prisoner, and overtook him about 150 yards off—I asked him for the knife and plate he took from Mrs. Hames—he told me he had no such things about him—I told him if he did not give them up, I should go for a policeman—in two or three minutes he threw this plate from him on the ground; I took it up—I then walked with him halfway to Hillingdon—I still asked him to give me the knife—he ran on, and soon afterwards the policeman overtook me—I went with him, and found the prisoner concealed behind a tree—the officer found the knife on him—he had not been out of my sight two minutes—he was not sober.</p>

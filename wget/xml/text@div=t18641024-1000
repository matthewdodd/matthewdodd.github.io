                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Barrett, and we keep a to<lb></lb>bacconist's shop in Plumstead—on 20th September the prisoner came in and asked for half an ounce of tobacco, and gave me a shilling—after he left the shop I weighed the shilling, and found it was bad—I ran out to find the prisoner, but could not—I put the shilling in a box by itself—on 5th Octo<lb></lb>ber, between 3 and 4, the prisoner came again—he asked for half an ounce of tobacco, which was three-halfpence, and gave me a bad two-shilling piece—I was prepared for him; I recognised him again—I waited to see what he would give me—I placed it between my teeth and found it was bad, and ran round the counter—I caught hold of him, and said, You villain, this is the third time I have caught you with bad money; now I will give you in charge"—I had a friend in the shop, who went for a constable, and I gave him the florin and the shilling—the prisoner said, when I caught hold of him, that I must be mistaken, for he had never been in the shop before.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 14th of July, Miller spoke to me in Stoney-lane, and asked if I knew a person who would earn a shilling—I said, "What for?"—he said, "To draw a truck with a cask of oil on it"—I said I would have no objection to do it—he said he would give me a shilling and a glass of gin—I went with him, and found the truck in Tooley-street—he said I was to take it to his house—I went as far as King-street in the Borough—I left Miller in Tooley-street-when I got to King-street, a policeman stopped me-Ross then came up, and desired roe to take it back again, but the constable took me and the truck to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, and live at 141, St. John-st. West Smith<lb></lb>field. On the night of the 1st of Nov. I fastened up my shop-door and all my premises—it is my dwelling-house—I put the key of the shop in my pocket, and went to bed—next morning William Donoghue, my foreman, came to my bed-room for the keys—I gave them to him—in a minute or two after he returned, and made some communication—I went down, and found that my shop had been broken open—an entry bad been made at the shop-door—there were marks of violence on it—I missed from three shelves, some cloths, kerseymeres, and doeskins, which had been placed there the previous night, and two rolls of brown beaver and olive cloth from the counter, about seventy yards altogether, which were safe when I went to bed the night before—the lock of the shop<lb></lb>door had been wrenched off, the shutter wrenched from its fastening, the screw gone, and a square of glass taken out—the door was to, and appeared as usual outside, but was only on the latch—in my judgment the breaking was decidedly from the outside—a portion of the beading beneath the shutter was broken away, and the part injured was daubed with mud—I saw some spots of tallow near the lower bolt on the floor—my desk, which was a fixture on the counter, was broken open, but I missed nothing from it—there were papers in it, and I saw spots of tallow on them—the value of all the property lost was about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's foreman, and live with him. I retired to bed before my master on this night—I got up about half-past six o'clock in the morning, and about ten minutes past seven I went to my mas<lb></lb>ter for the keys of the shop—I found the shop-door leading into the passage locked as usual—I unlocked it, and entered the shop—I missed a piece of cloth, and a piece of beaver from the counter, which I had put there the night before—I also missed cloth from three of the shelves, which I had seen the night before—I went and told my master, and informed the police—on Mon<lb></lb>day the 6th, about a quarter to two, I went to Mr. Attenborough, the pawn<lb></lb>broker's in Crown-street, Finsbury, and there saw about thirty-five yards of the cloth which bad been stolen—this now produced is it—there are six pieces—about an hour after, I went in company with Mr. Attenborough's shopman, my master, and Dewer, a policeman, to Bradshaw's house, No. 1, East-street,</p>

               <p>Finsbury-market—I saw the elder male prisoner in the shop, it was a tailor's shop—he was asked where he got the cloths from, that he had sent to be pledged at Mr. Attenborough's—he said he had bought them by patterns of a man named Hodges, I understood, but am not confident, and something was said by him about taking us to the man—in about twenty minutes or half an hour young Bradshaw came down stairs, on being asked for—before he came the elder Bradshaw had repeated the same thing, that he had bought them, I do not know that he mentioned Hodges again—he said that patterns had been brought to him, and he bought them by those patterns—I think nothing was said in young Brad<lb></lb>shaw's presence about these cloths—they were taken into custody, and taken to the station—the elder Bradshaw asked if any body owned the cloths—I said "I believe I do"—I swear positively to all these produced by Pawley being my master's property, and part of what was missing, except the piece of black which has been cut—we missed black of exactly such quality, appearance and dye—here are two pieces produced by Wentworth which are my master's, and part of what were missing—here are two yards and five-eights of list produced by Beaumont, which I believe to have been cut from the beaver, one of the six pieces I have spoken of—it corresponds in quantity as near as can be—there is about a trowser's length gone from one or two of the pieces—these small pieces of cloth produced by Dewer correspond exactly with some of the missing cloth, and also with some of those pieces which are produced.</p>

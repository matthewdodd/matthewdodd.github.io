                  </hi>. I live at 211, Cater Street, Peckham, and am a pensioner in the Royal Marines—on Monday, the 4th October, I went up to the Greenwich Pension Office to draw my pension—I took with me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and drew from the Pension Office 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I afterwards went into a public-house in Greenwich; I cannot tell the name—I had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of bread and cheese and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of beer—I went into another public-house first and had a glass of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of bread and cheese—I was by myself—I then went into the Cape of Good Hope in King Street, Deptford—I was alone and it was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner was in the bar when I went in and some conversation ensued between us about joining Her Majesty's service—I paid for a pot of ale which we were drinking in front of the bar—the prisoner suggested that "we had better go into the tap-room" and sit down"—we went in together. and another pensioner was there, who remained about twenty minutes—when we were alone I drank some of the beer and very shortly afterwards became quite insensible—when I recovered the prisoner was cutting my right-hand trousers pocket out with a knife, I could not recognise the knife—that is my knife; white handle, two blades, and a little bit broken out of the handle—this is the cut pocket—the prisoner ran out, I told the landlord—I have not seen any of my money since—I got my knife again from the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Cape of Good Hope, Deptford—on the afternoon of the 4th October the prisoner was at my bar—in twenty minutes or more the prosecutor came in—the other pensioner was in previously—he belonged to Deptford and was not in his company at all—the three dropped into some conversation in front of the bar and the topic was advising the young man to enlist to better his condition—he was in a deplorable state then—he was very shabby and he suggested going into the taproom—the prisoner took the beer in—about twenty minutes afterwards the other prisoner came out, and the other two were left in the room together—I should think about twenty minutes after that I was in the bar, and I saw the prisoner rush through in a violent manner, and I said "Some<lb></lb>thing is wrong," and ran to the street door to see if I could see him, and it appeared he turned into a turning where there was no thoroughfare—I went into the taproom and found the prosecutor in a state of insensibility, and I asked him what was the matter—I looked at his pockets and saw one was cut out entirely, and a portion of the other taken off—I sent for the police and soon after the police came we saw the prisoner some distance off and we both pursued him and followed him into a coal shed where we took him—he said to the constable that he only had a sovereign and that belonged to him, his own hard earnings and he threw this knife away, and I went and picked it up, we took him to the station-house, and the money was found 011 him.</p>

I was on duty in the High Street, Deptford, on the afternoon in question and was called by the last witness, and we ran after the prisoner, whom we caught in a coalshed in King Street and told him he was charged with robbing a man—he said he had two or three pounds in money that he had worked hard for—he didn't say he had only sovereign; he had a soverign in his hand at the time—I took him to the station—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said "Don't say anything more about, it won't do you any good, I done it"—a little further on he put his hand in his pocket and pulled a knife out and said "Allow me to throw this knife away, it belongs to the man"—it was picked up by last witness and given to me—I have kept it since—after he was charged at the station I searched him and found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in bronze.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went into the Cape of Good Hope and this man says he was a sergeant-major of marines. I didn't know whether he was or wasn't. He says "He would make a smart young soldier if he would enlist with us; you had better come with me and live the life of a gentle<lb></lb>man". I said "I can earn that" (showing the money in my pocket) "and I am not going into the army for less." We had a holiday on that day. When I went out the policeman and landlord ran after me, and they says to me "Run," and I just stepped into the shed. I said to the policeman "The money I have here I have worked hard for."I never robbed a man in my life that I am aware. I own to his knife.</p>

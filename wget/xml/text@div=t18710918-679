About 3.30 on the morning 2nd Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was in Britannia Street, Hoxton—I saw the two prisoners come out of a recess in Britannia Street, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's shop—Tumbler was trying to conceal something under his coat—I went after them, and they both ran away—Tumbler threw away a parcel, but I did not stop to see what it was—he was caught in my sight by another constable—I went back to where I saw the parcel thrown, and picked up a pair of trowsers.</p>

On the night of 2nd Septem<lb></lb>ber, I received a communication from 285 N, in consequence of which I apprehended Willett about 4 o'clock in Shepherdess Walk—he was coming out of a court where there was no thoroughfare—I asked him what he had under his arm when I first saw him—he said "Nothing"—I asked him what he had been doing, and he said he had not been doing anything—I had seen him go into the court with something under his arm; he had not got anything when I spoke to him—he said he had not been down the court, he had been sitting on the kerb in the streets all night.</p>

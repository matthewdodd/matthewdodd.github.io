                  </hi>. I am footman to Mrjor Brooks Bridges Palby, of Rut<lb></lb>land-gate, Knightsbridge. On Saturday, the 28th of Sept., I heard a ring at the area bell—I was in the area, and saw the prisoner—he said he had come from Mr. Hardy's, for a piece of beef that was left in mistake, which was to go up to the floor-cloth manufactory, that it was a larger piece than was intended to come, and he would be back in about ten minutes—the cook asked me to let him down the area—I directed him towards the kitchen—the cook went and got the meat, and the prisoner came up the steps with it in a butcher's tray—I followed him—he went in a contrary direction to the floor-cloth manufactory—I followed nearly half a mile down the road—I then spoke to Mott, the policeman, and pointed out the prisoner to him—he was going along the road, with the tray on his shoulder—I went and seized hold of him—he put the beef down, and said, "You have got the beef, and let me go"—I said I should not, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Grove-terrace, Brompton. I serve Major Palby with meat—on Saturday morning, the 28th of Sept., I sent a piece of beef weighing 121bs. there—I did not send the pri<lb></lb>soner to fetch it away, or to promise to bring a smaller piece in its place, or to take it to the floor-cloth manufactory—I have a customer there—I supply the two—I never saw the prisoner before this—I had no order for beef from the floor-cloth manufactory on the Saturday—if he used my name, it was wholly without my authority.</p>

Griffiths pointed out the prisoner to me—he was going down Kensington Gore, carrying a butcher's tray, with a piece of beef in it—Griffith stopped him in the park—on the way to the station the prisoner said he had better do that than starve.</p>

Nothing of the kind was mentioned to the Magistrate—the prisoner told me to go to Queen's-buildings, Brompton, that his hat was under a woman's stall there, and that he had got her to take care of it—I</p>

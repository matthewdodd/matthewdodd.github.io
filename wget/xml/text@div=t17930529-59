When I came nigh the place this William Sanders followed me and says here is my fine woman; with that he called to me and said, Mrs. Marshall I want to speak to you; on which I went up to him, and the first word he said to me was, fine woman, are you going to give me any gin? I told him I had no gin money, it was better for him to take and pay me what he owed me; he then called me a very bad name, a bloody whore, and up with his hand and knocked me down; when I was going to get up, he upped with his foot and kicked me in the mouth, and knocked three of my teeth out; my blood gushed out with a deal of blood, and I spit my teeth out on the ground; I immediately catched hold of him, and tore his shirt; I fixed on him and laid hold of him by the shirt, and tore his shirt; with that he laid hold of me by the hair of my head, and he dragged me into the stable, and he threw me under an horse, and he hit the horse to make it stand on me; I cried out for mercy, and he saw the horse startlish, and he took me by the right hand to pull me from underneath the horse and immediately I dropped the money, and he took and dragged me towards the door, and kicked and beat me very much; he pulled me from there to throw me some where else about the stable; immediately as he saw the money drop he directly dragged me towards the door, and kicked me in a woful manner; I ran out of the stable as fast as I could.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do after all this? - I ran away, and left my money behind, and left my shoes, handkerchief and cap, in the stable, and ran home immediately; I don't live a stone's throw off; I left the money there, I did not take a farthing; I ran home and put on an old pair of shoes, and returned back to the stable again to see if he would give me my money; he had turned my shoes, handkerchief and cap, out on the dunghill, and he was gone; I immediately went down to his mistress in the bloody condition I was in, and she turned me out of doors, and said I had no business there; I left the money in the stable on the litter where he made me drop it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Andrews. I was in Liquor; but not so much, but that I was sensible of what was done: - there was 7 s. 6 d. in Silver, and the rest in Half-pence: she gave a Knock with her Foot, and there came a Man into the Room, who threatned to throw me out of Window, and throw me down Stairs if I said any thing; I should have taken the Money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290006"></xptr> from her if it had not been for the Man: I charged the Constable with the Prisoner, and a Watchman with the other Woman (Yates) to keep her in Safety, that I might find out the House; and the next Day she came voluntarily, and went before the fitting Alderman: the next Day, after the Constable had her in hold, they told me if I went into the Room I might find my Money, and I took the Money off the Middle of the Quilt on the Bed in the same Room - there were Eleven Shillings - when I went into the House with the Constable he searched for the Prisoner, and she was lying up. on the same Bed. -</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was your Money that was upon the Bed?</p>

               <p>Q. Had she any Intention of Lewdness with you, do you think?</p>

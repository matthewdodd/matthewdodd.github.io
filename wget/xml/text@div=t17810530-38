               <p>On Sunday morning, the 22d of April, going down to the water-side, at two o'clock, I missed the malt mentioned in the indictment, out of the barge. I took a boat, and went down the river. In coming by <placeName id="t17810530-38-crimeloc177">Wapping, at Union-stairs</placeName>

Her stern and her head were very lofty; that led me to think something was in her. I examined the punt, and found 17 sacks I had lost; my name was on 10 of them.</p>
               <p>What wharf is your barge moored at? - Wright's wharf, in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. There were 157 quarters of corn on board, in 314 sacks.</p>
               <p>When you came down on the Sunday morning, what did you miss? - I saw a great hole on one side. I examined it. There were 17 sacks missing, containing four bushels each.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Who did that punt belong to? - The prisoner's father. The prisoner worked in it. He built a fine place in it for the reception of himself and a boy in the night.</p>
               <p>He was not on board when you found the sacks? - No; she was made fast to a Dutchman, and nobody on board.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Craft are often taken from one place to another by people that do not belong to them? - I cannot answer for that: our craft is often turned adrift.</p>

            , my father, who is a waterman. I was in the skiff with Bevan when he took the corn out of the prosecutor's barge, and put it into the punt. He took first five quarters in the skiff, and carried it to his punt, and put it in his punt; then he went and took three quarters more, and Clod took the punt to Union-stairs: then we came along-side the punt, and put the three quarters in, and laid there till morning; then we went on shore.</p>

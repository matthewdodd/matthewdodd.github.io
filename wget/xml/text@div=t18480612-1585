I have heard you have found the other flour, and I will not get anybody into trouble on my account; those people have beenkind friends to me (mentioning their names); I sent it by my little girl, and what I have done I will take upon myself: it was the flour I had of Cheeseman"—I had learned from Cheeseman that this room was his, and Ifound his coat there with brass and lead in the pockets—I had seen himwearing that coat on several occasions, and he claimed it at the station andasked me to let him wear it.</p>

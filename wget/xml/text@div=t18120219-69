He was stopped by a person.</p>

               <p>Q. Who stopped him - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your handkerchief - A. Not till a boy told me the person was running away that took my handkerchief, they saw him take it; the boy is not here; I could not find the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had the handkerchief with you at Lincoln's Inn-fields - A. No, I do not. About half an hour before I felt, I had a handkerchief in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

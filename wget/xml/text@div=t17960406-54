               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; on the 1st of March, we lost the things mentioned in the indictment, they were taken out of my bed-room drawers; the prisoner was my servant, I had seen them the day before; I went out about three, I returned about seven, but did not miss the things that night; when I came home, I went up stairs, and found my drawers had been opened, I had left them locked, but I did not miss any thing that night; the prisoner was in the house; I would not suffer any of them to go out, because I had several servants; and the next morning I went to take a gown out of the drawer and found it was gone, and then I missed the other articles; I told the prisoner I was sure she had taken the things, and she strongly denied it several times; I saw my property again before the Lord-Mayor, on the 3d of March.</p>

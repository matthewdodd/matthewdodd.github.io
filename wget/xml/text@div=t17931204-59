               <p>I am an officer, No. 36, Barbican. On Tuesday the 19th, about a quarter after eleven, the prisoner came to my shop with a piece of oak on his shoulder, he pitches it off his shoulder into my shop, and he says, here master, here is a piece of wood for a pot of beer; I had a customer in the shop that I was serving, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040154"></xptr>soon as I had served the customer I went round to him, I asked him how he came by it, he said it was a parish affair, and I might as well buy it as another, he said he was at work at one the church vaults, and he brought it away from there; saysI, I suppose it belongs to the clerk of the parish, he says, yes, I desired him to put it on his shoulder and go along with me to the clerk, but he refused that; when I went down to Mr. Ayscough the clerk of our parish, he knew neither the man nor the timber, and I was going along with him up to Guildhall, to the sitting magistrate, and going along he cried, and said that he took it out of Mr. Brown's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise before? - None at all, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a new piece? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Court to Webb. What is it worth? - Two shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is customary amongst us carpenters to take chips, and fire wood to burn, or make the price of a pint; this piece I took out of the yard, it being a black piece I did not know but it was an old piece, so I said to the sawyer as I was coming out, I will make a pot of beer of this, says he I will have half of it; so I went to the gentleman's house and asked no more than a pot of beer; so I hope you will take it into consideration, I beg for your mercy, so I leave it to your lordship and the mercy of the court.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Webster. Did you say you would have the beer with him? - I did not.</p>

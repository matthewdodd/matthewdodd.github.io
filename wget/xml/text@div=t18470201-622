                  </hi> I am the wife of William Budding, of park-terrace, King's-road, Chelsea. Some few weeks ago the prisoner came to my shop—there were several customers there—after I had served them, she asked me to change two half-quartern loaves which her little sister had bought—I was to give her a brick loaf for the two little loaves which she produced—I gave her the brick loaf, and put the two small loaves on the shelf—I am positive I had served no bread whatever to anybody—no little girl had bought two loaves—the prisoner went away—I saw her again coming out of a shop opposite, with the quartern brick under her arm—I called her across to my shop, and said, "You have not paid me for that quartern brick"—she said, "Have I not? give me change for a half-a-sovereign." which she produced—I gave her two half-crowns, four shillings. and some pence, deducting for the loaf—she said, "What is your bread?"—I said, "7 1/2 d"—she said, "I cannot pay but 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, your bread?"—I said, "7 1/2 d"—she said, "I cannot pay but 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "Very well, give me my change"—she gave me four shillings and one half-crown—I said, "That is not at all"—she shuffled among some plates, and said, "Oh, dear, here it is!" and then gave me the other half-crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she come back to your shop from the opposite shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called her back—she had been cheated out of the bread, because I knew I had not sold any, and she had stolen those two small loaves off my counter—I found they had been removed, and I had exchanged them for a brick, under the idea that she was telling the truth—she gave me back her full change—I gave her back the half-sovereign, and she went away—I missed the small loaves off the shelf directly—they were two crusty half-quartern bricks—I then recollected that she could not have bought them—she said her little sister had just bought them at my shop.</p>

               <p>loaves on the shelf about a quarter of an hour before—I was serving alone in the shop—there was nobody but me to have served them—I cannot under<lb></lb>take to say how many loaves I sold that day, but am certain I had not sold any half-quaterns during the last half-hour—I will not swear I did not sell two such loaves during the day—she took the loaves off the shelf while I was engaged—I did not see her with them when she entered the shop—I saw her enter the shop—she had a basket, but it would not hold them—she did not come back with two loaves in her hand—after I had served my customers, I asked her what she wanted, and she asked me to change the two half-quartern loaves which her little sister had just bought.</p>

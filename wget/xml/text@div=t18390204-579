                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN RICHARD CARTER</hi>. I am a common informer, and live in Para<lb></lb>dise-street, Lambeth—the prisoner is a hackney-coach driver. In May last I appeared against him about driving a coach—on the night of the 16th of January, shortly before ten o'clock, I went into Palace-yard with Fel<lb></lb>stead for tlie purpose of taking a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to go home—I had not been there many minutes when I saw a person named Norris go into the tap under the King's Arms tavern there—he came out shortly after with one Job<lb></lb>bins and several others—Felstead was assaulted by Jobbins, who com<lb></lb>menced beating him with a bludgeon, a thick stick—Norris said, "Go it! give it 'em!"—I called "Police" as loud as I could, and while doing so I was knocked down by the prisoner—I had not said or done any thing to him—after I was down he fell upon me, and inflicted a wound on my chin, which cut. It very nearly to the bone—I lost my hat in the struggle, and picked up another, which, to the best of my belief, was the one which the prisoner wore—that hat is now in the constable's possession—my chin bled profusely—I made the best of my way home, and, as soon as I could, got assistance from Mr. Collambell, a surgeon.</p>

I believe—I recollect giving her something perfectly well—I have a doubt about how much, but I think it was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Felstead is one of the same class with me—he is my assistant—he gives evidence on oath—I stated at the police office that Jobbins assaulted Fel<lb></lb>stead, and that Norris said, "Go it, give it 'em"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)</p>

               <p>—this is my hand-writing—I do not think what I said was taken down it the exact terms I gave it—I believe the words in the deposition are "Fel<lb></lb>stead was assaulted"—I swear I mentioned the name of Jobbins—what was taken down was read over to me—I was not particularly desired to attend to it, but I did attend to it—I signed it—I did not tell the clerk he had not taken it correctly—the substance was there—I told the Magistrate that I was knocked down by the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read, was</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">"he was assaulted by a man there"</hi>)—I had been taking some<lb></lb>thing to drink that evening—I had drank at the Shades at Charing-cross, and at another house in St. Martin's-lane—I do not know the sign—I might have been to other places, but I do not recollect it—I may have been in one or two more houses—I was in one in Palace-yard—that is all to the best of my recollection—I swear positively I was not in three others—there might have been one other—the first was in St. Martin's-lane, the second in St. Martin-street, the third at Charing-cross, and then in the neighbourhood of Palace-yard—they are all I recollect, and I think I can swear positively that is all.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 16th of January I was in company with Carter all day—I am also a common informer—at near ten o'clock at night we were at the coach-stand in Palace-yard—neither of us were at all the worse for liquor—after we had been there a very short time a person named Norris went down into the tap of the public-house, and in a short time the prisoner and fifteen or sixteen more came up—the tap is a low cellar under the King's Arms tavern—a man named Jobbins began beating me with a bludgeon, and Norris said, "Go it, give it 'em"—Carter called out "Police," and Jobbins ran away—I turned round and saw the prisoner knock Carter down with his fist—they both fell together, and when the pri<lb></lb>soner got up I saw something in his hand which I thought was the blade of a knife—Carter was cut across the chin two inches or two inches and a half in length, and was bleeding very fast—he had lost his hat—there was another old hat lying on the pavement, which he took—I took him home, and a surgeon attended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell the Magistrate that Jobbins knocked you down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he did not knock me down—I did not hear Carter examined—I told the Magistrate the name of the man who assaulted me with the bludgeon—I swear that—what I said was taken down and read over to me—I did not correct any part of it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, only referred to the assault on the prosecutor</hi>)—I was with Carter all day—William Cave, a person named Lowndes and Clark were with us—we had been drinking at some public-houses in the evening—we were in three or four—I recollect four—we drank in each of them—I have been an in<lb></lb>former three or four years—I am in Carter's service—I swear for him—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Canterbury-place, Lambeth. On the night of the 16th of January I was called in to the prosecutor—I observed a wound on his chin, about an inch, or an inch and a quarter, or rather better, in length—it appeared to be an incised wound, made with a cutting instrument—I consider it could not have been made by a blow of any blunt instrument, or by falling against any thing, because then it must have been a contused wound—the skin would then be lacerated and uneven, but the edge of an incised wound would be perfectly clean—it was not a bruise—I considered it an incised wound—I dressed his face at his own house on two succeeding days—I called on the third day, and he was out—I attended him twice after that at his own house—it was a deep wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Suppose a man fell on a sharp flint, would not that give the appearance of an incised wound? I should say not—it would not give it the appearance that wound had, nor would a piece of glass—it might cut it clean.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

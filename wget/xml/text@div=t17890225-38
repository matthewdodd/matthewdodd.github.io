I missed no other property; I felt my watch drawn out; I told him I was going to No. 11, New Peter-street; he pointed his hand, that is the way, up Great Peter-street; no more passed at that time; he left me, and I went home, I don't know which way he went; I afterwards missed half-a-crown and a shilling, directly after I parted with him, before I got home; the next day I was very bad, I did not go out at all; it was on a Saturday I was robbed; on Monday I went out, and I went round among the pawnbrokers; I found my ring at Mr. Brown's, pawnbroker, in Strutton-ground, Westminster; then I went and got a warrant against the woman that I understood had pawned it; he gave me her name, which he said was Cornwall; I went to the house where I was directed for her, with an officer, to No. 3, Duck-yard; when we went there, we found a woman of the same name, but it was not the prisoner; she went with us to the pawnbroker's; the pawnbroker said, that was not the woman; the woman said, it was one Williams, who had lived there but was gone; this woman said, she would meet us at six o'clock at night to go to some houses, where she thought we might find her, but before night I called, about two o'clock, at the constable's; I had not been in there above five minutes before I received a message; we went both together; I stood at the door, and the constable brought them both out; they were taken before the Justice, and examined; they were searched; I knew the man prisoner again, when he robbed me I observed he had a regimental waistcoat and breeches, but he had a brown great-coat on, he had a flapped hat on, the breeches and things were white, such as they commonly wear; when I saw him again he had on a red jacket, I saw him by the light of the lamp; I have seen the prisoner several times before; and I remembered that night to have seen him before; I had seen him on the Parade, and met him several times, but never had any acquaintance with him; I remembered that night to have seen such a face before on the Parade; I never was in his company, nor did I know where he lived, nor any thing about him; I never heard any thing of my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. What are you? - A carpenter.</p>
               <p>Can you form any judgement how long you had lain on your back before the prisoner came to you? - Not a minute.</p>
               <p>Was you completely stunned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So as to lose your senses for a moment? - For a moment I might.</p>
               <p>You live in the neighbourhood of the Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does it happen to you to know, that when complaints are made against soldiers to the officer, they are mustered on the Parade? - I have heard it talked of, but have never been present.</p>
               <p>You did not take any steps to find out the prisoner? - No, I did not, because I did not know where to find him; I should have applied, if I had not found them in such a short time.</p>
               <p>How much of the Monday did you employ in going to the pawnbrokers? - It might be an hour; I was so ill on the Monday that I did not get out of bed till ten.</p>
               <p>Did you swear to him positively on the 19th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you even swear positively to him on the 22d? Do not you know that at last he was only committed on suspicion, and is so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250066"></xptr>now; did you observe any thing else about this man at the time he robbed you? - When I looked up in his face I took notice of his eyes, he had very full eyes, rather a cast in his eyes.</p>
               <p>The Jury will judge of that observation; it is just the reverse, Do you remember the cast in his eyes? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did not it occur to you, Mr. Christie, as a man with a squint is an uncommon thing in a troop, that it would be mighty easy to find that man out on the Parade? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing else remarkable either about the man or his dress? - No, I did not, but very heavy eye-brows; I thought at the moment I saw him come out of the pawnbroker's, I could have positively sworn to him; the magistrate asked me, if I could swear that that was the man that knocked me down; I told him I could not; I told him it was the man that came to my assistance, and helped me up, and took off my ring; I have frequently seen the soldiers on the Parade, and seen the prisoner in a grenadier's cap.</p>
               <p>The time, as nigh as you can fix it, was twenty minutes past nine. - It was.</p>
               <p>Do you know, whether the man that took your ring had on any gaters on? - I cannot say I observed any.</p>
               <p>Did the man who helped you up come in front of you, or behind? - No, he came in front, I saw no other person near me; I did not look behind; I could not see where he came from, he was standing close by me.</p>

               <p>Court. What made you tell her so? - Because I knew a girl of that name there, and I knew she was not the same; she gave me no other name that night: on Monday morning the 19th, about eight o'clock, Mr. Christie came to my house, and asked, if I had seen such things, which he said he had lost; he mentioned a watch, a gold seal, and a mourning ring with the name upon it; I shewed him the ring, and gave him directions where to go to find the woman, where she said she lived; they did not find here there; about two o'clock the same day (Monday) the two prisoners came to my shop, and she asked me for the ring, very well says I, what is this the man that belongs to it? He made answer, yes; he said he found it on the Parade; I had information in the morning, and I sent for a constable; I know no more; the constable and the prosecutor came directly: the ring was brought to me in the condition it now is, which made me think there was some force used to it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a serjeant in the Coldstream regiment, I have known the prisoner Suiter upwards of six years; he is a <rs id="t17890225-38-deflabel191" type="occupation">grenadier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17890225-38-defend417 t17890225-38-deflabel191"></join>, I was on the same guard he was the 17th of January, which was the King's-guard at St. James's; he mounted that guard at ten o'clock that morning, and went off at ten on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>When did he go centinel? - At ten o'clock that same evening at St. James's; he answered the roll-call at nine that night, I called it myself, it was in the guard-room, Cleveland-row; I saw him under arms a quarter before ten; it is usual to inspect the grenadiers before they go, I did so a quarter before ten, I saw him him dressed in every particular proper to go centinel.</p>
               <p>Explain the difference of a grenadier in the guards, from the other soldiers? - He had a cap on, and his hair platted behind, turned up under the cap, and a large braid very well powdered, it was powdered in the morning, he was in a proper dress to go on his duty, he had white gaters on.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing him in the guard-room at any time between nine and the three quarters? - I might be about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250068"></xptr>eight minutes calling the roll, which consists of one hundred men; no man departs, or is suffered to go out before the roll is called over.</p>
               <p>If the prisoner had been seen in any particular situation in the dress you saw him at the three quarters, do you think it would have escaped the observation of any body; particularly that braid? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What is the distance from the guardroom to St. Ann's-lane? - I think, to the best of my calculation, it is a full English mile.</p>
               <p>Supposing the prisoner to have undressed himself, and to have dressed himself again, so as to be under arms when you saw him, how long would that take him? - He could not put on his white gaters in less than ten minutes, they are very full of buttons, and very hard to put on; or to put on his cap and coat, it would have taken him a quarter of an hour, he can put on his cap himself, and clasp it behind; but it would take some time in doing it.</p>
               <p>Now at the time you inspected, was he in any particular flurry, or did he appear to have run any considerable distance, or to be at all disordered in any manner? - He was not so much disordered as I am now.</p>
               <p>From ten o'clock how long did he continue centinel? - Two hours.</p>
               <p>He could not go off that? - No, he dare not.</p>
               <p>Now do you think, that speaking on your oath, and speaking from caution, it was possible for the prisoner, from twenty minutes past nine, to have come from St. Ann's-lane, and to have equipped himself ready for his duty, in the condition you saw him by a quarter before ten? - I do not think that he could.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as you was in the same regiment for six years, what has been his character as a soldier and a man? - I never knew or heard any thing against him, but being a clean soldier, and always punctual to his duty.</p>
               <p>Did he bear the character of an honest man? - Very honest for any thing I ever heard of.</p>
               <p>Who is his lieutenant-colonel? - Lord Cathcart, he came on the King's guard this morning, or I am very sure he would have appeared.</p>
               <p>(The roll produced, dated 17th February, the prisoner was the third man.)</p>

               <p>I am a private in the guards, I was on the same guard with the prisoner on the 17th of January; he was at the roll-call, I came down from the top guard-room to the lower guard-room, at nine in the evening, the prisoner was sitting in the corner by the fire; after roll-calling there was no place for me to sit, I stood by the fire till the relief turned out; at three quarters after nine, at which time he gave me his place; he was one of the relief, I sat down in his place, and he went centinel, I was talking with him most of the time, I am sure he never went out of the guard-room all that time, if he had gone out I should have had his place, for he promised me it when he went out.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are perfectly satisfied.</p>

On the 31st of March we had been drinking together, and were both a little elated: we had spent the evening together, and came home together about one o'clock in the morning - my servant had given a beer cask to a customer by mistake twelve months before, and the customer had sent a message about it - I spoke to my servant about it, and the prisoner said I should be doing wrong if I deducted it from her wages, which I threatened - I said he had no business to interfere; that affronted him, and he struck me in an indifferent way, and I struck him - I went to the bottom of the stairs, and called to Mrs. Chapman, to know if that conduct was to be tolerated; she was in bed - she dressed partly, and came down; she said, "Bowry, I will not suffer that conduct in my house - you shall go out this instant;" he said he would go - he went up a few stairs, to a little anti-room, where his bed is, and came back with a pistol - I had no idea that it was loaded; he aimed it at me - Mrs. Chapman had found us in combat when she came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no blows or words pass after he came from his room? A. No - he aimed the pistol at me, and fired; I fell back in my chair - I was not wounded, only something struck my eye; I had no idea he would have done such a thing, in consequence of our intimacy, which was of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070083"></xptr>so long standing - we had always been good friends: I have no doubt it was nothing but the moment of irritation- the room is small; I could find no mark of a shot or bullet - a Policeman was sent for, who took him, and he was committed for an assault; I do not believe he intended to do any thing but frighten me, and not to do me any personal harm.</p>

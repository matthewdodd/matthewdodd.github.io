Between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 7th of June, I went to the Rising Sun at Stepney—it was Stepney-fair—I called for gin-and-water—I went into the parlour—the prisoner made way for me to sit down—he introduced a portrait of himself, and said, "Will you allow me to take yours?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Will you allow me to sip out of your glass?"—I said, "I will pour you out a little in your glass, if you want it" he said he was about singing a song—he called a respectable man, who sat two or three persons off to sing a duet—after that I felt a tug at my pocket—I thought I had sat on my coat—I felt another tug, and then found my hand<lb></lb>kerchief was gone—I seized the prisoner, and said, "You have robbed me"—he said, "You are wrong"—I said, "You have my handkerchief "—he said, "I have not got it"—he made a push, and put it on the table, and said, "I only took it for a joke"—it came from under his jacket—he made his way to the door, and the officer took him.</p>

On the 7th of May a woman called me, and told me to take the prisoner, who was coming out of the Rising Sun—I stopped him, and took him inside—he then said it was all right—the prosecutor said he had taken his handkerchief, but he was inclined to forego the prosecution, as he had admitted he took it—the prisoner said, "I never admitted anything of the sort"—the prosecutor said, "Take him"—the prisoner then said, "I beg your pardon."</p>

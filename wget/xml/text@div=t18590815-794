                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Adam-street, Rotherhithe—the prisoner came to me as a servant about 10th April—my wife was then ill, and died on 18th April—the prisoner remained in the house till 11th May, taking care of my house, and acting as a servant—I had four children altogether—I did not know that the prisoner was going to leave, but when I came home to dinner on 11th May she was gone, and the young baby also, which was 11 weeks old—I have been in search of her ever since till 14th July, when I found her in the Gray's Inn-road—my little girl, who was with me, recognised her in the crowd, and I took her by the shoulder, and asked where my child was—she said that she came as far Leadenhall-street the same night with the baby, and fell asleep, when she awoke she had not got the child—she had no business to take it into Leadenhall-street—I have never seen the child since.</p>

On 24th July I was on duty in Gray's Inn-lane, and Plater gave the prisoner into my custody for stealing his child—he said she came from Rotherhithe on 11th May, sat down in Leadenhall-street that night, and fell asleep, and when she woke the child was missing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know that the child was missing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two or three days afterwards; it was a little after 8 in the morning when I saw her in Tooley-street; I was on one side and she on the other I stood and looked at her across the street—I had not heard a word about the child being missing at this time; but I stopped and looked at her because I wondered where she was going to with the baby—I thought it was her daughter's child—I knew that her married, daughter had an infant child.</p>

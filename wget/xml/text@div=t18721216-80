                  </hi>. I am a labourer of Selina Terrace, Croydon—on 13th November, I was in St. Thomas Street, London, not quite sober—I saw the prisoner there, and asked him to have something to drink—we went into a public-house and I paid for some drink—he then came out to show me the way to the station to go to Norwood Junction, and he caught hold of me, tripped me up, took my belt off, struck me with it, and took my purse from my pocket containing 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., done up in paper, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—there was no one with him—my thumb and cheek were cut by the belt—I bad my purse safe in the public-house, when I was showing the landlord an American cent, and the prisoner saw it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Briaress, and am sometimes a laundress—on 13th November, about 12.30, I was in my own room, and thought my husband's van stopped at the door, I pushed open the window, but it was Mr. Brown's van; I then saw a man at the opposite corner knock down another man—he seemed to push him down into the gutter, and when he was down be pulled off his belt, pulled down the front of the young man's trousers, and rifled his pockets, and a knife or something fell to the ground—I called out "You are a great vagabond to hit the poor fellow like that"—the prisoner is the man who knocked the young man down—I knew him by sight before, but did not know his name.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bermondsey-road, in the parish of Bermondsey—I occupy the whole house. I was disturbed in the night of the 13th of Nov., by the barking of my dog—I got up, opened the door, and listened—I did not find the staircase-window open then—I did after<lb></lb>wards, about half-past three o'clock—I immediately sprang my rattle, and let the police in at the front door—I found the sash of the kitchen win<lb></lb>dow broken, also four panes of glass—there was room for a man to get in—the sash frame was carried out with the glass, and I found some marks of blood on the window-blind, such as might occur from a person's hand being cut—I am in the habit of keeping the staircase window always closed, and I know of no alteration in that respect that night—I did not notice that it was fastened, but it was decidedly down—some flower<lb></lb>pots which had been at the staircase-window, I found removed into the garden, as if they had been handed down—I lost no property—it appeared to me that the parties had entered by the staircase-window, and gone out by the kitchen-window.</p>

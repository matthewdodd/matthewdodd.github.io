On the morning of the 1st of February I began work at six o'clock; I was at farrier's work in the shop - when this happened I was mending the iron step of a cabriolet; it was in a heated state, but not red-hot - the prisoner stood on the left-hand side of me; the step was hot- the prisoner said nothing to me, but took the step out of my hand and struck me with it on my hand; it was then in a hot state - I took it out of his hand and said "George why don't you let me do what I have got to do with it?" I was working on it for about half a minute, and I then received a blow on the head; I do not know how, or by whom it was given - it produced a fractured skull; I have been in the hospital, and have been out of my mind since - Peacock and Carrington were present when the blow was given.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not the prisoner directed you to strike the step on the crown, as it is called? A. No he did not; William Saunders might be in the shop, but I did not take notice of him; I had not pushed the prisoner at all - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not strike him with the hot step on the back of his hand and burn him? A. I did not, I am quite certain; I never asked anybody whether I could get my expences if I prosecuted him only for a common assault; I have known him about twelve months - it all took place in less than five minutes.</p>

            . I am a farrier. On the 1st of February I was in Davis's shop with Chalk and Lemon; I was about six or seven feet from Chalk who was altering or mending a step - I saw the prisoner and him twisting together with the step, but whether any blows passed I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand did the step get into at last? A. Chalk's - he got it back, and while he was altering or mending it, this chisel lay by the side, and Lemon took it up; Lemon was holding his hand, whether it was hurt or not I cannot say; he turned and took up the chisel - he stood a minute, till Chalk was leaning over the anvil - he then struck it down on his forehead; he then threw it down and immediately went away, out of the shop: I caught Chalk or he would have fallen - the blow struck him rather above the forehead - it bled.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might elapse between the twisting and when you saw the blow struck? A. About a minute; we led Chalk to a surgeon's - he was taken to a public-house, and in about three hours he was taken to the hospital; he was struck with the cutting part of the instrument.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They were struggling together about the step? A. Yes; the step was hot; I did not see the prisoner's hand then; but at Hatton Garden on Saturday I saw him with a sear on the back of his hand, but how it was done I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it a scar? A. Something of a mark - I was not very near him, but I saw a mark; he shewed it to the magistrate; I do not know that I ever saw him before that day - the whole affair might have occupied three or four minutes.</p>

            . I am a farrier. I was in the shop and saw Chalk mending a step; Lemon came and interfered with him - he tried to twist the step out of his hand; after that he stood for a little while - a minute I suppose; then he took up the chisel and struck him with the edge of it over his forehead - it bled; there were two streams of blood - I went with him to Mr. Headlam the surgeon, and in two or three hours he was taken to the hospital; I heard nothing said before it happened - after Lemon struck him he threw the chisel down, and went out saying "That serves you right."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the back of Lemon's hand? A. No; I heard him complain of his hand as soon as the twist was over; before he struck Chalk he said he had hurt his hand - the step had been heated; Chalk had a fur cap on: William Saunders is a fellow-workman - he was in the shop.</p>

I am a surgeon and live in Featherstone-buildings; I know this shop and believe it is in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn - it is in Middlesex. On the 1st of February, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor was brought to me; he had received a wound on the front and upper part of his head, about two or three inches in length - it appeared to have been produced by an instrument with an obtuse cutting edge, similar to that produced; the sharp edge of it would produce it - the edge is not very sharp, and it might produce such a wound; the blow appeared to have produced a concussion of the brain - he was removed from my house to bed; and in three hours he was bled in the arm at the public-house and taken to the hospital; the witnesses are in error, there was no fracture of the skull - a concussion of the brain is attended with danger of life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by obtuse? A. Not so sharp as a knife or sword; it resembled a wound caused by the joint effect of a blow and a cut.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and live in Jewin-street. On the 14th of February I was called in to the prosecutor - he had then been moved home from the hospital; he seemed at that time to be labouring under symtoms of a secondary nature - of low information in the brain, from the effect of a previous blow; there was a scab formed over the wound - I thought there might be matter in it; I ordered it to be poulticed and found there was no matter - he was not out of danger by any means when I first saw him; I have attended him till within the last fortnight, but he has not taken medicine for the last three weeks or a month; I have no doubt his illness was the result of the wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came into the shop, the man struck me over the hand, and burnt my hand; I was in pain from the burn - I caught hold of the chisel and hit him on the head; I did not mean to do him any harm.</p>

            . I was in the shop when this happened; I had the step to alter and took it to Chalk to do, and while he was doing it, when he had done a little of it, Lemon came into the shop and said "It wants a little more doing to it;" I took it again to the smith (Chalk) - Lemon stepped up and said "Charles, give it a blow or two there;" immediately after that Chalk said "D - n your eyes, what have you got to do with it;" and then made a hit at Lemon with the step, and struck him across the back of the hand; Lemon then rubbed his hand where it seemed to be hurt, and immediately laid hold of the chisel and struck Chalk on the head - he threw the chisel down on the ground and walked out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might have elapsed from the time he was rubbing his hand till he walked out? A. Scarcely half a minute; it was his duty to give orders, his father being the employer - he was in the habit of doing so.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Did you see Peacock the day after the accident? A. Yes - I had no conversation with him then, but I had on the day this happened; I did not tell him I knew nothing of the business - I never told him so, I swear; I was a very short distance from the witnesses - they were at work. There was no scuffle between the prisoner and Chalk, about the step, if there had I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lemon say anything when he dropped the chisel and walked out? A. Not a sentence - I must have heard if he did: the witnesses were about the same distance from him as I was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of the principal surveyors of the Thames-police. In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's premises, in Glass-house-yard, in the liberty of Glass-house, near the end of Aldersgate-street—I knocked at the door, it was opened by Martha Hartill—my brother officer Isbester was with me, and I had a warrant—I asked if Mr. Hartill was at home, she said, he was not—I told her I had a warrant to search the house for King's stores—she said, she knew nothing of them—the door of the house opens into a passage, there is a door to go into a coach-house, or van-house, on the left hand side, going in, under the same roof—I searched below, while Isbester went up stairs—in the coach-house I found a hamper with a quan<lb></lb>tity of straw on the top—I found in the hamper 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. weight of copper bolts, a quantity of copper nails, mixed metal, and nails, and copper sheath<lb></lb>ing—I have not cast up the weight—I have been a police-officer nearly 24 years—I know the King's mark, the broad arrow was on these stores—I showed the woman part of the copper—I asked her if she knew where it came from—she said she did not know, but a carter had left it there about nine days age, and what it contained, she did not know—I asked her who the carter was, she said she could not tell—she said her husband had been out of town nearly three weeks—this was on Thursday, the 17th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—I traced her husband through Kent into Surrey, and on Saturday I found him at Mitcham—he had a van, and was driving from London—going through Mitcham—I told him, I wanted him for some King's stores, that I had searched his house in Glass-house-yard, and there found a quantity of King's stores, and he must go to town with me—he said he would not, he knew nothing of any King's stores—he afterwards said he would go with us any where, and I brought him to town—the name of John Hartill was on the van—on the way to town, he asked me to let his wife know where he was—I sent him on board the police-ship, and went to his wife, to the house which I had searched—I told her where her husband was, and she went to him on board the ship—I saw the van in the same coach-house, where I had found the copper—in coming along the road, I said to the man, "If it is not in your possession, it must be in your wife's." and he said. "Rather than my wife should suffer, I will take it upon my self"—I have had this property in my possession ever since—this is part of the stores—the King's mark is plainly on them.</p>

They bespoke, each of them, a suit of clothes. They told me they had just come from sea, and they must have the clothes on Sunday morning following. I told them, I could not promise them, the time was so short, but I had a suit of clothes would fit one of them. I fitted them on one of them; he liked them, and I was to make for the other by Sunday morning. On Sunday morning they came, they bought various other articles of wearing apparel. They told me they had no money about them, they would thank me to go to their landlord with them, and as soon as the clothes were delivered the clothes would be paid for. I made out the bill and receipt according to their request. I sent my foreman with them to the place where they lodged. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The things that you made for them were two waistcoats and two jackets - A. Yes. They bought various things besides, and I was to send them to their lodgings, and the landlord was to pay for them. I sent my foreman with them.</p>

            . I went by the order of my master to take them two suits of clothes. I went with them two prisoners to a house in Artichoke-lane. Their pretended landlord asked me if I had made them men's clothes. I said, yes. He said, walk up stairs after me. I had the clothes with me. I went up stairs. The prisoner Myers said, I shall go and clean myself. The landlord asked me if I had got the bill. I said, I had. The other one took the bundle to go and clean himself. After they were gone, the landlord took a pocket-book out of his pocket. I expected he was going to pay me my bill. In the course of two or three minutes, I asked him where these men were gone. He said, he did not know. I then said, where is the clothes; my order is not to leave the clothes without the money. He said, I cannot pay you to-day, call to-morrow. I went the next day. I knocked at the door; a woman opened the door to me. I expected the woman that opened the door was the daughter of that fictitious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130050"></xptr>landlord. She told me, in short, that this man that pretended to be the landlord did only lodge in the house; he was only a fictitious landlord; he had only a furnished room. He had ran away, and had handed them things out of the house that night. The landlord of the house told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not evidence. You know nothing at all, only that you went there, you delivered to one of the men the jackets and trowsers. Why, did not you lay hold of the man - A. I did not suspect that he was not the landlord of the house. I never was paid for them clothes. I am certain these are the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your clothes again - A. No. I asked them what they had done with the clothes. They made a jeer of me.</p>

               <p>Myers's Defence. On the 20th of November, I went to this man's house; he asked me what clothes I wanted. I told him I wanted some clothes; I had no money; I would shew him a man that would be answerable for mine. He took measure of me for a suit of clothes. He said, he could get them ready; he would send them to my house on Sunday. I called at nine o'clock; he then said they would be ready in half an hour. He told me he should send his foreman with us to the man that would be answerable for us. When the foreman came in, Mr. Wright stood on the stairs; he said, these young men have bespoke the clothes, will you be answerable for them. Mr. Wright said he would. He asked him to sit down, and to take anything to drink. He said, he was in a hurry, he would call again. He did not call till Tuesday. He was very well satisfied. The next day, Mr. Wright was very ill, and so he was all the week. Then Mr. Wright went out. We never knew that he was moved until the Monday fornight following. Then Mr. Levy said, in case we did not pay him or give another security, he would swear our lives away. Then he should have security for his money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you pay the rent and taxes of this house? A. No. I am a horse patrol of Bow-street, and they are paid by the conductor of the establishment. I have it entirely for my own use, and live in it alone. I have so much a week, and a house to live in; it is not used by my employers for any purpose whatever.</p>

            . On the 29th of November, about seven o'clock in the morning. I searched Scarce's house, and in the front parlour, (which Pearce said he rented). I found a small skeleton key and three common keys, and behind a box in that room I found a waistcoat, and on the opposite corner a pair of trowsers; Fair came to the house - we found a shirt collar in the hat box, which he claimed.</p>

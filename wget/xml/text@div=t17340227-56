               <p>Elisha Manisier. On the 25th of January, in the Morning, I bid my Girl call the Prisoner down to fetch up the Work, as usual. In three Quarters of an Hour I went up myself, and not finding the Work on the Board, I asked him why he did not fetch it up. He went down, and returning, said, he had search'd the Drawer where he had seen the Maid put it, but he could not find it. - I advertised the Goods, and on the Monday following he told me, with a great deal of seeming Joy, that he had heard - .bl<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270022"></xptr> Court. Were the Goods your Property.</p>
               <p>Elisha Manisier. No; the Snuff-Box was my Lord Harvey's, and the Tweezer-cafe Mr. Duton's.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Prisoner must be acquitted, for he's indicted for stealing your Goods - However, I would not immediately discharge him out of Custody for a Mistake, you may still indict him for stealing the Goods of my Lord Harvey and Mr. Duton.</p>

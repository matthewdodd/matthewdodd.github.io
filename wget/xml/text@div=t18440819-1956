                  </hi>. I live with my father, Jonathan Munn, a grocer, at Old Brentford. On the 18th of June the prisoner came to our shop, and asked if I would allow him to have some things for Mr. Winter, as he was going out in the barge—he said he wanted three loaves, a quarter of a pound of lard, half a pound of bacon, and half an ounce of tobacco—I knew Mr. Winter had dealings with my father—I knew the prisoner was in his service, but he was not at that time, I believe—I let him have the things for Mr. Winter.</p>

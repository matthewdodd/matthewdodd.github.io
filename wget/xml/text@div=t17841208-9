               <p>Did you live there in October last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you there the 18th of October last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was in the house besides yourself? - A maid servant, the housekeeper, and Mr. Truscot.</p>
               <p>Who was up last that night? - I was.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - Between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Where the doors fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten the outer door of the court yard at the back of the house? - It was fastened with a cross wooden bar and two iron bolts.</p>
               <p>Did you fasten the front door of the house too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were all the lower windows fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you get up in the morning? - At seven, I was the first up, and when I came down the back doors were all open, the front of the house was never touched, the back court yard door had a hole cut in it.</p>
               <p>Have you the pieces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Produce them. - This is the hole, it was cut about the middle of the door, there was a bolt about six inches.</p>
               <p>What was done to the iron bolts? - There were two iron bolts, and both the staples were forced out; as soon as I came down I went up to the housekeeper, and to Mr. Truscot, I told them? when I went out into the yard I saw a lamp-lighter's ladder out in the yard.</p>
               <p>Was it there the night before, when you went to bed? - No; I saw the pistole were gone, they were there the night before, I saw them when I went to bed, they laid inside the kitchen door on the right-hand, the pistols were Mr. Truscot's; I found six tea spoons and the cream jug missing, that is all I know that was missing; Mr. Truscot, I believe, knows of the rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is the situation of this court yard door that you have been talking of, with respect to the house? - It comes into the passage that leads to the kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Is that passage a covered one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is over it? - It was the courtyard door to the house.</p>
               <p>This was the night of the 18th of October? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean it was the night between the 17th and the 18th, or between the 18th and 19th? - Between the 18th and 19th, I am sure of that; I cannot say any thing of the pistols, I never found the spoons and jug again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fearnley. It is stated, that this robbery was committed on the 18th at night; immediately after the robbery was committed, information was sent to Bow-street: this paper is a list of things taken by theft.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to this.</p>
               <p>Court. You may ask him, whether he remembers any advertisement coming out from Bow-street, and whether it was before or after that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. These are the things taken between the 18th and 25th.</p>

             called in again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fearnley. Do you remember any advertisement coming out from Bow-street? - Yes, I received that advertisement half an hour after I took in the pistols, this was the paper, these are the pistols, they have not been out of my possession; I received them from the prisoner at the bar, I know him.</p>
               <p>Had you much conversation with him? - Not as conversation.</p>

               <p>Did he say whose they were? - No.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In the passage leading into Tothill-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You remember the day by these papers I take it for granted? - That is what I go by.</p>
               <p>You received them the day this handbill was issued, which you take to be the 18th? - Yes, it is the 18th.</p>
               <p>And it is by this paper that you understood it was the 18th; do not you keep books? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you referred to them? - No, I was guided by the hand-bill.</p>

               <p>Court. How comes it, that in all this time, when this was discovered, that you have never looked at your own books to see when you received these pistols? - I went by the hand-bill; I was in a hurry to go to Bow-street, as it was my duty to do, and they gave me directions to go to Mr. Masterman's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you receive the handbill after the pistols? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then that is no apology for your not setting them down; did you give a duplicate? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you make a ticket? - I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>Is not it your constant practice, and is not it your bounden duty to make a ticket and tie it to the articles? - Most undoubtedly;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080043"></xptr> I have not a ticket, I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>There is no entry in your book I take it for granted? - Really, upon my oath, I am not able to say whether they were booked or not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that going to Bow-street, in consequence of this advertisement, and knowing that you were to be examined, you made no entry; it seems to me to be peculiarly the object of an entry; you are quite sure it was the 18th?? - Yes, I go by the hand-bill, I do take it to be the 18th.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - On a Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was on the Monday? - We always receive the papers on a Monday as early as possible.</p>
               <p>You went immediately to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know a woman of the name of M'Carty? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know a woman of the name of

               <p>Did you tell her you had given information? - I might say the information was given.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not? - I cannot directly say.</p>
               <p>You think you did? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Do you think you told her this man, Stewart, had better get out of the way? - Stewart was along with her, I told her if he did not get out of the way, I should stop him.</p>
               <p>What, the man against whom you had given evidence, and was to be prosecuted for burglary? - I told him he must go, or I should stop him.</p>
               <p>Now, I believe, you have a sort of private intimation in your shops, by which you can send for a constable, without any body knowing it? - If we find a ground or reason to send, we certainly do send.</p>
               <p>Have not you, a private sign, by which you communicate with the persons in your business to go for a peace officer, without giving an open order? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>So you told him he had better get out of the way; what did Maddocks say about it? I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Recollect a little? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was the prisoner taken? - It might be in the course of the ensuing week; I believe it rested a fortnight after the information was given.</p>
               <p>What day in the week was he taken? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect what day you attended? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fearnley. You received that paper, have you any reason to know the particular day on which you received the pistols, excepting that paper? - It is from that paper I speak as to the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Do you know who this Mrs. Maddocks is? - I believe her to be a girl of the town.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN TRUSCOT sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of October, I lodged at Mr. Masterman's, in Red-lion-square, I had a pair of pistols at Mr. Masterman's on the 18th of October.</p>
               <p>Were they in his house that night? - I am sure they were, I saw them there when I went to my bed, I passed by the chest where my pistols lay, and looked at them, and took one of them in my hand; about seven the next morning the boy came in and told me the house was broke open; my pistols were gone. I gave information at Bow-street the next morning, which was on the 19th.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear of your pistols again? - On Monday the 25th, I went to Woolwich, and returned again the Thursday after, the servant went to Mr. Wright's and saw my pistols. ( Looks at them.) These are my pistols, I saw them at Mr. Wright's.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080044"></xptr>Court. How long after you returned from Woolwich was the prisoner apprehended? - About ten days or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had not all Sir Sampson Wright's men with you? - I think not.</p>
               <p>Did you apprehend this man or they?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fearnley. Did you desire the prisoner might not be apprehended? - I desired he might not till I had written to Mr. Masterman, unless he came for the pistols.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Why, Captain, these appear to me to be as plain pistols as ever I saw in my life? - Yes, Sir, here is the maker's name, I had a particular mark on those pistols.</p>
               <p>What, that you had observed before? - In the firing them, which I could swear to them by; not only that, but the wood they are mounted on, one is a paler kind than the other.</p>
               <p>Why, Captain, they are hardly ever similar, the using one more than the other, makes them paler or deeper? - Here is a bit of one broke in the firing.</p>
               <p>Yes, I remember that I have one of my own broke just like it, it happens nine times in ten to these Birmingham made pistols.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How can you make use of such a question! did any thing more pass? - Many things that I did not think worth my notice, and there might have been cant words, and I might have made use of them since, but I cannot charge my memory with them.</p>

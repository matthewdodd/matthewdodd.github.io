                  </hi>. I am a merchant living at Carnarvon—on 6th Febru<lb></lb>ary, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Leadenhall-street—in consequence of what a gentleman said to me, I went after the prisoner, who was crossing the street—when be turned and saw me following him he began to run, and ran through Leadenhall-market—I followed him, but did not overtake him—he was stopped by some one else—I told the policeman that he bad taken my handkerchief, and the prisoner put his hand to his trousers pocket and said, "Here is your handkerchief; don't lock me up; don't be so hard"—I left him with the policeman.</p>

I saw the prisoner running through the market at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I chased him till he was stopped by a gentleman—the prosecutor came up, said that he had stolen his handkerchief, and asked where the handkerchief was—the prisoner said, "Here is the handkerchief," and took it out of his pocket—I took him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not say, "Take the handkerchief," but "Take the handkerchief if it is yours." It was lying on the ground, and I picked it up. A gentleman came up to me and said, "It belongs to that gentle<lb></lb>man who is going up there." I said, "I picked it up, and if it belongs to him, take it and give it to him." He said, "No, I will tell him you have got it," and, thinking he was going to say so, I ran away. I did not steal it.</p>

On the 20th of March I was on duty in Old street-road a little before six o'clock in the evening, and I saw the prisoner and his companion in company <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> together—I watched them for half-an-hour—I saw them go up to the prosecutrix's shop, look at some shoes at the door, and pass by—the prisoner then sat down on the next door step—his companion passed by the step several times, and each time came and talked to the prisoner—the prisoner got up, and looked into the window—his companion then took the shoes down, and both ran off together—I pursued and took the prisoner—his companion dropped the shoes—the prisoner said he saw the other take the shoes, and he ran after him to stop him—they had both run away together—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them better than a quarter of a mile—they both ran off at one time and in the same direction—the boots were dropped in a street a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's—the prisoner was running in the same direc<lb></lb>tion as the other, but he never called "Stop thief" or any thing till I stop<lb></lb>ped him—the other passed the prisoner in running, and the prisoner joined, and both ran together—the other was about ten or twelve yards beyond the prisoner when I took him.</p>

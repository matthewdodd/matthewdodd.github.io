                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor of this indictment; I am a solicitor. In the year 1846 I occasionally went to the offices of Mr. George Lewis, in Barnard's Inn—at that time the two prisoners, King and Wyatt, were clerks to Mr. Lewis—I remember going to the office on 3rd July, 1846; I saw King there, and Mr. John Minn Cooke—King said that Mr. Cooke had a judgment against Lord George Loftus for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me if I would become the purchaser of it, at the same time stating that he had papers then before him, abstracts or copies of settlement, showing that the late Marquis of Ely had covenanted with trustees, on his marriage, to insure his life for the sum of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each younger child; that the Marquis had omitted to do so, and he, King, was about to take proceedings either against the present Marquis, or the trustees of the late Marquis, to recover the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and that, should he succeed, there would be the prospect of a tolerable dividend under Lord George Loftus's estate, he having taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act—after discussing the matter, I was shown the judgment paper, and the bills upon which the action against Lord George was founded—after some discussion, I ageed to purchase it of Mr. Cooke, who was the party holding it—that agreement was reduced to writing—this is it—King wrote it out—it is signed by me and Mr. Cooke—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was a memorandum of agreement, dated</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd July</hi>, 1846<hi rend="italic">, between Francis Gibbons, by John Minn Cooke, his agent, of the one part, and John Jackson Lee of the other part; and recited that on</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1842, <hi rend="italic">the said Francis Gibbons obtained a final judgment against Lord George Loftus for</hi> 558<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">debt, and</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">taxed costs, which he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Gibbons</hi>) <hi rend="italic">agreed to sell the said J.

I called again, and it was not then executed—I saw King, and he asked me to let him have a further payment on account of Mr. Cooke—I then paid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stated that the assignment should be put in hand immediately, and I should have it on the following day—that was all that took place on 21st Aug.—I might have called between 3rd July and</p>

               <p>21st Aug.; very likely I did—I called on 21st Aug., and again on 22nd, and King said be would send Wyatt out to get the deed executed—I do not know that Wyatt was present at that time; they sat in different rooms, and I do not know that Wyatt was in the room; I think not—I called again some time in Sept.—I saw King, and paid him the balance, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to make up the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I also paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the stamp of the deed, and received the deed from him—this is it—it is in the same state in which I received it—(<hi rend="italic">the deed was here read. It was dated 22nd Aug.</hi>, 1846, <hi rend="italic">and purported to assign the debt in question to John Jackson Lee; it was signed Francis Gibbons, and witnessed by Thomas Wyatt, clerk to Mr. Lewis On the back was a receipt for the</hi> 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">also signed Francis Gibbons, and witnessed by Thomas Wyatt</hi>)—I believe this signature "Francis Gibbons" to be Hildebrandt's writing—the attestation of Thomas Wyatt is Wyatt's handwriting—I speak to both of Wyatt's signatures—in consequence of information I received, some time at the latter part of last year, I asked Wyatt if he could give me any information about Francis Gibbons; what he was, and where he resided—he displayed some hesitation at first, but on my second inquiry he told me that he was a carver and gilder in Piccadilly—I have looked when I have occasionally gone through Piccadilly, and could see no such name—I did not go for the express purpose of ascertaining whether there was such a person, but I have gone up Piccadilly on one or two occasions and looked, and could see no such name; and I made inquiries of persons in the street, and could hear of no such man—I also directed my clerk, William Jackson, to make a search—I have advertised for Francis Gibbons, but cannot ascertain that there is such a person—I have made inquiries for Lord George Loftus, both at the Marquis of Ely's and at the late Marchioness's—they told me he was at Hanover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there such a person as Lord George Loftus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes; I went with a subpœna to procure his attendance both to the Marquis of Ely's and the Marchioness's—I could not ascertain on what part of the Continent he was—I believed that there was something wrong about the deed last year, but I only ascertained that it was a forgery yesterday six weeks—it might be in Sept. or Oct. last year that I believed there was something wrong about it; when I made the inquiry of Wyatt which I have spoken of—I gave King and Wyatt into custody on a Tuesday; it was about the 18th or 19th Jan.; it was the day after I got information of the forgery—it was the day before the trial of an action against me at Westminster—King and Wyatt were both my witnesses on that trial; I had subpœnaed them both—I cannot tell whether they were to be witnesses for the plaintiff—it is impossible I can tell who a man intends to call for his witnesses—King's son was the plaintiff in the action, as executor of Mr. Lewis—there was a claim against me of 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to which I had a good defence—I have reason to believe the record was withdrawn—I have subpœnaed Mr. John Minn Cooke—I have known Hildebrandt by sight perhaps six or eight months, but I did not know his name—I do not know when I first knew his name; I should not have known it till I was told yesterday six weeks—I knew him by sight five or six months before that—I had seen him at Lewis and Cooke's offices, and once or twice since, I believe—I might have heard his name before yesterday six weeks, but it is an uncommon name, and I might have forgotten it—I never had any dealings or transactions with him—I never received any communication from him in writing, and never saw him Write; but I have seen some of his writing which he has given me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you have never seen him write, or received any written communication from him, how cameyouto swear that you believed this signature to be his writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because when I went to him, when I was first informed of the forgery, I asked him to give me some of his handwriting that I might see it—when I was informed who had committed the forgery, I asked a party to show me his house—I waited about the house probably about a couple of hours, with the intention of taking him into custody; I did not succeed, and I returned to town, and apprehended the two prisoners—I then returned to Hildebrandt's—I got into the house, the door being opened upon my knocking at it, and I walked up stairs, and found him—I produced the deed to him, and asked him if he had any of his own handwriting by him; and be then gave me this small note, stating that this was his handwriting—that is my only knowledge of his handwriting, and from what passed between us at the time—I paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first instance; that was in Mr. Cooke's presence—I think Mr. Cooke was present at the whole of the first interview—I received a note of hand and judgment paper at the time of the agreement—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I am a carver and gilder by business. I have known the prisoner King about twenty years—the signature of "Francis Gibbons" to this deed is my writing, and also the name of "Francis Gibbons" on the back—I wrote it in Aug., 1846—I called on Mr. King, at Barnard's Inn, for a little money that be owed me, and he said, "Now you are here, I want you to sign a deed"—I do not recollect what answer I made—he placed the deed before me—this is the deed—I think no one but King was present at the time—he had written out the name I was to sign on a piece of paper; and when I saw it was not my own name, which I supposed it was, I made an objection—I said I objected to write any other name but my own—he then stated that it was only a matter of form, and that any person passing through the Inn would answer the purpose quite as well as me—he said, "Don't you think for a moment that I would lead you into an error"—I then signed the deed—I made a mistake in the first signature; I put a letter wrong—this is the signature I speak of, at the bottom; the mistake I made was an "e" instead of an "i," or an "i" instead of an "e," I do not know which—I then signed this at the back; it was done at the same time—no one was present but King and myself at the time; it was all done within two minutes; I do not think there was any one there; I do not remember seeing any one as I was leaving the office, but I think Mr. Walbanck came in as I went out—I am not quite certain whether I spoke to Walbanck or not.</p>

Fisher and Cooke, attorneys, in Gray's-inn-square, and have there seen Wyatt and King, both in the present year and last year—I believe they were there acting as clerks; they were engaged in business in the office—I do not think I had any conversation there with Wyatt about this deed; I had on one occasion at the prosecutor's house; that was about three or four months before the prosecution commenced; it may probably be six months ago—I had instructions from Mr. Lee—I said to Wyatt, "Oh, how about that assignment of Gibbons?"—he hesitated before he answered me, and then laughed, and said, "Oh, it is all <hi rend="italic">bosh</hi>"—I think that was all that passed—I have made inquiries in Piccadilly for Mr. Francis Gibbons—I searched through Piccadilly for such a person—I think it was on the morning of 22nd Jan. that I was there last—I made inquiries at about every third or fourth number from end to end—I inquired both if they knew such a person living there then, or whether they knew such a person living there in 1846—I described him as a picture dealer—I did not hear of any such person.</p>

                  </hi>. I know Wyatt and King—they were fellow clerks of mine in 1845 and 1846—Mr. Lewis, I believe, was considered the master—Mr. King acted ostensibly in the business as master—I know Hildebrandt—I have seen him at King's several times, I mean at the</p>

               <p>office in Barnard's Inn—in Aug., 1846, I understood King to say that he was going to write to Hildebrandt—I believe he did write; but really it is so long since, that I cannot call to mind—I recollect that Hildebrandt was there about 17th Aug.; I saw him there—after he was gone, Mr. King told me to put down the name of Mr. Gibbons in the call-book—this entry (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) on 17th Aug. is my writing; it is, "Mr. Gibbons;" I wrote it, as King desired me—I think Hildebrandt called again in the course of a few days—here is another entry in the call-book, on the 19th, of "Mr. Gibbons;" that is my writing; I entered it by Mr. King's instructions—I cannot say whether Hildebrandt was there or not on the 19th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you name any one sum which you have paid on account of these shares: paid yourself with your own hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, my salary as secretary has been going on, and therefore I consider that equal to a payment—I have given them credit for my salary, and they have given me the 500 or 600 shares, besides the moneys that I have paid—I really cannot say what amounts I have paid, but I have paid certain amounts, and certain amounts have passed to the credit of the Company—there are different sums, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have passed to the credit of the Company by writing it in the books; that is paying.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280036"></xptr>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me one payment that you have made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say on what day or in what month I paid that; if I had known you were going to ask me I could have brought the Company's books with me—I have paid 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—that is the utmost I have paid—I do not know the nominal value of the shares; how is it possible I can tell? the shares are 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I believe I am one of the trustees of the Company—I know that I am—I really do not know whether these shares are saleable now—I was one of the promoters of the Company, together with a gentleman of the name of Fellingham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever, in the course of your time, used any other name besides the one you now use? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have; Walbanck is the name that I have taken, Charnock is my real name; I can explain the whole circumstance if you wish it—the fact is this: when I was very young I was drawn into pecuniary circumstances and liabilities; I afterwards mentioned it to a certain gentleman, and he advised me to alter my name—it was well known that those parties who were responsible with me would have to pay the liabilities, therefore they advised me, in order to carry it out, that I should not, being young, bear any responsibility, and that I had better change my name for a short time—I have changed my name for the last sixteen or seventeen years—my uncle was a banker in the country, and Williams, Deacon, and Co., in Birchin-lane, stopped payment, owing them between 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was drawn into it, and when my uncle's partner came up to London, post baste, in a chaise and four, he found that Williams, Deacon, and Co. were closed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you attribute the changing of the name to the failure of Williams, Deacon, and Co.; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt about it—I have never used any other name, or answered to any other name besides—I am quite sure of that—I once lived in Osborn-street, Whitechapel, with a person of the name of Mr. Scott—there was such a person, I am quite certain—I do not know that I was frequently addressed there as Mr. Scott—Mr. Scott was is partnership with me, and he was there every day; if he was not there day by day, he was there four or five times during the week—we were house agents there—I was there, I suppose, for a year and a half—I did not leave without paying any rent—the fact is, the landlord died, it got into other hands, and the other party wished me to leave, and there were fixtures which I thought were quite equivalent to the rent—Mr. Scott went to Birmingham—I was manager of the Rotunda, in the Blackfriars-road—that was after leaving Barnard's Inn—it is a theatre—it did not require a licence, it was for Negro melodies—I did not keep a similar entertainment in Holborn—I went there occasionally; not to act; I took no part whatever in it—I merely went for amusement—I once lived in Bucklersbury, for a few weeks or a month or two—I think that was before I was at the Rotunda; I was at Osborn-street after the Rotunda—at Bucklersbury I answered to the name of Hilder and Co., under the instigation of Mr. King—I do not know hot long I was there; the landlord wanted the premises, and they were given up—I do not think there was any rent demanded.</p>

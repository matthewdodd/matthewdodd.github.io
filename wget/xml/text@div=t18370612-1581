                  </hi>. I am a messenger at Worship-street police-office. I remember, on the 29th of April, the prisoner coming before the magistrate—he was sworn—a summons had been taken out for Mr. Bray—I took down the prisoner' evidence in writing—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"James Tye, of Spring. street, Clerkenwell, says, On Sunday, the 2nd of April instant, I was going past the defendant's house, about six or seven minutes past four o'clock. I saw a woman come out of the defendant's house, with beer in a pewter quart pot—I did not see her go in—I saw a girl go in with a blue jug, and come out with beer in the jug—I afterwards went to St. Leonard Shoreditch church—service was then on—I got there twenty minutes after four o'clock—it was the front door that was open—they came out at that door—the defendant's house is the White Swan, Long-alley, Shoreditch."</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 171.) On Sunday, the 2nd of April last, I saw the prisoner at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon in Milton-street, St. Luke's—after we had been together sometime, he asked me what time it was, as he said he would not lose the last half-hour—that is the time the persons are praying in church—I believe the church is open at St. Luke's at that time—1 pulled out my watch, and told him it was eight minutes past four o'clock—he had been with me then about half an hour—I am sure it could not have been less than a quarter of an hour—he left me after I told him—my watch was right by St. Luke's clock and the brewhouse clock—I should say it was very nearly a mile from where I was to Mr. Bray's public-house—it might be more or less—I did not know what he meant by losing the last half-hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you with him altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half an hour—I will swear it was not ten minutes or eight minutes before four o'clock—when I looked at my watch there was nobody within two or three yards of me—there were no girls—there were not two prosti<lb></lb>tutes in my company—I know Mr. M'Donald's public-house—I was not in that public-house that afternoon—I cannot say that I saw Mr. M'Donald nor any one connected with that house—another policeman was sent for from the Featherstone station, to state he saw us in the same street that afternoon—he came afterwards, but he did not recollect the day.</p>

               <p>me why I did not come, when Tucker's case was heard—I said I was not called in—the Magistrate said he wondered how a person could stand the office and hear false evidence given—I recollect this 2nd of April, from taking a boy into custody for breaking a square of glass, between two and three o'clock—Bray told me you were to give evidence in his case—I have not been to any solicitor's office with the other witness—I was on night duty—I got up, as near as 1 can guess, at twelve o'clock—I might go to the station-house before I went to bed—I do not recollect that I was in any particular place before twelve o'clock—I set my watch about half-past twelve o'clock—I went down Whitecross-street, and passed the brew house—I was at St. Luke's a few minutes before I was at the brewhout—you can go in a few minutes from there to Bray's—it is much further than from M'Donald's to Bray's—I have been in London very nearly two years, and have known Mr. Bray very nearly all the time—I sometimes drink there—I was detected drinking there while on duty—Bray is not the only person that would serve me—I have never asked you to lay informa<lb></lb>tions against any houses because they would not serve me, nor against Mr. Gold's in Old-street.</p>

On Sunday, the 2nd of April, I was at home in the afternoon and evening, during the hours of Divine service—in the afternoon I sat in the parlour, behind the bar, with George James—he took out his watch at twenty minutes past four o'clock, and told me to open the door—I got up and opened it—while I was sitting John French came—I saw him through the window—I did not let him in—he was the first person that came in when the doors were opened—not one person from three o'clock till a quarter past four o'clock entered the house—no woman went out with a jug—they could not without my seeing it—my father was ill in bed all that day, and my mother was sitting at the fire asleep.</p>

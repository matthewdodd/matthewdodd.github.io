Holmes at the bottom, I said who is G. Holmes, says he, he is a private gentleman that lives at Kensington, and I asked him whereabouts at Kensington, he said, at Stones-end, going to Hammersmith; and he said, yes, says I, then who is Mr Stenson, says he, that is the person who the things are for; now from that moment his having first told me it was an old lady, and I seeing the name created suspicion, for Mr. Stenson could not be an old lady at any rate, I caught at the expression directly, says I, you told me just now, it was an old lady that wanted these things, O says he, I suppose in the hurry of drawing the draught, they omitted the S; I never asked the old lady's name, nor asked the man his name, I went and called my man from dinner and beckoned him to go into the parlour, and told him there was a person in the shop who I did not know, and he came in such a sort of questionable shape, I did not know what to make of it, and I sent him to Messrs. Hankey's; that was the only proof to ascertain whether it was sound or unsound. After my man was gone I went into the shop, and entered into conversation with the person, and he said he had some little business at Mr. Constable's, and I said the man will not be long; so we were talking about the new tea-warehouse, and who were the proprietors and such like: whether the prisoner's situation grew uneasy or not I cannot say; but, says he, as your man is not returned I think I will go to Mr. Constable's, and I will be back in about ten minutes, very well, Sir, says I, if he brings the money I will send him to you; the prisoner never returned, and in about a quarter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140040"></xptr> of an hour or twenty minutes my man and Messrs. Hankey's clerk both returned, the moment I saw a new face I was convinced that my suspicions were well founded, and that I was right: I said to my young man, you know where Mr. Constable lives, go and see whether he is there or no, so I believe they did, they did not come into the shop, they returned and said the prisoner had not been there.</p>
               <p>Have you the note? - No, Mr. Tate has it, and Mr. Tate then said he suspected it was Druitt.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man? - Yes, I am sure it is the same man.</p>
               <p>It was not candle-light? - No, Sir, it was not.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure as to the day? - Yes, I think I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When a man says I think, I apprehend it imports a doubt. - It may, Sir; I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after? - I never saw him till he was taken, which I believe was three weeks or a month, but I received a letter from Mr. Tate, informing me that Druitt was in custody, at the Rotation-Office, at Hick's-Hall, I found him in custody, charged with the offence.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you mentioned the day at the Rotation-Office? - Yes, I did, I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>He instructs me that he pressed you to fix the time, that he might shew where he was at that time. - I said it was Tuesday the 1st of November, says Mr. Webster it is not material about the day, says this unfortunate young man, I wish the gentleman would be precise as to the day; before that I had consulted my wife and the man altogether.</p>
               <p>You did state it was uncertain, to which Mr. Webster said it was not material, was it so stated in the presence of the prisoner? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>I observe in the whole account you gave to my friend, you very constantly and very properly said, the man, you did not name the prisoner; are you able to say now, with certainty, whether he is the man? - I do think he is the man.</p>
               <p>Is it a matter about which concurring circumstances, and the opinion of other men have induced you to believe that he is the man? - I am not governed by other men at all.</p>
               <p>I am afraid the best men are governed by other men. - If I could have any doubt of it, I should be happy to catch your idea.</p>
               <p>Abstracted from every thing you have heard from others, from all you have seen, from all comparisons of hand-writings, are you able, at the distance of a month, to say that is the man; if you have a particle of a doubt, I am sure you will say so? - I really do think he is the man, but I am not infallible, he very much resembles the man, but never having seen him before, and it was four o'clock in the month of November, and it was rather dark.</p>
               <p>You speak very much to your honour; then you say that you cannot speak to him positively, from the circumstances of never having seen him before, seeing him in the month of November, and seeing him rather in the dark, do not you think you may fairly suspect your own recollection? - Sir, in general I do not.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about him, go up to him? - I think it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt, Sir? - When I say I think he is the same man, that does not imply much doubt, but to say with certainty that he is the same man, I cannot.</p>
               <p>In short, you do not swear with the same positiveness that I do that this is Mr. Silvester, I swear this is Mr. Silvester.</p>

               <p>Court. Abstracted from the possibility of being mistaken, which there certainly is to you in common with all mankind, have you at this time any doubt in your own mind that this is the man? - Certainly not, I certainly think he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Court. I will put it to you in a different way, I am sure you will not go any further than the truth; supposing you had never heard any thing about this man from the time he left your shop, and that you had met him a month after in the street, should you have known him to be the same man that offered you the note? - I do not say that I should, I did not take a great deal of notice of the man, I think he is the same man, but to swear positively that he is the same man, I cannot; if I had met the man at a distance of time, I should not have said to a friend, that is the man that offered me the forged draft.</p>
               <p>But now from all the circumstances you strongly believe him to be the same man? - I thought when I saw him at Hick's-Hall he resembled the man very much, he seemed to me much the same sort of man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect a Mr. Ripley of Wapping attending the examination? - Yes, so I found.</p>
               <p>The draft you gave to Mr. Tate was the same draft you received from the prisoner? - I do not recollect whether I saw it at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you mark it? - No, there was no mark upon it, I sent it by my man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know what day that was? - I am sure it was on Tuesday, I believe it was the 3d.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow.

               <p>It is, we all know, a fashionable village, and the boarders and lodgers change their abode frequently; you do not mean to swear that there is no person of the name of Stenson but your wife? - As an old lady I will.</p>

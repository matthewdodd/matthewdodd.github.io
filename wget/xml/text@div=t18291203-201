            . I copy music. On the 28th of November, at half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another boy; they went by Mr. Jackman's shop, and round the corner of Denmark-street - the prisoner shortly after came away from his companion, and went up to the shoes, which were fastened at the door with some iron wire; he pulled one pair, and another pair fell - his companion came up, and held out his hand to take them; the prisoner saw me coming, and dropped them - I took them up, and watched his companion, who went on to another street, and joined the prisoner; I gave charge of the prisoner - I had never seen him before, but I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you live? A.At. No. 68, Davies-street - I have given evidence in a case before, in which I took the prisoner, because I saw him commit a felony; I was a prosecutor myself once, and have given evidence in two cases, I believe - I was here last Session, and two or three Sessions before; I saw the prisoner try to take some cloaks in Oxford-street - I did not try to take him then; he was in Crown-street when I took him - I had my expences in the former prosecutions.</p>

            . On the 28th of November I heard a pair of shoes fall; I went to the door, and saw a pair lying - I looked out, and saw a man run away; the witness gave me these shoes, which are my master's - he went out, and brought the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether your master was asked to come here to-day? A. No, he was not- the person I saw running was about fifteen yards from me; he went in a straight line - I heard no cry of Stop thief! this witness was formerly in my master's employ.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to my father's, and turning down Crown-street, when this man came and took me - I had not been near the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am travelling inspector to the General Post Office—in consequence of communications made to me about the London and Ipswich line, on Saturday, 1st September, I made up a letter containing a half-sovereign put on a card, twelve penny postage stamps, and a written note—I put them in an envelope addressed to Mrs. Wat<lb></lb>noughby, Scole Inn, Scole—before putting the half-sovereign in I care<lb></lb>fully marked it, and also the stamps—after fastening up the letter I handed it to Mr. Monro, of the head office, London, with directions to despatch it by the bag to Ipswich—the Ipswich mail train starts from London at half-past eight, and arrives at Ipswich at half-past eleven—the prisoner is a sorting clerk on the railway, and travels on the line between London and Ipswich, sorting the letters in the van as he goes, and he returns to London two or three hours afterwards—he went by the Ipswich mail at half-past eight that night—he was the person to sort the letters on that journey; he would sort the letters for the Scole and Stowmarketdistrict—he would return by the half-past one mail which arrives in London about five—I was at the Ipswich Post-office when the mail cart came in that night, about half-past eleven—the Scole bag was opened in my presence, and the seal broken—it was properly tied and sealed with the proper official seal—I carefully examined its contents, and could not find the letter addressed to Mrs. Watnoughby—I am positive it was not there—I very carefully examined for that purpose; that was the only bag in which such a letter ought to have been placed—I left for Shoreditch by the mail train, and arrived there about half-past five—before I left Ipswich I saw the prisoner coming out of the railway hotel opposite the station, about ten minutes before the train started, about a quarter past one in the morning—I saw him when we got to London in the sorting carriage, immediately after the arrival of the train—I went back by the same train—I said to him, "You know me, Mr. Barrow; I have come to inquire about a missing letter; did you sort the Scole and Stowmarket letters that arrived in the London bag last night?"—he said, "I did"—I said, "Did you sort them all yourself?"—he said, "I did it all myself; Mr. Leal tied up a few bundles, but he did no sorting"—(Mr. Leal is a clerk in the Post Office; he had no duty that night, I think)—I said, "Did you make up the Scole and Stowmarket bag?"—he said, "I did"—I asked where he went to the previous night when he got to Ipswich—he said he went to the hotel opposite the station—I said, "Did you go any<lb></lb>where else?"—he said, "No"—I asked what money he had—he said,</p>

               <p>"About 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he was searched by Crocker, a constable, who found on him a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and I think 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I said, "What money did you change this morning at the hotel?"—he said, "A sove<lb></lb>reign"—I said, "Are you quite sure?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you not change a half-sovereign there?"—he said, "No, I did not"—I then directed him to attend at the chief office the following morning—I sent Crocker down to Ipswich, and upon his return, and on receiving his report, I saw the prisoner at the Post Office on Monday, 3rd September, about mid<lb></lb>day—I said to him, "You told me yesterday morning that it was a sove<lb></lb>reign you changed at the hotel; the barmaid states it was a half-sovereign that she got from you?"—he said, "I am sure it was a sovereign"—I said, "The half-sovereign that I enclosed in the letter that is missing has been found at the hotel at Ipswich, opposite the station, where you were on Saturday night"—he said he knew it was a sovereign he had changed—I then gave him into custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the half-sovereign that I put into the letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the prisoner's position in the Post Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Travelling clerk in the Railway Post Office—I believe his salary is 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I know that he was promoted lately—there are various modes of promotion in the Post Office, for good conduct or by rotation; it is not always by seniority—I am travelling inspector attached to the missing letter branch—it was part of my duty to examine the prisoner as I did—I asked him where he went to at Ipswich—I knew, for I had seen him come from the hotel, I did not know whether he had been anywhere else—it was about half-past eleven when I found that the letter was missing—after that I waited at Ipswich till the train started—I walked about for an hour—I did not go anywhere—I was not watching—Crocker was with me; I walked about till about one o'clock—I was waiting about the station for the train to start when I saw the prisoner come out of the Railway Hotel—I could command a view of it from where I was waiting, that was partly my object—I had not kept the hotel always in sight—I had not seen the prisoner go in—he had not been watched away from the train that I am aware of—I did not go into the hotel at once and see what money he had given, because I did not know then that he had changed any money there; one reason was there was no time, if I had gone I should have lost the train—I did not leave the constable to go, I thought it better to take him with me for my assistance, in case I should find the marked money on the prisoner—it is not so easy to find a constable in London at that time in the morning, I should have had a difficulty in finding one to do what I required of him, he would have required a long ex<lb></lb>planation before he would have acted for me—of my own knowledge I do not know who went down in the sorting carriage besides the prisoner, but I believe Gurr, the sorter, and Mr. Leal—Mr. Leal was not searched, no suspicion whatever attached to him, he is a man whose character is above suspicion—I believe he got out at Forest Gate—he had been in the carriage down while the letters were being sorted—I believe he was at the Railway Hotel part of the time he was at Ipswich—I have not taken any steps to ascertain what became of a gentleman who slept at the Railway Hotel that night—the prisoner was originally committed for trial, and then the charge was withdrawn.</p>

I am sister of Mrs. Fisk—on Saturday night, the 1st September, when she went to bed, I took charge of the house, assisted by Mrs. Porter—I know the prisoner—I have seen him before—I remember his coming to the house that evening—he had some brandy and water—when he was going away he paid me—I do not know how he paid me—I know that it was gold—I remember giving him change—I put the money he gave me in the regular till—when I went to bed the money was there—I remember Crocker coming the next morning—I saw the money pro<lb></lb>duced by my sister—I had not put it in the private till—I made a state<lb></lb>ment to Crocker as to what had occurred the night before—I do not know whether I took any other gold that evening, I do not remember—I took a half-sovereign next morning from a gentleman who stayed at the hotel all night—he left that morning—I put that same half-sovereign in the same till—I received it about ten minutes before eight in the mornin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mrs. Fisk, and live at the Railway Hotel—I cannot say at what time I went to bed on Saturday night—it was directly the mail train came in—I did not come down again after that—I did not see the prisoner there before I left—Mrs. Bird was the first down next morning—I was down about a quarter to eight—I had occasion to go to the till about that time to get change for some one who came in—it was a stranger—I do not remember what he wanted—I do not remember what change I gave him or what it was for—when I went to the till to get it there was a quantity of silver, and I took a pound's worth out and two half-sovereigns as well—that was all the gold—I took it out and put it in the other till (the private till)—I locked it—I am quite sure at the time I removed the money from the till to the private till there were only the two half-sovereigns there—after that I gave change for a sovereign that was in there with the two half-sovereigns; that was when I took the pound's worth in silver out of the private till—I do not know who it was who came in for change—he had some refreshment—it was by the eight o'clock train—he gave the sovereign, and I gave him change for it out of the private till—I put the sovereign in the same till—the two half-sovereigns were there at the time I put the sovereign in—there was no sovereign there except the one I put in.</p>

Seeing him getting a little forward in liquor about two o'clock, I begged him to pay his reckoning and go home; he said he knew the company he was in, and was not afraid of being robbed; M'Coull came in about this time and called for a pint of porter, which was served to him; then the prosecutor said he had been robbed; and the two prisoners were gone out of the house.</p>

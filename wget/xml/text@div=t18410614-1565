                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at No. 25, Strand. On the 24th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, as I was going to put up my shutters, I observed that a pane of glass was broken at the corner of the window—I did not miss any thing at that minute—I put up one shut-ter and as I returned for a second, I met the policeman with the prisoner in custody—he asked me if I had lost any thing—I said not that I was aware of—he said, "You had better look, 1 think you have"—I looked and found I had lost five bundles of cigars, containing 100 each, they had been lying in the window directly opposite where the glass was broken—I had seen the glass whole about eight or nine o'clock—the policeman found some cigars under the broken window and I found three or four in the area directly under where the window was broken—they were of the same</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F.</hi> 94.) I was on duty in the Strand on the night of the 25th, I saw the prisoner standing close to Mr. Smith's shop window—there was another one with him—I went towards them and heard a slight snap as I thought, as if glass had been broken—I looked round for a moment, and then walked very smartly towards Mr. Smith's shop window—there was no other shop near there open at that time—when I got there I saw the prisoner turn his head, look towards me, and then they both ran away in the same direction, as fast as they could—I kept my eye on the prisoner on account of his having this black apron on—the other one escaped—I pursued the prisoner down Hungerford street, and at last caught him in Craven-street—he was stopped by another constable—I had my eye on him the whole of the way, and was calling "Stop thief"—when I got up to him he had taken his apron off, and had got it doubled up in his hand—he asked what I wanted him for—I said I did not exactly know yet, but I suspected he had broken a tobacconist's shop window—he came back with me—I took him back to the shop and asked Mr. Smith if he had lost any thing—he said he thought not—I said I thought he bad, and went out, took the shutter down, and saw the glass had been broken big enough to get both my bands in—I picked up nineteen cigars from the flagstones close under the window, and Mr. Smith brought up three from the area.</p>

               <p>I was in Mr. Copps's house on the 5th of April, about five o'clock, I work there weekly; I was in the back-parlour, the things were taken from the fore parlour, I thought I heard somebody at the door, I went to the door, and found it open, I went to the front parlour, and missed a bundle of goods, I went to the door, and saw the prisoner in the field with the goods; I cried stop thief, and saw him with two bundles in the fields; the prisoner then run away, and I ran across the fields, and picked up one of the bundles, I only missed one at first; Rigbey took the prisoner in two minutes after; I do not know how he got in the house, he was out of my sight but a small space.</p>
               <p>MARY-ANN JACKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the house at the same time, in the kitchen, and heard the door opened, I just let my young mistress out, and shut the door immediately, it opens with a spring latch inside and out; I called out, who is there? nobody answered; I met the last witness coming from the gate, who said we had been robbed; I then went to the gate, and saw the man standing by the goods in the field, with his apron in his hand; and we both cried stop thief! I picked up one bundle, and the last witness picked up the other, and he run away; he had his apron in his hand just going to tie up the bundles in it; he was pursued and taken, and brought back to the house. There was no other person in the field but himself and us two women.</p>

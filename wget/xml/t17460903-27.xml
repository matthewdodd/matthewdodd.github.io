               <p>Lyon. I have seen him before; the 19th of June, about four o'Clock in the Morning, I thought I saw him unlocking 'Squire Barber's Door; he was down upon his Knees and looking thro' the Key-Hole; when I saw him I directly ran down Stairs and stepp'd to him; he had got the Escutcheon off the Door; I took the Chisel in his Hand; and he own'd to me that he took an Escutcheon off a Door the Moment before, at the Corner of James-Street: I carried him from thence to the Crown, then we acquainted Mr. Barber's Folks of it before we went before the Justice; we examin'd him before the Constable, and he had 13 of these Brass Escutcheons; we also found a Pick-Lock in his Pocket.</p>

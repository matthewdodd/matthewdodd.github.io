On the 14th of January I had been at work there till a quarter past six o'clock; I then went to the west end of the town and purchased some tools - I then went with a friend to the Two Brewers and Magpie public house, Shoreditch, where we had four glasses of rum and water; I was not so intoxicated as not to know what I was about - I went to the Spread Eagle to inquire for a coach about twelve o'clock - I had three sovereigns in my breeches pocket, and my tools in my coat pocket; I saw Bailey there, and another, who, I presume, was Jenner - they told me the coach was gone, - my friend said I was very tired, and asked if I could not have a bed - they said if I would go to Darkhouse-lane I should get one - I thanked them and went on - they came, one took hold of my arms and tripped me up near Monument-yard, and they both fell on me; Bailey took the tools out of my pocket and put them into his own; my friend, who was a little behind, came to my assistance, and told me he had robbed me; Jenner escaped, but we held Bailey fast, and gave charge of him to a watchman, who let him go - we then gave charge of him to another - he had got rid of the tools; we did not see him do it, but he confessed that he knew where they were, and we went back and took them from under a shutter; Jenner was taken in about a fortnight, but I did not know him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About one o'clock on Sunday morning, the prosecutor and his friend came and gave me charge of Bailey; he said he had not taken the tools, but he knew where they were, and if they would forgive him he would give them up - he pointed them out under the window of No. 39, Little Eastcheap - I took him to the watch-house - the prosecutor was the worse for liquor - he was able to stand, but seemed to have been drinking very much. <rs id="t18260216-208-verdict1100" type="verdictDescription">

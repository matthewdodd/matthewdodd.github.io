I cannot swear to Carroll. The blow knocked me down. I was not in liquor. When I rose I saw Nicholls, and ordered him to fetch a constable. Scott came.

            . I was called; I found a mob, and the prosecutor holding Capps by the arms; he gave charge of her for robbing him. I took the other two about twenty minutes after, the fighting was over when I got there. He said in Capps's presence that he was robbed of 4 s., a half-crown, and 6 d.; she denied having any money, but at the watch-house I found half-a-crown in her hand; she threw it down on the bench when I was going to search her. The prosecutor was very much smeared with blood, which came from his nose; he had a black eye, and his head was beat; he did not appear the least tipsy. I saw Carroll and Smith round there when I went up.</p>

Capps who stood under the archway immediately came up, and put her hand in his waistcoat pocket; I did not see her touch him before that. The prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"I will not be robbed, and will not let you go;" he held her by the hand. While he was wrestling with her, the other two prisoners came down the court towards him; one of them cried,</p>
               <p>"Let her go;" he said he would not; and one of them said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not, we will knock your b - y head off." The other two came up after her hand was in his pocket.</p>

These women seeing him ill-use me, came up, and he struck them.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. Carroll and I were sitting at our door, and seeing a crowd at the end of the court, we went up, and the prosecutor was holding this woman. I said,</p>
               <p>"Do not ill-use her - take her to the watch-house, if she has done wrong."</p>

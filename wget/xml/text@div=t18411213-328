Between four and five o'clock, in the evening of the 7th of December, I was going into my shop—the prisoner and a woman were there—the prisoner asked to look at some socks, of a similar description to what my wife was showing to a customer—I showed them some—he offered me 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair, I asked 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he chose three pairs, and told me he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I said I could not take it—he remained about twenty minutes—I turned to get a halfpenny from my wife, and he went out—I missed three pairs of socks—I went out and stopped him, and asked him to give me up those socks—he said he had none, and he would knock my head off, if I said any thing to him—I called a policeman, and he was taken to the station—these socks were found in his pocket.</p>

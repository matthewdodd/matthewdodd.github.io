                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at York-square, Commercial-road. I own a barge—the prisoner was in my employ<lb></lb>ment some short time before Aug. last year—I gave him instructions to take a load of manure to Mr. Williams, at Greenhithe, and when he started I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to have 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for taking it—I was in the habit of paying him so much for each trip—when he came back he told me Mr. Williams did not want it, and Mr. Walters had taken it, and he had drawn 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and brought me this memorandum for the remaining 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me—some time after, when he was going into the neighbourhood, I desired him to call for the money—I asked, when he came back, if he had got it, and he said he had not—I asked him on two or three occasions—he left my service in the early part of Feb.—I afterwards wrote to Mr. Walters, and received a letter from him—I did not recover the money—I have never been paid—(<hi rend="italic">memorandum read</hi>—"Received of Mr. Porcas one freight of dung, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.")</p>

               <p>for the trip—he did not have a share of the profits of each trip; he had not of that trip—when he was down below, if any one offered him freight, he would take it, and would have a portion of the profits—that was not the ar<lb></lb>rangement for every freight he got—on some occasions he has a portion of the profits—I have not asked my attorney, or any one, whether it was not necessary, in order to convict this man, to make him my servant; nor looked into any book—sometimes the prisoner got freights of bricks—I did not pay the other man who worked the barge; I suppose the prisoner paid him—the barge was not lying idle at Limehouse seven months, or yet seven weeks before the prisoner took her.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you now, or did you at any time, owe the prisoner any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; he always had his money advanced—on some occasions he had a share—if he went from London with a load of manure, and some one said, "Can you take a load of bricks or manure?" then he would have half of the freight—there are fixed sums for freights generally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Stone, in Kent. In Aug., last year, the prisoner brought a freight of dung from Mr. Williams—he said he was busy, and could not work it out, and wauted me to take it—I said I was in the habit of having twelve months' credit, but if he would give me four months I would have it—he consented, and I was to pay 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he said he had been accustomed to have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on delivery, which I gave him, and have the receipt—in Dec. he applied to me for the balance, which I paid him—this is his receipt(<hi rend="italic">produced, dated 15th Dec.</hi>)—I wrote it, and he signed it, in my presence—at the latter end of Oct. he had brought me an order to pay him from Mr. Porcas.</p>

I have sailed with the prisoner, as mate, eight or nine years, off and on—I was in the barge <hi rend="italic">Henry,</hi> belonging to Mr. Porcas, when this manure was taken—I was hired by the prisoner, and he always paid me by the share; if we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> nothing, I got nothing—the prisoner had the control and management of the barge, and of the work, and found work for the barge—whenever we loaded dung, he took it wherever he liked, and made the best he could of it—once, when we were unloading bricks at Woolwich, Mr. Porcas and his man, Gudgeon, came on board, and wanted to know where Smith was—I said he had gone to London, to settle with Mr. Porcas—I have heard Mr. Porcas come down and ask Smith how he got on—Smith always paid Mr. Porcas money—I was never present—I have sailed all my life by the share—if the freight came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there would be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the owner, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the work, and I should expect 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself—they did not settle after every freight; it ran on fora month—I and Smith stopped at Three-cranes Wharf ten days in the barge, waiting for a freight of cement—Mr. Porcas came on the wharf, and told us to hold on; he would make them pay—8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day would be the proper price for the demurrage—my wages would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—I know of the barge being leaky on two occasions, and requiring repairs—it cost about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for three men to assist us, to keep us from losing her altogether.</p>

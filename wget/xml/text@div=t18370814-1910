                  </hi>. I am a jeweller. On the 27th of July, I opened my box, and missed a breast-pin, and these other things—my wife accused the prisoner who was in our service of it—she denied it at first, but when my wife said she would send for a policeman, she acknowledged she had taken some of the things—this is my property—this is the printed muslin—this is the brooch and the ear-drops—some were found in her pocket in a purse—this brooch and ear-rings were found in her pocket, and they are mine.</p>

               <p>pocket in her purse—Julia Asher was present—I took her with me as a witness to the police-office—she was not examined—I did not offer her as a witness, but she went as one if she was wanted—I required the Magistrate to hear what she had to say—that I swear, and he did not—I took her with me each time—she is no relation of mine—she works in the shop—I did not see the prisoner examined at all before the policeman came—I remember my wife speaking to her about these things—she said, "Do not accuse me of any thing of this sort, for I will bring you my box that you may search it"—she went into the back kitchen, and brought her box into the front kitchen—she kept her box in the back kitchen—she had only been with us fourteen days—it was kept with a rope tied round it—I never examined whether it was locked—I do not remember who took the string off—I was present when she brought the box, but do not recollect who opened it—she said she had opened my box with a key, and had taken the things I missed—I went for a policeman, and came back with him—her box was in the front kitchen when I came back—when the pelerine was found my wife told me to get a policeman—I never offered to make up this charge—I did not offer for a half-sovereign to waive all proceedings—I wanted nothing but justice—I know the prisoner's sister, living at Mr. Giles's, in Cable-street, by her coming to plead mercy for her—I had no conversation with her about this robbery—she came to my wife and asked for mercy—I was present—I had no conversation whatever with her about any money—I received a good character with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I lost some lace and this pelerine, which was found in the prisoner's box—it was not kept locked, but corded round—the pelerine is worth from 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these are the ear-rings—the pin was drawn from the prisoner's shift in her bosom—she held her hand up in a threatening position, and said, "Do you accuse me of being a thief?" and threw the pin over her shoulder—the printed muslin was produced from between her stays and petticoat—the pelerine was kept in a drawer in the shop—when the policeman was called in she said, "Send for my sister, I will give you back the half-sovereign, and pay you for the pelerine."</p>

I saw the prisoner bring the box out of the back kitchen—there was a cord round it—the prisoner opened it in the front kitchen—Mr. and Mrs. Van Praagh and myself were present—there was another servant in the house who left suddenly, very shortly after she was taken—I believe a lace cape or pelerine was taken out of the prisoners' box—the prisoner offered to strip herself that she might be examined—she pulled off her petticoat, put her hand to her bosom, and drew something from it, and said, "You charge me with robbing," and threw this pin over her shoulder—I said, "There is the half-sovereign, I should think"—I found it was a pin—I was present when the policeman came in—she gave the pelerine and pin to the policeman—the muslin came from between her petticoats and stays—I attended at the police-office, but was not heard—I go backwards and forwards to the prosecutrix's for needle work, but am not in her service.</p>

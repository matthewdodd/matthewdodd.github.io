             (police-constable C 164). On the 2nd of September I was on duty in Grafton-street - I heard a noise at No. 23 - I went over, and the gentleman at No. 22 looked out, as he had heard a noise - I waited till Bishop came up - we went into No. 22, and got into No. 23 - we heard some persons run up stairs, and we went up- I saw a hand taking a ladder through a trap door at the top - I jumped up, caught the ladder, and went up - I found the trap door of No. 24 was open - I went in, and found Evans in bed, with his stockings and drawers on, and Wood was on a bed on the floor - there was some lime on his shirt, and on the bed likewise - I found a bunch of keys on the table, and a knife - Bishop and I desired them to get up, and they were taken to the station-house - I went back to No. 23, and found a sack, with these things in it, on the roof - there was a puddle of water on the roof, and I found wet marks in the room where the prisoners were - Wood's shoes were wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find Evans's shoes? A. No; Wood was in his shirt; but it was some minutes after I tapped at the door before it was opened - I did not examine Evans's feet, but his hands were dirty - there were some women on the stairs of No. 24.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went in with Alderson - I saw some persons go into No. 24 - we got down, and tracked them by some lime - we knocked at a room door, but it was five minutes before we got admission - I heard some bustling inside - Wood was on an old piece of bed on a blanket, and Evans was in bed - I asked him how long he had been in bed - he said about two o'clock - I took him to the station-house, and in going along he threw this knob down an area - I found some of these things on Evans, under his shirt - this key fits one of the locks, which was found on the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the magistrate you heard a hustling in the room? A. Yes; I cannot tell whether that is in the deposition - I only saw one woman in the house, who appeared to live there - I went into the next room - I did not look at Evans's shoes - he took them from under the bed, and put them on - this lantern was burning on the roof.</p>

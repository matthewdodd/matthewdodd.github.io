             was up last. She is my wife's sister.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you discover your house was broken open - A. Between five and six in the morning, I found that I had lost the articles mentioned in the indictment. It was broken open at the back part of the house, by taking up a wood curb over the coal-cellar, which held the iron bars which led into the coal-cellar. The glazed part of the kitchen window was taken off, and laid upon the coals, and one of the iron bars bent, so as to admit a person in. They got into the back kitchen. The kitchen-door was bolted with two iron bolts, and locked, and had this spring bell upon it in the passage. The box, where the lock shot into, was taken off the door-post, and then the door was taken off, leaving one hinge on the door, and one hinge on the post. The door was put in the back kitchen, on the other side of the fire-place; and this bell was found in a basket where there were some greens. The pistol was taken off the mantle-piece in the front kitchen. Only this pistol was found. It was my wife's property before I married her. I have not the least doubt about the pistol. I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. That appears to me to be a common pistol - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the time when the house was broken open - A. From the noise that took place it must have been when we were asleep.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose, upon the discovery of this, you communicated it to Mr. Fleming - A. Yes. I went down into the kitchen and saw the door had been removed. They had cut a candle down, and put it in the candlestick. There was a great deal of the candle left.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010044"></xptr> It had burnt about two inches.

On the 1st of June, between eleven and twelve at night, I saw two men. I hailed them, and they ran away. The prisoner was one. They were in the fields. I ran after them, and took the prisoner. He had a bag under his arm. I called assistance, and we took him to the watchhouse. The prisoner was searched there. I saw the pistol taken from him, from behind his ham, under the bend of his knee; and I saw a box of phosphorus taken from him, and some keys of different sorts, and a picklock key among the rest.</p>

This picklock key was down in the skirt of his grrat coat, and the remainder of the keys were some in one pocket, and some in another. The phosphorus was in his waistcoat pocket. This is a purse, two knives, a tailor's thimble, and some needles. He said, his name was

            . I lost my tea-chest in the middle of December last, from a yard in the front of my house.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SITGRAVE. On the 10th of February, the prisoner and another man with him, who stood a little distance off, came into my shop with a tea-chest, in a blue apron, for sale, He took it out and gave it to me to look at. I suspected him very much, by the concealed manner in which he had it at first, and on examing it, I found it had no sugar glass; and he told me he had broken that just before he came from home; he asked me would I not give him any thing for it; I told him no, I would have nothing to do with it. I saw him go across to the next witness's shop over the way, and the other man with him; they immediately came out of Berry's, and I went over, and told him I considered the caddy as stolen. We went after them to the end of Charlotte-street; I there passed them, and they did not appear to know me again. I then lost them, and after that, going up towards the turnpike, at the top of Old-street, I saw the man who had accompanied the prisoner standing at a shop. I went into the shop, which is a broker's, and there the prisoner was offering it for sale; I told the woman that I thought it was stolen, and advised her not to buy it. I then looked for the person who accompanied the prisoner, and he was gone. The prisoner said the caddy was his; and when I got him to my house, he said it was his mother's; when I asked him who his mother was, he said she was a woman who carried the swagg, which I understood to be a basket of earthen ware.</p>

I had suspicion in consequence of his appearance, and refused to purchase it. We delivered the tea-caddy to an officer, together with the prisoner.</p>

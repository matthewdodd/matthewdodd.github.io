                  </hi> I am a dentist, of 159, Camden Road, in the parish of St. Pancras—on 28th March, about three in the morning, I heard a noise, got out of bed, and saw the prisoner on the first floor landing—there was a light from the gas in the street and from my neighbour's house; they are detached houses and form a crescent—I struck the pri<lb></lb>soner on the right cheek with my right hand, and he struck mo violently on the temple twice, which produced an effusion of blood—he rushed down stairs—about two days afterwards I saw him at the Brentford</p>

               <p>Police-station with another person, and pointed him out—I found my drawing-room door and window open, and there was dirt from some one's shoes on the mat—that is on the ground floor; the window and shutters were wide open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I was first brought under your notice on the 28th with another man, did not you order the other man to take off his cap? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Both of you, I think, and I believe I examined both of your heads to see if there was any mark—I do not think I asked him how he came by a bruise on his right cheek—I did not ask him to open his waistcoat, but the policeman opened it—he told me he had been fighting—I do not remember whether he wore a moustache—I said that I should like to see you by yourself in less light, and the superintendent took you into a passage where there was a light at one end and none at the other, and then I said, "I know you, and you know me"—I had the blinds drawn down in order to see you in a subdued light, as I saw you the first time—I was awoke by a loud rumbling noise and a violent concussion, which shook my bed—I thought it was nothing like a burglary, and therefore I went out unarmed—you had a little mark on your cheek two days afterwards, but not much.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 19 <hi rend="italic">T</hi>). On the morning of 29th March the prisoner was at Twickenham Police-station, and I noticed a mark on his right cheek about the size of a half-crown, as of a severe blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 37 <hi rend="italic">T</hi>). I told the prisoner the charge; he said that he knew nothing about it; he was at home and in bed, and could bring four witnesses to prove it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I think it a very hard case. There are three or four persons where I slept, who say that they cannot appear unless I furnish them with the means to pay for their loss of time; they live within a mile of this place. The other man who was charged with me had a mark on his cheek; that man slept with me on the night this gentleman's place was entered, and he was allowed to go at large. I never was in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood the gentleman says that he resides in in my life.</p>

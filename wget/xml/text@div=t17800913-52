               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. Hawley and Downes. On the 6th of this month about three o'clock in the afternoon, as I was returning from dinner, I met the prisoner at the bar in the street with the trunk upon his back. I had seen it landed at eight o'clock in the morning; it came from Perth, and was landed upon my master's wharf. I stopped him and got it from his shoulders; he seemed as if he would have made off, but I secured him and took him and the trunk back to the wharf.</p>

               <p>I came out of Scotland in a sloop. I came down to Wapping to seek a ship which was going farther on. I came to two or three wharfs to seek for a ship. A man came dressed in a blue coat, with a small ribbon about his hat; he asked me where I came from? I said from Scotland. I had come only that day. He said he would give me sixpence if I would carry this trunk about forty yards because he did not choose to carry it; as I was carrying it one of these gentlemen stopped me and said it did not belong to me. I said it belonged to that gentleman.</p>
               <p>To Newhall, When you stopped him what did he say to you? - I asked him who gave him the trunk; he said a man with a laced hat. I said you shall go back with this trunk and see if you can find the man.</p>

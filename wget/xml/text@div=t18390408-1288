On the 12th of March, about four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in York-place, City-road, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's house, carrying a large bundle on his shoulder—I asked him what he had got—he said, "A dock"—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "From a gentleman's in Tottenham Coart-road"—I asked him where he was going to take it to—he said, "To Mr. Beeche's, in Chiswell-street"—I asked him what Mr. Beeche was—he said, "A clock-maker," and he was going to take it to be repaired—I asked him what sort of a clock it was—he said, "A striking clock—I asked him to let me look at it—he took it off his shoulders, and put it on the pavement—I untied it, and there was a clock, a cloak, and a silk scarf—I told him to tie it up again, which he did—I said, "You must go with me to the station-house"—he took the clock, put it on his shoulder—we were going together—he said, "I shall not carry it any further"—he set it down on the pavement, made a plunge, and got away—I pursued, and took him again, after running about a hundred yards—I took him to the station-house, and found on him two knives, a house key, a China ornament, and part of a box of lucifer matches.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 36, Gracechurch-street. In July last, I was living with Mr. Thomas Bosberry, a draper, of Regent-street. On a Saturday evening, at the latter end of July, the prisoner came to the shop and asked to look at hosiery of different descriptions which I showed her—she asked to be showed some black silk handkerchiefs, and I did so—I observed her looking round towards the door, and then saw her shuffling her dress on the right side—the parcel of silk handkerchiefs was then in front of her, near the edge of the counter—I removed them from her, went round the counter, and asked her if she had anything on her that did not belong to her—she expressed surprise that a person of her respectability should be charged with such a thing—I asked her to move from the coun<lb></lb>ter a short distance, which she did, and I distinctly saw five handkerchief fall from the right side of her person on the floor—I picked them up—I showed them to her, and charged her with them—she said she knew nothing of it—Mr. Bosberry sent for an officer, and she was taken into custody—the handkerchiefs were his property, and worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she had directed the things she had selected to be sent to the Hon. Spencer Cow<lb></lb>per's, in Bruton-street, and she gave her own name, but I forget it—I went and inquired there, but did not take the goods—she was taken before the Magistrate—she appeared in a very bad state of health, and in conse<lb></lb>quence we withdrew the prosecution, but before that, when she was taken before Mr. Bingham, she said she was very sorry for what she had done.</p>

I gave them some mutton chops at the Blakeney's head in Bow-street. They whispered together. Sarsfield and the prisoner went out, and staid some time; when they came back they went out again and whispered. I left them and went home at about half an hour after twelve at night; then I missed my box with the things in the indictment in it, (mentioning them) I had seen them about three in the afternoon; I never got any of them again.

I was at work in the garret; he came up about ten o'clock and unlocked his box, and took some money out, (this was the Wednesday after Christmas.) He locked it again, and went out again. Sarsfield came about eight, and said, Are you at work? I said, Yes. He staid two or three minutes, and went away. In about a quarter of an hour he came again. I said, Sir, Where is my landlord? He said, I left him at the public house. I said, What is it o'clock? He said, It is just eight. That time he brought the prisoner with him. I knew Sarsfield before, but I never saw the prisoner before that night. I am very sure he is the man. I knew him again when I saw him at Sir

            's about a month after. Sarsfield sat down facing me; then he got up, and began cursing and swearing, and said, he wanted some money to go to a club. He came round to me. I looked round, and saw the prisoner go to James Hall's box, which was just behind me, about two or three yards from me. He took the box in his arms. I said, Gentlemen, what do you mean? Sarsfield said directly, Not a word, by Jesus. The prisoner went away with the box. Sarsfield all the while was standing over me for two or three minutes after the box was gone out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when he took the box, or while he was in the room?</p>
               <p>Davis. He said nothing when he took it. He had been talking to Sarsfield.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner in the room?</p>

               <p>Davis. No; I was afraid to stir out of the room. Sarsfield asked me to light him down stairs; I did, and wished him a good night. Then I went up to my room, and staid there till my landlord came home, after twelve o'clock. I dare not go down stairs. My room is up three pair of stairs. I saw nobody from their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250005"></xptr> going away till my landlord came home. I was a stranger in that part of the town, being lately come from the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not mention a word of Lee on the trial of Sarsfield?</p>
               <p>Davis. I did not know his name then; I mentioned another man with Sarsfield. I knew his face, and know the prisoner is the man. When my landlord came home he missed his box; he came into the room where I was, and asked me where his box was; I told him Sarsfield and another man had been here and taken it away. There were some of the prisoner's countrymen and some of mine came to me last Monday and offered me seven guineas if I would go off. I am a Welshman. They said they would have a coach for me to carry me down to Windsor, or any other place. I saw one of them at the door as I came in.</p>

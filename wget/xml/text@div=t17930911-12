               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a servant of your's? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live? - He lived at Pinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose? - I lost a bit of bacon, and a penknife, out of the tea chest, and the value of half a pint of gin, and a bit of pudding. The tea chest stood on the dresser, the gin was in a bottle that stood on the dresser; I lost them the 13th of August, between ten and eleven, as near as I can guess, in the day; I went out to work between five and six, I saw them there then; I believe he took them between ten and eleven, because of a little girl who lived at the next door, and I asked her.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he took them? - Because he owned it, and I found the things on him in about an hour or a couple of hours, on the same day; I found on him the bacon and the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body in your hearing tell him to confess? - Says I,

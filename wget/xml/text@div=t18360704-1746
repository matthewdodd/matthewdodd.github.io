                  </hi>. I am a Marine, quartered at Woolwich. On the 2nd of June, I had been drinking at a public-house, and left at half-past eleven o'clock to go to the barracks—I was very drunk, and when I got into the air I got worse—I think I laid down, and when I came too, I found myself lying in the street, and my boots cut off me—when I left the public-house, I had my boots laced tight on—they had been cut off, and my right foot was very much cut—I was in the hospital sixteen days—I had not seen the prisoners on the night I lost them—it was Satur<lb></lb>day night or Sunday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of Woolwich. I was of duty that Sunday morning at four o'clock, and was in a lane called Ship-stairs—I observed a great deal of blood on the stone of a public-house—I traced the blood about 30 yards, and there I saw the prosecutor buttoning up his trowsers—his boots were off, and his trowsers were all bloody as high as his knees—he was quite sober then, but quite in a debilitated</p>

               <p>state—his stockings and feet were cut—I gave him in charge to our superintendent—I then took two men with me, and saw a boat coming up with parsons and the two female prisoners in it, about a quarter past five o'clock—I saw them go alongside the Peter boat, and Parsons took these boots out of it, and put them in the boat he was in—he then came towards the stairs—he saw us, and seemed to avoid us, and was going to pull towards the river—we drew off, and then he landed at Ship-stairs—he pulled off his shoes, turned up his trowsers, and washed his feet and hands in the Thames—he then up the stairs—I went and took him, and told him that these boots which he had in his hand were what I was looking for—(the tongue of this boot is cut through, and here is blood in the boot)—he seemed very much agitated, and could hardly get a word out—at last he brought out the word "Tracey"—I told him he must go with me to the station, and we took him—he declared he was innocent of any thing—I showed him the blood that laid about, and said the man was pretty well killed—he put his two hands together, and said, so help him God, it was not him, but he knew the man that did do it—we left the women while we took him to the station—when he got there, he said he had the boots from Banister—we searched him, and took 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him, and on over hauling his coat, we found blood under the arm, where we suppose the boots had been put—we then went back for the women, and as we were bringing them up, one was bantering the other to tell the truth, and at last Hickey said that Banister was the man that Parsons got the boots from, and that at the time the boots were taken from the man, she made the remark that it lay in her power to transport them both if she liked—I left the women in the custody of my brother officer, and went to Banister's lodging—I found him on the bed but not undressed—I questioned him whether he had been with parsons during the night—he said he had the whole of the night, and had left him about half-past three o'clock in the morning—but previous to my finding Tracey, I had seen Banister coming up the lane at near four o'clock, and I called to him, to tell him that his wife, or the woman that he lives with, was looking for him, and he ran away from me—I watched him home, and on returning from there, I discovered the blood, and the prosecutor.</p>

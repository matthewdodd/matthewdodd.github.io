                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Card—he is a turner. About two o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 27th of Oct., I was walking along Austin-street, Shoreditch, with my niece, Ann Card—the prisoner came up—he said nothing, but <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me about violently, then took my shawl from me, and struck me on the mouth and face—I fell, and bled very much—this is my shawl—it is the one I had on my back at that time.</p>

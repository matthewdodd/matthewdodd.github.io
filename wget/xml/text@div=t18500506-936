                  </hi>. I was servant to Mr. Minton, a beer-seller. On Satur<lb></lb>day night, 13th April, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another man, called <hi rend="italic">"Paddy,"</hi> up-stairs in the second floor at Mr. Minton's—I had seen the prisoner down-stairs before that, playing the fiddle—there was no one up-stairs but them and me—Mrs. Minton was down-stairs in the bar, and there were some soldiers in the house—<hi rend="italic">Paddy</hi> broke the panel of a door with an axe, and the prisoner was standing at the top of the stairs seeing whether any one was coming—the prisoner said he would cut my throat if I told my master—after the panel was broken, he went in and fetched out three blankets, two sheets, and some dresses, one by one, through the broken panel—they brought them down stairs, folded up in a red bundle, and the other man took them into a cottage at the back of the house, where no one lives—the prisoner had been drinking that evening, but was not intoxi<lb></lb>cated—he was only pretending to be so, staggering about—when they came down the prisoner went in front of the bar, and pretended again to be drunk—he left about twelve o'clock—I did not see him again till he was in custody on the Monday or Tuesday after—I had not given any information to any one in the meantime of what I had seen—the prisoner said he would cut my throat, and I was frightened—I told it first when the policeman came on the Monday—the prisoner said he would buy me a new suit of clothes, a watch-guard, and a watch, and a new pair of boots, and a sovereign in my pocket to go prigging—that was on the Sunday night after the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a beer-seller, and kept the Duke of York. On 13th April, Jones was in my service—I was out that evening, and returned about half-past eight o'clock, and again at half-past ten—I saw a bundle in the bar containing these blankets, sheets, gowns, and other articles, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I went to my room on the second-floor, and found the panel of the door cut and pushed in—I got in through it myself, and missed all the clothes off the bed, books and papers, shirts, and other things that have not been found, to the value of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw Jones there that even<lb></lb>ing, but he did not say anything to me about the robbery till the Monday afternoon, when the policeman was there—I have known the prisoner some time—I saw him in the house that evening, about half-past eight—I left him in the house—I cannot say who was with him—there was a full house—I know the person described by Jones; be was in the habit of coming with the prisoner, and was in the house that evening—I have seen him once since this hap<lb></lb>pened, but not since the prisoner has been in custody—these papers(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced by Loome</hi>)are mine, and were in a box about a week before.</p>

I was coming home full of liquor between 1 and 2 in the morning, after boxing day, I met with the prisoner at the bar, we went in at <placeName id="t17630114-26-crimeloc141">the Anchor alehouse in Chick-lane</placeName>

I gave her half a crown; my watch was then in my pocket. She clasped my arm round just at parting, I had not power to get up, and I missed my watch directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you fallen down?</p>
               <p>Hethcote. No, I was standing. I found my watch gone, and I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been down?</p>
               <p>Hethcote. I had. She put her hands round me while I was taking out my money, and I fell down, and had not power to get up. I said, you have got my watch; she said, go about your business home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Hethcote. No. The next morning I went there again, and she came in. We took her to Guildhall; she said there, she had no watch, but the two women that were left behind had it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I go a-washing. This man came into the house where I was in Chick-lane. I never saw him in my life before. I went away and left him in the house. The next morning I was coming up the lane, I saw him; there were two women there that sat by him. I asked him, if I ever meddled with his watch? he said, he did not know, the women imbibed it in his head that I took it. He swore first before the sitting Alderman, that he lost it out of his coat-pocket, tied up in a silk handkerchief. Please to call the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dolman. I am the constable. The prosecutor charged me with the prisoner for stealing his watch. I know nothing at all of it. All I know of her is, she is a very bad woman as possibly can be. When I took her in charge, both he and she were so drunk that I believe they hardly knew one another.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was you in company with any other women at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Thompson, and live in Car<lb></lb>naby-street, Golden-square—on Wednesday, the 29th of Oct., I was walking in Shadwell with my little boy—I had a purse containing three sovereigns, half-a-crown, two shillings, two sixpences, and some halfpence—I saw the prisoner just inside the gate of the London Dock—I asked if he would be kind enough to direct me to the Hermitage Dock—there was a man inside the gate about two or three yards from him—the man said, "You can go through the dock and round the dead wall"—the prisoner was by—I went round the dead wall—the prisoner followed me, came up and said if I liked he would show me the way—I said, "No, thank you, my had, as you have been kind enough to direct me I can find it myself," he walked by me—as he was passing me I saw my gown lifted up on my right side where my pocket was—the prisoner left me and walked on—when had got a few yards I missed my purse—I know it had been safe not two minutes before—no one had been near me but him—I directly ran and caught hold of him by the collar, and said, "You have stolen my purse and money, all that I possess, and if you will give it me I will let you go; I am the mother of a family, and don't wish to hurt you"—I held him and sent for a policeman, who came and took him—there were six or eight boys surrounding him, some without hats and some without shoes.</p>

I am barman at the Lord Rodney, Westminster Road—on 16th October, about 11.45, the prisoners and another all came in and had something to drink—Stoney and Evans were in one compartment and Bassett and an old gentleman in another—Bassett gave me a florin which I put in the till—Stoney then called for some drink, and gave me a florin—I put that in the till and gave him change—Bassett then had some<lb></lb>thing to drink and gave me a third florin—I tried it and it bent—I then looked at the other two florins and found they were bad—they were not in the till—Mrs. Bucks had cleared the till at 12 o'clock before I served the pri<lb></lb>soners—I called in two policemen and gave two of the florins to Melville and the other to Bellchambers—when I got over the bar to fetch a constable I met Stoney at the door going away—I did not give any florins in change to any one after 12 o'clock as there were none there—nobody used that till but me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabriolet master, and live in Co<lb></lb>burg-street, Hampstead-road. On the 18th of January I had a cab under the charge of Robert Fincher—I sent him out with it—a black mare was with it—Fincher has not been here—I do not know where he is—he went out with it on the night of the 18th, about half-past five or a quarter to six o'clock—he came to me about five minutes before eleven o'clock, without cab or mare, and gave me information—in consequence of what he said, I went to endeavour to find the cab and mare, and found it in Holborn, about half-past one o'clock—the prisoner was driving it—it was coming from the City towards High Holborn—two gentlemen were inside it—I stopped the cab directly I saw it—the gentlemen jumped out and no away—I did not know either of them—I am sure it was my horse and cab—I called a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge—I went with him to the station-house—he there said he had found the cab coming towards Westminster-bridge without any body in it—next morning, when he was before the Magistrate, he said it had been standing two hours opposite the Star and Garter, Edgeware-road, without any driver, and he found it there—Fincher was before the Magistrate, and continued in my service for a week or ten days after, and then left—I have seen him since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge—he said, at the station-house, that he met the cab and horse walking to<lb></lb>wards Westminster-bridge—he said before the Magistrate that he saw it standing two hours opposite the Star—I do not recollect that he named where—I do not know any Star near Westminster-bridge—Fincher was bound over to appear as a witness—what he said was taken down in writing—I cannot be positive that I saw him sign it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in Southampton-street, Westminster, and saw the cab in Parliament-street and nobody with it, and the reins under the horse's feet—I went to the side of it—there was nobody in it—I took it back to the stand in York-road, opposite Astley's Theatre, and asked the waterman if there was an owner to the cab—he said "No"—a lady and gentleman came up as a fare—I stood a quarter of an hour—nobody came—I took it to a stand in Holborn—I then drove to the stand opposite the Star in the City-road, and stopped there a quarter of an hour—nobody came—two gentlemen in the public-house said they knew the cab, that it belonged to a gentleman in the Edgeware-road, and they would go with me—they got into the cab, and as we drove up Holborn, the prosecutor stopped me and gave me in charge—I was never in the Edgeware-road—Fincher told the Magistrate he left the cab and horse with a boy, and when he came out of the public-house the cab and boy were gone—when I first saw it, it was going over the bridge with the reins under the horse's feet—the gentlemen were quite strangers—they jumped out immediately I was stopped—I had been in London about three days.</p>

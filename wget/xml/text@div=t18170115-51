            . I am an officer. I was standing at the corner of Featherstone-street, about ten o'clock on the morning of the 3d of January, the prisoner and another man, were coming towards me with a bundle; they were crossing into Banner-street. Seeing me, they altered their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150020"></xptr>course, and turned up Bunhill-row: when they got to Artillery-buildings, the other man said, here is a b-y pig, and ran away. I went up to the prisoner, and asked him, what he had got in the bundle. He said, an old jacket and trowsers; he said, there was nothing else. I took him to the watch-house, and asked him again before I opened the bundle, what it contained. He then said, four pair of shoes. I found a jacket and trowsers, and four pair of shoes in it. He said, I might keep them if I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. I did not know him before; the prisoner did not run away. The man who was with him was dressed as a sailor.</p>

At that instant he hit me, he seized my watch. I ran after him, and cried stop thief; he made his escape between the coaches; I lost him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your watch again - A. I came round to the spot again; in about a quarter of an hour; there was a man there that I understood to be a Bow-street officer; he said, young man, it is of no use of you standing and waiting here, he will not be here any more to night, if I would call on him on the next morning at the Yorkshire Grey, he would speak to me. On the next morning I went to that house; I asked the landlord if he had seen a Bow-street officer there. The landlord's name is Harding. He said, what do you want with a Bow-street officer; I told him that I had lost my watch; it was a silver watch, with a steel chain and key only to it. The landlord afterwards produced me the watch. This is the watch; it is mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was this a blow or a tap that the man gave you - A. A tap with the back of his hand; I did not receive any injury by it.</p>

            . I keep the Yorkshire Grey public-house. The prisoner brought the watch to me to sell about ten o'clock at night; he had a whip in his hand; I have known the prisoner some time; he is a hackney coachman. He said, Harding, I want to sell a watch for twenty-two shillings; I told him, I had no money to purchase watches. He turned round and went away; directly after, Henry, the prosecutor, came to me with another man, and called for a pint of beer, asked me if I had a Bow-street officer in the way, one had promised to meet him there that morning; I told him there was no one there. I asked him his business; he said, he had lost a silver watch, with a steel chain, and a key at the end of it; he said, he was a journeyman carpenter, it was very hard for him to lose it; I said, it was. I told him on the over night I had such a one offered to me for sale, perhaps I might find it out. I went then to the watering-house in Charles-street, Covent Garden; there was some coachmen there at breakfast; I told them the circumstance of Ned, the coachman; he goes by that name; one of the men said he lived in Charles-street, Drury-lane; the feeder of the horses went and shewed me the house. I went up in the two pair room; I found the prisoner at breakfast there with his wife; I said to the prisoner, Edward, the watch you offered me last night is a stolen watch. The prisoner took me to Crown-street, Seven Dials, to the Plough public-house; I stopped in the public-house about a quarter of an hour the prisoner brought

             that the watch that he left in his hands the over night he must give to me; he did so. I left the prisoner and Tappen together and came home. The prosecutor has the watch now. I have no recollection of the watch, only it had a steel chain. When I told the prisoner that the watch he offered me last night was a stolen watch; he said, he picked it up. The prisoner was taken in custody the next morning in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the prisoner, is he the man that gave you the blow on the breast - A. To the best of my recollection he is; I took particular notice of his dress; his dress tallies. I described his dress to the landlord.</p>

            . I am a hackney coachman. The prisoner brought this watch to me on the 27th of September, he asked me to lend him two shillings upon it; I had one shilling about me, and a shilling he owed me before, that is all he had for it. I had the watch in my possession until next morning, then Mr. Harding and another man came for it; I delivered up the watch; the watch had a steel chain to it. I cannot swear to the watch.</p>

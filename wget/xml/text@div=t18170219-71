He was in our house on the 22d of February-it is a private house. He came there about ten o'clock, with Seneway, who lodges there, he left the house about eleven o'clock at night. I gave Seneway the key, (the prisoner was with him) to let themselves in. About five o'clock in the morning, I heard somebody coming down stairs; I did not hear him come in again. I sleep in the parlour. I asked who was there three times - No answer was given. I heard the watchman call five o'clock in the morning, it was quite dark in the room, the shutters were to. I heard the street door open, it was bolted and locked. I heard him unlock the door; he went away. When I got up in the morning, I missed a large shawl which hung on a line, and a jacket which belonged to a gentleman, whom I wash for. I got up about eight o'clock in the morning; I missed nothing else-that was all that belonged to me. The jacket hung on a line, in the same room in which I slept. They must go through my room to go up stairs. It was a white linen jacket. I had only let Seneway the lodging three weeks.</p>

            . I was in company with the prisoner. I met with him at the Kettle-Drum, in Denmark-street, and took him to my lodgings about half-past ten o'clock at night, he went in with me; it was on the 22d of February. I lodge in the one pair of stairs; he was to sleep with me that night. We went out about half-past eleven o'clock, he went with me. Mrs. Williams gave me the key; I returned with the prisoner to my lodgings about twelve o'clock, he went into my room with me; he said, it was too late for him to go home, and he would sleep in my room that night. We let ourselves in with the key, and left the key on the table in my room. I am quite sure that I locked the door when I went in. The prisoner slept in the same bed with me. We both got up about three o'clock in the morning; he wanted to go into the yard. I went down with him. We returned to bed again. I awoke at half-past four o'clock - He was not gone then. I awoke again at half-past seven-the prisoner was then gone. I found the key of the street door on the table. It is a spring lock and goes back without the key. I missed the things I had taken off the overnight; it was a pair of trowsers, value 12s., a waistcoat, a silk handkerchief, a jacket, some stockings, and two 1l. notes. The prisoner was taken up the same morning about half-past eight o'clock; he had my clothes on.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Cunningham, who is captain of a steam-packet—we lodge in the house of Samuel Glover Fair<lb></lb>brother, at No. 31, Bow-street, and have the upper apartments—the pri<lb></lb>soner was Mrs. Fairbrother's servant. I had 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in sovereigns and half<lb></lb>sovereigns, which I kept at the back of a drawer in the sitting-room in a beaded purse, which was in a velvet bag—I did not keep the drawer locked—there was no lock to it—I saw it all safe within a fortnight of losing it—on the 13th of Sept., at a quarter to nine o'clock, on going to my drawer I missed the bag, purse, and money—I told the prisoner of my loss—she said she was very sorry for it—I sent for a policeman—I asked her if she had bought any clothes, or spent any money—she gave me some information, then went down stairs, and brought up a dirty cotton bag soiled as if it had fallen into the privy—she said, "See what I have found in the water-closet"—the police<lb></lb>man took it out of her hand—she said there was money in it—it contained 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, all my money but 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was not my bag I found, it was Mrs. Fairbrother's bag—the policeman searched the water-closet, and found my beaded purse covered over with a half hand<lb></lb>kerchief—it is a pan water-closet—the handkerchief did not belong to me—the prisoner was in my room at times, and I trusted her with the key of it—Mr. or Mrs. Fairbrother might have gone to my room, but nobody else except the prisoner—nobody had suggested that it might be thrown down the privy—I had said all I could for her to endeavour to try and find the purse, and offered 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; if it was found—I did not discover that she had been spending much money—there were several new things in her box, but not of any value—Mrs. Fairbrother is not here—I asked the prisoner if she had these things given to her, or had bought them—she said she gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them a few days before, that her father had bought them for her, and afterwards that he gave her part of the money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I spoke to the prisoner about a pair of stays and other articles found in her box—she said she bought the stays in Cross-court, Drury-lane, for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid for them in silver—she after<lb></lb>wards returned to the room, and produced a dirty bag with the money, and said, "I think it is money"—I asked why she thought so—she said because she had seen some—she did not say that on opening it she found money, in it—I</p>

               <p>cleaned the bag, opened it, and found seventy-three sovereigns and fifty-five half-sovereigns folded in two pieces of paper—I went to the water-closet, and found this shawl and the bead purse—I have not found who the shawl belonged to—there are several people in the house—I found several people in the room—the purse and shawl could not have been there long, as it was not dirty, only a little wet—if anybody had gone there it must have been dirty—the purse was as clean as it is now—I could not see it when I went to the water-closet, as it is a basin—I had to put my arm through—it was known in the house that the money was missed.</p>

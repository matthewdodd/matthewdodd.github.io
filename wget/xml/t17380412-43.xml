            . About 10 o'Clock on Sunday Night, March 12. I was coming down the Strand with another young Man, and there being a Burying at the Corner of <placeName id="t17380412-43-crimeloc214">Catherine-street</placeName>

When he was gone, the Prisoner laid hold of my right Arm, and I got loose from him twice, but the 3d Time he seiz'd me, he held me so fast to his Breast, that it was with the utmost Difficulty I freed myself from him. As soon as I was disengag'd I felt for my Watch, and it was gone. I ask'd him the Reason of his laying hold of me, and imagin'd he had some Evil in his Breast; but he made no Answer at all, only held me fast. While I was struggling with him, I felt a Man behind me; and I suppose either the Prisoner, or some of his Confederates, then got my Watch, for there were several in Company with him, tho' the Prisoner only assaulted me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you call out to the People that attended the Funeral?</p>
               <p>Castella. I was in Fear, and apprehended that most of the Mob about him consisted of his Confederates, I was afraid of being knock'd on the Head. The Day before he went to offer Bail before a Judge, he sent me Word, I should have 3 Guineas, if I would not object to his Bail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you where I liv'd?</p>
               <p>Castella. When he was gone before the Justice, he said he <rs id="t17380412-43-deflabel215" type="occupation">kept a Cork cutter's Shop</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not I go with you before the Justice without a Constable?</p>
               <p>Castella. As soon as he was out of the Mob, I took him, and told him, I had lost my Watch while he held me. You joke, says he. I told him he should go before a Justice, and he said, he had rather go without a Constable, than be knock'd down, and forc'd to go</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many People might there be about the Burying?</p>
               <p>Castella. About 30 or 40, besides the Mourners. They were going into the last Coach, when this happen'd.</p>

            . On the 13th of March, I was with the Prisoner in the Round-House. There was a Man call'd me out, and desir'd he might drink with Castella and me: We went to a publick House, and he offer'd him 2 Guineas and the Watch to make up the Matter, because the Prisoner was but just come into Business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went with him before the Justice, the Justice would have nothing to say to me, because I did not come before him in charge of a Constable; upon which I went with Castella to the Constable of the Night.</p>

            . My master's house is repairing: I kneeled down in the passage, to call my young master to tea, and saw the prisoner take a pair of shoes off the shelf in the shop; he was at the bottom of the ladder; he was my master's journeyman; he put one in one pocket, and the other in the other, and went out at the door with them; this was about six o'clock in the evening, about a week ago, or better; his business was to cut out. I went down and told my young master the prisoner had got a pair of shoes in his pocket, and he went after him, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Bulimore Francis. The prisoner came to my house, and called for a pint of beer, on a Monday, a week ago; he said he would fetch them in two hours time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Francis. I live in Windmill-court, Pye Corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call?</p>
               <p>Francis. He did not call at all for them; here they be. (Two pair produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

            . The prisoner confest to me, the morning after he took the shoes, where they were: I am a fellow journeyman. He was apprehended the same evening; I think the 19th instant, on a Monday: he said the reason he did not tell me before was, because he had left two pair instead of one; as the maid charged him but with one pair: I went and found them where he had said.</p>

               <p>I took them for a customer, and he was gone out of town; and I could not shew them that night; and I took and left them there: the person's name is Jones, he lives in the country.</p>

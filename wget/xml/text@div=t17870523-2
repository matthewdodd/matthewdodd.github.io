             gave me a ticket of this cloak to redeem it from Mr. Cowper's, to take it to another pawn-broker's, to get more money upon it if I could.</p>
               <p>When was this? - Last Monday fortnight; I could not get so much money by two shillings, and I took it back to Cowper's again, and got the same money upon it again.</p>
               <p>Was it the same cloak you took out by means of that duplicate that you brought again to Cowper's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you are sure you had it from Lawson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Lawson say any thing to you when he took it to Cowper's? - Nothing at all, it was last Monday fortnight when I redeemed it, and I brought it back again to the pawn-broker's the same day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen, prisoners counsel. Where do you live? - I have been in custody ever since last Monday; I have been an unfortunate girl.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation in the course of this business with the officers, as to what you should get by this prosecution? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you do not know that there is a reward in this case? - No, Sir, I do not, and I do not wish to have it; I am twenty-two.</p>
               <p>How long have you been what you call an unfortunate girl? - Almost a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>You do not know there is a reward in these cases? - No, Sir, I do not.</p>

               <p>Which had the cutlass? - Cousins had the cutlass, and Lawson had the pistol; I had no arms; we proceeded through the back roads, through several villages till we came near Acton; we stopped thereabouts for some time, till at length I believe it was a hackney coach came near us; Cousins run out and called the coachman to stop; I seized the horses; Lawson went in at one door, and I went to the other; then I came round again, and stood by the horses, and Cousins and Lawson got into the coach; there happened to be only one lady in the coach; they had taken her money, and

               <p>Which took her money? - Cousins, they demanded the Lady's ring, and she observed it was her wedding ring, and they desisted from taking it; after that we proceeded across the fields, and came to town; then we went to the pawnbroker's in Wild-street, and Lawson pawned the cloak for eight shillings; we then divided the money, and drank a glass of rum together, and I left them; they took from the lady a guinea and a half in gold, a half crown piece, a shilling, and two six-pences; I had fifteen shillings for my share, then I left them; I am sure the two prisoners were with me; I never was in company with Cousens before to my knowledge; I have known Lawson some time before.</p>

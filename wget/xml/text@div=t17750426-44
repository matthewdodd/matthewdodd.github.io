At half past five o'clock in the morning of the 23d of April, (last Sunday) as I was coming down about my business, I opened the kitchen door, and saw some men, I believe three, I am not quite positive to the number; I was so extremely surprized with it, they were going out of the kitchen window, which is below stairs, into the area, they had forced the door of the kitchen into the area, I went immediately back again up stairs to alarm my fellow-servants.

Andrew asked which way they were gone, as he had lost sight of them during the time he was going down stairs: I said they were got into the garden, upon which he barefooted as he was, jumped into the garden after the men; my master's house is the last but two on the last hand side, I heard one of the persons say, but who I don't know, d - n you, blow his brains out; there were no watch at that time, it was so late they were gone off their stand. I kept my eyes upon them till I saw Andrew run after two of them across the fields, the other had made his escape another way. I looked as long as I could see them running across the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260029"></xptr> fields, then I came down stairs in order to take this bag of plate that was left in the garden, for I saw one of them fling a bag over the area when I looked out of the window, and the first man that got over, picked up this bag, and ran away with it, and got into the garden.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Nugent, I was alarmed by my fellow-servant about half past five in the morning with a cry of thieves in the house; upon which I got up and went into her room, and saw two men in the area, one with a laced hat, and another with a bag, there was a third man that was getting over the rails. I did not stay there much longer, but ran down stairs, and just as I ran down stairs the house bell rang, which I imagine alarmed the people more than they were alarmed before, and made them hasten away as fast as they could; but by the time I had got down stairs, and had opened the bars and bolts, and opened the door, they had got quite out of sight, and had got over the garden wall, which is about thirty yards off. I asked my fellow-servant which way they were gone: she said into the garden; upon which I jumped down; one of the fellows immediately said, d - n you, blow his brains out. I am not certain which said that, there being three to one, it put me to a stand; I did not advance to them, but they were endeavouring to make their escape, and got over the rails into the fields; and Jordan, the shortest of the two prisoners, dropped the bag as he was getting over the pails, I am certain it was him; I got over after them, and pursued two of them, which were the two prisoners, and pursued them as far as the burying ground, there I met with one Parsons, who accompanied me up to the brick kilns. I was barefoot, so that when we ran upon the grass I had the soot of them, and ran faster, but when they came upon hard road I could not run so fast; by that time many people were alarmed, and Parsons went and seized Jordan in my sight; I lost sight of Jordan about two minutes while he was dodging backwards and forwards among the brick kilns, but I am sure to his person, though I had not my eyes upon him during the whole time; I saw him again afterwards, and I am very certain to his person, I went up the moment Parsons had laid hold of him, and said what a fool was you to break open a house at such a time in the morning, at this was; he said he was innocent; then I went round the kiln to look for the other, he was taken not quite in my presence, he was at some short distance. I might have seen him very plain, only the multitude of people that were between me and the prisoner were such, that I cannot exactly say that I saw him taken, neither can I swear to his person. The other had a plain hat; Jordan was much behind, and I had a better opportunity of viewing his face, and I am certain to his person.</p>

               <p>Thompson. No, not directly and positively; but it was very much like him, and I believe it was him; he had no hat on at the time he came over the rails from the area, and went into the garden. Andrew came out, and asked where they were gone, and was informed they were in the garden. I also heard somebody say, d - n him, blow his brains out. The short man, which I take to be Jordan, got over the pails into the fields, and dropped the bag, and Andrew pursued him till out of sight. I still kept at the window, while Martin went down stairs, Martin went down to the garden wall, and took the bag in which was the plate from a man, who gave it to her, I had my eye upon them all the time.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker in Hart-street, Covent-garden. I was accidentally out in the fields to take a walk at half past five last Sunday morning. I heard a cry of stop thief, and saw the two prisoners running, they were pursued by four or five, one a gentleman's servant without shoes or stockings on. At first, I thought it was only some people in play together, I took no notice of it, but seeing the gentleman's servant coming running without shoes or stockings, then I began to think it was something serious, and turned and joined in the pursuit. William, the tallest man, turned round, and said to one of the men that followed after him, You bloody thief, if you touch me I will blow your brains out. I followed Williams, who, in order to avoid me, jumped into a pond up to his middle, I caught at him but could not catch him at that time, and then he ran into a brick kiln, and dodged backwards, there I got a piece of a brick and gave him a blow on the head, which a little stunned him; he put his hand to his head, then I closed upon him. I never lost sight of him from the first, I am certain he was the man. The gentleman's servant then came up and said, What a regue or fool was you to rob a house by day-light; and the prisoner desired him not to use him ill.</p>

I was wheeling some dung to Mr. Harding's yard, who keeps cows; near his cow house, in the fields, I heard a cry of theives, and saw Williams running with a pistol in his hands. upon which I alarmed the milk people, who were in the yard, and they all ran after him; I saw Parsons lay hold of Jordan, and they hunted Williams about for above a quarter of an hour in the brick-kiln, where they dry bricks, dodging about before they caught him. One of the men found him there, and they, to the number of twenty surrounded him; he still stood upon his defence against them all: one of the men,

(The salt-seller produced, and deposed to by Bolan, who said, he absolutely saw it the day before, that it was one of a better sort, and was frequently papered up when it was not in use, and stood in that cupboard where the rest of the plate was.</p>

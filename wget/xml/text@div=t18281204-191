            . I am a Bow-Street patrol. On the 20th of November. I saw the female prisoner in White-street, Spitalfields, with a bundle containing six hats, and a cloak over it; I asked where she got them - she said she had brought them from over the water, from Mr. Harris', to pick, the day before, had left them at a house close by, and had called for them; she said if we went with her she would shew us where they lived - I handed her to my conductor: she was going towards Bishopsgate, and might have gone to the Borough that way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then she told you if you went she would shew you the house? A. Yes, and she staid with me while my conductor went to the place; her account was true - it was in some street in Surrey-street.</p>

            . I am conductor of the patrol. Mitchell gave the female prisoner to me on the 20th of November; he said, "I have stopped this woman with this bag, and she says there are hats in it;" I asked her how many there were, and she said half a dozen - I found it was so: she said she did not know the street, nor number, but she would shew us the house; I asked where she lived, and she said in a street in King-street, Borough - I asked whose hats they were - she said her husband was foreman to Messrs. Harris, of Winchester-street, Borough - that she brought the hats over last night, left them at Mr. Coffee's, and when she called for them they were removed - that she had them to pick, and was returning them; I left her in custody, and went to Harris'.</p>

            ; the male prisoner has been in their service eight or nine months - the woman came to fetch hats to pick, and to bring them back; her husband delivers them to her - I deliver them to him in general, but sometimes Mr. Walmesley does; we keep a book, in which we enter the work given to the prisoner - he gives<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040084"></xptr>them to his wife as he pleases: he has no right to give out any which are not delivered to him; here is an account in the book of work delivered to him - the whole of them are accounted for; we at times give bats back to repair, but these were not to be repaired - the bats delivered to him have been returned; if any others were made use of by him, I did not deliver them to him: I believe these to be my employers' property.</p>

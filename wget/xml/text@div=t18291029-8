I said No; she then asked if she might come home to my place - I said, "Yes, Sarah, you may - I am going to wash, will you come with me now;" she said No, she was going to Old-street-road with a cap - when I got home I was talking to a neighbour - a little girl came and said something, and when I got home I found our room door, which is on the first floor, unlocked; I had left it locked - the landlord does not live in the house; there are two lodgers - we pay 2s. 6d. a week; only my father, mother, and myself occupy that room - we have but one room; I went into the room, found my box open, and missed a gown, a pair of shoes, a yard of cotton, a pair of stockings, and a yard of blue cotton out of it - also a gown and a handkerchief out of a bundle on the bed; I am seventeen years old, and go to service, but was then out of place, and merely waiting there till I could get one; I pay nothing for my lodging - I keep my wages, and bought my clothes myself; I did not see the prisoner that evening - I had been absent about three quarters of an hour; Hands, the officer, took me to the pawnbrokers, where I saw my things, on the Friday - I lost them on Tuesday, the 13th; I was with Hands on Thursday when he took the prisoner - she said she would go and shew him where she had pawned the things; I found every thing but the stockings.</p>

On the 2d of January, about six o'clock in the evening, after dark, I saw the prisoners Davis and Froom, with another person (not in custody), standing at my window - I suspected them. I was in the street coming home, and passed the door. The shop is part of the dwelling-house. About ten yards further I saw another suspicious character, walking to and fro and looking about. I then crossed the street, and saw Maller watching on that side of the way - I again crossed towards my shop, and stood about twenty seconds, and saw Davis push his fingers against the window; the glass fell inside. I seized him; his fingers went inside the glass, which I found had been cut by some sharp instrument. He slipped from me - I pursued, and in the pursuit I saw Maller running; I seized him, and Davis was taken by another person who is not here - I never lost sight of him. On returning towards the house with them two, I saw Froom endeavouring to hide himself against one of the pillars of the Opera colonade, which is opposite my house; I pointed him out and he was secured. I am certain of his person. I gave them in charge. I am certain I saw Davis's fingers go inside through the glass - I saw the tip of his finger through, on the other side of the glass, inside the shop; I could see that through the glass. I am certain his finger was inside the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FROOM. Q. There was a wire outside the window - A. Yes, a safe-guard. They could put two fingers through the guard and draw goods out - there were goods small enough within reach.</p>

            . I am conductor of the patrol. I received information, and on going to the prosecutor's shop, I found the prisoners. I had seen Froom and Davis in company together ten minutes before the alarm in Cockspur-street, going towards the prosecutor's house. I found nothing upon Davis; but two duplicates, a dice, three marbles, and some playing cards on Maller. Williams<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150005"></xptr>searched Froom in my presence, and found a handkerchief and a piece of crooked wire in his hat.</p>

               <p>MALLER'S Defence. I left home at half-past two o'clock, and went into the City - I called in Clare-market, and had a pint of beer. I was to meet my brother between five and six o'clock, and being too soon I walked into Covent-garden, talked a few minutes with a lad who I met, and walked into Leicester-square and through the colonade, to pass away the time, and saw this gentleman cross the road, and catch hold of this boy, and just as I got to the end of the colonade, I heard a cry of Stop thief! saw the boy running, and endeavoured to stop him; a gentleman caught him - I went up to see what was the matter, and the gentleman collared me and said,</p>

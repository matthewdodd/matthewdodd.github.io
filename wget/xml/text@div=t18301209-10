I saw the prisoner in custody at the station-house, on the 18th of November, and went with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090011"></xptr>her from there to the lock-up room; she appeared very eager to disclose every thing - I did not tell her she had better confess, or that it would he worse if she did not; I told her what she stated to me would be in evidence against her, and the less she said to me would be the better - her mother overheard this, and advised her to confess; she told her mother something in my hearing - after locking up the prisoner, I saw her sister in the street, and she delivered me some keys; it was stated in my presence, at the office. that the prisoner lived at No. 5, Grove-lane, Deptford - I went, and in a new trunk there I found a red morocco case with seven sovereigns, a gilt chain, with a gold locket attached to it, six silver tea spoons, apparently new, a silver caddy-spoon and sugartongs, a pair of coral ear-rings, gold mounted, a gold ring, set with pearls, a silver watch, with two gold seals and a key, a piece of new printed cotton, some new silk, a pair of new gloves, a yard or two of linen, two or three yards of new calico, two gauze handkerchiefs, a piece of black stuff, a black lace veil, two small pieces of ribbon, and a pair of white cotton stockings - all these articles were new; there were other old articles in the box - I had no conversation with her about the things found, except that she said the sovereigns were part of the 20l. note - I did not say it would be better or worse for her to confess; she said this the next morning; I saw her put on the desk at the Police-station a purse with 13s. in it.</p>
               <p>MRS. MANN. The parlour is part of the dwelling-house- I swear this note is ours; I know it by the endorsement, and here are the intials T. M. at the back, which we always make on notes; the T.M. is my daughter's writing: Shaw's name is also on it, in her writing - I saw her write it when she received it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me, down in the parlour, that you did not know whether you put the note into the pocket-book or no, as there was a cheque with it? A. I did not - there was a cheque with it, which was left - that and the note were rolled up together, and put into the pocket-book and into the desk; I did not say I did not know whether I had put it into the pocketbook or the desk, or any such thing - I said, as there was a cheque with it, it could not drop out without the cheque dropping also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mistress said she did not know the number of the note. Witness. No, I do not; I said I should stop the note at the Bank, and should be sure to find the thief, and she said, "I hope you will."</p>
               <p>JANE MANN. This is the note my mother received from Mr. Shaw; I have written " Shaw, T. M. 30," on it, by which I know it - it is the note she put into the pocketbook and into the desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it out of any desk whatever.</p>

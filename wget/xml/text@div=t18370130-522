                  </hi>. I am a Roman Catholic Clergyman, and live in Finsbury-circus. On Saturday morning, the 21st of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I was returning home from Islington, where I had been to see a sick person—Short-street, Moorfields, is near my residence—just as I stepped from the curb-stone there, I received a blow behind, which brought me to the ground, and stunned me—when I recovered a little, I called "Watch," and a person came to me—I do not remember whether he lifted me from the ground—I was quite stupified by the blow—before I was knocked down I had a green silk purse with two or three sixpence in it—I had four or five shillings loose in my pocket, and there was a key in the purse—two keys in my pocket, and a penny—I do not know who gave me the blow—I do not know whether I was struck more than once, and that was from behind—I have no recollection of being knocked down by any body coming in front of me—I was so stupified by the first blow I do not recoiled any thing—I think it possible I might have risen from the ground, and been knocked down again by a person coming against me, without my knowing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman. On the Saturday morning heard the cry of "Watch," when I was in Moorfields and went towards Short-street—I saw the prisoner come towards me, and return to Mr. Woods, knock him down and run away—I should not think there was time for him to have taken any thing from Mr. Woods' pocket at that time—it was a momentary thing—I followed him till he was stopped by Marshall, who I told to secure him—I said nothing to him.</p>

               <p>in the morning I beard the cry of "Stop thief"—I immediately pro<lb></lb>proceeded from my beat in London-wall, towards Coleman-street, and saw the prisoner running—he pasted a watchman who tried to secure him—I immediately stopped into the middle of the road, held out my arms, and caught him—he dropped a shilling as I was taking him to the watch-house—I said, "Whose shilling is this?"—he said it was his.</p>

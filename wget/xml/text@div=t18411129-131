                  </hi>. On Saturday, the 1st of November, I employed the prisoner to remove my furniture—on the following Monday, I saw him again, and took him to a coffee-shop in Long Acre, to have refreshment—I gave the woman, who was servant there, a five-shilling piece—I was then taken very ill, and leaned on the table—I was not at all in liquor—I was taken with a swimming in my head—I could not hold up my head at all—in a short time after I felt the prisoner's hand in my right band waistcoat pocket—there was no one else sitting in the box with me—he was sitting on my right hand side—I caught hold of his wrist and asked what he was about—he said only holding my head up—I put my hand into my pocket, felt my money was quite safe, and thought it might be a mistake—I leaned my head on the table again, and some time after I raised my head up and found he was gone—I felt in my pocket and found my money was gone also—I had had two sovereigns, half-a-crown, a sixpence, and a few halfpence—I fell asleep part of the time while I had my head on the table—I had not felt his hand in my pocket after I found the money safe—I saw him the following night on Saffron-hill—I said he had robbed me—he said he was very sorry for it—I gave him in charge—he said he was very sorry he had robbed me, and offered me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said his father had the other sovereign—he begged of me to have mercy on him—I said I would not have more mercy on him than he had on me, he bad robbed me of my last shilling—I was ten minutes too late at the police-office next morning, and he was discharged for want of evidence—I had him taken again.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my mother in the coffee-shop in Long Acre. I remember the prisoner and prosecutor coming in—they had two Beef-steaks, two cups of coffee, and two loaves—I brought in the beef-steaks in about ten minutes, and the prosecutor gave me a five-shilling piece, and when I came in after going to the bar, I brought him in 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave it to the prisoner, because the prosecutor had his head on the table—the prisoner was eating one steak—I went to attend to some more gentlemen in the room—I came to the table again, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner whispering together—I thought he had awoke him up—I went on serving—the prisoner came and asked for a bottle of soda-water, which I let him have—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in ten minutes after I had to go and take another order—I said to the prisoner, "Had you not better rouse your friend, we don't allow sleeping here?"—he said, "No; he is in li<lb></lb>quor"—I said, "You had better rouse him, and take him out in the air"—he said, "Oh, no, let him sleep"—I went on serving, and in the mean-time the prisoner had gone, but the prosecutor was still there with his head down on the table.</p>

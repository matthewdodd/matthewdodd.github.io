            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 15th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening. I went out; it was quite dark then - I left the house quite safe, and locked the door. I left nobody at home. I returned about five minutes before eight o'clock, and found the street door wide open - I am quite certain I had locked it, for I tried it afterwards. I found somebody had entered the house - I got a light, and found the cupboard doors open. I went up stairs, and missed my bed, and a patchwork quilt. The drawers too were open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone, and a great many other things taken out. I have since seen a silk handkerchief, and a few pair of stockings. The value of the whole is from 25 l. to 30 l. (Looking at a handkerchief and some stockings, produced by Pace) here are three stockings I know by any own mark on them, and another pair by the old fashioned silk clocks, and another pair I know by the darning. The handkerchief was marked with white thread; it is picked out now; the appearance of it having been picked out is quite plain. The persons must have got into the house by a false key, for the lock was not injured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The handkerchief is not an uncommon pattern - A. No; I have often washed it. I know my own darning.</p>

            . I am an officer, I look the handkerchief off Wilford's neck, and found the stockings at his lodgings, about twelve o'clock on the 24th of April. I had apprehended them both at ten o'clock that night, at the Ship, public-house, in the Vauxhall-road. I had known where Wilford lived for two years - I have seen him and Nibbs together at a public-house in Duck-lane at times, for two or three months back - they were acquainted before the 15th of March. The door of Wilford's room was padlocked. Woodley who went with me, opened it with a key, which he took from Wilford; he is not here - he is a constable, and had them in custody when I went there. I had been at Wilford's lodgings before, and saw him there several times - a woman lived there with him, and nobody else. I found the room empty; I had seen a padlock on the door when I have been in the house before. On searching the room and bed, I found these stockings, and some of them were hanging over a chair in the room. I noticed the letter C on some of them, and brought them away. I found a large quantity of keys there; here are two skeleton keys and four filed keys. I found five files, two large, and three small - one of the files was on his work bench, with a screw driver. I have not tried any of the keys at Coultas's house. I found nothing particular on their persons except the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found them five or six weeks after Coultas was robbed - A. He was robbed on the 15th of March. A number of persons lodge in the same house as Wilford; there are girls of the town there; it is a common lodging house - he is a shoemaker, and had the lower rooms. The woman who lived with him has left him - the last time I saw her was at the bar of this Court, from which she was transported - I think it was the Sessions before last. I found the prisoners in custody together - I was not present when they were taken. I had not been to Wilford's rooms for twelve months before, but I have passed by, and seen him in the room, a week, or perhaps a fortnight before he was apprehended. I have seen another woman in the room with him since the one I spoke of was gone. I understand he lived with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Shoemakers use files in their business - A. They use very coarse ones. I do not think the three small ones are such as they use.</p>
               <p>MRS. COULTAS. The house was very dirty; but I cannot say whether there were footmarks of one or more persons.</p>
               <p>NIBB'S Defence. I have had the handkerchief for twelve months. She said at the office, that she did not mark it herself.</p>
               <p>MRS. COULTAS. We bought it with the mark on it.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Wilford a good character.</p>

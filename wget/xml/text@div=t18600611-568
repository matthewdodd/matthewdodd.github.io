                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart beer-shop, Blackheath—last Thursday evening, 7th June, the prisoners were there—there were other persons in the room; four civilians—the prisoners were wearing their belts—they appeared sober—four pots of fourpenny ale were called for—they drank it and gave some of it away—after they had been there about an hour, they had a cane-bottom seat which I thought they were going to break—that was about quarter or ten minutes to 10—I took it away for fear they should break it, and oue of them collared me and said, "You b----you shall not have it"—it was a seat to hold about three persons—I do not know whether it was either of the prisoners who collared me, but there were ten or eleven soldiers—when I say collared I mean seised by the throat—they all came round me—it was a soldier who caught me by the throat—Rogan jumped on the table and said something in Irish which I did not understand—they then all took off their belts and put them in their hands, muttered among themselves, and went outside the door, and one came back and broke a window—I shut up the shutters fearing there would be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and all came back and knocked at the door and the shutters, and one said, "Come on lads, let us have the b----out"—I did not go outside—that ia all I know of it—I believe it was McTaddon who broke the win<lb></lb>dow, but I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser at Blackheath—on Thurs<lb></lb>day evening last, about half-past 10, I heard a noise and went outside my door—I saw a number of soldiers making a furious noise and flourishing their belts about—I only saw two policemen—I crossed over and stood as a looker on, perhaps ten minutes, during which time the language and the noise was frightful—they then gradually, by the persuasion of one of their party who tried to get them away, worked their way up on to Blackheath—I followed them there and then returned—I saw King, Rogan, and McTaddon there—McTaddon struck me with a belt on the head—I had seven or eight cuts on the top of my head from one and the other, but from him principally—I saw belts used—they came down the hill some few minutes afterwards with a most furious yell—I saw the shop shutters being shut up—I saw nothing that occurred previous to closing the shutters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure you were hit on the head by McTaddon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the lamps were out—it was dark but we were close together—there was a great deal of pushing about—I had never seen him before—when I saw him again he was in custody; I knew him directly I saw him, and said, "That is the man who struck me"—King also struck me—I recognise those three, McTaddon, Rogan, and Connoway—I had a special constable's staff and struck some of them—I was called on by the police to interfere or I should not have done so—I only know by hearsay that they belong to the Donegal militia—they called out, "We will show them what the Donegal men can do"—I concluded that they were Irish by their brogue, but there was not time to think—from the time I first saw them going up the hill to the time they returned ten minutes did not elapse; it is not more than fifty yards to the top of the hill.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 98 <hi rend="italic">R</hi>). I was on duty in Blackheath village in plain clothes, last Thursday night—I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at 'the White Hart and saw the men come out and walk up and down the street—about a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110099"></xptr>
               <p>dozen militia-men—the first thing one of them did was "to break a window—I saw all the prisoners there—Rogan called to them to fall in, and they immediately fell in and marched down the street in a very furious manner, cal<lb></lb>ling out, "We will kill the b----English;" and striking at the shutters and everything that came near them—I collected some civilians together, and called upon them to assist me and prevent them doing further injury—Smith was one of them—we made a rush at them, overpowered them, and secured the first five, all except Houghay—I got struck several times with a belt on the face, head, and arm, but we managed to take these five to the station.</p>

The prisoner was three Years in my employ. In consequence of consulting Skillern, the officer, I put some tickets which he gave me among a heap of feathers in the warehouse, where the prisoner worked; about five o'clock in the evening of the 15th of January, I went out, leaving him there, and about six o'clock he was apprehended with a bundle of feathers - I had a good opinion of him - he earned about 18s. a week.</p>

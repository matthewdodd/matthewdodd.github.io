What time of day was it? - A.Five o'clock in the afternoon; he walked deliberately out of the shop; my servant was coming in as he went out; he crossed the street; I ran after him, and stopped him about twenty yards from my own door. A great many neighbours came to my assistance, and not being able to get a constable, we took him to St. Giles's watch-house; he was then taken to Marlborough-street, and committed; he used me extremely ill in the street; he threatened my life several times if I did not let him go.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable(produces the candlestick); I took the prisoner from the watch-house to Marlborough-street; it was rather dusk; after we had got a little way from the watch-house, I perceived this plane in his hand; I thought it adviseable to take it from him; while I was thinking how to get it from him, he swore bitterly, struck me violently with the plane, and stunned me; the blows were visible five days after; the plane dropped; I recovered myself, called stop thief! and ran after him (he had run away), a man stopped him; I came up almost im<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250031"></xptr>mediately, and, with the assistance of the mob, took him to Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I belong to Portland Barracks; I was so much in liquor, I don't recollect any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hemmings.) Did he appear to be in liquor? - A. By no means.</p>

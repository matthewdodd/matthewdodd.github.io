                  </hi> I was in Lower Grosvenor-place about eleven o'clock at night on Sunday, the 3rd of Aug.—I saw the prisoner Smith—I think I addressed her, but I will not be sure—there was some conversation about the time of night, and in the course of that conversation I looked at my watch—it was a gold watch, and fastened round my neck with a string—I looked at it, and told her the time—we were then passing along Grosvenor-street, away from Ranelagh-street—I was induced by what Smith said to go back to Ranelagh-street, and went down Ranelagh-mews—I had not been there a moment when she wished to induce me to turn down a dark place, which I did—she held me by the coat, and wished me to proceed a little further—she then coughed twice, and that was followed by Edwards rushing down upon me—he held me by the arms, and said, "What are you ill-using the female for? what are you doing to her?" or words to that effect—I thought Smith had hold of my coat at that time—I struggled as violently as I could, and succeeded in extricating myself as soon as I could, but I had called "Police" two or three times—I walked three or four feet—passage from the mews leads to the back of some small houses in Ranelagh-street—Edwards went up the passage, but I saw him again instantly almost—I missed my watch the moment that the police<lb></lb>man approached me—I had scarcely recovered from the fright I was pat in when I saw the ring of my watch hanging to my guard—I said, "They have taken my watch"—it had been wrenched from the ring—I gave in<lb></lb>formation to the policeman, and the prisoners, who had not gone more than a yard, were both taken—I know the houses Nos. 22 and 24 in Ra-nelagh-street—the backs of those houses come against the passage where I</p>

I was in Ranelagh-street that night at the entrance of this mews—I did not see the prosecutor and Smith turn down the mews, but I heard the cough—I turned down the mews, and Edwards ran down before me as the cough was given—the moment Edwards went down the prosecutor turned out, and called, "Police"—he said he was robbed, and held up his guard, and showed it me—at that time Edwards might have turned down the dark passage, but I did not see it—I observed him running up the mews, and he was out of my sight for a moment or two—when the prosecutor made known his loss I turned down the court, and took both the prisoners there—the back of the houses in Ranelagh-street come to this court—Edwards could have thrown the watch to the back of those houses.</p>

I know the turning out of Ranelagh-mews to the left—it goes to the back of our house—on the morning of Monday, the 4th of Aug., about half-past seven o'clock, I found a watch on the window cill of the next house to ours, which window comes into our yard—it was a yellow watch—whether it was gold or copper I could not tell—there were two cases to it—it was broken—there was no face to it, and no glass—it appeared to have been smashed down—it must have been thrown to the window—I picked it up, and took it down into the kitchen to the landlady, and after some conversation with her I put it back again—I have never seen it since—I thought there was the figure 11 on it.</p>

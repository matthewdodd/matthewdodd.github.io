I went away for about an hour and a half or two hours, then returned, and he told me what had been bid for them. I did not tell Mr. Vorley that the prisoner was waiting. Mr. Vorley sold them about two o'clock, and I waited there till then, then went and asked him if he would settle for them? He said he was not going to the office just then, but he was going soon, and he would settle for them. He said in about ten minutes that he could not pay the money unless I brought somebody to vouch for them -

               <p>COURT. Q. You must have known he could not be honestly possessed of the beast - A. I did not know it.

Vorley looked at the letter, spoke to the clerk, and after some little time told him to pay me the money. He gave me a 20 l., a 5 l., and a 1 l. note, and 8 s. in silver; we came out, and Richard joined us at the door; we went to the Bank, and they waited outside while I went in and changed the 20 l. note; I could not write, and got a gentleman to write</p>

            . I recollect his being called up about four o'clock on the Monday morning, about a fortnight before he was taken up. He went down, I did not hear the persons speak to him; there was something like dirt flung at the window, he got up and went out, and returned about five or six o'clock in the evening. I cannot say who called him up. He went out next day, about six o'clock in the morning, and took his basket to get champignons. He generally went down the Hounslow road for them. He did not come home before the evening; nobody returned with him. I did not see any of my brothers that evening.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you expect him home before he returned - A. I expected him about two o'clock with the champignons, as he used to do.</p>

            . I am in the Pay-Clerks' Office in the Bank. I produce a 20 l. note, No. 12833, dated 8th October, 1819; I got it from Mr. Wragg. I can positively say Clements is the man who brought it, from a circumstance that transpired. Wragg asked him what profession he was? he gave his name as Taylor, of Cranford, and said he was a labourer.</p>
               <p>"T. Taylor, Cranford," was written on it, and Wragg wrote</p>
               <p>"labourer." I paid him twenty 1 l. notes for it. The following notes were among those I paid him:-Nos. 52943 and 52944, dated 4th November; 73157, 8th November; 45051 and 12284, October 23; 40877, October 25; 76018 and 25462, October 27; 76235, October 28; 15073 and 32640, October 30, 1819; also Nos. 37736, September 29; 70115, November 4; 61895, November 2, and 33118, October 18.

            . I apprehended Richard at Staines, on the 17th of December, standing at his own door, near the market-place. I told him there was a 1 l. note paid into the Bank, which had come through his hands to his father, and it was forged. I shewed him a note, but not that I was speaking of. He said he had not seen his father for four or five weeks; that he had given his father a note, but that he received it from the Bank of England, in change for a 5 l. or a 10 l. note, he did not know which. I said if he had so received it, he had better meet me with his father and explain it. I went with him to his father. In going along he said he had some more notes in his pocket, which he had received at the same time. I asked him to shew them to me, to see if the numbers corresponded. I then saw he had six 1 l. notes. Just as we got into Staines, I asked him about the note he got change for, he said it was a 5 l.; that he had been to London as guard to Creswell's waggon on the Monday, returned on Tuesday night, and changed a 5 l. note for Mr. Creswell; that he received 1 l. out of it, which 1 l. he gave to his father. I told him it must have been more than a 5 l. note, for I saw six in his hand. He immediately put his hand into his pocket and said,</p>
               <p>"No, you are mistaken, there are but four" - he shewed me four. I said,</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I am mistaken." I got him into a house, searched him, and took four from him, which I produce. Here are Nos. 76235, October 28; 25462, October 27; 52943 and 52944, November 4, 1819. I did not then find that he had two others.</p>
               <p>Q. After that what happened - A. I left him custody, and in the course of the evening he denied having any more notes about him; I again searched him, and found a 1 l. note loose in his side coat pocket, at the bottom, as a piece of waste paper - it was No. 12284, October 23, 1819. Next morning I saw him, and asked if he was in the same mind? he said, No, he would tell the whole truth. I neither threatened nor promised him. He then said he was coming to London on a Tuesday, to the Board of St. George's, Hanover-square, to receive an allowance which he had from that parish; that he met his brother William, and told him he had no money; that his brother said,</p>
               <p>"I am going into the City to receive some money, and if you will wait till I return I will give you some." That he waited about Hyde Park Corner till his brother returned, and he gave him ten new 1 l. notes. I told him he must have known how they were got, for he knew his brother was receiving alms from the parish. He said he did not know, nor did he ask him. I then asked who was with him? he said nobody was with him for sometime. I said it was of no use to tell me so, for I knew there was another with him. He then said there was; that

            'S Defence. I was going to London to my parish, and met my brother with three beast before him; he asked me if I was going to London? I said Yes. He told me to take them to Clements, and he would take them to Smithfield and sell them. I took them to him, and called him up in the morning; he overtook me on the road, and took them into the market. When we came back he told me to tell my brother to come up next day, which I did. He called me up next morning - I had to go to my parish again, and went to town with him, but he never mentioned where he got the cattle from. As we came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120048"></xptr>back he gave me these ten notes. I owed my father some money, which I had of him in the summer, and gave him one of the notes. I know nothing of the cattle.</p>

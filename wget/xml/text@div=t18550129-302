                  </hi>. I am a cornchandler, and reside at No. 2, Windsor-place, Old Kent-road. The prisoner was in my service as carman—he had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on Thursday, 7th Dec., he was sent to Mrs. Cun<lb></lb>ningham's, in the Old Kent-road, to remove some goods—I did not see him again until the next morning, at 20 minutes to 1 o'clock, when he came home—he said he had made 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the job; that they were a mean shabby lot, they had not given him any beer, or anything to drink—he gave me a half sovereign, and I gave him the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and also another shilling for himself, because he was out so late at night—he did not tell me in what coin he had been paid, he simply gave me the half sovereign, and I gave him the shilling out—on the Friday evening I saw Mr. Drapper, senior, who made some communication to me—in consequence of that, at the close of business, as the prisoner was going to leave, I called him into my private parlour on</p>

On Thursday, 7th Dec, I employed Mr. Smith to remove some things for me—the prisoner came with a van to do the job—when he had finished the job he came to me, and said, "Your good gentleman says that you will settle with me"—I said, "What have I to pay?"—he said, "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—I gave him half a sovereign and two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—I said to him, "Did you have any beer?"—he said no, he had not had any—I then told him to give me one of the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces back, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said, "That is 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for yourself"—I had not told him where I was going; it was not quite decided; we did think of going to America, but we went to Scotland—the prisoner might have heard it talked about that we were going to a distance, but I cannot say that he did—Mr. Drapper was present when I paid him the money—I was afterwards present at the Southwark County Court when this cause came on to be tried before Mr. Clive—I saw the prisoner sworn, and heard him examined—he stated that he had received half a sovereign from me, and that he had given me three 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces in change—after he had said that, I was examined—the prisoner was then recalled by Mr. Clive—he was cautioned; Mr. Clive told him to be careful what he said, or he might commit him to the Old Bailey—after t hat he stated that he had received half a sovereign and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from me, and had given me back three <hi rend="italic">id.</hi> pieces—I was examined in his presence, and</p>

I was present on the evening of 7th Dec., when Mrs. Cunningham asked the prisoner what she had to pay for the job—he said, "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—she gave him half a sove<lb></lb>reign and two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—she then asked if he had had anything to drink; be said he had not, and Mrs. Cunningham gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asked him to return her a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for himself—I had been in the house ever since 11 o'clock; I was there when he came, but I had not seen him before—I was present at the trial before Mr. Clive—I do not know exactly the words the prisoner said in the first instance, I did not hear it—I heard him recalled; I do not exactly recollect whether I was called before the prisoner was examined—when he was recalled, Mr. Clive told him to be careful, or else he would have to be sent to the Old Bailey—he then stated that he had received 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mrs. Cunningham; he said he had received a half sovereign and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and had returned her three 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces.</p>

               <p>recalled the prisoner—it is necessary to give notice of a set-off—there was no notice of set-off in this case, it went off on a different ground—the defence was, that he had discharged the then plaintiff at a moment's notice, on the ground of dishonesty, and that that exempted him from paying wages altogether—the point is this, the prisoner was a weekly servant, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week; for that stipend he was faithfully and honestly to serve his employer; he breaks faith in that contract, and having broken faith in that contract, he was not entitled to that sum for doing that which he had contracted to do—Mr. Smith, in effect, set that up as his defence, that he had never earned his wages, because before the time came he had discharged him, for a good reason.</p>

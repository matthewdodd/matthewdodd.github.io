            . Some time before the prisoners were apprehended, I missed the whole of the plate I had in the house - it was about March last; there were fifteen silver spoons among others, a number of gold trinkets, gold rings, brooches, and other things. I then had apartments at the warehouse in Vere-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Who lived in the house - A. One of my men - neither of the prisoners. Green came there occasionally, as a private servant, for which he was paid extra. I had the first and second floors in the house where the feathers were kept - the plate was in the front room, second floor. I had locked up the rooms, and was in the country for five months; I left in August and returned in February. They informed me my door had been found open; I had left the room in care of a servant who is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Green was often employed by you - A. Yes. he did go to the room when he pleased, and after the door was opened, any of the servants could get to it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor and apprehended Green; I told him I had a warrant against him for felony; he instantly said he knew nothing about the feathers. I asked if he knew any thing that took place at his master's house at Christmas last; he said,</p>
               <p>"You mean the plate." I had not mentioned a word about plate. I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do mean the plate." He said the plate was taken to Mr. Brown's, and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110130"></xptr>melted down, and afterwards it was taken to Potter's, next door to the prosecutor's, and sold him - that he went over to the Red-lion, and received 10 s. as his share.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say if he would give information, he should be admitted as a witness - A. No; he was apprehended on the 19th of July.</p>
               <p>MR. GARDNER. When I missed the property, I desired the foreman to keep his eye on the workmen. I understand the prisoners worked in the room after the door was found open.</p>

            . I am a timber-merchant. I was present at the examination of the prisoners. I went particularly to attend to this case, at the prosecutor's request; I recollect the prisoners saying something, the clerk did not take it down; what they said was voluntarily. Immediately as Green was put to the bar, without being spoken to, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have robbed my master. I won't tell a lie about it;" the Magistrate said,</p>
               <p>"Man, don't convict yourself;" but he replied again, that he had robbed his master. Murrell said he was working in the feather-room, up two pair of stairs shortly before Christmas, and that Banner came to him and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got some plate here, and his answer was,</p>
               <p>"Bill, put it aside for the present;" and that about a week after he found the plate at Green's house; he addressed himself to Banner and said,</p>
               <p>"Was it not so;" Banner said,</p>
               <p>"Tell your story." Murrell said, He took it from Green's to Brown's in Wild-street, and then to Potters.</p>
               <p>MURREL'S Defence. I am a plasterer by trade, and have worked at it forty years. I had a few spoons of my own, besides old silver. I was short of money, and went to Brown's and asked him to melt it.</p>

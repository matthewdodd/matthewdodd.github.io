               <p>I am a clerk at the Bank. About five or six weeks ago a person came to me, gave me a Bank note, and said he came from the office in Bow-street, and only wanted to know if it was a good note. I went and showed it to the second cashier, the first was not there; he said it was a good one. The man said he did not want the money, but that there were two girls in custody on suspicion of stealing it. That officer came afterwards, and had the money, his name is Godfrey. I have the note (producing it).</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to the Rotation-office. On the 24th of February, I was at the publick-house; the two prisoners came and told me they had found a piece of paper which they had delivered into the hands of Mr. Forster, a publican, in Cockspur-street, to read; that a man who stood by the fire, said it was a good Bank note, and bid them not take less than the value for it; that the landlord offered them five pounds for it, and then eight pounds, but they would not take it; and they asked me to go with them to the landlord. I went and bid him bring the note to the office, he did, and it was delivered to me; I kept it a fortnight and advertised it, but nobody came to own it. The magistrates then asked me what I had done with it; I said nobody had owned it; they said I might go and get the money for it, and give it to the girls; I went and got the money, but before I delivered it, I advertised it twice more, and then the prosecutor's brother came and owned it.</p>

Nichols had the note; she offered it me for eight pounds. I asked her where she got it; she said a gentleman gave it her going down the Haymarket. Somebody present said it was either a bad note or a stolen one, upon which she demanded the note, and said she would put it in the fire before my face; I said I would not give it her till I had shown it to some proper person; she came again with Godfrey and took it to the Rotation-office.</p>

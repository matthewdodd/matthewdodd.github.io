                  </hi>. I live at 7, King-street, Drury-lane; I work at a plate warehouse in Castle-street. In Nov. I went to Mr. Adlard's shop for a pair of trowsers—I saw the prisoner, and told him I wanted something cheap, old stock, or soiled, or something of that kind—he gave me five or six pairs, and I selected this pair at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him I was not in a position to pay then,</p>

               <p>and asked him if it made any difference—he said, "Not at all for a short time, to oblige you"—shortly after Christmas I paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not paid any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of Holborn.

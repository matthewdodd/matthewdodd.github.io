                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at Kensington. About two o'clock in the morning of the 14th of Feb. I and my shopmate were in a private house belonging to Simpson—the prisoner and another woman came in—the man belonging to the room ordered them out—the prisoner went down first, and the other stopped to talk a bit—my mate went down, and I went down—the prisoner was stopping on the stairs, and pulled me about—I got away from her as soon as I could—when I got into the street I missed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. frorn my waistcoat-pocket, where I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when I went into the room—I had only two sixpences left—I had been to a meeting for the benefit of one of our workmen, who had met with an accident—I charged the prisoner with robbing me as soon as she came out—she denjed it, and said she had not any money—I took hold of her, and kept her till I saw an officer—I had seen money safe in the room—the prisoner was the only one who touched me.</p>

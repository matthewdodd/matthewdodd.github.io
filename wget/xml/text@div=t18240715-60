On the 22d of October, 1822, the prisoner came to my house with a picture; he asked for my brother, who had some knowledge of him, he left the picture to be framed and glazed, and went away, and called again every day till the 1st of November, and on the following day he called, and took out a letter, which he said he had received from Squire Clark, stating that his father was dead, and he had a great deal of property left him, he said there were a number of things in my shop which he should purchase, he came next day and looked out a vast number of things which were put aside for him; he called again next day, and looked out in all 100 l. worth; he said that one Mills, whom he lodged with had 22 l. of his, but it was not convenient for him to settle it, but he would accept a bill. On the 1st of November, he called and took away 14 l. worth of goods, and produced a bill on Mills. I asked if it was Mills's acceptance he said it was, he then endorsed in it my presence - he called a porter who took the goods away with him - my brother was present when he gave me the bill, it has not been paid. I did not see the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cook. When did you first see him - A. On the 26th of October; my brother lodged with me, but had been absent just then, he had been in the House of Correction for twelve months, as a bill had been filed against him, by a man who wanted to extort money. Bliss was there with him - he had a bill with the goods. I did not give him the change of the bill as he had looked out more goods. There is a man named Mills, employed as a carver and gilder in my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he gave you the bill he had looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150023"></xptr>out other goods - A. Yes, my Lord, to the amount of 100 l., and said he would write to me when he got home about sending them.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix brother, and have lived at her house eight or nine years. I have known the prisoner nearly three years. On the 25th or 26th of October, 1822, he came and requested me to get a handsome gilt frame to a picture; he called day after day, and said there were several things in the shop he should like to purchase, and produced two letters, one from Mr. Clark, and the other from Mr. Goodman, stating that his father was dead, and that he was coming into possession of a very large fortune, and wished to buy several things to take down to Daventry, for his father had lately fitted up a new room, and he should handsomely furnish it. He said Mr. Mills had drawn 50 l. from his grandfather, who was also dead, that Mr. Mills had been to Daventry, to receive a legacy of 50 l., and he had given him a warrant of attorney to receive it, and there was a balance of 22 l. due to him - that Mills had applied the money to his own use, and given him a bill at a month's date; he produced the bill unaccepted, and next day called with the acceptance to it, and said it was accepted in the presence of Mr. Bishop. He endorsed it in my presence and gave it to my sister - he then looked out a quantity of goods, and ordered me to pack them up and bring them down to Daventry myself, and I should be paid the balance. He said he had stopped too long in town, and should like to take a few of the light goods with him to satisfy his assignees, to make things pleasant as they would think he had stopped too long in town. He looked out a set of china, some jars, a caddy and other things amounting to 14 or 15 l., and told me to send them to the coach office, to go to Steventry near Daventry. Northamptonshire, for

            . He took the caddy and some plated goods away in a handkerchief, I got a porter to carry the rest with him, the porter returned without the goods. He had called at half-past five o'clock in the morning, after he had paid the bill, it was then that he took the goods away. I inquired at the coach office, and my suspicion being raised, I went to Mills. I did not see him again till this day fortnight, when I took him in Oxford Street, I went twice to Daventry after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was true he had some property - A. I know that Mills had received a legacy of 50 l. from the grandfather. I purchase goods on commission, my sister keeps this shop, the goods are her's, I have been in the House of Correction suffering for two villains who were afterwards indicted. I never gave him the copy of a bill to draw or had any conversation with him about a bill, nor ever got any one to draw the copy of one. I never told him I could put him in a way of making money. I knew there was a Mr. Mills, who had received a legacy for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any offer about destroying the bill it any money was paid to you - A. Mills said he would not have the man hung for 100 l. I said my sister only wanted the bill paid. I said nothing about burning it.</p>
               <p>The bill was here produced, but nobody being present to prove it forged, except Mills who was an interested person the prisoner was</p>

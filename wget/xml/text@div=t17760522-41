               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Petty-France; the prisoner at the bar and one Scandal, who stands here, came to my shop on Monday the 22d of April, about seven in the morning; Scandal produced the watch, but the prisoner said the watch was his property; I opened the watch, and asked a good many questions about it; I found it was not his own, for he said he did not know whether it was gold or no; I had received an information of a watch being lost; I stepped with the watch to Mrs. Mitchel, she owned the watch; when I came back again, these two men were standing in the street; they were taken up and carried before a magistrate. Scandal asked if I would lend a guinea upon it, for that the prisoner had pledged it before, and had taken it out and brought it, but they did not know what was the value of it.</p>

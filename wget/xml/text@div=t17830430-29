               <p>Why what had the young one to do in your house? - On the 29th of March, they came to lodge with me.</p>
               <p>I thought you said only Hancock? - Hancock took the lodgings, and when he came to go to bed, my wife gave him the candle, he said, James go up stairs with me a little bit, he said he should want a fire, and my wife carried up a tub of coals, and he asked her to let the young one lay with him, my wife said, she did not care for one night, he lay there all the next day, and Hancock lay in bed all the next day as we was told; the next day it was repeated in the same manner, on the 1st of April, the young one came down and told my wife; mistress, your sacking of your bed is broke,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300056"></xptr> I want to mend it, says he, I am a handy little fellow at these jobs, and will do it myself, I went up stairs to work in the garret, being a shoe-maker, on the 2d of April I was in the lower apartment winding some flax, which is a wheel that makes a noise, and my wife was gone out to Butcher-row, for some cheese for our supper, she returned in about five minutes, says she, has the young men been in for a light? - says she, I saw them a talking together, and presently upon hearing a bustle, I went up one pair of stairs, and saw nobody, a thought struck in my head, I went up higher, and saw Hancock unlocking the door of his own room.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was this? - about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you go with a light? - Yes, as soon as Hancock had unlocked the door, he slipped in his candle and asked me for a light, I lighted his candle, and being taller than him, I looked over his head, and missed my looking glass which stood directly opposite the door, I said to him, what have you took the looking glass down, no, says he, says I, I insist upon seeing what else is down, and I rushed in upon him, and took the key out of the outside of the door, and locked it withinside, says I, I will keep you for my property; when I got in, I missed my sheets, pillow cases, kettle, counterpane, and looking glass, and they were all in the room that I left him; he walked about the room, he said it is very high says he, you must ask the other, I know nothing about them, I was not at home all night; says I, where is the other? says he, I have not seen him; I unlocked the door, and called my wife to fetch a constable; the constable began to ask him about the things, he knew nothing at all about them he said, you must ask the other; he believed I had lost them he said, and he was willing to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's question to Hancock. Did not I call to you for a light before I went into my room? - No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. WALE sworn.</p>
               <p>ent for some cheese in the evening on the 2d of April, about eight, and a few doors from my own, I saw the prisoners whispering together as I passed them, the one that took the room of me, said to the other, now let us go; with that I had some suspicion, and I looked to see if they went into my passage or not, and I saw them both go in to my house, my husband was at work, I asked him if the young men had been in for a light, and I had not been in many minutes, before Hancock came in, he said, so mistress, here is a stranger; I stared at him, stranger said I; yes, says he, you know I did not lay at home last night; yes, says I, so the boy told me, so I made a kind of a smile, and he coloured like any thing; says I, Sir, when would you chuse I should make your bed; says he, the boy told me he made it in the morning; a good evening to you madam, says he, I shall be in, in half an hour, then there was a bustle, and my husband did not get up from work, until I spoke quite sharp twice, and a few minutes after I heard another bustle; my husband went up and caught the prisoner as he told you: I saw the little one and another man on the stairs, I called to the man who lives in the one pair of stairs, he came down and collared him, and brought him down in the passage, the other man that he had brought I suppose wanted to take the bed away, I asked him what he had done with the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the whole furniture was not there when I left the lodgings? - I cannot tell, he never would let me have the key.</p>
               <p>Whether I did not call for a light, when I entered the room the second time? - No, my Lord, he did not seem to want to know any body.</p>
               <p>Did he ask for a light? - He did not let any body see him.</p>
               <p>Did he ask for a light? - No, no.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HANCOCK's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When they came up stairs, I called to this man for a light, I found my door unlocked, my windows open, and my curtains drawn, here is a man that has known me this dozen years, I have been in his Majesty's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300057"></xptr> service five years: he will give a character of me, Mr. Burn; I came up from Portsmouth on Saturday, and arrived in town, and took this lodging about four in the evening: I know nothing of the things.</p>
               <p>PRISONER GREENWOOD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming up stairs to bed, I thought this man was in bed, and the woman turned the key: The inhabitants of London make a property of seafaring people now, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Hancock called one witness, and the Prisoner Greenwood called three witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

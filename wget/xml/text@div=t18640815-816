I live in Case-street, Millwall, and work at a forge—a little after 4 on the morning of 14th August I was aroused by a party who lived in the house—I found the window in the front parlour broken—it was all right when I went to bed—I missed a pair of trousers which had been on the arm of the sofa—they could have been taken from the window—the sofa was only a yard and a half from it—I went out with two others—my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> went up the road to look for a policeman—I saw the prisoner about ten minutes afterwards—we caught him about 400 yards from the house—we overhauled his bundle, saw he had not got the trousers, and gave it him back—we asked him if he had a pair of trousers—he said, "No," and we let him go—I saw him again about a quarter of an hour after—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the trousers.</p>

I received some information on the morning of 14th August, and met the prisoner carrying a bundle—I said, "What have you got in here"—he said, "I have got two dead fowls, which I bought of a man at Black wall"—I took him back a short distance and met another constable—I noticed that the prisoner looked bulky—I searched him, and in his trousers I found a dead rabbit, and these trousers, which he had got rolled round his waist—I examined the window at the prosecutor's house, and saw a square of glass broken.</p>

I was so drunk that they led me towards Cubitt's-town. I got into the wrong road, and got into a ditch. I afterwards got out and laid down and went to sleep. Sometime after a man reached me, and asked me if I had any money in my pocket; I said, "Yes, a little;" he asked me if I would buy the things he had, a rabbit, two fowls, and a pair of trousers, and being quite intoxicated I gave him two shillings and half-a-crown. I did not know what I was about on account of the drink."</p>

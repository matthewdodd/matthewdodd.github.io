               <p>Q. Did you miss both the caddys - A. Yes, they were on the dresser when I left the house, I am sure of it, the other caddy was full of bills, receipts, and papers.</p>
               <p>Q. What might they be worth - A. I will say six shillings for all together; I would not wish to value too much. The officer has them, I have seen them in the hands of the officer. I did not see the prisoner take them; I am sure I latched the door I tried the latch, and I am sure it catched, it is a common latch.</p>

            . I am an officer; on Friday the 9th of December, I was in White-cross street, looking about there, I am generally there of an evening about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner with these things under his arm, he was in company with a tall man, I asked him how he came by the property; he told me he took them from his father, his father lived at Islington, he was going to take them to a brother of his in Crown Street Soho; he would not tell me any more. I then said to him, if he was going to Crown street Soho, he was in the wrong direction, he was making for lower White-cross street, and within a few doors of it, that lies south of the place, and Soho lies westward; I then took him to Hatton garden office; I took the caddys and him into my custody, I asked him who was along with him, he said, he did not know the name of the tall young man, he did not belong to him; I then took him to the office, he told the same story nearly to the magistrate; the magistrate asked me if I had any thing else against him. I could not say although I suspected him. The magistrate said, if he would bring his father the next day he would liberate him. He was ordered to bring his father, the next day the father came, but nobody came forward to own the things, a carpenter came into the public house and said he was going to put up some iron bars to a house that had been robbed; I took the prisoner to the Shears public house, the parties came forward and swore to the articles, he was committed for trial, These are the caddys, I took from the prisoner. The prisoner had just been discharged from the New Prison when I took him; I never had him in custody before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix This tea-caddy is my husbands property, I know both the caddys, this is the key of one of the caddys, I lost the key of the other caddy some years ago, I have brought the key of one of the caddys, I had it up stairs in my bed room. I have brought the key with me now, it will lock, and unlock it both. The caddys were unlocked.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Goswell-street. I have carried on business there thirty years—the prisoner was in my service—he has been so full a twelve month—he left me for a period of two months, and returned to me—before he came to me he lived with Mr. Sowerby, a pawn-broker of Chiswell-street—he was acting as my foreman in Oct. last—I left town on 15th Oct., and left the prisoner in charge of my property and busi<lb></lb>ness—I returned in the evening of 26th Oct.—a person named Finch was in my employment—in consequence of something I discovered with respect to the accounts, I looked about me to see how things had been going on in my absence—on 28th Oct. I found some duplicates on the counter—they related to books that had been in pledge, and were out of time—the books are here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are a portion of them—there were several parcels, some containing twelve or fourteen, but they had been all mixed together—when I left town those books were upstairs in the warehouse, packed in parcels; when I returned they had been opened—I found five books deficient—one of the duplicates was for a Bible, and a case of drawing instruments—I inquired for that Bible, and searched for it—I did not find it—the duplicates were my own, used in my own business—duplicates are generally affixed to the bundles in which the things they relate to are contained—I was told that some volumes of the "History of William IV." were missing—I do not know it of my own knowledge, I only learned it by inquiry—on comparing the duplicates with the bundles, I found out that five books were deficient—we do not particularize the articles in the duplicates, except in this case the Bible was named—we say "two, three, or six books;" or "one book"—I came to town on the 26th, and on the 29th I spoke to the prisoner about this—I called his attention to this parcel of duplicates—I do not think I showed them to him; I said, "There are some books missing, and here are a lot of duplicates, and I understand there was a Bible and a "Life of William IV.;" I don't see them"—he immediately went and brought a small Bible, and opened it, and found a mark in it which showed that it was not the one, and he said, "Oh! that is not it;" but he said, "I know nothing about them"—I said, "Here are also some numbers, parts of a Bible, that ought to be here; I don't see them"—I cannoti recollect that he made any reply to that—I then gave him into Inspector Brannan's custody—I afterwards went with Bran<lb></lb>nan to the prisoner's lodging—my young man then pointed out some books—the prisoner was not present—they were the books which I had mentioned to the prisoner, and which he said he knew nothing about—they were a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220017"></xptr>
               <p>Bible, two volumes of the "Life of William IV.," and the "Tourist in Italy, by Roscoe," which had a mark on it, I believe in my own handwriting—I believe that was one of the books forming a part of these—he had no right or autho<lb></lb>rity to take those books to his lodging—I remember examining my cashbox on the 29th; Finch stood by the side of me, it was a few minutes before dinner, we dine about half-past 1 o'clock; there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it in gold—I am sure there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner had gone out at that time—that was after I had spoken to him about the things—he came in while we were at dinner—he dines with myself and family—he came in I suppose, a little before 2—he came and sat down at dinner—Finch dines after him—after the prisoner had bad his dinner, he went out—I did not see him go out—I did not afterwards examine my cashbox, but I was told there was no cash in it—I believe Brannan came to the house between 2 and 3—the prisoner came in while Brannan was there—I went down immediately I heard he had come in, and told him I wanted to speak with him upstairs—I then stated generally, the circumstances of the accounts—I then said to him, "About this gold watch; you ought not to have taken it"—I had asked him about that gold watch in the morning, having found it had not been delivered—I said, "How is it about that gold watch, that you have not given it?"—he said, "Oh! I have taken it home to try, and I have left it at home"—I said, "Well, bring it tomorrow, you should not have taken it home, there was no need"—in the afternoon I said to him, "You had no right to take that watch"—he replied, pulling it out of his pocket, "Oh I here it is"—he said he had been home for it—I then said, "There are these books, and the numbers?"—he said, "Oh! I suppose I must pay for the Bibles; some of them were in numbers"—I made no remark—I have since seen the watch—I have also seen another watch; they are both mine—before I left home, I left a gold lever watch in' the window—I did not miss it till about ten days after the prisoner had been in custody—that was the watch that Brannan took from the prisoner on searching him—I saw it taken from him, it had an Albert chain with it—there were two watches taken from him—one he produced, and one Brannan took from him—I had no suspicion that the watch he was wearing was my own—I have since examined it and find it is mine, I have no doubt at all about it—that is the watch with the Albert chain; the second watch was found on bim immediately on his being taken into custody, but I did not examine it then—Brannan has since produced it to me, and I identified it—the desks I had never seen.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Peachey, and was so during his absence from town from 15th to 25th Oct I saw these duplicates on the counter—they relate to things out of time—they were lying on the counter for about two days—here are five duplicates, one is for forty-nine numbers of books, two for two writing desks, one for a book and case of instruments, and</p>

I saw the prisoner come home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about half past 5 o'clock—Mr. Peachey called him into a private room where I was—Mr. Peachey asked him to render an account of the deficiencies in his goods—the prisoner said, "If you don't like me, Mr. Sowerby will take me"—Mr. Peachey then said, "About the gold watch belonging to one of the customers?"—"Oh!" he said, "here it is,"pulling it out from his waistcoat pocket and placing it on the table—he afterwards said, "I have been home to get it"—Mr. Peachey then said, "There are some books and numbers of Bibles missing"—he said, "Oh, yes! I took them; I left them to be bound; I suppose I must pay you for them"—Mr. Peachey said, "But you took them without my autho<lb></lb>rity"—he said, "I will pay you for the numbers; they are at a little sta<lb></lb>tioner's shop, in Old-street, to be bound"—Mr. Peachey said, "Am I not going to have any further explanation about the deficiencies?"—the prisoner said, "Mr. Peachey, if you don't like me, Mr. Sowerby will take me; he gave me that ring," alluding to one he had on his finger, which J now pro<lb></lb>duce—Mr. Peachey then left the room to go for some books, and while he was absent the prisoner said to me, "Do you think they will find me guilty?"—I said, "I really don't know"—I then took possession of the watch which he placed on the table, which I produce—I then took him to the station and searched him—I found on him the watch with the Albert chain and the ring—the watch is gold—he said, "Is it necessary to take that from me, as it is mine?"—I said, "I must take all"—I found on him a duplicate of a watch pledged that same day at Mr. Vaughan's, in Oxford-street, which I also produce—I afterwards went with Mr. Peachey and his young man to the address given by the prisoner in Duke-street, Oxford-street—I found the name of Whitaker on the door, as he told me I should—in the one pair back room in that house I found four printed books, which I now produce, namely, a Bible, two volumes of "William IV.," and "The Tourist in Italy," also two desks and two vases—I saw other property there which I did not then take possession of, but I did afterwards—on the evening of 3rd Nov. I accom<lb></lb>panied Mr. Peachey again to the prisoner's lodging—I took a tea poy, a tea tray, and two scent bottles—from information I received there, I pro<lb></lb>ceeded to 71, Murray-street, Hoxton, where I took possession of two dressing cases, which I also produce; I got them from a person named Billings there—on the morning of 30th Oct., while going to the police-court, the prisoner asked me whether I had seen Mrs. Whitaker that morning—I said, "No; but I saw her last night"—he said, "Then you have been at my place?"—I said, "Yes"—"Splendidly furnished, is it not?" he said—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Did you see the tea poy?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I bought that and a dressing case for Mrs. Whitaker, and one for myself, within this</p>

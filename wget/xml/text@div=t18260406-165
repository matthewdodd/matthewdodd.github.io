In 1823 I had a sunk wheel silver watch - it was in June or July that year; the minutehand was broken half off by my thumb nail in opening it, and there was a dent near the handle of it, worn nearly through - I know the prisoner well - I saw him in July 1823, when he robbed me - he used to be at the cook-shop of a night, and I had seen him at Squire Wyard's, at <placeName id="t18260406-165-crimeloc886">Pickler's-hill</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. What time of night was this? A. When he first came I looked at my watch, and it wanted ten minutes to one - I was lying in a sort of shed, where there was hay and straw - there was no window, but some great holes - there was no door, one side of it was open, and that was where we got in - the only opportunity I had of seeing him was in this hovel - I never saw him from that time till about five weeks ago - I had seen him before - Warner, who is here now, came and told me he had got my property, and asked if I knew him - I said Yes - this was about a week before Bedford Assizes; Warner never told me that his brother was accused of horse stealing, nor any thing of the kind - he did not say the prisoner had accused his brother, and a man named Walker, of horse stealing - I never heard that Warner's brother, and a man of the name of Walker, were accused of horse stealing, and were to be tried at the Bedford Assizes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever hear that Warner's brother and Walker were tried for horse stealing? A. No; I heard a man named Monks was tried for horse stealing. but I never heard that Warner's brother and Walker were tried for it till this moment - I did not know the man who came in with the prisoner - upon my oath I have not prosecuted that man for this offence in Hertfordshire; I did not prosecute James Low for this offence; I went to the Hertford Assizes at Christmas, 1823, with this Hertfordshire fellow; but I did not charge him with this offence, as I charge this man now, with stealing my watch, and beating my head against the wall - I mean to stand to that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I caution you, if you do not answer fairly, we will commit you. Did you attend the Hertfordshire Assizes? A. Yes I did, at Christmas 1823 - I was sworn in Court; the man, who was the prisoner there, was James Low; he was accused of bringing this man to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about this watch? A. No; it was not mentioned, neither money nor watch; there was a witness came who went against him and cast him; I did not say he was one of the men who had my watch, but he was the person who brought the man to rob me; that man, who worked with me, was drinking with me, got them to come and rob me, and said what money I had got, and what watch I had got, and said it would be well to part it among them; the gardener put that man in the cage; and his son came out with a blunderbuss and assisted him, but this prisoner had run away then.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you charge a man of the name of Low with stealing your watch? A. No; I did not; I appeared as a witness against him for bringing this man to rob me of my watch; I cannot tell what happened to him; I heard he had two years' imprisonment; I did not accuse him with stealing my watch, but of bringing this man to rob me; I had not been at a public-house the night before - I always went to a cook-shop, and went to bed at eight o'clock. Low was taken as soon as this man had run away - he was going away after him, and I took him; I never saw my watch afterwards, nor the prisoner till, last Month. I cannot tell whether it was in June or July - it was in hay harvest - Warner never told me to say it was in July - he never told me any thing about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whereabouts was this? A. At Pickler's Hill, in Middlesex, just as you turn to East Barnet.</p>

            . I worked with the prisoner - he went to buy a watch-chain; I asked him what he had got, and he said a chain for a watch, which he had won at a mountebank's at Barnet; two or three weeks afterwards he told me that he went to a little place in a garden, and a man took him and one more to rob a person; they waited while he laid down, and they thought he was asleep, and they set upon him, and tried to get his watch and money, that the man was too strong for him, and turned him over twice, but he knocked his head against the wall, and got his watch and money; I saw the watch - the minute-hand was broken off, and there was a dent in it, near the swivel; he said it was at Pickler's Hill, near Barnet, in a shed in a gardener's place; he said the man had a pair of buckskin breeches on, and the chain was off, and he had hard work to get his finger and thumb in, to get the watch out; I had a brother tried for horse stealing, but I never told the prosecutor so - the prisoner and I were brought up under one roof, and while we were sitting in my own house at home, one Sunday, he told me of this; I do not know the prosecutor - the first time I saw him was one Sunday, at St. Neot's - a man who lived at Holloway, pointed him out to me; I was not present when the prosecutor saw the prisoner; when the prisoner told me of what he had done, he said he wished he had such another chance; I know he sold the watch to his brother William, who is now in Newgate; I worked with his brother last wheat hoeing time. I know the prisoner never had a watch before in his life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Was it in 1823 he told you this story? A. It was two years ago last hay time; I went down to where the prosecutor lives, to tell him; the prisoner continued to work in the same neighbourhood till he was taken; I did not go before a Magistrate to tell what he had told me; I think the prisoner was in Bedford gaol last - I am sure he was there last spring; in January or February, I think, he worked for a Mr. Fly, and now and then for a Mr. Goff; Walker and my brother were both charged with horse stealing by the prisoner; they were to be tried at the last Bedford Assizes - it was not till after they were in jail that I went to accuse this man - I was at their trial; another brother of mine contrived to get the prisoner in jail; before that he was at Bedford, committed on this charge, and he was removed here; he was taken on the Monday, as the Assizes were on the Wednesday - he had come down as a witness against my brother - the first time I saw the prosecutor was on the Sunday, as the prisoner was taken on the Monday; I saw the prosecutor at Bedford Assizes; he knew my brother was charged with stealing a horse; I had no conversation with him; the prisoner was to be a witness against my brother - he knew it - he was not in Court but below stairs; he had been in the Court, where my brother and Walker were standing at the bar, but he went away before the trial was over; I am quite sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060070"></xptr>about that: I did not go with him - he went away from me out of the Sessions house, while my brother was on his trial - he did not tell me about the watch; I told him I knew the man, and had seen the property. I have been in gaol myself three times - the last time was last Midsummer, for that fellow stealing a watch, about twelve months before; and the first time was seven years ago. I had no spite against the prisoner for being put in gaol last time for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you convicted at any of these times? A. No; the prisoner was in the same gaol with me, on another charge for a watch, but he was acquitted - the man did not know him when he came to the bar - I never shewed the prisoner to the prosecutor at all - I was present when he saw him at the Assizes, and he knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Warner and Day fetched Thomas Butterworth up, and they had me sent to gaol two days before they had their trial.</p>

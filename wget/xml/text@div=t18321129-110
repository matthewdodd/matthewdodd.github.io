On the night of the 12th of November I fastened up my shop before I went to bed; I was alarmed in the night by some person getting down the shutters; I got up, and found one of the shutters down- I went out at the private door, and saw the prisoner crossing the road; I pursued, and gave an alarm, but I did not see him taken - I found one of the panes of glass in my shop window broken, and I saw a pair of boots at the watch-house, which are mine, and had been in my shop the night before; they had slipped the shutter down, without taking down the bar, then broken the glass, and taken out the boots, which stood on a shelf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were you the last person up that night? A. Yes - I saw the shop was fastened; the pins were in the bolts of the shutters, and the glass safe.</p>

               <p>CHEVALIER PHILLIPE LOUIS DE LA MARTELIERE, by interpretation. On the 3rd of October, I was pushed down, but I don't know by whom. My watch was taken from me, and I have never seen it since. I only think it was the prisoner, who knocked me down; I do not swear to the man, but it is like him in stature and in shape.</p>

            . Seeing the prisoner running, and hearing a cry of stop thief! I stopped him. He, Chevaliere, came up immediately; I do not under stand French myself, but he appeared to me, by his signals to mean that the prisoner was the person who took his watch.</p>

               <p>COURT. Now Chevalier, look at the prisoner and tell us whether you have such a recollection of the person who robbed you, as to be able to swear it was the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Chevalier, by interpretation. I cannot swear; it is like him, in stature, and in shape.</p>

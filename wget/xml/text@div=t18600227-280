                  </hi>. I live in Kentish-town—in June, 1858, I was in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields, about 1 o'clock—the prisoner came across my path and looked round several ways—I got near to him and he caught hold of my watch-guard and put one hand near my throat; I sung out for help but no help came, but others came up and assisted him, and put one hand across my mouth—I kept my hand on my watch in my left waistcoat pocket but they got my watch away—I closed with the prisoner and he closed with me and was about to strike me—I let him go, and I was about to follow him but I was stop by a woman.</p>

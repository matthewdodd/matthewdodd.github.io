He brought a bad shilling to me, which I marked, and afterwards gave to a policeman—I went into the shop, and found Hunt there—I showed him the shilling, and asked him if it belonged to him; he said that it did—I asked him if he had any more like it; he said, "No more"—I said, "This a bad shilling, and you know it; I can see what you are; I don't want any trouble with you; there is the door; if you like to go, go; I shall detain the shilling"—he walked quietly off, leaving the shilling and the tobacco—I went to the door and saw a young man, who I believe to be Cooper, selling fly-cages, and when he had got to the top of the street, he turned his head round and looked, and Hunt went in the same direction.</p>

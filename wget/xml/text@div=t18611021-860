I am assistant to Mr. Yard, a chemist, of 30, Lamb's Conduit-street—on 21st September the prisoner came there be<lb></lb>tween 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for two pennyworth of cooling ointment—I served him, and he gave me a shilling, which I suspected immediately to be bad—I gave him the ointment and change—I doubled the shilling up in his presence—I said, "I shall detain you till the police come, for passing bad coin here frequently"—he said he had never been in the shop before—a constable was sent for, and I gave him in charge with the shilling—at the station I marked the shilling—the prisoner had been at the shop twice before to my knowledge, about six weeks previously, and oiled for twopenny worth of cooling ointment on each occasion, and gave A billing each time—it was given to me the first time, and I put it in a tax, and kept it—I did not serve him the second time—I saw Mr. Yard serve him, and he gave Mr. Yard a bad shilling—after he was gone I said something to Mr. Yard, and he bent the shilling, and found it to be bad—he vent to the door, and the prisoner was gone—that shilling was put with the one I had previously received—they both remained in the same place till 21st September—I gave all three of them to the constable—when I said that the prisoner had been in the shop twice before, he said, "I have no other bad money about me; I have never been in the shop before "—he was told that he was given into custody for passing a bad shilling, and passing two on other occasions—that was said in the shop at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an agent to an ale brewery. On Thurs<lb></lb>day night, the 27th of December, a little after twelve o'clock, I was going home from the brewery, and in King's-road, Pimlico, which is a very soli<lb></lb>tary place, the prisoner and another man sprang out from a dark part of the square, and stood before me—it is called Eaton-square—the houses are a great distance off—I reside near there—I said, "What do you want?"—he said, "Money?"—I said, "You shall not have a halfpenny from me"—he said there was no use in my resisting, they intended to have my money or my life—I said, "You shall not have either, I hope"—he said, "Then I will not trifle with you"—he thrust his right hand into his bosom, and said, "I have a pistol here, and am determined to have your life or your money"—I seized hold of his arm while it was in his bosom, and said, "Now, you villain, fire away"—a struggle ensued between us—</p>

               <p>I got very much bruised and kicked about the legs and feet, but be did not get me down—I called out for the police, but before that, he said to his companion, "Come on, George, he is too much for me"—I had on a pea-jacket—I found two of the buttons torn open, and it is a very difficult coat to unbutton—I heard a policeman run up, but ray back was towards him—the prisoner wrenched himself away from me, and ran—the policeman and I ran after him, and caught him about fifty yards off—the other man went in a contrary direction, towards Ebury-street and made hit escape.</p>

I heard aft alarm given by the prosecutor—I went up as quick as I could, and found the pri<lb></lb>soner at the corner of the square with one hand in the prosecutor's breast, and the other at his stick—he then ran off, and I took him about fifty yards off—the other man went Belgrave-street way, and made his escape.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pear Tree-court, Clerkenwell. I have been working at 19, Cornwall-terrace, Regent's-park—the prisoner was at work there as a labourer. On the evening of the 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> of August, I saw him on the third floor of the house—he came out of a room I had been at work in—it was a bed-room—he was a slater's labourer, and had no business there—I saw him tucking something white into his trowsers—I told Hawes the foreman of it, and afterwards told the prisoner he had been taking something out of that room, and wished him to put it back again—he said it was nonsense—Hawes said I had better fetch a policeman, and then he took a white waistcoat out of his trowsers, and went and put it back into the drawer—he came out on the landing-place then—I suspected he bad something more, and told him so—he denied it—I was told to go and tell the footman—he then said, "Oh do not hurt a poor man, "and he would put it back—he then took one waistcoat from his right side, and another from his left, and put them back into the drawer—he was going away, and came out on the landing again—I was not satisfied then that he had given up all he had got, and on looking at him I saw something red in his trowsers pocket, and took out a silk handkerchief—I then gave information to Hawes, who sent me down to the footman, and I told him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am footman to the family of Mr. Thomas French, of No. 19, Cornwall-terrace. Robert French Burnett and William Mackey Burnett arc his nephews, and it was their things which were taken, and Mary Ann Flick's—when I was called I asked the prisoner how he came to go into the room, and said I must go for a policeman—I went, and got one—when the policeman came in, I was in the hall, and a pair of stockings fell out of the prisoner's coat sleeve, belonging to Flick, the housemaid—the white waistcoat and handkerchief belong to William Mackey Burnett, and the other waistcoat to Robert French Burnett—they had a bed-room on the third floor, and another on the attic—the articles were taken from different rooms.</p>

F. B.," and," R. F. B."—I have heard master call them by those names—I have seen "R. F. B." written in letters, but not at full length.</p>

On the 23d of February, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, my daughter called me out of the back-shop to the front. I found a pane of glass broken, and quite out; it had been cracked sometime before, but was quite safe before this. I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of the window, which are worth about 5 s. The prisoner was brought into the shop in a very few minutes by Taylor, who produced them, also two pair of knee-buckles, and two fruit-knives, which were mine, but I had not missed them.</p>

            . I live in Great Queen-street, about six doors, from Mr. Mead. On the 23d of February, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw three boys run by my shop. Suspecting them, I pursued, and overtook them in Drury-lane; the prisoner was one - I saw him put his hand into his pocket as he was running. I secured him, and took six pencil cases out of his pocket; I took him to the shop, and gave them to Mead. While I stood with the prisoner, a woman came up, and gave me two pair of silver buckles, and two silver double-bladed fruit-knives, which she said were thrown into a passage; she shewed me the passage, which was between the shop, and where I took him - the other boys got away in the crowd. I had seen them lurking about the shop all the afternoon, which made me suspect them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not pick them up - A. No, I was close behind him, and must have seen it if he did. It was a very dirty day, and they were quite clean. He had a dark green ragged coat on, and a ragged apron.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY PARTRIDGE. I live in Orange-street, Red-Lion-square. I was passing Mead's shop, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw three boys close together, leaning on the window-ledge of his shop; I passed them, and turned back to look at them. One of them turned and saw me; he informed the rest, and then all turned round, and ran away. The middle one took his hand out of a hole in the glass, which was large enough to admit his arm; he had a great quantity of silver articles in his hand. The other two snatched them out of his hand, and all three ran off together. I only saw their backs, and will not swear the prisoner was one; when he was taken he had a blue ragged coat on, and a short ragged apron, the dress that one of them had. I saw him at the watch-house that day, he had the same dress on then, which enables me to say he is one of them. It was one of the others that took the things out of the window; they were all acting together - I saw some pencil cases taken out. I had seen the prisoner about a week before, in company with the boy who put his hand into the window, he had the same dress on. I think his coat was blue, but it was so dirty that I could hardly judge. I knew his dress when I saw him at the watch-house.</p>

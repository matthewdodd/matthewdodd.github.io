The prisoner was in my service, and if he received money he was to bring it to me immediately - he never paid me 7l. 7s. from Mr. Scott - he had been with me about five weeks, and left me on the 3rd of February; I never saw him again for five months - there were no wages due to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. Has he not parents who have been tolerably strict with him? A. I believe not; I did not see him again till the 27th of August; he did not tell me he had lost the money and was afraid to return - his father told me so; I have not heard where he slept that night.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner fourteen years; I live in Charles-street, Drury-lane, and go out charing; when he lost this money he came to me crying bitterly - I said, "John, what ails you?" he said, "I have lost my employer's money, and if you will let me stop here to-night, from my father's, I will thank you;" I put him to bed with my son that night, and in the morning I gave him 6d. - he said he would go home to his parents.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did he come to you? A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - it was some time in February; I told his father of it afterwards, and he could not find him; about five or six weeks ago he came to me without a shirt, or a bit of shoe to his foot.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable of St. Martin's: On Friday the 8th of November, about eight in the morning, in consequence of information, I apprehended Emery, at No. 7, Angel-court, she was up; I asked her, where is the woman's money; there was a whole parcel of women there in confusion, and she said, let me go up into my own room, I went up; I then said, where is the woman's money; says she, here it is; she then went to something like a half chest of drawers, and she took the money out of the bottom drawer but one; she gave me five guineas, a half-guinea, and a crown piece; but says she, I was drunk, and I know nothing at all about it; I then took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those the words? - A. I think they were.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Fowler's defence. Mrs. Cole and I had been drinking together in the evening at a public-house; afterwards Sally Emery came home, she had been drinking wine with a gentleman, and was very tipsey; Mrs. Cole came up and asked me if I would have some porter;

             had a handkerchief in her hand with a knot at the corner; when I came back Sally said, she had lost her handkerchief and a half-guinea and some silver, and said, that either I or Mrs. Cole must have taken it, for nobody else had been in the room; I said it must be Mrs. Cole; she directly said, you stinking bunter, will you dare to say that I had it; and then we went to sighting; and then she took up a patten and threw it at me; there was not a man in the house, nor there is not a woman in the house that has got a man, besides Mrs. Cole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Emery's defence. I had been with a gentleman in the city, and got two half-guineas from him; I had been drinking some wine, and was very much intoxicated; I had some porter, and got change, and I put the other half-guinea and some silver into the corner of my pocket handkerchief and tied it up; after I came home I missed it, I told Lettice Fowler of it, and she said, Mrs. Cole must have it; and then Mrs. Cole began to abuse us both, and she and this young woman went to sight; Mrs. Cole, tore her veil off her bonnet, and her gown was tore to pieces; she had a white dress on; after that I went to bed, and in the morning, when I went to put my things to rights, I opened the shutters, and the first thing I saw was this crown piece and two guineas; there were no men in the house; there is no woman in the house that cohabits with any man but herself; I went and asked my landlady what was best to be done, and upon her advice I took the money and put it altogether in a drawer, and when the man came for me, I took it out and gave it him, but as to her being robbed, it was no such thing; this young woman did take up the broom, when she threw the patten at her, but there was no other violence used to her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Cole) Did you go to any public-house with Fowler? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you drank any thing that night? - A. No; only the porter up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at any public-house that night with two men? - A. No such thing; my husband is at Wandsworth, he belongs to the City Militia; I sent him a letter, but he has not got liberty to come up; I saw him at Bow-street, he got liberty to go to Bow-street to see how it was going forward.</p>

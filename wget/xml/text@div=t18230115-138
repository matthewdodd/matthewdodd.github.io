            . I am a conductor of the Bow-street patrol. On the 7th of December, I stopped Markwick in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, with this wrapper, and asked where he got it; he said he bought it of some servants in Bunhill-row - I asked if the master authorised his servants to sell it, he then said he bought it of the gentleman; I said I should take him to the gentleman, and when we got into Bath-street, he said he bought it of one Taylor, at a public-house. I left him in charge, and went to the Northumberland Arm's, City-road, found Taylor there, and asked if he had sold or given any wrapper to any man within ten minutes - he said not. I took Markwick there, who said he was the man; Taylor denied it - Markwick then said he bought it of a stranger in the street. I went to Markwick's house, and found a quantity of wrappers in boxes and drawers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was he carrying it publicly - A. Yes.</p>

            . I was warehouseman to Mr. Butler. Taylor was in possession there - Mr. Butler was abroad at the time. There were a quantity of wrappers in the cellar - these two are marked J. B. in the way ours are.</p>

             re-examined. I did not live in the house. Taylor was in possession under me, under the warrant; but the effects were assigned over to Mr. Helps, the provisional assignee. My authority was gone when the assignment was made. Mr. Helps never took possession except through me. I consider myself under his control, and the property in his care.</p>
               <p>MR. HELPS. I was provisional assignee. I consider that Cutten had possession for me. I had not directed him remain in possession for me.</p>

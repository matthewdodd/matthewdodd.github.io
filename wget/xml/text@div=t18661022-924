                  </hi>. I live at 31, White Place, Drury Lane, and am an unfortunate girl—at a quarter to two on Friday morning, 5th October, I was walking along Gray's Inn Lane to King's Cross—I was crossing from one side of the road to the other, just by Verulam Buildings—when I got on to the pavement the prisoner came up to me, and asked me where I was going—I told him I was going home—he said, "I'll go with you"—I said, "You will not"—when I was crossing the road he said, "I want you"—I said, "I don't want you, I would rather have your room than your com<lb></lb>pany"—he then struck me a violent blow on the chest, which caused me to fall down—when I was on the ground he knelt upon me and took away my handkerchief and my purse—my jacket pocket was cut very much and torn—my purse was in my hand—that was taken away, it contained one sovereign, one half-sovereign, a half-crown and sixpences—I screamed out, but nobody came—afterwards the police-sergeant came, and I told him what had happened—the prisoner ran away down Verulam Street—there was a gaslight opposite—I could see his features plainly—I described him to the sergeant—I am positive he is the man—I saw him the next day at the "Clock House," Leather Lane—the policeman was with me—the prisoner was at the bar—I could not identify him then, as he was leaning against the bar, and I could not get a full view of his face—I waited till he and his three companions came out and were going up Leather Lane—I went up to him and told him he was wanted—I gave him into custody—I recog<lb></lb>nised</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 165 S). I received a description of prisoner from the sergeant—on the Sunday night I was going with the last witness along Leather Lane, and she went into the Clock House—the prisoner was there—his back was towards her—other people were with him—he and his friends came out and walked up Leather Lane—the last witness got in front of him and turned him round, and said, "You are the man who robbed me"—he said, "You have got this up."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 210). On 11th Dec. I was on duty in Princes-road, Notting-hill—I saw the prisoner about five minutes before nine o'clock in the evening walking along the road with these three pieces of board over his shoulder—I stopped him, and asked where he got them from; he said from his master, Mr. Pocock, in Lad brook-square—I said I would take him to his master—he went with me, about 300 yards, to the corner of Princes-road—he then said he did not know where his master lived—I told him I should take him to the station—he said, "Let me go to my house"—I took him to his house, No. 27, Prince's-place, I found there three pieces of deal-board, thirteen pieces of stained-glass, eleven squares of crown glass, seven pieces of mahogany, about eighty feet of wood altogether, and twenty feet of wood moulding—they were partly in the cellar down-stairs and partly in the room—a person went into the house with the prisoner, but he had nothing in his basket—I produced the articles at the police-office; part of them are here.</p>

I keep a bacon and cheese shop—on 14th August, about half-past 5 o'clock, I was coming out at my door—I saw the prisoner and another man go to the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner strike him twice as I was crossing the road—he struck him in the face—I said, "What game do you call this"—I saw another man, who put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket—I did not see him take the money—they ran away—I pursued the prisoner, and knocked him down—I laid hold of him, and tried to get him to the station, and some of my neighbours helped me—he got his arms round my arm, and I said "He is breaking my arm"—all the girls and bad women came with sticks and stones and beset us—we had to send for a policeman.</p>

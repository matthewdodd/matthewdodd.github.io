On Friday, the 27th of September, I saw the prisoner in my shop - he bought same cakes for two children he had with him. I knew him before, and went out, leaving him in the shop. I missed a gold watch, gold watch chain, and four rings, a small fish and key. I had seen them the night before on the table, in my bed-room, which is the second floor back room - the front room on that floor is where I make my confectionary ornaments. I did not miss the property till I heard the prisoner was in custody, which was the day after he came. He was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards, but was never in the bed-room. I allowed him a guinea a week on his father's account, as he was not on good terms with his father. The property is worth 8 l. I rent the house myself, and have no lodgers. He was in the habit of going to the workshop.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Jarrin. The prisoner came to the shop on Friday; he remained there, and about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him going up stairs; he did not say what he was going up for. He remained up stairs about half an hour. I said nothing to him, as he had been accustomed to go up to the workshop. There are other men up there. When he came down, he desired me to get him a hackney-coach, which I did, and he went away.</p>

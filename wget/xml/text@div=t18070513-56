Notwithstanding she was very loving, and she would clench about me, I could not extricate myself immediately; but all of a sudden I found her to run, which caused me to have a suspicion; I put my hand upon my right hand pocket; I missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was gone. - A. Three guineas and a half, a seven shilling piece, a sixpence, and a halfpenny. When I got up to her, I said you hussey, you have robbed me; I took her of his side of Strand-lane; I seized her first, and the watchman came up and took her; she was searched, and all my money was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober at this time. - A. I had been drinking, but I was very competent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I saw him he was very tipsey; he says it is a very cold night for you to be walking; he says will you have something to drink, poor girl; I says, I am benighted; he put his hand in his pocket; here, my girl, says he, I have a family of my own; what he put in my hand I did not know. When I was searched they found what he said in my pocket; that is the way I had it; he gave it me.</p>

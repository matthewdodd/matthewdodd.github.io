I lost my handkerchief; but, I believe, some of the women, his companions, that came me took that.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose house was this?</p>
               <p>Mott. It was the dwelling-house of one Rose Sykes: when I got out into the court and called Thieves! a woman standing by asked me what I had been robb'd of: I said my watch and money, and that I had a friend at the Reaking, in Broad Court, and desired her to fetch her to my assistance. My friend was not there, but there came a serjeant of the foot guards. He bid me stand where I was, and said, there is no thorough-fare, and whoever comes out of the house lay hold of them. Presently a little ragged girl came out, there were people with links, one of whom said, lay hold of that girl, she has got some money in her mouth; I did, and she spit three shillings into my hand, and another fell to the ground; I was afraid to stoop for that, fearing I should be knock'd down. Then out came the prisoner's wife, I took hold of her, and kept her, 'till a fellow rescued her from me. The serjeant was then gone for a party of guards. I took the girl, who is here to give evidence ; she declared the 4 s. was part of my money, which the prisoner had given her to fetch a gown out of pawn.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen the watch since?</p>
               <p>Mott. No, my lord, I have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he could not swear to me, at first, but that my voice was something like the man's; but when he came to see me in Newgate. he then said, now I can swear to your person and voice.</p>
               <p>Mott. When I came before justice Fielding to see the prisoner, who was taken up for another offence, the justice asked me if I knew him, I said then I could positively swear to his person and voice.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the robbery was it that you saw him first ?</p>

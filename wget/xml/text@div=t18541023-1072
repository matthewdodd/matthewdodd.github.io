                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Arlington. In Jan. last I was at work at Dawley Fields, in the parish of Arlington—the prisoner was in the same field, at work—he is a labourer, I believe—I left my tools on a bench in one of the cottages that we were building—we were building twelve cottages—I had a plane and a hammer amongst my tools—I missed them the same day—on 4th Aug. I went to a stable used by the prisoner, and found the tools there—the prisoner's initials were then upon them, but I knew them to be my tools—his initials were cut in them, and burnt in</p>

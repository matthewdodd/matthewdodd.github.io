                  </hi>. I am a butterman, of 84, Hill Street, Lisson Grove—on 9th March a female came in, wearing a veil which concealed her face—she asked for a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a bad florin—I asked her where she got it—she said she did not know—I called in 211 D and gave him the florin—he broke it and threw it away—I let the prisoner go—on 13th April she came again between nine and ten in the evening—she came again for half a pound of beef sausages which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a florin—I tried it and found it vry soft—the prisoner saw me bending it and said, "Do not bend it, I can pass it at the butcher's"—I gave her in custody with the florin, but before that she opened her purse and 1 saw several florins in it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 9th March I was at Mr. Lewis's shop and saw the prisoner there—she lifted her veil and I recognised her—Mr. Collins gave me a bad florin—I bent it between my teeth—it was very soft, and I broke it in several pieces and threw it down on the dust—I have not the least doubt the prisoner is the person—she lifted her veil as she went out.</p>

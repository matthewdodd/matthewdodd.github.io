               <p>Q. Was the window of the kitchen and the house secured when you went to bed - A. The window was fastened by a bar, but not so secure as it might have been; the feather had not gone through.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash put down - A. I cannot swear that; there were no weights to the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it was quite open, or shut down - A. I cannot say one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come down in the morning - A. I came down twenty minutes past five.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the shutters down - A. The shutters were shut in.</p>

               <p>Q. You went out about half after five - did you observe the area gate - A. The front area door was half open; I went out at the street door.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the kitchen window when you came down in the morning - A. The window was fastened the same way when we came down as when we went to bed. I saw a great deal of dirt in the window, and I saw the print of a man's foot upon the dresser under the window. I went up stairs about my business. The porter said I heard the door go a second time after your husband went out; I was alarmed; that was about an hour afterwards. I ran down stairs and said, sir, the thieves have been. There were four table spoons of Mr. Hanson's gone, four tea spoons, a salt spoon, three table cloths, and a ham, all Mr. Hanson's. Then I went to look at my own; there was a pair of tea tongs, a table spoon, tea spoon, and an apron, gone of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things, the table cloth and the spoons, the night before when you went to bed - A. The spoons were in the closet, the table cloth in the drawer, the ham in the passage over the back area, my spoons in the dark closet, going the into back area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are dressed like a quaker, have you been sworn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people in the house had been up and out before you - A. Only my husband; there was a piece of coat found the same morning; I saw it as soon as I came down stairs, between the window and the cill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Between the window and the cill there was a piece of a coat found - the window had no pulley - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if any body threw up the sash and attempted to come in it would fall down upon them - A. Yes; I left the piece of coat there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you discover by the information that you received from the servant in the morning that the house had been robbed - A. Yes. The servant on seeing this piece of cloth came up to me; in consequence of the information I came down, the servant had not taken away the piece of cloth; the first thing they mentioned to me was the window; there was all dirt there, it had the appearance of a person's foot; it rained very hard in the night, it was impossible any body could come in without making it dirty: the cloth laid inside of the window, and the buttons on the outside; in consequence of that I was perfectly convinced that somebody had broke in; I found upon enquiry that several things had been missing, that have been described; we had a suspicion who the person was certainly; a week or ten days elapsed; I was going across Lincoln's inn I observed West, he was coming across Lincoln's inn; having no reason to ask him any question, I walked along; at the time I came to Carey street, I heard somebody running, it was this man; he said, I beg your pardon, Mr. Hanson, I was the man that robbed your house on such a night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you make him any promise - A. None at all. I replied, did you, I will not stop here and talk about it, come home and have an explanation about it; he and I went home and he explained it, he said that between twelve and one o'clock that night, he broke into the house by this means, he got over the area gate and got into the area, he stopped, there a short time till the watchman had gone bye, he turned the pin of the window about a good deal, it was fastened by a feather, he turned the pin about a good deal; after which the feather fell down in consequence of which he immediately took out this pin; then the shutter was immediately loose; he opened the shutter and entered the window, and got over the dresser; in getting through the window, in consequence of there being no pulley to it, it cut his coat getting through and tore part of it off; he then fastened the shutter again, as it was the former part of the night, indeed faster, for if they had been properly done nobody could do it; he then remained in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130024"></xptr>kitchen and collected all these things together, as before stated, the ham, and table cloth, &amp;c. and waited in the kitchen, in the back area, and in the coal hole, till Mr. Clapham went out in the morning, through at the street door, as he always does every morning; the prisoner about five minutes after followed him, that was all he said; in consequence of that information I sent for Mr. Blundell the constable, and de livered him over to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you afterwards go to Robinson's apartment - A. I did; I went to the watchhouse with Mr. Blundell; at the watchhouse Mr. Blundell asked where these things were; he replied that they were in Fisher street, No. 22, at Mr. Robinson's. In consequence of that information Mr. Blundell and I went there to see if it was true, leaving the prisoner in the watchhouse; I saw Mr. Robinson at No. 22, Fisher street; he appeared to me to be in lodgings; Mr. Blundell asked him if he knew a person of the name of West, and if he knew Mr. Hanson's servant, if he knew any thing of him, or had seen him; he said I do not know any thing of him, nor have I seen any thing of him; Mr. Blundell said are you sure of that; I think the words were quite, or no; after that Mr. Blundell asked him if he had any bundle containing the table cloths or the ham; he replied no; immediately Robinson turned to his wife and asked her if she knew any thing of them, or had seen any thing of him or these things; she said no; Mr. Blundell said he was sure the things were there, and he would have a search warrant; the prisoner after pausing a little turned round to his wife, and said well, I believe, we may as well confess it as not; Robinson immediately crawled under the bed and got the bundle containing the table cloth and the ham; then Mr. Blundell said you must come along with me and the bundle; we all came together to the watchhouse, he carried the bundle; he was secured in the watchhouse. The things were delivered to Mr. Blundell; they are my father's property, but I do not know so much about them as the cook.</p>
               <p>MR. BLUNDELL. Q. You are a constable of the Liberty of the Rolls - A. Yes. On the 16th of June, between the hours of eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information that you received from the prisoner West, did you afterwards go to Robinson's house - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the account that was given by Mr. Hanson - A. Yes, it is true; Robinson took the bundle from under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Robinson and the bundle to the watchhouse - A. Yes; I did not take him in custody then, he willingly went with me; when I came to the watchhouse I said he was in custody; I have had the bundle ever since; I produce it, and a piece of coat; on the 1st of June, at night, that piece of coat was delivered by Mr. Hanson to the watchman.</p>

I am very sorry for denying it to the officer, when he came, but I did not know he was an officer, nor did I understand what he said at first; as soon as I properly understood the affair and when he told me what West had been about, I took them from the place where my wife had left them; I asked West why he brought me in such trouble; he said he was sorry, I was an innocent man.</p>

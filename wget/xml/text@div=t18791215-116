                  </hi>. I live at 15, Industria Terrace, Brixton Road, and am a plasterer—on Saturday, 6th December, about 9.30 p.m., I was in the London Road in a public-house, where I saw the prisoners—they asked me to treat them—we all had something to drink—I said "I want to go to the Elephant and Castle"—they offered to show me the way—we left, and they took me up a dark turning, and Worster knocked me down, and before I was fairly up Hall knocked me down—Worster took my watch and chain from my pocket—I called out "Police?" and he gave it me back and ran away—three constables came up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hall.</hi> The master of a public-house did not refuse to serve me—I did not throw down a pot of beer—a constable did not come in and put roe out—I did not drop my money on the floor—you did not pick up two half-sovereigns and return them to me—I did not say I left my silver cigar-holder there—I did not put my arm round your neck—I did not say to the constable that you did nothing to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Worster.</hi> I had had a glass of ale, but was not the worse for drink—I did not take hold of the horse's head of a van pasting the tavern and draw it on the kerb, and the driver did not say "What are you doing of, you d—fool?"—I did not catch hold of a young woman round the neck, and we did not fall.</p>

               <p>10 o'clock, when I saw the prosecutor and the prisoners together at St. George's Circus—I watched them till they got to the Duke of Clarence, in the Westminster Road, where one of the prisoners asked for some drink, and the barman refused to serve them, and they crossed back from the Duke of Clarence to the Grapes—I remained outside with Chamberlain, and they remained there three-quarters of an hour, when they left and went down the London Road and entered the Royal Mortar public-house—after they were turned out the prosecutor was between the prisoners, one taking hold of each arm—they crossed the London Road, down St. George's Market, where there are about a dozen short courts—I got behind some vans, and Chamberlain ran round through another court—Hunt was behind me, and I heard the prosecutor say "No, I am not going that way; I will go back again," and he began to struggle to get away from the prisoners, and as soon as he began to struggle Worster hit him at the tide of the bead and he fell, and on trying to rise to his feet again the other prisoner struck him and he fell again, and while he was on the ground they got round him—he called out "Police) "and "Murder 1"—as soon as he began to call out they ran away, and Hall ran into my arms—the other prisoner was secured by Chamberlain—they were charged at the station Hall said he was in the Borough Road at 10.45 at a public-house called tile Fountain, and from there went to the Victoria Theatre and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor there, who was going to be looked up by a policeman, and he took him away, and the prosecutor asked him to shew him the way to the Elephant and Castle, and he was taking him that way by a short cut, and when he got down by St. George's Circus he said he wanted to go back after a woman, and they did not want him to go, and while he was struggling to go he called out "Police!" and "Murder!"—they were both searched and nothing found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder and live at Stratford. The prisoner was in my employment, but he was discharged a fortnight before this—on Saturday afternoon, 4th April, I saw my kettle safe between 5 and 6 o'clock, in the kitchen, but it was put in an outhouse afterwards—this lid (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was on it—I missed it and other things on Sunday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine store dealer, of No. 12, Britford Place, West Ham. I know the prisoner—on 7th April, about 7 o'clock in the morning, he came and offered roe this copper lid of a tea kettle for sale—I said, "I do not like the look of this, I do not think it is right"—he said, "You may do as you like about buying it, I have just brought it from home"—it weighed three quarters of a pound, and I gave him five pence for it—the sergeant came in the afternoon, and I gave it to him.</p>

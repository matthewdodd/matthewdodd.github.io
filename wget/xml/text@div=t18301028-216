Lush has been in my service at various times, and was so on the 6th of October, when this book was taken from my premises; it is the Haldane edition of Aristophanes - I had seen it five or six weeks before - I had had it bound for a gentleman, and have had it by me five or six months; my name is stamped in it - I was sent for on the 6th of October, to Mr. Bohu's, and they desired me to go to a pawnbroker's, where I found the book; I have seen Smith before, but did not know him personally.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose an ordinary person would not know the value of it? A. No, only scholars; there was a crest in it, which is torn out.</p>

On the 6th of October I went to the Cock and Bottle public-house, to take some refreshment; I saw this soldier, Cock croft, sitting on something, which was wrapped up in a horse-cloth; in a few minutes the prisoner Smith came in, not very sober, and said to the soldier, "Give me what you are sitting on;" the soldier said,"No, I shall deliver it into the person's hands who gave it me to take care of:" I did not take any particular notice till about ten minutes, when I saw both the prisoners looking at a book; I knew Lush, and said, "Will you let me look at it?" he held it to me, and I looked at it - he asked what it was worth; I said I did not know whether it was Latin or Hebrew - he said, "It is Greek;" Smith then said to Lush, "I will give you 1l. for it;" Lush said, "I shall not sell it, it is not my property - I got it so" (making a cross on the table) - I left them there with the book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And this was openly in the public-house? A. Yes - there were a dozen more persons, who might all see it; Smith seemed tipsy.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any part of the commissioners meet after that - A. Yes; they first met on the 22d of August at the Baptist's Head coffee-house; Messrs. Reynolds, Chambers and Hickey were present, they qualified themselves by taking the usual oaths to each other; they then took the deposition of the petitioning creditor's debt, and signed the adjucation of bankruptcy; the act of bankruptcy was, that he had lain in prison for two months - the commissioners qualification was signed in my presence, and I witnessed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any order made for notice of the proceedings being given to the prisoner - A. Yes; he was summoned to appear personally on the 29th of August, the 19th of September, and the 3d of October, at Guildhall, at twelve o'clock, to make a full disclosure of his estate and effects. I produce the Gazette of the 22d of August, 1818, which contains notice of the bankruptcy - (read) - The commissioners met at Guildhall on the 29th of August; the bankrupt did not attend there that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he meet the commissioners any where else that day - A. Yes; he was brought before them at a private meeting at the Baptist's Head coffee-house, but refused to take the oath. The commissioners asked him to take the oath, and were half an hour or an hour endeavouring to persuade him to take the book - he refused, and was not examined.</p>

What property have you in your possession - A. I am really not prepared to state. Q. Have you five hundred pounds in your possession, or under your control - A. I am going to petition the Lord Chancellor, or proceed at law, to supersede the commission, which I have good reason to think is an illegal one. If the decision is against me, of course I shall answer. Q. You are required immediately to state whether you have the 500 l. or not - A. I am wholly unprepared to enter into any examination at present. Q. You are not required to state the whole of your account; the only question is, Have you the 500 l. in your possession, or under your control - A. I can only answer as before. Q. Do you decline to give any further answer respecting the 500 l. - A. I do; but I beg to be understood that I do not decline answering from any intention to retain property which my creditors may be entitled to, or to evade the claims of justice, but that it is my intention, under legal advice which I have received, to contest the validity of the commission which has been issued against me.</p>

             being sworn, and examined on his oath, states the following answers to the questions hereafter stated - We think to right to apprize you, that you are bound, under the peril of committing a capital felony, now to disclose and discover all your effects, real and personal; and that you may be aware of your duty, you are called upon to hear the clause in the Act of Parliament now read to you (which was read accordingly); and having now heard the said clause In the Act of Parliament read, you are called upon to disclose and discover your effects, real and personal - A I am wholly unprepared, not having had any notice of the meeting, nor having any opportunity of seeing my legal adviser. I am not enabled to enter into any examination. Q. You have had the notice required by Act of Parliament, you attended on the 3d of October, being the day on which you by statute were required to make such discovery and disclosure, you were brought before the Commissioners again on the 7th of November, why then are you not now prepared to make such discovery and disclosure - A. I did not suppose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170019"></xptr>that I should be under the necessity of entering into any explanation, until the validity of the commission is determined. Q. Do you mean that you refuse to make such discovery and disclosure, until the validity of the commission is determined: or do you wish for any time to enable you forthwith to make such discovery and disclosure, as we think it proper to apprize you you are bound forthwith to do - A. I beg further time. Q. Do you mean that you beg for further time to make such discovery and disclosure, or that you may try the validity of the commission - A. I beg for further time, to enable me to make an account out. Q. If this meeting is adjourned for a week, will you, at the expiration of this week, make out the best account you are able - A. That is a time in which I should not be able to do any thing scarcely. Q. Will you now discover or disclose any part of your estate and effects - A. I am wholly unprepared. Q. We wish you to understand that we do not now ask you to discover or disclose the whole of your estate and effects, if you are unable so to do, but we repeat the question, Will you now discover or disclose any part of your estate or effects - A. Before I give any further answer to that I beg to see my counsel. Q. Time has been so often given you without success, that we must again repeat the question, Will you now discover or disclose any part of your estate or effects - A. I cannot at present, still I request it may be fully understood, that I by no means decline answering at present, from any intention to withhold property which others may be entitled to, neither do I wish to evade the claims of justice, but it is my intention, under legal advice which I have received, to contest the validity of the commission before a Jury, which has been issued against me, and for which purpose I have given my solicitor directions to commence a suit. Q. Was there not a sale on your premises the latter end of March last - A. Yes. Q. For how many days did the sale continue - A. Altogether three days. Did you not receive, after the second day's sale, the sum of 800 l. on some, and what other sum of money - A. It might be something of that kind, but I cannot say exactly. Q. Where is that money which you so received - A. I am not prepared to give an account at the present time. Q. Is it in your possession or under your control - A. I cannot answer it at the present time. Q. When you say you cannot answer it at the present time, do you mean that you are unable to say whether you are possessed, or have the control of this sum, or do you mean to say that you decline to answer the question, or have you any other meaning - A. I do decline for the present. Q. Did you not, after the third day's sale, receive a further sum of about 800 l. - A. I don't recollect the sum. Q. Did you not, after the third day's sale, receive a further sum of upwards of 500 l. - A. I did receive a sum of money, and it might probably be that amount. Q. Is that further sum of money in your possession, or under your control - A. I beg leave to decline answering for the present. Q. Such leave cannot and is not now given you, and you are now called upon to answer the question - A. I am not prepared to answer that for the present. Q. When you say that you are unprepared, do you mean to say you are unable or decline to answer - A. I do decline for the present. Q. Are you unable to answer that question - A. I am unable to give a particular account. Q. You are not asked to give a particular account; you are asked whether that sum is in your possession, or under your control - A. I should wish to see my solicitor before I enter into any further answer. Q. Was not your stock in trade valued, early in the present year, under prime cost, at the sum of 8000 l. and upwards - A. I believe the Accountant did make it somewhere near that amount. Q. Was not such stock sold off in the month of March last - A. It was thereabouts, I believe. Q. What sum did you actually receive from the produce of such sale - A. I do not recollect. Q. Did you not receive upwards of 3000 l. - A. Certainly not. Q. Did you not receive upwards of 2000 l. - A. I cannot say now. Q. Will you say you did not receive that sum - A. I cannot tell. Q. Where is the money you did receive; is it in your possession, or under your control - A. I beg leave to decline further explanation at the present. Q. Leave is not given you, and you are called upon now to answer the question - A. I must beg leave to see my advisers before I say more. Q. Do you then refuse to answer the question - A. I do decline at present.</p>

             be discharged from custody as to the commitment of the commissioners, and the warrant of Mr. Birnie, dated 4th of January, 1818.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter, whose hand-writing is it - A. It is the hand-writing of a clerk in our office - it applies to another order - (read).</p>
               <p>Sir - If the same anxiety existed to discharge Mr. Page, as procured and continued his illegal and unjust imprisonment, he would have been released on Saturday, when all the Commissioners were in town. You are well aware that an instrument, signed by only two commissioners is of no use, and we are advised it is in the power of the Commissioners to release Mr. Page, without further trouble or expense; we will, however, attend the Judge, and give every assistance in our power to release Mr. Page, as he considers every hour's imprisonment a great aggravation, and it is to be hoped a day will come when this oppressed individual will have justice done him. A petition was yesterday presented to the Lord Chancellor for a habeas corpus, and you will be served this day with a copy.</p>
               <p>ROGERS AND SON.</p>
               <p>To MR. G. ADAMS May 13, 1818.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Justice Holroyd's order for the prisoner to be brought up to be discharged from the commitments of the commissioners, in consequence of the first commission being superseded, was then put in and read, dated May, 14, 1818.)</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. When was the order that you produced, obtained - A. It was drawn up on the 5th of June; the term ended on the 10th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Tilleard attend on that occasion - A. Yes, and said he had no objection to the order. Mr. Justice Holroyd requested him to attend the Judge, or sign on the back of the order that he had no objection to it, both of which he refused to do. I, in consequence attended before Mr. Justice Abbot, made an affidavit of the service,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170020"></xptr>stated what had passed between me and Mr. Tilleard, and obtained the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that order ever made a rule of Court - A. No, it was not proceeded on, nor made a rule of Court, in consequence of an opinion which I obtained from Mr. Cullen, whom I consulted on the prisoner's behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that opinion taken by the prisoner's desire, to govern his conduct - A. It was, and I communicated that opinion to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you employed as solicitor for the prisoner - A. In January, 1818, my father was employed and interfered respecting the prisoner's proposition to his creditors. I first interfered in the month of April.</p>
               <p>Q. The verdict in the prisoner's favour was on the 9th of May, on the 19th of that month was any offer made to his creditors - A. Yes, I advised him to make a proposal to his creditors, and a circular letter was sent round to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner instruct you to bring any action to try the validity of the present commission - A. Yes, it was determined early in November that an action should be brought.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason why it was not immediately brought - A. It was considered as a local action against the commissioners, and the imprisonment being in Surry, it was thought proper to bring the action in Surry. There was a consultation under the first commission, with two gentleman of the Bar, and it was thought by them that it was a local action, and therefore I acted on that opinion in the second action. I could not proceed to trial until the Spring Assizes, and I brought the action sufficiently early for that purpose. I commenced proceedings on the 12th of January, as far as I am able to judge, it was determined to bring it on then. I exercised my own judgment as to when it was to be brought, and did not consult the prisoner. I engaged counsel to attend him at his third meeting, to guide him as to the conduct he was to pursue.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you mean to swear that counsel advised him not to answer - A. I do not know, I was not there. We thought it important that we should not advise Mr. Page.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you consult about laying the action - A. Mr. Sergeant 
               <persName id="t18190217-29-person337">Onslow</persName>
             and Mr. Barlow.</p>
               <p>Q. The commissioners' commitment was to Newgate - A. Yes, there were two actions brought against the commissioners, one was for Middlesex, and the other for the commitment at the Baptist Head, it was thought proper to lay the venue where it took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that apply to the first or second commission - A. To both; it was in consequence of 42 
               <persName id="t18190217-29-person338">Geo. III</persName>

               <p>Q. If you were advised to bring it in London. how came you to bring it in Surry - A. We were not advised to bring it in London; the consultation was on the first commission.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the answers you have been giving apply to former actions, which were never proceeded on - A. We have not been to trial yet; they were brought after the first verdict.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you bring the last action in consequence of the advice of any counsel - A. No, I took the opinion I had received, on the first commission, thinking it applied to the second also.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the commitment in the first case, on which you received the advice of the learned Sergeant, was in the King's Bench prison - A. No, I believe you will find it was in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any act done by the commissioners except in Middlesex or London - A. No; I know of none; we considered the imprisonment in Surry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the act charged in the action now pending - A. For the commitment by the commissioners, the first time he was brought before them, and for the imprisonment in the King's Bench. He was brought from the King's Bench to be examined, and taken back there.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Have you any commitment of the prisoner on the 29th of August, 1818 - A. I have - it is the commitment to Newgate - I produce it.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. He was brought to the King's Bench under that commitment - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. H. EDENBOROUGH. I am one of the petitioning creditors; I attended the meeting of the prisoner's creditors, in the early part of January 1818, at the Baptist's Head coffee-house; the prisoner was in an anti-room waiting. He came in before his creditors - Mr. Rogers, Sen. attended in his behalf; an account of his effects was produced, of which I took a copy.</p>
               <p>(read).</p>
               <p>LOSSES AND EXPENSES. - Going in, 100 l. Bad debts, 1,500 l. Lost by sale of goods to Smith, Islington, 3,000 l. Ditto Foster, Robins, Machin, and Eddes, 380 l. Ditto by exchange of lace, 60 l. Cash lent Murt, 90 l. Ditto by forged notes, 80 l. Lost by goods sold in shop, 350 l. By goods stolen in the shop 400 l. Rent and taxes, 270 l. Law Expenses, 120 l. House Expenses, 400 l. Wages, 140 l. Personal Expenses, 170 l. - Total, 7,060. Stock in hand, 9,525 l.</p>
               <p>Q. At that meeting were the amount of the prisoner's debts stated - A. Yes; Mr. Rogers undertook to say that they did not exceed 13,000 l. The creditors requested Mr. Rogers to withdraw, while they considered the statement; the prisoner was then called in; 5 s. in the pound was offered on his brother's security, and his own note for 1 s. 6 d. - making together 6 s. 6 d. in the pound; it was calculated that that was not half of what he made there were assets to pay, and the offer was not accepted. He had been in business about fifteen months. I called on him two or three times, with the other creditors, to induce him to make a better offer - he said he could make no better offer than he had done. He said he kept no books. He was asked to produce bills of parcels, they were not forthcoming. Corfe, the shopman, said in his presence that the goods were ticked off when they came in, and the bills were afterwards destroyed. The prisoner did not contradict it. I believe this was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the goods furnished to him such articles as he dealt in - A. Yes; he dealt considerably in lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. Did he not say that he could not obtain security for more than 5 s. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, I will give you so much in the pound, or you shall take all the effects on giving me a release - A. Yes, the proposition was made, but on this condition, that he would not give up the property unless every individual creditor had signed the release, and it would be impossible to get the signature of every creditor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170021"></xptr>Q. Was it not proposed that an execution which was in the house, for the stock taken of his brother, should be withdrawn for the benefit of the creditors - A. Mr. Rogers said, he thought if the creditors would accede to the proposal, it might possibly be done. I think he said he would try to persuade

             to forego the execution. He made out that he had 9,525 l. to pay 13,000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his stock taken - A. At prime-cost, and those articles that were depreciated in value were rated under prime-cost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not offer to give up the stock to his creditors after the commission was set aside - A. A circular letter was sent round, and Rogers and Son desired to have a meeting, but the creditors would not meet him, considering the proposition so fraudulent. This was after the trial, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. The circular letters were dated May 19 - this was a long while after the property was all sold by auction - A. I believe it was. My brother was assignee under the first commission. There was not a halfpenny to be got on the 14th of May - none of his property was to be got at.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the terms upon which he proposed to give up all his property - A. He said he would not give up a farthing until every individual creditor had signed his release. It was suggested to him that he should deliver up the property to three or four of his principal creditors, but as many creditors lived in the country it would be impossible to get them all to sign.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose they did not all sign, what was to be done - A. We promised to endeavour to get them to sign, but as he refused the offer, no further proposition took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he insist that delivering up all his property would be an act of bankruptcy - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. Did you accompany Mr. Adams to the prisoner with a deed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it stated to Mr. Page that Mr. Rogers had approved of that deed on his part - A. I do not recollect that it was. He said he could not sign it until he had consulted his solicitor.</p>

            's hand-writing, but I never saw him write so bad.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath do you or do you not believe it to be his - A. My belief is that it bears a similarity.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it such a similarity, that you believe it to be his - A. I should rather believe it was; I paid him the same note that is now produced. Every thing was sold off that was on the premises, both stock and furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the notes, do you see any of them you paid to him among them - A. Here are two 40 l., three 20 l., a 15 l., a 10 l., and a 5 l. note, all of which have gone through my hands - they have my mark on them, and are the notes that I paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive any money himself from the sale - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. Did not the sale commence under an execution - A, Yes; the amount of the levy was 800 l. The prisoner succeeded his brother in the business, and took the stock at a valuation. The execution was to secure his brother payment for the stock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then why was not the money paid to the Sheriff - A. The produce of the sale was more than the levy - the business was put an end to by the execution, and the second and third day's sale was for his own benefit.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the King's Arms, in St. George's in the East—I have known the younger prisoner three months—she was a customer—on the 24th of June I was going along the Kingsland-road, at ten o'clock in the morning, and met her; and went with her to her house in Union-walk, Union-street, Kingsland-road—I there saw the other prisoner—the introduced her as her mother—we had something to drink, which I paid for—I said I was going to the Old Bailey to a trial—the younger prisoner asked me to let her ride with me, as I had a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> which the did—she said she was going to the Old Bailey to meet a person she wanted to see—she remained here the whole of the day, and so did I—the Court did not break up till ten o'clock—I was a witness on a case—after that I bad some brandy and water, and remained with her at the public-house Bear here till twelve o'clock—in going home with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> she rode with me, and I was induced to go with her where she was living—there I saw the landlord of the house, the elder prisoner, and two children—we had more drink, and it got on for two o'clock—I got intoxicated—the elder prisoner said, "You had better stop now it is getting so late," and I was induced to do so—I sat down, fell asleep, and was awoke in the morning by a policeman knocking at the door, and asking who the two females were, going out in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> so early, it being between three and five o'clock—I had a purse, with between 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold about me when I went into the room—it was a red purse, with ivory at each end—I also had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in my waistcoat pocket—I fell asleep about half an hour after I got to the upstairs room—when I was awoke by the policeman I did not know at first where I was—I put my hand into my pocket, and told him I had lost my money—he took a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and went in pursuit of the</p>

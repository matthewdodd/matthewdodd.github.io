On the 21st of August, in the afternoon, I turned my gelding out on Brockley-hill, within a quarter of a mile of my house, on a waste - I saw him still grazing there a little after eight o'clock that evening, I went to look for him between four and five next morning, Saturday, and he was gone - I searched for him on Saturday and Sunday, and found him on Monday, about twelve, at Monk's stables, near Whitechapel; it was mine - I have seen the prisoner once or twice in different parts of the neighbourhood, but not to know him - I live about twelve miles from town.</p>

            , a horse-slaughterer, in Whitechapel-road, opposite the London-hospital. On Saturday, the 22nd of August, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, a horse was brought to me by the prisoner; another man, whom I have known in the neighbourhood for fifteen years, was with him - the man who came with him said I was to give this man 30s. for the horse, and 1s. to him, for shewing him the slaughtering-house; I put a sovereign and a half into the prisoner's hand; I had scarcely done that, before I said to the other man."Why, do you know this man who has brought the horse?" he said he did not; I then said to the prisoner, "Give me my money back again, I have strong donbts on my mind that this is not right;" he immediately gave me back the money - I told him I should detain the horse and money - Mr. Monk was standing in the shed close by; he took him into the counting-house, and questioned him; he was perfectly satisfied that it was not correct, and told me to take him to the office; as we went along, he made a start, and attempted to escape; I, however secured him, and told him it was a folly to put himself in jeopardy for so trifling a thing; he said he had taken the horse from Mr. Wright, of King's Langley, who was a wealthy man, and could well afford to lose it - I took him to Lambeth-street; he said he was a poor man, and had taken the horse out of the field - we wrote that evening to Wright, of King's Langley, but got no answer - it is near Hemel Hempstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him no such thing; I said I was afraid it was a stolen horse, not that I had stolen it.</p>

I had been down at harvest-work, and as I came back on Saturday morning, I met a man in the road with this horse; he asked if I wished to buy it; I said, "I don't care, what do you ask for it?" he asked 35s.; I said, "I have 28s.;" he agreed to take it. I have witnesses who saw me buy the horse, and pay the money, if I had an opportunity of bringing them here.</p>

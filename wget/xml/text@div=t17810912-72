Between ten and eleven o'clock on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120070"></xptr> Thursday morning, the 6th of September, the prisoner came into the shop, and took a counterpane out of pawn for 18 d. She came out of the box, and I went to the other end of the shop, and she came into the shop. She opened the door, behind which hung six or seven gowns; and about ten minutes after, my master, coming down from breakfast, missed the gown, and asked me where it was. The prisoner came back, and seemed much confused, and said she wanted a pair of wires, which is a pair of ear-rings. I served her, and then followed her to her lodgings. Between our house and the lodgings I took her, with the gown in her lap. She came back, and my master charged a constable with her.</p>

               <p>I went to redeem a counterpane, for 18 d. A woman came in to redeem a waistcoat. She went out first. As I went out, I picked up the gown, and seeing no ticket on it, I thought it was as much my property as another's, and took it home with me.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.)</p>

On 16th July, about half-past 4 o'clock, I met Sexton at the bottom of Hadleigh-green, with his face bruised and his finger bleeding—he said that he had been robbed, and described three men—he went with me to the top of the Green, where he identified Chow, who was lying asleep—I took-him in custody, searched him, and found on him a half-crown, and sixpence in coppers—Sexton had been drinking a little, but was sober.</p>

On Thursday, the 27th of January, a little before one o'clock in the day, I was coming down stairs, found his room door open, and saw the prisoner in the room with a bundle in his hand, or his hand on the bundle, which contained the articles stated in the indictment - he tried to pass me. I saw that the sheets, pillows, quilt, curtains, and valences were stripped off the bed; he had put them into the pillow-case. He also had a bundle with two pillows, some pictures, and a looking-glass, which were my husband's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pillow-case - A. On the bed - the room is very small. He passed me as far as the stairs, but I called Stop thief! and Youren seized him; he said he would not flinch, and did not attempt to go further; he had left every thing on the bed - I had made the bed not half an hour before, left the door locked, and took the key into the top room until Youren came for it. We both came down stairs together; he put the key to the door, and found it was open - I had left the things in their proper places. The street door was left open.</p>

            . I am a currier, and occupy part of a back room at Anderson's; I went out between eight and nine o'clock, and gave her the key to make the bed. I returned home a little before twelve o'clock, went up to her room for the key, and she came down with me. I put the key to the door, and it flew open; it was unlocked, and the prisoner was there - he either had his hand on the bundle, or the bundle in his hand. While I turned round to the landlady he came out of the room, and passed me; she cried out Stop thief! and I seized him directly. I found the room stripped of every thing, the pictures taken off the wall, and the curtains off the bed; I found a bundle and a pillow-case in the room containing the property - he appeared agitated. I asked him how he got into the room? and he gave me some keys, one of which opens the door. There is a door from the front room into mine, that was locked and bolted.</p>

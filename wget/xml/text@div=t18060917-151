             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Did you go on the 7th of August to Mr. Miller's. - A. I did, Mrs. Miller and I went to the White Horse; coming out of the White Horse Mrs. Miller pointed to a man (the prisoner at the bar), who came up to us; Mrs. Miller asked him if he had got any thing about him, he said no, but he had got one half guinea in the house, which was rather the worse for wear. I went up stairs into his house with him, he told me to stop at the head of the stairs (Mrs. Miller went into the yard), and he would bring it out to me (there seemed to be several people in the room he went into), he brought me a crooked half guinea, I asked him the price of it, he said it should be five shillings, but as it was wore he took three shillings and sixpence. He called his wife up stairs, she came up, he told her he had not a sixpence to give me, she gave me a sixpence good money out of the four shillings I gave him. I wrapped up the half guinea in paper immediately, I put it in my box, and I put the box in my pocket, and I gave it to Mr. Rogers when I got out at Shadwell. I had no other money in my pocket.</p>

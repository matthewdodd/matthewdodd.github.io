On 16th June I was on duty in Liverpool Street, and about 12.50 a.m. I saw the prisoner about 10 yards from the Great Eastern Railway's premises with a box on his shoulder—I asked him what he was going to do with it—he said that at 12 o'clock he was engaged to curry it from the North London Railway to Cannon Street station by a gentleman who then went into the Railway Tavern with a gay female, and that he waited outside till the house closed—I took him in custody—there was a cut on the third finger of his left hand, another on his right hand, and two grazes on his wrist—I found 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him but no knife—seeing some labels of the Great Eastern Rail<lb></lb>way on the box, I went there and found a window broken and a hole made large enough to take the box through, and blood on the glass.</p>

               <p>Q. On Thursday the 10th of November, do you remember the prisoner coming into your shop - A. Yes, he came in for three pennyworth of cheese; I weighed it, and gave it him; he gave me a three shilling token in payment; I sounded it on the counter, and just at that time Johnson, the officer, came in; I shewed him the three-shilling token; Johnson said it was a bad one. I told Johnson on in the presence of the prisoner, that I received it of the prisoner. Johnson desired me to mark the three-shilling token, which I did. This is the token; I have no doubt about it.</p>

            . In consequence of suspicion, on the 10th of November, I saw the prisoner; I watched him; I saw him go into Mr. Vaisey's shop; I stood outside. I saw him tender a three-shilling piece; when Mr. Vaisey had got the three-shilling piece, I heard him ringing it; I went into the shop, I asked Mr. Vaisey to let me look at it; he shewed me the three-shilling token; he said, I have just received it of the prisoner. I upon looking at it, I observed it to be a counterfeit. I shall know it again if I see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that - A. That is the token that was given to Mr. Vaisey by the prisoner; I have no doubt about it. I asked the prisoner where he got the token, and told him it was a bad one, he said, he got it in change for a pound note at Chatham. I asked him if he had any more tokens about him that he had taken in change of the pound note at Chatham; he said, no, he had not. I took him backwards to search him; in his left hand breeches pocket, I found two tokens wrapped in paper, and two loose; the two in paper had paper between them, as they are sold, to prevent them from rubbing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and tell me whether these are the four that you found in his breeches pocket - A. These are the four that I found in his breeches pocket. I asked him where he lived; he refused to tell me. I searched his other breeches pocket; here is two shillings in good silver, and three or four sixpences; in his coat pocket I found two shillings and tenpence three farthings, and a hank of cord, and about a pound of meat; they are new articles just bought.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, residing at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140034"></xptr>Hampstead. On Thursday, the 1st of this month, I went down to the neighbourhood of Kilburn for the purpose of seeing a child, it was a female child, and I found it lying at a chandler's shop, in Kilburn; I found one wound on the right cheek, extending completely from the mouth to the extremity of the jaw. I found another smaller wound on the neck, and on the opposite side, I found a smaller one; I found sevaral others on the head, which seemed as if they had been made by some blunt instrument, as if a stake had been forced on it. I found underneath these wounds, on the top of the scalp, that the scull had been fractured. From the appearance I believe it was necessary to use considerable violence in causing the wounds. The first wound on the jaw appeared to have been forcibly ript open; the scull was in that state of hardness to have required force to fracture it. I opened the child, and examined the lungs; they appeared to have been inflated; but that is certainly no criterion to judge whether the child was born alive. The appearance of the wound on the head would not have satisfied me that they had been inflicted on a living subject; but the wounds on the face and neck did satisfy me that they were. There was a small portion of blood had issured from the surface of the skin, which would not have been if the child had been dead at the time the wounds were inflicted. It is my belief and judgment, that the child was born alive.</p>

               <p>Q. In your judgment and belief, did the wounds occasion the child's death - A. It is uncertain whether they would have occasioned instantaneous death; it is questionable to me, but the child might have lived after the wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was its death, whether instantaneous or not, occasioned by that violence - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. I have been settled in practice for some years; I have been much in that part of my profession called midwifery. I have seen many children that have been born dead; I never before saw any where the death was alledged to have arisen from violence. I first saw this child on the 1st of February; it had been found some days, and there were several small portions of blood on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear whether that blood issued from the wounds or from the mother - A. I believe it issued from the wounds. From the appearance of all the wounds, as they were partly cut and partly torn. I think they were inflicted by a violent instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. If a young woman, like the person at the bar, were prematurely delivered, might she not by accidentally putting her fingers into the mouth of the child, and in the agonies of labour, have inflicted every wound you saw on it - A. From some parts of the wounds, I think it is impossible that fingers could make them.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me why not the nails - A. The wounds on the head it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Why - A. The scull was evidently penetrated.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that have arisen from the fall of the child from a woman's person, in the act of delivering herself standing, or a stone, or a brick, or the hard ground - A. I should not think so; it was directly a penetrated wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you exclude the possibility? do you mean to say it was impossible - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. I will not trouble you upon the subject of the inflation of the lungs, being a proof of the child being born alive, because that fallacious doctrine has been long exploded by men of the greatest science in your profession.</p>

            . I am a surgeon belonging to the Cold Bath-fields prison. I was requested by Mr. Baker, to make an application to the prisoner, for the purpose of examining her person, to ascertain whether or not she had been recently delivered of a child. I went to her on the 2nd of February, and I observed to her that I was requested by the magistrate to examine her person, to ascertain whether she had been recently delivered of a child or not She burst into a flood of tears, and seemed to shew great reluctance to my doing so.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Before she imparted any thing to you, did you not tell her that what she said to you was in confidence, and would never be used against her? did you not say she had better tell you whether she had been delivered or not - A. I might have made use of the word better. But to the best of my knowledge, it was that she had better tell me whether she had been delivered or not, because if I came to examine her, I should ascertain it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you positively swear that you did not say to her she had better own that she had been delivered of a child - A. It is most likely that I did so.</p>

            . I am a publican, and at the latter end of January last, I kept a public-house in Poland-street, Soho. The prisoner was my servant, and passed as a single woman to me; she had lived with me very near five months before she left me; she gave me one week's notice on the Sunday to quit on the Sunday following; but she quitted me on the Friday. I made some observation on her person; from her appearance, I supposed that she was in a state of pregnancy; I did not communicate to her my suspicion. She went on the Friday. She came back to my house on the Monday following; she came back for her box. On the Monday when she came back, I did not see her. I saw her on the Thursday following at my house, she came back for a character, and I saw there were some little alterations in her; she was not so large as when she left. She came on the Thursday morning to know if I would give her a character, and then she went away shortly afterwards.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came and lived in his service while I lived there; she and I slept together; I told her that I was sure she was in the family way, about two months before she left; she said she was not. I thought so by her size. I observed an increase in the appearance of her size, after she came to our house; that increase of her size appeared to be increasing and getting larger. In consequence of that it was that I asked her if she was not in the family way, and other circumstances, namely, her not being as other women are.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140035"></xptr>She went away on the Friday, and she came back on the Monday, and she returned also on the Thursday; I saw her face, but had not an opportunity of observing her person on the Monday.

I went down to the house of a person named Lucas, living at Kilburn, on Friday, the 2nd of February; I there received some clothes; they were in Lucas's house for the purpose of drying. At that time I looked at those clothes, and upon examining them, I made an observation that they were badly washed, for that the dirt was not half taken out. They consisted of a gown, a petticoat, a chemise, a pair of stockings, and a handkerchief. I went there the next day, and brought away the clothes I had seen on the preceding day; I have them here.</p>

            . I am the mother of the last witness. On the morning of the 30th of January, I went to the place where the child was; I was fetched by my husband; it was in a garden, formerly a field; I saw a new born child; I was so much frightened, and so much shocked that I did not examine it then, but I went and brought a neighbour. She took her apron, and she and I picked it up and put it in; and then we examined it together. I found the face dreadfully cut, and its neck. I found wounds on its head; they were not perceivable at first, because it was so stiff with the frost, but when it came into the warmth of the house, the wounds opened and bled, and were then very plain to be seen on the head. We reckon it a quarter of a mile from our house to Mrs. Lucas's. I can't say how far from where the child was.</p>
               <p>The COURT in charging the Jury informed them, that unless they should be of opinion that the child found in the garden was a child produced from the prisoner's body, they could not find her guilty of the murder, because they would not be connected together. But if they should think, that though the evidence did not satisfy them that the child found was hers; if they were of opinion that she had been with child, that she had been delivered of it, and had concealed its birth, then they would find their verdict so, specially, because she would be imprisonable for any term within the discretion of the Court</p>

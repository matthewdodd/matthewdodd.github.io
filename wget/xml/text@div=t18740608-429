Pawson's, Dodd was on the opposite side walking up and down, Roxby stood a few yards below the house on the same side as Pawson's—I never saw Williams after, until I apprehended him in the Hackney Road—I saw Turner come out, not Williams—I think she came out about ten minutes after—she appeared very weighty and bulky in the fore part of her dress—she was holding up her dress—she passed Dodd in front of St. Paul's, and went into a public-house in Cannon Alley—she passed Dodd within two yards—Dodd was watching Pawson's appa<lb></lb>rently—he followed her into the public-house—Roxby was at that time standing close to the door of Pawson's—Dodd was carrying the parcel up to the time of going into the public-house, and just before going in he untied the string of the parcel and threw the paper away, and the string on the ground, both of which I picked up—they remained about ten minutes in the public-house—Dodd came out first carrying a long parcel of silk in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> bag under his arm—the female followed a few yards after him—they went in the direction of Cheapside—I spoke to a constable in uniform—I then took Dodd into custody—He said "What do you want with me?"—I told him, and he said "I know nothing of that woman"—I had not said anything about the woman to him—He was confused—the constable took the woman within a few yards of Dodd—I said "You will be charged with stealing that parcel"—he said "I know nothing of that woman, it is all wrong, it is all a mistake"—I then took him to the station—I did not know then what was in the parcel—they were put in the dock together—I heard Dodd say "I know nothing about her, I know nothing about this lady"—the woman said "Who charges me with stealing this, nobody saw me stealing, I know nothing about this man," meaning Dodd—on the same day I went with Lythell, Simmonds, and Randall, three detectives, to the Hackney Road—I saw Roxby and Williams together in the Hackney Road—we took them to the station—the charge was read out to them—Williams said "I was in Pawson's, but what I got I paid for"—at the time he was apprehended this piece of silk was in his hands—he said "I know nothing about that female (Roxby), we were standing drinking together, I know nothing of her, we had had a glass together."</p>

I don't live there," or something to that effect; "I know nothing about them; I never saw them before"—I showed them to Turner; she said, "My lodgings 1" I said, "Yes, and this is what I found in your room;" she said, "I know nothing whatever about them"—on the 14th April I saw the two women and Dodd together, in Friday Street, City—they went into Messrs. Boyd's warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am female searcher at Bow Lane Police Station—I searched Turner—her cloak was made of cloth—this is the cloak—these pockets are not usually worn in waterproofs. (<hi rend="italic">The pieces of silk alleged to have been stolen was here produced.</hi>) This pocket would not be of any use to carry it in, only to hold it in, to rest it—the only use of the cloak would be to hide it, but it could not be put in the pocket.</p>

Between 8 and 9 at Night, I and the Deceas'd were on the Patrole in the 5 Fields between Chelsea and Westminster, we past by the Genoese Arms, and when we were got about 6 or 7 Yards from thence, the Prisoner and John Andrews came out together. They call us King Georges Dogs, and gave us other abusive Language. - Sir says I to Andrews, if you dont mend your manners, I shall carry you Prisoner to the Guard. - Will you says he but I'll Stick you to the Heart first, and then pull'd out a naked Knife, upon which I Collar'd him and kickt up his Heels by the side of a Dunghill. My Comrade might then be about 2 Yards behind me, and his Candle was beat out. Andrew got up again and went towards my Comrade. The Prisoner came up to me and I collar'd him.

The Deceas'd ran from the Dunghill towards the Genoese Arms and fell down, and Andrews ran quite away. The Prisoners Sword was not then Drawn: I took it from his side, - and we carry'd the Deceas'd into the Genoese Arms. Captain Steward thus depos'd.

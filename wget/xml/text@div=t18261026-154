On Thursday, the 12th of October, about ten o'clock, I missed a sovereign and two shillings from my box, which I had seen safe on Sunday, and locked it up; the key was in my pocket - the prisoner slept in the same room - I told him of it; he denied taking it - I gave him in charge, and at Bow-street he said, that at three o'clock in the morning, he got out of bed and took the key from my pocket, and took the sovereign from my box.</p>

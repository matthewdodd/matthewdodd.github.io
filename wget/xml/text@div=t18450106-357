I left home about six o'clock in the evening—I left no one at home—I shut the doors, and left the house safe—I returned about twenty minutes before eight o'clock—I found the street door fast, as I had left it—on going into the house I found everything in disorder, and I missed the property described in this indictment—if any one got into the house it must have been by a key—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is my property—the whole of it was safe when I left—on the 19th of Dec., in consequence of a dream I had the preceding night, I went to Mrs. Asher's shop in the Minories, and found my Cashmere dress lying on the counter—Mrs. Asher showed me a satin shawl which I had lost—I went and gave information to the police—I then accompanied Dubois and Holland back to Mrs. Asher's—I saw the same articles which I had seen there before, and the officers took possession of them—I then went with the same officers to Mrs. Davidson's shop in Russell-court, Drury-lane—she showed me a velvet scarf and a dress which were mine, and which I had lost on the 3rd of Dec—the officers took possession of them—she then produced a black silk dress of mine, which the officers took—they are here to-day—we then went to the house of the prisoner Miers, in Harrow-alley, Houndsditch—we saw her there—the officers searched the place—they found a black silk dress there, a worsted shawl, and some fringe—they are all my property—I then went with the officers to Mr. Josephs, in Rosentary-lane—I there discovered a black satin dress, and a blue silk dress—the value of what I lost was about 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—what I have found is worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I went with Mrs. Ayres on the 19th of Dec. to Mrs. Asher's house in the Minories—I saw Dubois take the Cashmere dress and the satin shawl—from what we heard there, we went to Davidson's, in Russell-court—we got some things there, and from what we there heard, we went back to Asher's and then to Miers's house in Harrow-alley, Houndsditch—we saw Miers there—I produced the property I had found at Asher's and Davidson's on the table—I said to Miers, "This person's house has been opened by skeleton keys, and pro<lb></lb>perty stolen; Davidson says you sold her this property, which is part of what was stolen,—where did you get it?"—she said she bought it of a man whom she knew, but did not know his name, nor where he lived—Davidson said to her, "You know you sold them me"—Miers said, "Yes"—I said to Miers, "You are the last person found in possession of the property, I shall be obliged to detain you"—she seemed very much agitated—some time after her husband came home—I told him the same tale about the house being entered by skeleton keys, and property stolen—he said to her, "Tell me who you bought it of"—they looked at each other for some time, and then she said, "I bought it of <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Harris"—Miers said, "I am an honest man, for God's sake, let us go, and look after Harris, for if he gets scent of it, he will be off"—I said, "You shall have the same facilities that other persons have; you shall go and find Harris"—I said to a City-officer who was there, "Go, and search for him, but don't part with Miers"—they went, and in a few minutes returned with Harris—I said to him, "Is your name Harris?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him to sit down, and I told him the tale, and sh wed him the property on the table—Mrs. Miers said she bought it of him, and gave him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—Harris said, "So help me God, she never did, it is a pretty thing to get me into"—I said, "Sit down, you shall have justice done you"—about half-an-hour Dubois came back, having been to Joseph's and got more property—I then said to Mrs. Miers, "Have you bought other goods of Harris besides those now produced?—she said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "I must search the house," and we all went up stairs—that was in consequence of something being said about more stolen property being in the house, but I cannot recollect the words—when we were up stairs there was a good deal of shuffling about, and going from one part to the other, and saying, "There is nothing here, and nothing here," and so on—Mrs. Ayres said, "Here is another gown and shawl of mine," she took them off the sofa and gave them to me—she then said, "Look how they are shuffling at that end of the room"—I went there—Mrs. Miers and her husband, and Mrs. Ayres were there—there was a table, the flap of which reached nearly to the floor, and I found under it a bundle—I took it out and said, "What is this?"—Mrs. Miers said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let us look what nothing is"—I found in it a pair of trowsers and a shirt, which Miers said were his—there were some table-cloths, napkins, and other things in the bundle which are not in this indictment—I had Harris below in custody—I brought Mrs. Miers down, and I said to Harris, "We have found a bundle of things under the table; I think it is only justice and fair to you to tell you that Mrs. Miers says she bought them of you along with the other lot of goods"—he said, "She will say anything, the</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in the 'Change. On the 9th of Dec. I saw Harris there, between eleven and twelve o'clock—he had a bag with him, and he offered the things in the bag for sale—he was throwing them out for any person to buy them—they consisted of women's wearing apparel, dresses, shawls, and linen—there was a table-cloth or two—Mrs. Miers came walking up the market, and he offered them to her—I think he asked 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I afterwards saw him put the things into the bag, and walk down the lane with them towards Miers's home, and she went with him—I have seen her purchase of him several times before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mrs. Miers's sister; I live with her, and mind her shop. I was there between twelve and one o'clock on the 9th of Dec.—Harris came to her shop about that time, and she came with him—he brought a bag with him—my sister purchased the contents of it of him for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these are part of the articles that were in it—they were turned out of the bag on the counter—they were purchased in the ordinary way in which our people purchase goods when they do not effect a sale on 'Change—my sister had dealt with Harris several times before.</p>

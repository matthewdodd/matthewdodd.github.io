On Saturday night I sent her to the watch-house for disorderly conduct, and getting tipsy; she wanted to take a bundle with her, but I refused to let her - it was detained in my parlour till the Tuesday following, locked up in the parlour; I kept the key in the drawing-room. The constable opened the room on Tuesday in my presence, and found the parcel, she had come to demand her clothes - she had made up the bundle on Saturday night. When my servant opened the door to her, she rushed on her, and began beating her. I ran down stairs, hearing the screams, and saw her beating her. I sent for an officer, who opened the bundle in the presence of the prisoner and myself, and found two napkins belonging to me in it; she then asked for her trunk, which was brought down. I said I would have that searched also - she ran away when she was asked for the key, one of the constables fetched her back, and threatened to break it open - she then gave up the key, and a silver fork was found in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BERNARD. Q. I believe you had her with a character - A. She referred me to a person, who did not satisfy me; but being ill, I took her for a week on trial. I went to the watch-house on Sunday to sign my name, two gentlemen went with me; neither of them called himself Mr. Rowley - she was discharged on bail. I had charged her with threatening to take my life; she had held me down on the stairs at half-past twelve o'clock at night, and pulled off all my clothes. I have four silver forks constantly in use, they were kept in the drawing-room cupboard; her box was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. When her trunk was opened, did not she look at you, and say,</p>
               <p>"Oh! you wicked woman" - A. She did several times, and I nearly fainted; she said it before the box was brought down. I do not know what she said when it was opened, for I was near fainting at the time the fork was found.</p>
               <p>Q. At what church were you married - A. I was married in a private house. I cannot say when, for I took no notice of the time; it was in the period of St. Mary's, Dublin. The Rev. - Harris was the clergyman; I think it is nearly six years ago. I have not seen Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190051"></xptr>Rowley since the year I married him.

            . I was fetched to Mrs. Rowley's, on the 12th of February, about three o'clock in the afternoon; I saw a servant crying, Mrs. Rowley was in the parlour; she said the prisoner wanted to take her bundle and trunk without being searched, and that she had lost a silver fork. The parcel laid in the corner of the parlour tied up at two corners, and the other two untied - she claimed three dusters and a napkin, which were in it; the trunk was brought down - I asked the prisoner for the key, which she refused two or three times; I said I should break it open; she then delivered it. I unlocked it, and Mrs. Rowley took out the fork.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not say she would not give up the key till she had a witness present - A. I do not recollect it; I will not swear that she did not. When the fork was found, she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! you wicked woman." Some of the linen in the bundle was wet, as if it had been laying in a tub.</p>

            . I went with the officers to the house. I saw the trunk opened, but when it was to be fetched down, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I have stopped long enough," and ran to the door - I fetched her back, and saw the trunk opened, and the fork found; she made a second attempt to get to the door, but I had the key in my hand.</p>
               <p>MRS. ROWLEY. The fork is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went before the magistrate on the Monday, did you say a word about the fork - A. No; I had not missed it. I suppose the watchman must have opened the bundle on Saturday, in pulling it from her, some things came out at the time. I pushed them in with my feet, and locked it up. She told the magistrate that I put the fork there, but positively I did not.</p>
               <p>- I am servant to the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>I do not know how the fork got in the box; I heard my mistress say it was missing. When the prisoner came to the door, she said she wanted to speak to me, that she had come for her things - she then knocked me down. When her trunk was opened, she told Mrs. Rowley she put the fork there; we generally have four silver forks in use. Mrs. Rowley appeared rather agitated, when the prisoner said she put the fork there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the door for my things. I found the servant had been warned against my calling. I gave the door a push, and walked in - she screamed out - her mistress came down, and a constable was fetched. I was shewn into the parlour, where the bundle was. Mrs. Rowley requested the constable to turn me out of the room, which he did, and I could not see my things examined. I did not like to give up the key of my box, as I was not allowed to see my things, so I ran to the door to tell the neighbours. The moment the box was opened, Mrs. Rowley fell back, and pretended to go into a fit. I looked at her instead of the box. I turned round, saw the fork, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! you wicked woman."</p>

On the 26th of January I hired a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Castle-street, Strand—it stopped in Picket-street—I went to the Black Horse and took a glass of stout—I then came and asked the driver to allow me to drive—he said he would—I went on the box, with my cloak on—it was rather heavy—I got down, and James Sermon, the driver, got down, and I put my cloak into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I drove up to the Angel Inn, and asked the driver what his fare was—he said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—I then looked, and my cloak was gone—I gave him in charge, and gave information to the policeman, who traced out the party, and Sermon was discharged.</p>

            : in consequence of what she told me, I went into the two pair of stairs bed room; I charged her with taking copper money out of the drawer; the drawer was full; she replied she had not taking any copper, and that the child had often told lies of her before; I asked her to shew me her pockets; she turned them inside out, there were between three and four pennyworth of halfpence, nothing like the quantity I expected to find.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your little girl in the room at the time. - A. Yes, and my wife; I saw a tin box, I asked her if that belonged to her; she said it did, it laid on the top of the bed. I searched that bed I found nothing there; I searched a turnup bed in the same room there I found the copper on the top of it, in a dirty handkerchief, apparently thrown just thrown in.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in copper. - A. Six shillings and fivepence three farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner claim that handkerchief. - A. She did not claim it; she did not deny taking the copper money; after I found it I asked her if she was not ashamed of taking it, and how she could say she had not taken it when the child was looking at her; she made no answer to that; I asked the prisoner to give me leave to search her lodgings; the officer brought some things.</p>
               <p>Q. We cannot enter into that business because they were taken at a different time - you said the drawer was full of halfpence, what sized drawer was it. - A. It was a large wide drawer full of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not tell whether the bulk was less or not. - A. We could not because there were so many in it.</p>

The prisoner Jones was several years in our employ; Britten was a stranger; we discharged Jones early in July, and in about a week I discovered that we had been robbed of ninety bags of nails - I found Jones standing in Fish-street, took him to our warehouse, and gave him in charge, and begged him to make a full discovery of the robbery, that I might discover the receiver; Britten and Griffiths were taken the same day: I was present on the 11th of July, when eight bags of nails were found in Griffiths' shop; the marks on the bags had been rubbed over with ink; some were marked B and B D, in pitch - they contained new nails, but had been cut open, and some taken out; they were precisely the nails we deal in - one bag is marked B D in pitch, and that I can distinctly identify, though attempts have been made to obliterate it; the pitch still remains - the ink is washed out. Griffiths keeps an old iron and rag shop - he said if the nails were mine I was welcome to them - that he had bought them several months ago. - The quantity found are worth 14l. or 15l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are any of them your own manufacture? A. No; I do not know the maker. I send out perhaps twenty bags in a year; they were in the corner of Griffiths' shop, covered with a quantity of rags; he did not tell me of whom he bought them - I did not ask.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. I believe Jones used to lock up your warehouse, and deliver the keys to the clerks? A. He had possession of the warehouse two hours after I left, and used to take the keys to a neighbour.</p>
               <p>JOHN DYER. I am in partnership with Mr. Browne. Jones had the <rs id="t18260914-38-deflabel218" type="occupation">entire care of the warehouse</rs>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Bolton, spice-merchant, of Little Eastcheap, nearly opposite the prosecutors' warehouse. About the end of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw Britten come out of the warehouse, with a heavy bag on his shoulder; Jones accompanied him to the door, and shut it after him. I did not give information till after they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You did not see the contents of the bag? A. No. I am certain of them both.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Britten afterwards? A. I saw him pass the prosecutors' door two or three times after, but he never went in - it was just break of day. I mentioned the circumstance to my master. The bag was like those produced.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with a search-warrant to Griffiths' house, at the corner of George-yard, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel; Fortune and Dalton were with me - I found Griffiths standing in the street- I called him in, and said we had a warrant to search for nails. I left Fortune and Dalten there while I went to take Britten - I saw him come out of a public-house, down from Osborne-street, towards Griffiths' house - he was fifty or sixty yards from the house; I told him I wanted him about some nails found at Griffiths' - he said he knew nothing about any nails; I took him to Griffiths'. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140029"></xptr>found eight bags and a half of nails, about 2cwt. in each bag - a few were exposed for sale in a saucepan lid: they appeared to be a sample of those in the bag. Ink had been rubbed over the marks on the bags, but we could discover some pitch marks with the letters B D, after clearing away the ink. Griffiths said, "If they belong to the gentlemen take them away, and there will be an end of it;" there was a good deal of old iron and old nails in his shop, but all these nails were new. While I was locking Griffiths up, he told me he bought the nails of Britten. The bags of nails were covered with rags, except the half bag, which was under the window. Two days afterwards I found ten more bags at Wiggens' sale-rooms.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You knew Britten before? A. Yes - he worked as a porter, and lived in Wentworth-street. I am sure Griffiths said,"Take them, and there will be an end of them;" I said,"No, you and the nails must go before the Magistrate" - Mr. Browne was present; I cannot say whether the nails in the saucepan lid caught his eye - he inspected them after we found the bags. I call the bags concealed; they were behind the counter, with rags over them.</p>

On Monday, the 18th of April, I left home about half-past ten o'clock in the evening—I left nobody in the lower part of the house—the doors were locked, the windows down, and the shutters closed, but not fastened—I went to a neighbour's, two or three doors from my house; and about half-past eleven o'clock, Michael Phillips called me from my neighbour's, and brought my bonnet in his hand—I went back with him, and found my shutters open, and the window up—I put my hand in at the window, and missed the property from the table; it had laid there exposed for sale—the table was close to the window—I missed prints and thirty-four yards of merino a shawl, two handkerchiefs, two pairs of drawers, and different articles—I went to Aldgate watch-house—Three-tun-alley, is not far from my house—I went and listened at the door of a house there—I have known Hyams by the name of Mitchell from his youth—I heard nobody's voice that I knew when I listened—I heard a person say, "There are gown pieces;" and I immedi<lb></lb>ately left, and went to Mr. Phillip's for assistance, and he ran to the police—the door of the house I listened at was open—I do not know how many voices there were—I afterwards saw Hyams come out of the house and go on—I do not know whether he saw me—he walked a-pace—I called to Phillips for assistance, and said, "There goes Mitchell!" which is the name I knew him by.</p>

On the 18th of December these articles were stolen from one corner of the parlour: I had seen them the afternoon before in the box; the prisoner lodged with me - this letter is in his own hand-writing- (read.)</p>
               <p>Newgate, December 22, 1828.</p>
               <p>DEAR FRIEND, - I take this opportunity of sending you these few lines, to see if you will he so good as to send me the small sum of money that is coming to me from Bembridge, and to send me my clean shirt; if you speak to Mrs. Weston to give you the shirt, not the apron nor the other - please to let some of the shopmates come to see me, and bring me them; I do not like the place I am in, but I have got justly what I deserve - you know the reason I took the box, was that I could not get it no other way; the reason I did not give it you when you asked the office-man what time it would go, and he told me it went off at six o'clock in the morning; I have not got a penny to buy paper to write to my parents - any one coming to see me must be my father or my brothers; they will be admitted from ten till two o'clock any day but Sunday. Your's, most, &amp;c. ANDREW CALDWELL.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he charged me with stealing it he said he would let me off, and then he said he would transport me; so I thought, when I came here, if I confessed he would send me the money, and would forgive me.</p>

I missed the box on the morning of the 18th; I left the house on the evening before, not above ten minutes - the prisoner was in the back parlour: I borrowed his key to get in - when I came back his light was out; he did not appear to be there: I spoke to the prisoner about it, but he was the only person who was there; on Wednesday evening we found the box at Piccadilly.</p>

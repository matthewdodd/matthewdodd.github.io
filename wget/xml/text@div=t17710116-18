On December 21, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went out to the other end of the town. I returned again about twelve. I left the prisoner's wife in the parlour. She had an apartment in the yard backwards. Being at my house, he lodged with her; he is a cabinet-maker. He worked for me at the time. The first thing I missed, was a bed and two pictures. I know the bed, the bolster, and pillow, the sheets and counterpane, and two blankets, and two pictures were altogether. They were goods for sale. Then I went into the parlour; there I missed all the pictures, which were six, and a glass. Then I went into the yard backwards, into one of the rooms they lodged in, where my chest was. It was a large chest; there was linen and all my cloaths, four or five coats, as many waistcoats, as many breeches, five or six shirts, some stockings, a pair of sheets; the chest was took away and all the things. The hat, and buckles, and plate, were in a large trunk; my hat and wig, a chest three foot six inches long; my pumps were in the lining of a great coat found upon the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the watch, and key, and plate?</p>
               <p>Morgan. The plate was locked in a drawer in the shop; the buckles were gone from a room in the yard; they were locked up in the chest; my watch laid upon the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the prisoner and his wife?</p>
               <p>Morgan. She was in the parlour when I went out; they were both gone when I came home again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you think they stole your things?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I suspected them. I found them out on the twenty-second; the next day he had conveyed the things on board a ship. He was in Darkhouse Lane, at a public house with his wife, I took them up, and found the things on board a ship; I believe it was the Peggy.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the things were gone on board a ship?</p>
               <p>Morgan. An acquaintance of mine in Rosemary Lane informed me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she lie?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Just by the Tower wharf; I went do board her, and found a chest there; the captain went with us, and informed us where the prisoner was; we took them both up, and went to the Mansion-house; we attended at the Mansion-house on the Monday following; then we went to Justice Fielding; he was committed to the New Prison, and his wife acquitted; we found the plate and buckles; we found this hat upon the prisoner, he was wearing it, he had a shirt on too; he had a fair of my cloaths besides, and a pair of stockings; I cannot be sure whether he had the pumps on or not; he had one pair of buckles on, and one knee buckle; he had lost the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the chest? was the bed?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No, that was done up in a covering, and the bolster and part of the sheets; a pair of sheets were on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you found the sconce glass?</p>
               <p>Morgan. On board the ship, the glazed prints were packed loose, I believe there was three or four suits of cloaths in the chest; five or six shirts; a pair of sheets; some stockings; most of the plate was found upon the prisoner's wife; the punch ladle was found upon the prisoner; the rest of the plate the wife had in her pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any claim to these things?</p>
               <p>Morgan. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I never knew him before he came to me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160029"></xptr>Q. Had he been recommended to you?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I had a sort of a recommendation with him from Newcastle.</p>
               <p>Q. This ship was going to Newcastle; were the things all yours?</p>
               <p>Morgan. The things were all my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe him any money?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever borrow any money of him?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I borrowed two shillings once of his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sign any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Morgan. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was out of work. I went to seek a job. I met with this man in Whitechapel. I asked him for a job. Next day he shewed me his shop. He was a new beginner. He said, if I would come to him, I should want for no encouragement. I went the day after, and he would not be easy without I would bring my wife, and live in the house. He said, I should have any thing necessary belonging to the house; I being a stranger in London, thought it a pretty opportunity. I went to work for him, my wife laid all her things in pawn to find us in victuals, in the mean time. I worked for him six weeks, and never received a farthing from him during the time; I asked him several times for six pence or a shilling; he never would give it me, to get her any thing to nourish her. He went one day to buy some wood to set me to work. There were some deals and seneers. He said, if I would fetch them seneers out of the yard, he would give me a guinea: he said, they would never be missed. He said, I should want for nothing, if I would fetch them. I would not. He said, I should repent it. I did not know how to get my money. He said, he would leave my wife and I in the house while he went into the country. He said, if he could get a place in the country, I might sell the goods, and pay him the money. I bought these things, the bed and bedstead, six chairs and the pictures. I agreed to pay him half a guinea a week. He came one day to me, and asked me if I would have a suit of cloaths. He said, he had a new suit a making; that I might go, and if they would fit me, I should have them, and pay him a shilling a week. I went; the cloaths would not fit me; the cloaths were made and brought home; people were sending their bills, and he was upon the shifting order, to go into the country. I thought it proper to move these things; I thought he was going to leave me.</p>
               <p>Q. To the prosecutor. How much wages did you owe him at this time?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Williams. No; he called at my house on the twenty-first of December, and left word, he had been almost ruined by one of his men, and desired I would enquire if this man had taken any place to go to Newcastle. Capt. White came, and told me, his hands had been pressed, that prevented his going sooner. I asked, if he had a man and his wife, with some goods; he said, yes, and described them. I sent Mr. Morgan word, that I believed the goods were on board Capt. White's ship, off the Tower, Mr. Morgan said, There are my goods in the hold. I told Capt. White how the affair was; he said he was to have two guineas for his passage. He took us to Darkhouse lane, where the prisoner and his wife were drinking; Mr. Morgan gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man say for himself?</p>

               <p>Q. I would ask you, whether this Cellar you rent of him communicates with the other Part of the House?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Yes, Sometimes I go in one Way, sometimes another.</p>

               <p>Skelton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of the House being broke open? When was it broke open?</p>
               <p>Skelton. As near as I can guess about a Month ago.</p>

               <p>Skelton. The Cellar was broke open.</p>

               <p>Skelton. They broke the Hasp of it, they endeavour'd at the Staple, and they could not.</p>
               <p>Q. What Hasp do you mean?</p>
               <p>Skelton. The Hasp that goes over the Lock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find it in this Manner?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Between Six and Seven in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shut it yourself?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark when you found it in that Manner in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Yes. I was going to Market.</p>
               <p>Q. What Market?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Spitalfields Market. We have a Rag-Shop in our Cellar, and opposite to that we keep a Green Shop, facing the Cellar.</p>

               <p>Skelton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it stand wide open, or only loos'd? Did you find it so loose that any Body might enter it?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Skelton. I believe near a hundred Weight of fine Linnen Rags.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Skelton. I went to my Wife and said we are robb'd, we are ruin'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Missing these Things, what did you do?</p>
               <p>Skelton. I did all that lay in my Power. I had my Rags cried; but could find nothing of them; I went all up and down our Way to put a Stop to the buying of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say to the young Boy, Mayson?</p>
               <p>Skelton. I was not there when he had done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the Rags?</p>
               <p>Skelton. In a Room up one Pair of Stairs, by the Red Cow in Church-Lane, I found the Persons that stole them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170023"></xptr>Skelton. I said, what did you do with my Rags? You were seen to go over Tower-Hill this Morning betimes. No, says one, do you think that I have them?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing to say to either of the Prisoners in Relation to these Rags?</p>
               <p>Skelton. My Lord, they both sold them, and there is now one in Court that bought them. One Stephens.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after did you find them at Stephen's ?</p>
               <p>Skelton. On Christmas Day in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Stephens?</p>
               <p>Skelton. He buys Rags.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were the same you lost?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Please you my Lord as near as I can guess they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding them there what did you say to Mr. Stephens?</p>
               <p>Skelton. I let him know I believ'd they were mine. But Mr. Stephens said, you need not look over them, for I have bought them. Wherefore the Prisoners were taken up on this Occasion.

               <p>Stephens. The Woman said, she had got some Rags; I said, where do you use to sell them? and they said they sold them where they could have ready Money. They were half a Hundred and 12 lb. neat Weight. While I was gone up Stairs the Woman the Prisoner went out, as she said, to speak to her Master, to know whether he would take the Money.</p>

               <p>Stephens. They took the Money and went away, and I thought no more of it. But on Christmas Day Mr. Skelton came to my House with a Search-Warrant.</p>

             went down: I gave him the Bag, and he fill'd it about three parts full.</p>
               <p>Q. What Age is he?</p>
               <p>Bullock. He is between 16 and 17.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he went down and fill'd the Bag and brought it up to you?</p>
               <p>Bullock. Yes. And I shov'd the Door too, and carry'd the Bag home to Red-Cow-Ally.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did you carry this?</p>
               <p>Bullock. Between the Hours of One and Two; and when we came back again, before Two o'Clock, he fill'd the Bag as before. We both went back and down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he fill the Bag?</p>
               <p>Bullock. Yes, my Lord, about three parts full, and brought it to me up Stairs again, and we shut the Door too: With that, my Lord, we went home to my own Room with the Rags. At Six o'Clock I set out from my own Room and went down into the Coal-Yard, to my Mother's Room, and I desir'd my Wife and my own Sister to go with the Rags: My Wife took the Rags in my Apron herself: I put the Bag full upon Mayson's Head and the Remainder in my Apron my Wife took.</p>
               <p>Q. And where did they carry them?</p>
               <p>Bullock. To a Shop in St. Giles's, and they brought me Word, if I would take 2 d. 1/4 the Pound the Man would buy them. The Man where I took them from, gave 3 d. the Pound for them. I gave the Word, they should bring me so and so: With that they brought me 12 s. and 6 d. And as my poor Mother was in Want I gave her the odd 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had Mayson of the Money?</p>
               <p>Bullock. Six Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time were they sold?</p>
               <p>Bullock. About Nine o'Clock.</p>

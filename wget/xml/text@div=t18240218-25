I observed the bars of the cellar window broken open - they were safe the morning before, as I had ordered the prisoner to cover them with straw to prevent the pipes from freezing - the back of the cellar door was also forced open.

            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 24th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me in Goswell-street, with a bundle, I asked what he was carrying - he said, butter. I took him into a public-house, and asked him how he came by it - he said his brother-in-law, who lived near Cambridge-heath, gave it to him - he did not know the name of the street, or number of the house, but his name was Chiswick; that his brother-in-law had left Mr. Tucker, his master, about a fortnight ago, and he gave him a tub of butter, a cask of ale, and a sack of coke. I locked him up, and at eleven o'clock went to him - he said,</p>
               <p>"Now I will tell you the truth," and said voluntarily, that if I would go to Tipple's, I should hear all about it, that he got it from there. I found some pieces of gum among the butter, which was in a tin dish.</p>

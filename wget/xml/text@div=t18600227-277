                  <hi rend="italic">It appeared from the evidence in this case, that the girl was not taken or enticed from her home by the prisoner; but that being out, she accidentally met him, and then went with him to the theatre, and from there to a coffee-house, where they passed the night.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">intimated that there was great difficulty in saying whether these facts would support the indictment; the meaning of the words,"taking out of the possession of the parents," implied a renunciation of her home, and could hardly refer to a temporary absence with an intention of returning.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that even such a temporary taking away, would be an abduction; the offence of abduction did not depend upon time or distance, but consisted in the withdrawing of the child from the possession of the parent; he referred to the cases of Reg. v. Ames, and Reg. v. Manktelow, in the latter of which it was held that although the girl voluntarily met the man, and went with him, yet the case came within the statute.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">entertained no doubt upon that point, but here the difficulty was whether the taking away was such a removal from the possession of the parent, as would satisfy the statute: whether in fact it was a taking away with an intent that she should not return.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called the attention of the Court to the facts of the case of Reg. v Ames, which he contended were entirely different from those in the present case.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after consulting with the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi>, <hi rend="italic">considered it best to take the opinion of the Jury upon the facts, and reserve the case for the consideration of the Court of Appeal. The Jury, in answer to the queries submitted to them by the learned Judge, found, first, that in taking away the girl, the defendant knew it was against the will of the parents; and secondly, that his intention was merely that she should remain from her home for the night, and then that she should return to her parents.</hi>

On the 3d of March, finding he did not suit me, I gave him notice to leave; he staid in the shop sometime. While I was serving a customer, I saw him go down stairs with a parcel in his hand; when I had done, I asked him what it was? he said it was his old shirt - I took him down stairs with me. He went to an oil cupboard, and pulled out a dirty shirt of his own; I asked if he had left any thing else there, he said, No - I looked and found a new shawl there - I asked how he came to put it there, he said, he intended to pay me for it, and offered me a 1l. note for it; it was not worth above 10s.; I refused it, and sent for a constable, who came. I asked him if he had any thing else in his box belonging to me? he said, I might look. We went up with him, and found the articles stated in the indictment there, which have my private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. The cupboard was open; if shopmen take a fancy to things they always mention it, and pay for them before they take them.</p>

               <p>Q. Last Saturday you had been to Isleworth - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the King's Arms public house in that parish - A. Yes, I was in company with the man that I worked with; after I had been there some time I saw the prisoner; I went away at the same time with him. Nothing happened till we came to the Rails End, then he went his way and I went my way; in less than a quarter of an hour I heard a voice crying halloo! I answered; when I came a little further, he said come here; when I came up to him he was sitting down and his hat was over his eyes; I asked him what he wanted I lifted the hat over his eyes to see who he was; it fell down by his side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it down by his side or did it fall down. - A. I put it down by the side of him; he got up with vengeance to strike me; I was afraid, and started, and just below the boat house he knocked me down; that is fifty yards from the place; there he used me very ill and knocked me down; and robbed me of my watch; I got up and followed him to get my watch; he knocked me down again; I got up again, ran after him thinking to get my watch; down he knocked me again; he started and came to the Campsot, then he knocked me down again.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did he knock you down. - A. I cannot say. it was a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this. - A. Last Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those marks on your face from the blows that he gave you. - A. Yes; he knocked me down. I laid hold of the pallisades or else he would have thrown me into the Thames.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after he had taken your watch. - A. Yes. I followed him and when he came to the meadows he knocked me down; I begged for mercy, I said do not kill me. I halloaed out murder for assistance; he fixed me down, he clapped his hands on the back of my neck and pushed me down, and he put his knee into my loins: it was enough to squeeze me all to pieces. Just after that a gentlemen coming from Richmond to Iseworth came to my assistance; the prisoner made off; we attempted to pursue him but he got away from us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. What time was it you went to the public house. - A. Just before eight o'clock; I stopped till after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you drink in the course of that time. - A. I cannot tell you exactly. There were three of us in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not half a dozen pots of beer. - A. No; it might be four.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for all the beer. - A. We paid between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you obliged to pay for a pot against your inclination. - A. No, I was not against my inclination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the landlord compel you to pay for a pot of beer when the reckoning was settled.</p>
               <p>Court. Why do not you answer the question. - A. A pot of beer was brought and I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. It comes to that at last that you was obliged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010014"></xptr>to pay for it. - A. I did pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed the prisoner to Rails End. - A. That was my way home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Rails End, did you not say he had used you very ill in making you pay for a pot of beer. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you take his hat and tear it about and strike him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never heard of any such a thing as a reward for a person convicted of a highway robbery - A. I have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you expect to get, answer the question - How much do you expect to get if you convict the prisoner. - A. Forty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. When he kneeled upon you why did not you resist, you are as strong a man as him. - A. He is a great deal stronger than I.</p>
               <p>SEDDON BAMFORD. - Mr. Adolphus. At twelve o'clock at night were you coming from Richmond to Isleworth. - A. As near as I can recollect I was in a meadow going from the bridge towards the Rails End Ferry; about the middle of the meadow, as near as I can recollect, I heard some desperate blows and cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of night was it. - A.It might be twelve o'clock. I ran towards the place, in my way there stood a tree; I retired behind that tree for a few seconds to see whether there was a number of them or not; I could see nobody standing up, I saw something down in the meadow, it appeared dark and looked about this high (witness describing); then I saw a man get up and stand straight up, whether it was my voice that occasioned his getting up I cannot say; then he stooped and ran stooping away; I ran and halloed murder; as I ran I saw the prosecutor getting up and he ran the same way that the man run: I lost sight of the person that was running away; I could not possibly swear to the person of the prisoner. I ran towards a farm yard in search of the person of the prisoner; I could not find him; I returned back to see if I could find him any where in the meadow; the prosecutor came up to me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What state did he appear to be in. - A. He was in a very bad state, he could hardly walk; I ordered him to take hold of my arm and support himself; I advised him to go back with me to Isleworth. When we came to a light in the town I saw a great deal of blood about him and his eye knocked up.</p>
               <p>Court. The man that you had seen run away you do not know whether it was the prisoner or not. - A. I do not.</p>

            . - Mr. Adolphus. You are the constable of Iseworth. - A. Yes; I was sent for on Sunday morning to go to the Rails End; when I came there I saw Stovell, he told me he had been robbed of his watch last night and had been very much abused; he had the appearance of that; I asked him who did it; he pointed to the house where the prisoner lived; I went to the prisoner's house; his wife denied my searching the house; after being there about two hours, I found him in the middle room where two poor people lodged; he was hid; the bed clothes were put close up at one end of the room; I asked the woman what was there; she said, only the bed and the clothes. Another constable present, he put the clothes down and saw the prisoner's feet; I called a soldier, who assisted us; we secured the prisoner; I told the other men to hold him while I looked to see if I could find any bloody clothes or the watch; I found nothing in that room; I searched the garret, between the bed and the sacking, I found this shirt. I perceived there was blood upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the watch. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the prisoner what was the cause of your apprehending him. - A.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, there were me and my two comrades that were working together; we went into the King's Arms at Isleworth, to pay for beer that we had in the week; after we had been drinking there about an hour, in came the prosecutor and forced himself into our company; we had three pots of beer during the time he was in our company; as we were all going out of doors, my partner said here is four of us to drink three pots of beer, I think this man has a right to be a pot as he has been drinking part of ours; he said he would not, he had no money the landlord came up and said to him you owe me some money for tea and beer you had in the morning; the prosecutor said he would not pay him; I said he has been drinking our beer, we want him to be a pot and he will not; the landlord locked the door and kept us all in till such time the man had paid for what he had in the morning; then my prosecutor said is the pot of beer to come in; I said, yes; he said send it in, I will pay for it; the pot of beer was brought in and all four of us drank it up; then the door was opened and all of us went out; I wished one of my neighbour's good night, he went away home; my wife, and myself, and the other mate that was at work with me, we went down the street together. In the middle of the street I wished him good night. The prosecutor still kept following us, saying that we were a parcel of good for nothing rascals to impose upon him to make him pay for a pot of beer; I said my friend the pot of beer is settled for, drop it; there is no further to say about it; I said my friend the best place for you is on board a man of war; he came up and gave me a thump on my head and knocked me down in the road, I got up, pulled off my jacket and he and I fell a boxing; we were all in liquor. With the blood that came from my nose and from his head, that is the reason of my shirt being in the condition it is in; the prosecutor said he had enough; I picked up my jacket, my wife and I came home; coming along the road he followed us very sharp, and at the corner of a public house I bid him good night; I said good night my friend, he made no answer; I said to my wife go in doors, I must do my occasions; I set down by the corner of the wall, to do my business; in the mean time I heard somebody on the other side of the bridge halloo out halloa; I answered him; the prosecutor came back and says halloo; he came up to me and lifted up my hat; he put it down;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010015"></xptr>he took the hat afterwards and ran away with it; I says to him as he was going over the bridge, my friend you have got my hat; he said he had not; as soon as I had buttoned up my small clothes, I pursued him; he dropped the hat, I picked it up and returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Had you been drinking any liquor with the prisoner - A. Yes; I drank some of his and he drank some of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that day. - A. I had been up to Mr. Munn's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive your wages - A. Yes, I received eleven shillings and tenpence; I put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your money in your pocket when he took your watch away - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any of your money away - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch - A. No.</p>

Yes, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; I met the prosecutor with a hat upon his head and a hat in his hand, I never spoke to him; I met the prisoner upon the bridge without his hat, he was buttoning his breeches up; I spoke to him, I said my friend where are you going this dead hour of the night without a hat; he said that man had taken his hat off his head, as he was sitting in the corner easing himself; the prosecutor dropped the hat, and the prisoner went and picked it up; I persuaded the prisoner to go home and go to bed, as it was a drunken affair among themselves.</p>
               <p>Court. You know them both - A. Yes, by sight; the prosecutor is a sawyer, and the prisoner is a <rs id="t18080601-14-deflabel80" type="occupation">gardener</rs>

               <p>Confine yourself to what you know of Jervais and Dowst? - On Saturday, the 19th of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, Jervais, Dowst and I went to the White Horse, at Old Ford, there we staid till about six o'clock at night; Jervais, Dowst, and I, and three more set off for London; when we got over London-bridge, we met Jervais's father and mother, and he turned back with them, and Dowst and I kept on toward Mitcham; going along, we agreed to rob the prosecutor's ground; we went to the gate at the lower end of the ground, and went in; we jumped over the sewer, and took up four pieces, each of us two, and carried them towards the ditch, and went round the field; we threw four pieces over, and then jumped over ourselves; we carried them two fields off, and hid them in some bushes; we agreed to bring them to London on Sunday night; on the Monday morning we went to the place where we had hid them; one piece I put round my body, and carried a piece in a handkerchief; Dowst took one, and we left one piece in another place; we went to the White Horse, at Old Ford, and told the rest they asked, if they were to be in; I said, I supposed they must be in, as they were in the other; at night, Jervais, and I and another, went and took the piece we had left, and set off towards London; we did not see Dowst any more till after we were taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are the same Sibery that was here the other day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The same man that stated yourself to be a thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And to have drawn in every body that ever you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And in short, that you should not have stated this, but that you expected to be hanged yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(Jervais and Dowst did not say any thing in their defence.)</p>
               <p>There being no evidence to affect the other prisoners, they were not put upon their defence.</p>
               <p>Dowst called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

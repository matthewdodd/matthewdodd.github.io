                  </hi>. About a year ago I came from Baltimore, and was servant to Mr. Levy, a bootmaker, at 19, Old Montagu Street—about seven months ago Mr. Levy went to lodge at Artillery Passage, and I went with him—about five months ago I left his service, and went into the prisoner's service at 19, Old Montagu Street—he is a tailor—I remained there till the fire happened—that was on 24th December, the day before Christmas Day—I slept in the basement, there is a kitchen there—there are two rooms on a floor—on the ground-floor there is a shop and parlour, on the first-floor is a front room where there was a sofa where the prisoner used to sleep, and a back room, a bedroom, where the prisoner's daughter used to sleep—she is a girl of about 14, and a Miss Moss, a neighbour's daughter, used to sleep with her—on the second-floor were the workrooms, the back room was where the machine was—there were no rooms above—on the 24th at 1 o'clock the prisoner's daughter and Miss Moss went to Stratford to see some friends—I was in her bedroom that morning and attended to it, the bed was made, and the room left all right—there was some paraffin in the house, in an ordinary pint bottle—I had bought a pint about a fortnight before, it was used for a night lamp in the daughter's room—it was kept underneath the dressing-table in the bedroom—I saw it there that day—I am sure it was not on the mantel-piece—the door of that room was always kept locked—I used to lock it, and the key was kept downstairs in a table-drawer in the kitchen—there was no fire in the bedroom that day, we never had a fire there—I was in the workroom that afternoon—there was a coke fire in the grate there—there were three workmen at work there that day—near about 3 o'clock the prisoner told me to put on my things and take some work to the shops—there were two bundles in the workshop—one was for Mr. Keen, of London Wall, and the other for Mr. Croft, of Shepherdess Walk, City Road—the workmen all left at 3.30—Morris was the last one to leave—the prisoner went out before him, directly he had told me to take the work to the shops—I was the last in the house—I put on my things, and took the bundles—I left no one in the house—it was 3.45 when I left—I had a key of the street door—it closes on the latch by slamming it—I took the key with me to let myself in when I returned—I delivered the bundles at Mr. Keen's and Mr. Croft's, and returned to the house after 6 o'clock—I found there had been a fire, and the engines and firemen were there—I kept my key in my pocket, and afterwards gave it up to the police—this is it (<hi rend="italic">two keys produced</hi>)—the prisoner used to have the other key sometimes, and sometimes his mother-in-law, Mrs. Kruntz, had it—she had it that day—she</p>

               <p>lives at 16, Finch Street, Spitalfields, not far off—I could walk there in three minutes—she did not live at our house—she used to bring her husband's tea—he is a tailor, and worked for the prisoner—I know she had the key that day, because after the fire the firemen asked Mr. Marks for the key, and he went to his mother, and took it, and gave it to the fireman—that was after 9 o'clock that night—the daughter came home after 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner left the house before'me with a man named Friedenberg—I had bought paraffin before this—we use it to the machine mixed with oil—that was what I bought it for, and for the night lamp—I was not kept at the places where I delivered the goods—I was not tied to time—I did not hurry myself—I had not used the bottle for a couple of nights—the lamp had been supplied from the pint of paraffin for a fortnight—it is a very small lamp—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was used every night when I turned off the gas at the meter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at 17, Old Montagu Street, next door to the prisoner—on the evening of 24th December, about 5.40, I heard an alarm of fire—I went into the street and saw fire and smoke coming from the second-floor front room window of No. 19, and the door was wide open—I went in and went upstairs to the second-floor front room; I found fire on and over and under the table—the window was open—there was no fire in any other part of the room; the table itself was on fire; there was more smoke than blaze—there was no fire in the grate—I then came down to the first-floor landing and went into the front room; the door was open—there was a couch in the room—I found an old lady there, she is outside now, she might be between 50 and 60 years of age; I think she had on a cap or kind of bonnet—she was in a stooping position; what she was doing I could not discern; there was no light in the room—I told her to come out, as the place was on fire—she said something in reference to a child, in consequence of that I felt round the room as far as I could, there was no child there—I had placed the woman towards the door near the staircase, and I then caught hold of her and carried her downstairs and into a neighbour's house opposite—she was no doubt able to walk, but she might have been confused—before I carried her down I noticed that the light was beginning to show through the floor where the gaspipe was—I returned to the house, hearing of an old man being in the back room—I went upstairs again and went into the second-floor back room; the door was locked; I burst it open—there was no fire there—as I came downstairs there was a policeman at the door—I then went to my own house and got on to the roof to look after my own property—some short time afterwards the fire was put out—about half an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner and Mr. Moss in the street between Nos. 17 and 19—Mr. Moss tapped the prisoner on the shoulder and said "You must thank Mr. Walton for saving the old lady"—the prisoner thanked me and asked me to have a glass of something to drink—we went to the corner house at the bottom of the street and had a</p>

Benton producing it at the same time—he said "I know nothing of it"—I then said I should like to see Mr. Frieden<lb></lb>berg—he said "I will take you to where he lives, in the Commercial Road"—we went in that direction, and I noticed a man following us close behind, and I said to the prisoner "Who is this man following us?"—he said "That is Mr. Friedenberg"—he turned round to look at him—I said to him "Is your name Friedenberg?"—he said "Yes"—the prisoner said something to him in a language I did not understand, and I said "What you say, say in English"—the prisoner said "Do you understand German?"—I said "Yes, a little"—I then said to Friedenberg "Did you on 24th December, either day or night, meet Marks in the Commercial Road by appointment?"—he said "No, I did not, I was at Mr. Marks's between three and four, and left there with him; we went to Webb's public-house in High Street; we had a walk round, and came by his house just before 5.30; went into the comer public-house nearly opposite his, and I left him there"—the prisoner said nothing to that—Friedenberg then walked away—the prisoner seemed to become very excited and frightened, and said "I must have some brandy"—I said very well; and he went into the Duke of York in Martel Street, Commer<lb></lb>cial Road—he was in there about a minute or so—he then pulled the door open, and said "Come here, I want to speak to you privately; will you have anything to drink?"—I said, "No, thank you, I don't care for it"—he then said in a low voice "Well, it won't do you any good to put me in prison; you might as well have 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for yourself"—I said "Is that what you wish to speak to me about?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I have an appointment with Sergeant Thick, you had better speak to him"—he then accompanied me, and I met Sergeant Thick—I said "Sergeant Thick, this man wishes to speak to you, or say something to you"—Thick said "What is it?"—prisoner said "Well, you don't want to put me in prison; I will give you and your mate 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and you can keep the darkey and Friedenberg out of the way, and you can throw that bit of stuff away"—that</p>

                  </hi>. I am the assessor to the Staffordshire Fire Insurance Company an 1 to Fire insurance companies generally—I took this statement from the prisoner—I read it over to him and he said it was correct. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Fire happened Christmas Eve; no one in the house. I had been to work until the afternoon. The workpeople were also there. My servant took the work to the shops; she is a South African, had been with me about six months. She was brought over by a man, a bootmaker, who used to live at my place. I have been a tenant of the house four years. I left the house after 3, between 3 and 4 o'clock, on Christmas Eve. I left the girl there. She took work to Mr. Keen, 51, London Wall, and to Mr. Croft, Shepherdess Walk, City Road. The work was packed up before I left, ready for the girl to take away. The first I heard of the fire was find<lb></lb>ing the fire-engines there after 6 o'clock. The girl had the key of the door. I had been to several places to buy things; at a goldsmith's in Goulston Street; his name, I think, is Jacobs. I am informed the fire happened about half an hour before I came back; there was gas in every room in the house. I turned the gas off at the meter every night, and then my child, 14 years old, had a night-light; for since my wife died she was so timid. The child was at Stratford at the time. Miss Moss sleeps with my child for company. I sleep on a made-up bed on the sofa in the sitting-room on the first floor. My tenant left about a fortnight before the fire; he gave me notice. I can't give any idea as to the cause of the fire. All was safe when I left. The girl had to dress herself and then go with the work; she had no necessity to have asked. She sleeps in the kitchen. The fire had not reached the kitchen or shop and parlour, but was confined to the work-room on the top of the house. I am not able to form any opinion as to which floor the fire began on.") I have had experience in estimating claims—I cannot say that I examined these goods—I looked over them—speaking generally, I agree with the evidence of Mr. Armstead as to value—I re<lb></lb>member some observations being made about the key, and the girl Robinson made a statement about it—the prisoner said there was a second key, and when asked where it was he said it was with his mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house decorator, of Herbert Villa, Cooper Road, Acton—the prisoner worked for me—on 22nd October my family consisted of myself, my wife, my daughter Ada, and four other children, the youngest was a baby—Ada was 10 years of age; she would have been 11 on 10th December next—on 22nd October I and my wife went out at 11.30, taking the baby with us, and leaving the other children at home—before we left I asked the prisoner to have an eye to the place, to wait with the children till we came home, and to light the gas—he said he would do so—I am not certain whether we went out by the front door; we generally go out the back way—the side door was open—we returned about 6.30 at night—there was no light in the house—we went in at the front door; I let myself in by a latch key—I proceeded to the kitchen, and called for the prisoner and for the children—I got no answer—I then went to the kitchen door; I found it locked—the key was on the outside—I turned the key, and opened the door—when I got into the kitchen I found my child Ada lying on her back before the fireplace dead, with a handkerchief over her face—I went over the way to Mr. Lessingham's, a friend of mine, and got some matches, and came back and lit the gas—I then found my child lying perfectly straight, with the handkerchief over her face; the legs were towards the door, straight out; her arms by her side, and her throat cut—the police were sent for—nothing was moved out of its place till the police came—I found that the side door was fastened on the inside with a bolt, and the back door the same—I went over the house directly I had lighted the gas—I found the door of the back bedroom on the first floor forced; I had left it locked, and my wife had taken the key—there was a box there unlocked, and there was a till inside the box; the till had been forced by a screwdriver of mine—I had sold a house shortly before this, and had received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I had told my wife that fact in the prisoner's presence; he knew all</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had been in my employment about six months—during the time he was in my house he conducted himself well—he had never been left with the children before—I do not remember mentioning to any one except my wife that I was going out for the day, or that I was going to carry the cheque with me to Norwood—I did not carry it with me, I changed it and carried the money—the side door of my house was generally open—the bedroom door was a strong door, it appeared to have been broken with considerable force; I know that the lock did not go in far, after we came to examine it—I know that the prisoner is paralysed on one side—he is not a weakly man, he is as strong as any other man that I had working for me—I lost a glaziers diamond—I was asked before the Magistrate if I knew any one answering the description of "a man, apparently a working man, no moustache, only beard, black coat, waistcoat and trousers pepper-and-salt tweed, and hard felt hat;" I believe they have some one outside answering that de<lb></lb>scription, but I did not know any one at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Haviland Villas, Acton—about 20 minutes to seven on Friday, 22nd October, went to Mr. Shepherd's house—I went into the kitchen and found the little girl Ada lying on the hearth rug on her back—I examined her, she was dead—I found a wound on the left side of the throat, apparently a stab, it appeared to go through to the right side, and penetrate slightly—that wound produced death—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with a stab of this knife; it cut the arteries—the loss of blood from that wound, in my judgment, caused almost instantaneous death—there were two small cuts on the left side of the chin, probably unimportant, they were such as might have been done with a knife—the face was swollen all over, the forehead was contused, the face was slightly livid, more especially at the forehead, and the forehead was bruised—in my opinion severe pressure over the forehead and eyes would account for the swollen appearance—I examined her person and discovered that she had been recently violated—the back of her thighs were slightly bruised, and her back—in my judgment she had been dead between three and four hours; the extremities were all cold, and the body partially so—it is extremely difficult to tell within half an hour or an hour, but I should say she had been dead about three hours and a half—there was a great deal of blood on the floor on the left-hand side of the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Delahay Street, Westminster—I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and Lecturer on Forensic Medicine at the Westminster Hospital—on 29th October the last witness brought me some clothes sealed up in a parcel, and on 1st November a knife—I have made a careful examination of the clothes and applied the usual and microscopical tests to ascertain whether they were marks of blood—on the shirt I found two spots of blood on one side and one on the other, in the position spoken of by the inspector—on the collar of the waistcoat I found a small clot of blood, which I examined—on the trousers I found red marks on the lower part of the legs, and two or three spots about the upper part of the legs—I examined all those spots and found that none of them were caused by blood—they were very large red stains; I think they were paint, a crystalline substance—those on the shirt were undoubtedly blood, and the clot on the waistcoat—I examined a smear which the inspector pointed out to me at the back of the coat, it was a very faint smear; that was not blood as far as I could make out; I think it was a stain caused by perspiration—there was no blood on the coat; I may say that I did not notice the stain spoken of on the elbow, so I did not examine that—the marks on the shirt and waistcoat were such as might have been caused by the spurting of an artery—all I can say is that they had all the characteristics of human blood, but that is common to animals, to mammals—those were all the marks of blood I found—they were recent marks; it is impossible to say to a week or two how recent; they were undoubtedly not old stains, it was recent blood, quite consistent with having been there a week—I examined the knife; on each side of the blade there were stains of blood about 2 inches from the point, and also a smear near the handle, but no blood on the handle; that was recent blood—it might have been caused by the knife having been plunged into the throat, or it might have been placed on; it was quite consistent with its having been plunged into the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The size of the mark on the collar of the shirt was about the size of a three penny bit, the two splashes on one side were not quite so large; the one on the other side was larger, about the size of a sixpence—it is quite possible they may have been caused by the prisoner's nose having bled—I cannot even say that it was human blood, all I can say is that it was the blood of a mammal.</p>

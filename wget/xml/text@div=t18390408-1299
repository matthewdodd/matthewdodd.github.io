                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 198.) I was in Turnmill-street on the 11th of March—I saw the prosecutrix and a female in a hackney coach—the coachman stopped in the street, and asked for his money—the prosecutrix said she had given it to the male prisoner, and he was gone into the public-house—the sergeant fetched him out—he said the proseeutrix had given him no money, but he would pay, and he paid—I came round again, and found the prosecutrix quite senseless by herself—she was taken to the station-house.</p>

               <p>was then in company with a young man she called her <hi rend="italic">Teddy.</hi> They were drinking gin-and-water. We got into conversation together; they told me they had come from Cambridge on the Thursday; he said he was a steeple-chase rider she got tispsy some quarrelling took place between them. I advised them not to quarrel; he said she got so drunk, it was impossible for any man to live with her; that she would drink four or five quarterns of gin before she would get out of bed in the morning. I saw her again the next evening at the same place she was by herself. She told me her <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> had left her; that she had no place to put her head, for the landlord had threatened to turn her out, because she had no money to pay her lodging; that she was a married woman, the wife of Mr. Locke, 18, Upper Bedford-place, Russell-square: that she had been seduced from her husband by this steeple-chase rider; that he took her to Cambridge, and for the last seven months she had supported him by prostituting herself at Cambridge; but now she wished to get reconciled to her husband, for he was Dot aware of what had passed for the last seven months, because he thought she was at her brother's. I told her ours was very humble, but any place would be better than stopping in the streets: she might come, if she had no objection, to make shift for one night, if the landlord turned her out. She com<lb></lb>menced drinking with a man she called <hi rend="italic">Buckfriday,</hi> but whose proper name is Bissett. She got very noisy, and the landlord turned her out, giving her a shilling, as he said, to get her a lodging; she waited for my wife and self, and, when. we came out, asked if she could go with us; it was then too late for her to get a lodging; and that being the case, we took her, out of pure motives of charity, home with us. The next morning she awoke me early to fetch her some gin. I brought her half a pint; the drank it off at one draught she pretended that she was miscarrying; we asked her if she would have a doctor; but she said no, that she had often been in that way before, and did not require one; if she had some gin she should soon be better. At her request, her gown and shawl were pledged to get her gin; and during the time she was at our house, which was from the 5th till the 11th, she never got out of bed, nor drank less than a quart of gin per day. She took her meals with us, but never paid any share towards them. During the time she was at our house, she made no secret, but wrote several notes; amongst the rest, was one to Mr. Locke; the purport of it I do not know, but he sent her six shillings. She complained very much at his not sending her more, and requested my wife to go again on the following morning, to ask the housekeeper of Mr. Locke to come and see her. This lady states that the prosecutrix made no complaint of ill usage, although my wife offered to leave the room; therefore she had every op<lb></lb>portunity of telling this lady, had she experienced any ill usage; she likewise told this lady her clothes were in pledge, but she did not tell her we had clandestinely pledged them this lady left her a sovereign. Does it stand to reason, that, had it been our intention to have robbed her, we should have introduced a female to her, to whom she might have told all her affairs? This sovereign was spent in gin. I and my wife advised her not to drink so much, but she said she had lived upon it for the last four months, and she must have it. On the 10th, Sunday, she said she had two boxes at the coach-office, containing very handsome clothes, and she should like to go to her husband's on the morrow, if she had clothes to go in; at this time she had in pledge her stays boots, flannel petticoat,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080129"></xptr>
               <p>gown, and shawl. My wife said, 'I am going to tea at my sister's, in Surrey-street, Strand, and I think I could borrow a sovereign, and that would get your things out of pledge, if you think you could pay, so that I could give it her to-morrow again;' she said it would be no use her hav<lb></lb>ing her gown and shawl, for she had represented to Mr. Locke that her mother was dead, and she must go in mourning, for she had received money for the purpose of purchasing mourning, and had spent it with her <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> in Cambridge. We told her we had a black satin pelisse in pledge for five shillings, and a black velvet cape we could lend her. She said that would be just the thing. My wife did not get the sovereign that day; but on Monday, the 11th, she started after breakfast, and returned in the afternoon with the money. I went for her things out of pledge while she got op; when I returned she asked my wife what she should do for a shift, *******—she said she should burn it, and go with<lb></lb>out one for luck, for she had plenty in her boxes. My wife said, Do not do that; I will wash it.' She said, 'Well, if you do not mind washing them, here are the trowsers too/ which she drew from under the bed. We then started, and on the road she spent all the change of the sovereign which I had given her, for brandy. We waited outside while she went in to Mr. Locke's; she shortly returned, and called a coach; we got in with her, and she ordered the coachman to drive to the Haymarket, and she would have a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi> I with great difficulty persuaded her to go to my sister and return the sovereign, and the coach drove to Surrey-street. She said she had two sovereigns; one she changed in Surrey-street, at a public-house where she had some brandy, to pay the coach fare, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and one she left with my sister's landlady, my sister not being at home; she then went to the Heathcock and redeemed a veil she had left there for three shillings, and spent fourteen shillings in spirits; she pretended to be in fits, and was put into a coach; we rode with her, in company with a man named Curtis, that I have since learnt was a friend of hers. She made use of shocking language in the coach, both to me and my wife, that at last I said she should not come to my place again. I paid the coach fare, because she had no money, and left her. I heard nothing more of her till Wednesday, the 13th, when I saw the description of her in the 'Times' paper. I went directly to the workhouse. I gave them every information in my power respecting her. I told Mr. Millo respecting the shift, drawers, duplicates, and keys. They asked me to bring the keys. I did so at their request. Mr. Millo asked me what was her name. I told him she called herself Mrs. Locke, but I thought she had not given them her right name, for the dirty linen she had left behind was marked 'E. A. C'"</p>

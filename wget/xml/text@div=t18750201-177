I am a steward, and I was boarding at the Trafalgar beershop, West India Road, while I was ill—on the night of the 26th January I was sitting on a bench in the house, and the two prisoners came in—they went up to the bar and then came up to me and said "What a fine young man," and they sat down one on each side of me—Cain was on the right—they asked me to treat them—I put my hand into my pocket and took the sovereign out of a piece of paper, and finding the sovereign I put it back in my right pocket—I put my left hand in my left pocket and took out a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave it to Cain—I am sure before giving her the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I put back the sovereign into my right pocket—I stopped there and Cain was coming very close to me, as close as she could, both of them—I said "Don't close me up so," I did not like it—when I gave her the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she called for the beer—Mrs. Jones said "Your tea is ready," and I went and got my tea—there was no one with me, only Mr. Jones the master of the premises—he was taking tea with me—Mr. Jones said "Look in your pocket"—I turned out my pocket-book and found there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there in silver, and when I put that in my pocket the sovereign was gone and the paper—I had not been near any person at all after I left the prisoners in the bar to go and have my tea.</p>

January—the two prisoners came in and sat on each side of the coloured man—the one with the red plaid shawl (I know neither of their names) took gold out of the coloured man's right hand pocket—what it was I could not say—whether it was a-sovereign or a half-sovereign I could not swear—it was Cain, the one on this side—she was sitting against the bar on his right hand side.</p>

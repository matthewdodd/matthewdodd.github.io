I told him, I would go to Sir Sampson, and see if it was advertised, and if there was any reward, he should have it; and going through Broad-Court, he made a sudden stop, and said, he would go no further. I then suspected him, and took him to Bow-street; he said there, he had found it. I have known the man several years; he has worked for me; I had no suspicion he had stolen it at first. He has a wife and four children. Mr. Robins was sent for, and owned the seal. I have had it in my custody ever since. This is the seal.</p>

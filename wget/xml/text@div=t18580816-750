                  </hi>. I am an eating-house keeper in Hertford-terrace, Hag<lb></lb>gerstone. On Friday evening, the 20th of July, the prisoner came, about a quarter-past 8 o'clock for a halfpenny worth of pease pudding—she gave me a shilling—I gave her 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the shilling in the till, where there was no other—there were two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces.

After the prisoner had left the second time, Mr. Webb borrowed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me—I went to the till and took the two shillings out—there was no other shilling there, only the two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—I gave him one shilling out of my pocket Mr. Webb left the shop, and returned in about 10 mi<lb></lb>nutes with two Victoria shillings, and they were bent—I kept them apart from other money—I returned them to Mr. Webb the same evening, and he gave them back to me—I gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Haggerstone Cottages. I was in Mr. Reeves's shop that evening when the second shilling was given by the prisoner. I afterwards had occasion to borrow 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Reeves—he took two shillings out of the till, and gave me one out of his pocket; the two which he took out of the till were Victorias—I noticed that there was not another shilling in the till—the shilling he took out of his pocket was a George the Fourth—the two shillings were detected as bad in my presence. I returned to him and gave him the two shillings I had received from him.</p>

From information I received from Mr. Reeves, I went with him on the Wednesday to the prisoner's house—I found her there, and I said to her, "Mr. Reeves charges you with passing two bad shillings."She said, "Yes, I did; 1 passed them to Mr. Reeves—I got them of Johnson, he is a d—d rogue, and I will tell all about him." I took her in custody—I asked her if Johnson lived there—she said, "No; he used to live with me till about three weeks ago, when I got married." These are the two shillings I got from Mr. Reeves, they were not out of my sight.</p>

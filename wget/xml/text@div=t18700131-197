I have been for thirty-one years employed by the Treasury—on 1st January, from information I received, I went to Sewaid-atone Road, about 3 o'clock, with other officers—we posted ourselves in a position to command a view of No. 14, and shortly afterwards the little girl (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner Ellen</hi>) came from the door and passed us—we watched her to Mann's, the baker's, shop, and when she came out I sent Chapman in—he gave me information, and Inspector Honey went to a public-house—he took possession of a half-sovereign, and showed it to me—we watched the girl home, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came out again, and Honey and Chapman followed her, while I kept within view of the door of No. 14, and saw her return, and the officers folio wing her—I stopped her, and said, "My little girl, what is your name?"—she said, "Cave, sir"—I said, "Where do you live?"—she said, "14, down there, sir," pointing to the door which I had seen her go in and come out from—I told her she was suspected of passing coin which had been impaired, diminished, and light<lb></lb>ened—she made no reply—I said, "Do you understand me, my girl, or shall I explain it to you?"—she said, "If you please, sir,"—I said, "For lighten-ing the sovereigns and making them of less value, and then passing them; you answer the description of a little girl that passed some light sovereigns to Mr. West, the brewer, in the Hackney Road"—she said, "Yes, sir, I had</p>

I am chemist to Her Majesty's Mint—I have examined these articles—this box contains two batteries, a wire brush, a pair of scissors, two steal burnishers, and a clasp knife—there is no trough to the butteries, but a tea cup could be used as a trough—various solvents may be used in the trough; cyanide of potassium and various acids—there are two wires, which are in a very similar position to that in which they would be used for electro-gilding—this battery would extract gold from sovereigns, with the aid of acids—with the connection complete, a sovereign would be decomposed—I received the charges drawn from the battery, and charged it with them—I then operated with it upon a half-sovereign, using a solution of cyanide of potassium in the cup, and removed from the half-sovereign these three-tenths of a grain of gold (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I used the other battery, and worked with hydrocloric acid, by which means I removed ten grains of gold from a sovereign in an hour—I have analyzed the liquids with which the battery was charged; one was sulphate of copper, and the other sulphate of zinc—the acid in the cup contained a small quantity of gold—the board with a round hole in it is, I believe, used as a support for the coin after its removal from the solution—here is a sovereign which has been practised upon, and which is still uncleaned; it is dull—this brush would brighten it, and take off the rough red appearance—these bent wires are used to support the coin in this position—the process of electro-dissolu-tion is precisely the reverse of electro-plating; the one is putting gold on, the other is taking it off: you just change the wires—I believe this</p>

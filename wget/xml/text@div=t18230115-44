            . I am a watchman, my box is about two hundred yards from Benjamin's house, in the next street. On the 27th of December, about one o'clock in the morning, I was sitting in my box, and saw six or seven young men come down Gloster-court, into White-cross-street, which communicates with Playhouse-yard, they were going towards Benjamin's house; I saw them returning in about five minutes, each running with clothes thrown loosely over their arms, I knew their faces when I first saw them, by having seen them about; they made a stand for half a minute. I believe the prisoner to be one, I saw him both times, it was a fine moon-light night, and exactly under a strong gass-light; I saw his front face as they went, and on returning I saw his side-face, they were about twenty yards off, and I only saw them for ten yards. To the best of my belief he is one of them, I got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150026"></xptr>out of my box, made an alarm, and at last one of them dropped his load which I picked up, and followed them into the back allies, but there being so many avenues I lost them; I took the things to the watch-house, then searched about Playhouse-yard, and found Benjamin's door open, and alarmed him. Next evening I went with an officer to a public-house, about a hundred and fifty yards from Benjamin's, and pointed the prisoner out from among fifty others in the tap-room. I truly believe him to be one of them; I came out of the room to the officer, and said I believed him to be one, and went home; I expressed no doubt about him, he is not the man who dropped the things; I should know that man; but he had some.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You saw me two or three times before I was taken - A. That was when I pointed him out at the Admiral

            . I am headborough. These goods were delivered to me at one o'clock in the morning. I went with Brown to the Admiral 
               <persName id="t18230115-44-person501">Benbow</persName>
            , and when he came out, he said,</p>
               <p>"That little fellow in the black coat, smoking a pipe, I suspect him." I said,</p>
               <p>"Can you swear to him before a Magistrate;" he said he could swear it within his own breast. I said it would not do for me to take him, as he did not speak positive. I saw Brown again next night; he asked if I had taken him, I said</p>
               <p>"No, are you sure he is one of the men concerned in the robbery;" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, he is one that ran away." I went next night and took him at the same house, and told him he must come with me for a crack, in Playhouse-yard; he said,</p>
               <p>"If I am taken for that, I am taken innocently, for I know nothing about it."</p>

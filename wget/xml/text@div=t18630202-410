                  </hi>. I am a private in the 3d Buffs—on the morning of the 6th January I was in the Blue Boar public-house in Rosemary-lane from about 2 until about a quarter to 3—that was after midnight—while there I saw Thomas Nennis and the four prisoners—I heard Malone say to the prosecutor, "I have paid for a quart of beer for you to drink, and it is nothing but right that you should pay for one for me before you leave the house"—the prosecutor said he had drunk no beer of his, and therefore he should not pay for any for him—there was then a disturbance between the prosecutor and Donovan—he struck the prosecutor—the landlord then turned out Donovan and Nennis—I did not notice which way they went—the remaining three prisoners followed them—I then left house, and was on my way across Tower-hill—I was crossing the top of King-street, and I saw Nennis and the four prisoners; one on top of him, and he down on the ground—Andrews had hold of Nennis by the throat—I took hold of Andrews, and struck him, and knocked him up against a shop door, and he was bleeding at the mouth at the time I gave him into custody—I went over again and I saw Donovan rifling the man's pockets—I said I would not let him loose until such time as I gave him into custody—I then saw Malone putting his hand into the prosecutor's left-hand breast coat pocket, and taking from it a pocket-book—I saw Bryan standing at the feet of Nennis; I cannot say whether he was getting any money from him; he was there implicated in rifling him—I afterwards spoke to the police—I saw Malone in custody at about half-past 3—two men made their escape just at the time the row was; the other two were collared.</p>

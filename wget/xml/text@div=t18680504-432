I am barmaid at the Gray's Inn Restaurant, Holborn—on 28th March, in the afternoon, I served the prisoner with four<lb></lb>pennyworth of sherry—he gave me a bad half-crown—I showed it to my master, and asked the prisoner what he meant by passing bad money, and told him it was not the first time he had done it—he said that he was not aware it was bad—I gave him in charge with the half-crown, which I had not parted with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's husband; we live at No. 9, New Cavendish-street; I am coachman to Mr. Chapman. On Saturday afternoon, 4th June, about 20 minutes past 4 o'clock, the prisoner was brought home to me very drunk—I got her up stairs as well as I could, and she was lying on the floor—I could make her understand nothing—I went out, and returned a little before 12 o'clock at night—she was then lying on the bed, and had been sick—she was not then so drunk as she had been, but was not sober—I attempted to make the bed, and shifted her foot on one side to make room for me to lie down, upon which she got out of bed, took the poker, and hit me on the head as I was pulling my coat off—I was taken to a surgeon, who dressed the wound, but as it would not leave off bleeding, I was taken to the Middlesex Hospital.</p>

I was called, and met the prosecutor outside his house, bleeding very much; his face was covered with blood—I went up into the room to the prisoner—she was sober, but I could see that she had been drinking—she was lying on the bed in her clothes—I told her she had better get up, put on her bonnet and shawl, and come with me—she said she would see me d——d first—I could not get her out of the room, she kept shutting the door as I got her to it—I fetched another constable, and we got her to the station—the inspector said, "You might have killed him with that blow, and then you would be hung;" she said, "I should be satisfied to be hung, if he was dead first.

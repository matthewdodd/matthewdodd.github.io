I was sent out on the 31st of May to Newport-market for a pair of pumps for my young Lady, about ten minutes after six. I was a stranger to that part of the town; my fellow servants directed me over the fields by Battle-bridge. I had the pumps delivered to me about seven o'clock; I went to speak to a brother of mine, that lives in Water-lane. I saw the prisoner in Water-lane; I had seen him before walking about Islington, but I did not know where he lived; I never spoke to him to my knowledge; he spoke to me. From there I went to Carey-street, and then home. I saw no more of the prisoner till he robbed me, just as I had got over the brick-fields, on the other side of <placeName id="t17701024-56-crimeloc265">Battle-bridge</placeName>

               <p>Q. It was day-night then at that time?</p>
               <p>Waters. Yes; but it was a duskish evening. Just as I got over the ditch one of the brick-field, the prisoner laid hold of my collar, and swung me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner come from?</p>
               <p>Waters. I can't tell; I did not know that I had a foul behind me; I was crossing the fields for the nearest way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone?</p>
               <p>Waters. I did not see any body with him. He damn'd me, and bid me deliver what I had got. I told him, I was a poor servant lad, that worked hard for what I got, and had nothing. He laid hold of the waistband of my breeches, tore the buttons off, and laid hold of me in an uncommon manner. I begged for mercy; he let his hand loose, and turned out both my pockets. I had 2 s. 6 d. of my own, and 4 s. 6 d. of my master's in my breeches pocket. He took a pair of buttons from my sleeves, and four pennyworth of halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket. He asked where my watch was; I told him I had not got a watch. I was getting up; he kicked me down with his foot, and said, Damn you, do you think you shall know me again if you see me? I said, No. Then he snatched my neckcloth off, and tore it in two, and threw it at me. This is the shirt I had on when he robbed me (producing a shirt with the collar very much torn.) Then he went off, and I saw not more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a pistol, or any weapon?</p>
               <p>Waters. I did not see any. I went over the ditch again, and returned to the house I had come by, and asked for assistance to go in pursuit of the prisoner. They advised me to go to Sir

               <p>Waters. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>- Wright. This day week I had been from Sir John Fielding's office to his county-house at Brompton; as I was returning to town along with another man, I met the prisoner on the road; I passed by him. The young man that was along with me said, Wright, don't you know that man? I turned round; he was not twenty yards from me. When I was turnkey at the Gatehouse. I have seen him come there.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240036"></xptr> I ran after him and tapped him on the shoulder, and said he must go with me. He asked what was the matter? I told him an information was lodged at our office against him; he asked what it was for? I told him, and said, all our people have been after you at different times. He said, when does the sessions begin? I said, next week. A man was sent to the prosecutor; the prosecutor was gone to live with a gentleman in the city. The prisoner was put into a room among twenty people. One of the clerks said to him, look round, and ee if you can find the man that robbed you He went to the prisoner, and said, that is the man: we could not find any thing upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner to the prosecutor. Had not we conversation together at the Temple at that time you say I robbed you?</p>
               <p>Waters. No; I never spoke to him in my life before he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did you not immediately pursue me?</p>
               <p>Waters. I went for assistance, but could not get any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you resist me if I robbed you?</p>
               <p>Waters. He had me upon the ground not two feet from the water, so that I could not resist him.</p>

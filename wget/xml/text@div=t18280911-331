            . I took up the prisoner in Cloth-fair; he said he was very sorry, and asked me to ask his master to forgive him - I said I could not, as I understood it was a second offence; he said if I would intercede for him, he would pay his master so much a week, as he had done in a former case.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, denying all knowledge of the money being in the bag; and stating his absenting himself was on account of the lowness of his wages.</p>

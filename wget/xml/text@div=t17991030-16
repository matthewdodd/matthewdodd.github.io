             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of Staines; I went to the prisoner's house in Staines Moor, on the 16th of September, with a warrant of distress for poors-rates; in the bed-room I observed a quantity of wheat-sheaves, and some peas in an adjoining room. I afterwards went with Mr. Wild and the prosecutor, the same day, to execute a search-warrant; the prisoner had lived there for years; we found some sacks under the sacking of the bed, and others with apples in them; there were eight in all; the prosecutor claimed them to be his property; the prisoner had been his servant. I apprehended the prisoner; I told him I had a warrant against him for stealing the sacks; he said he had had the sacks at different times of his master; that he had bought corn of him; he was taken before the Magistrate the next day, and committed.</p>

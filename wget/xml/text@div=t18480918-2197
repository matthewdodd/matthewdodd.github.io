                  </hi>. I am in the service of the Waterman Steam-Packet Company as collector, at the City Pier, London-bridge—it is my duty to issue tickets to persons going up and down the river (it would be the pier<lb></lb>man's duty to receive them)—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in iny possession for that purpose on 30th Aug.—this ticket, No. 145, was issued from it that morning, for the purpose of going down the river.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to a woollen-draper at Aldgate. I went from Woolwich to London with my wife on 30th Aug., about half-past three by the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steam-boat, <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 5—I saw the prisoner on the pier—I purchased two tickets of him for a shilling—one was "S. N. No. 145," and the other "S. S. 34, 72"—I observed they vvere rumpled—the prisoner asked where I was going—I told him to London, and he produced these two tickets to me—I had some communication with the captain on board, and I purchased two more tickets, and paid for them there—I returned to Wood wich the same night by the Black wall Railway, and saw Mr. Dixon, the superintendent—I gave him the tickets I bought of the prisoner—them I purchased of the captain I gave up to the pier-man on arriving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe the third bell had struck for the passenger to go when you bought these tickets of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the third; the second had—the moment the third bell sounds, the boat starts, then was no time to be lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the Waterman Steam Packet Company at Woolwich—the principal collector in the employ of the Company, Charles Collins Blane, is one of the proprietors, and there are were—it is the duty of the collectors to settle with me—this is one of the books that is given to the collectors to issue tickets from—they change colour from time to time—the prisoner had only to issue tickets that he tore out of the book—I have given him directions with respect to tickets which have been torn out of the book, not to sell those tickets till he had brought them to me, and had them counter-signed by me—he was directed to give the ticket out of a book which he had—he has brought tickets to me to be signed—that has been the course of his duty during the whole of the summer—if he had in his possession any tickets that had been issued at other stations, it was his duty to give them to the pier-man—there is constantly a pier-man at the Woolwich pier—on the morning of 31st Aug. the prisoner settled with me—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as the balance of the preceding day's work—when I account with him, I go through his book, and ascertain the tickets issued, and then I require him account to me for the money—he said, previous to settling, that he had get into a mess through inadvertently selling two tickets, which had been given</p>

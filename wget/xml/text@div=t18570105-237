                  </hi>. On Wednesday, 24th Dec., about half past 9 o'clock, I was at the Rupel Arms, on the road from Woolwich to Green<lb></lb>wich—I called for a pint of ale—I was not drunk—I might have had three glasses of ale, but knew what I was about—I had some tools with me—the prisoner took some of my ale—I rebuked him for taking it, and he struck me on the mouth—I did not strike him again—I went and sat down, it may have been for an hour—I then went out, and went towards Greenwich—when I had got about thirty yards, the prisoner followed me out with a female—he came up to me by himself—he did not say a word, but knocked me down and kicked me—I became senseless—I had my nose and mouth split, and my teeth shattered—I was kicked under my chin, and my ankle was cut—I remained on the ground without sense for some time, and, when I came to my senses, I saw him standing over me, and said, "Where are my tools?"—he said, "They are all right," and left me—I did not see which way he went—my tools were gone—they were worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were all in the basket with my flannel jacket—I have never seen them since—I saw the prisoner in custody that day week—I told the policeman Tester on 26th.</p>

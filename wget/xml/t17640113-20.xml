She came in on the 24th of September: I enquired about her, and found she was gone to Norwich, with a weaver's wife; but upon the Thursday before Christmas, she was seen in Norton-Falgate, by a little girl, who got a man to bring her home. which he did, to the top of the alley, where I live, and I was sent for. I took her into the Green Dragon alehouse; her master was there: I went for a constable, and when I returned, I was told she had confess'd: then she told me she had taken 21 guineas, and how she had spent a great deal of it; and that some of the neighbours encouraged her to play at cards. The same she told me afterwards in prison. I had once seen her head peep over the wall; she told me one Garland, the next neighbour, lifted her up, and that he frequently used to lift her over the wall, to get into the house, when she was locked out.</p>

            . This unhappy girl is my servant. I am a lodger at Mr. Rogers's house; I did suspect she was got into some very bad company: I examined her how she came by things which she had, ribbons, necklaces, and cloaths; she said a young man gave them to her. I being a silver orris weaver, was fearful of being robbed: she had not been in my service at all, for three weeks before she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is she?</p>
               <p>Laney. I believe she is about 15 or 16 years of age. She is a poor unhappy girl, and has no friends at all.</p>

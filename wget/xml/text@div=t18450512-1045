                  </hi>. I am an attorney of the Four Courts, Dublin, but practising in London, as a parliamentary and Irish agent; I came to England for that purpose about three years ago; I was admitted an attorney at Dublin; I live at No. 9, Pall-mall East. On the 26th of March last, I was in possession of two pro<lb></lb>missory notes, one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received them from Mr. Thomas Holbrook Coyle—I gave 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two notes produced by Mr. Mytton</hi>)—these are the two promissory notes upon which I advanced the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while they were in my possession, I was informed that Willis had called on me—I then called on him—I think it was on the afternoon of the 26th or 27th of March—I met him coming out of his door—he said, "I was just going to call upon you, Mr. Hearne"—he said, "I understand you have got some bills of Mr. Myt<lb></lb>ton's; I have got a friend who is desirous to invest 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the discount of Mr. Mytton's paper;" and he added, "If you wish to have those bills</p>

               <p>discounted, I shall be glad to get them done for you"—I tben told him that I held two bills, amounting to 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I had given valuable consideration, and I produced to him this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—directed Edmund L. Hearn, Esq., 9, Pall-mall East—"16, Great Marlborough-street, 15th March, 1845: Sir, Mr. Coyle has this day handed us the proceeds, less discount, as agreed upon, of two promissory notes, of John Mytton, Esq., of Aston, Warwickshire, dated 10th March; amount 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. We remain, sir, your obedient servants, <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi> and Co.")—I had before that done business with those persons on account of Coyle—I asked Willis the terms—he said he would see his friend—I then intrusted him with the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, in consequence of the representation he made, that he had a friend who was anxious to have Mr. Mytton's paper—he appointed to call at my residence next morning at eleven o'clock—he did not come till the afternoon—he then said that his friend would give 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two bills—I asked, did that include his commission—he said, "No"—I asked what he would expect—he said he would leave that to myself—I then said I would give him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his commission—he said, "No, you must make it 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Very well"—he then said, "Well, I shall bring you the money to<lb></lb>morrow morning, between eleven and twelve"—I handed him the second bill at that interview, for the purpose of his friend advancing the money on it, as he stated—I was at home next morning—Willis never came, or anybody on his behalf, with the money—I have never been able since to get possession of the bills—I have endeavoured to do so—next day I saw Willis at his own chambers—I asked why he had not called on me—he said he was waiting, expecting his friend every moment with the money, and the very moment he brought the money, he would bring it down to my chambers to me—on the following" day I received a communication from Dr. Ryan—I then called on Willis again—he repeated the same story, that he was waiting for his friend, and I said I thought it was rather strange there should be any delay, inasmuch as his friend, as he had repre<lb></lb>sented to me, had agreed to the terms before he had the bills—he replied, people did not like to part with so large a sum of money as 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a moment—on the following Monday I went again—I did not get back the bills.</p>

Green, and Mr. M'Grath, of Lower Mount-street, Dublin—I have transmitted them a great deal of business, and they have done business with English clients through me—I have been acquainted with Mr. Coyle about six or eight months—I have had transactions with him before this with respect to bills—I should say, previous to this, to the amount of about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think more—I kept no book for bill transactions—I should say I have had about half a dozen bills from Mr. Coyle altogether, or perhaps eight or ten—I should say under a dozen, and over half a dozen—they have not been purchases of bills by me of Coyle—I got them discounted through my</p>

               <p>connexions, and handed over the money to Mr. Coyle—t did not buy these two bills for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I merely made advances on them to that extent, and when I found I could not get them discounted, in consequence of some transactions, I was obliged, of course, to take the bills for my advances—I advanced 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of hard money—not a shilling of it was my own—Coyle first lodged with me a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, on which I advanced him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and finding I could not get that bill discounted, when he brought me Mr. Mytton't bills, I returned him the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and held Mr. Mytton's bills as against that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave Willis into custody for stealing these bills from me—I appeared against him before the Magistrate at Marl borough'Street, and was examined on oath in support of that charge—I stated that the first advance J made to Coyle for these bills was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check of a Mr. Brown's, which Mr. Brown lent me—I believe I was asked before the Magistrate when I began to make advances on these bills—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. fitzpatrick here produced the notes of the examination, which the witness was desired to look at.</hi>)</p>

Cooper had a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had got discounted, and got the money—there was about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming to me, but he had kept it all—he said Mr. Cooper had that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and if I chose to get it discounted, I should no doubt have my money back—there was no arrangement made about it, but Hodgson was aware of the fact, and concurred in my getting the bill, on payment of the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in my deducting from the proceeds what was owing to me—I ulti<lb></lb>mately received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give the bill up—I did not at first state my claims upon Cooper to be 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I swear, sordid I afterwards say it and then 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told the gentleman that came to me how respecting the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I said I claimed it for the advance of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I—I do not think I mentioned any sum—the matter afterwards got into the hands of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I live at Limmer's hotel now—I reside at Alston, in Shropshire—I was twenty-one years of age last November. In consequence of some communication I received about the 9th of March, I went to some persons named Smith and Co. in Great Marl<lb></lb>borough-street—I got a letter from them, offering to advance me money—I have not got that letter—I had two or three from them—I went there in consequence, and saw some persons representing themselves as Smith and Co.—I saw a man and a servant there—there was a brass plate on the door, with "Smith and Co." on it—I went there about six times—some bills were prepared there one day that I went—I went four or five times before I left the bills—I left them on Thursday, the 13th—I left three bills—these now produced are two of them, one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and there is another for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. somewhere—I do not know where it is—these bills were prepared the first time I went there—they merely required my signature—they were not signed the first time I went there, because they had not money there to give me, and I refused to sign them—I signed them on the 13th, and they then gave me a memorandum acknowledging the receipt—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—not a shilling was paid to me in respect of these bills—I have never up to this moment received a farthing in respect of them, and I do not expect I ever shall—I think I should know the persons again that I saw at Smith and Co.'s—I am not quite certain—there was a shortish roan, and another a porter or clerk—I think I should know them both again if I were to see them—I have not seen them since—I made a communication to the defendants indirectly, through a gentleman named Sutton, as to the mode in which I had been deprived of the promissory notes—I told Mr. Sutton I had been robbed of these bills, and to get them back for me—on the day I signed the bills I was told to call next day—I parted with them on the faith that I was to have 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Friday, between twelve and one o'clock—I went there between twelve and one, and the clerk (I do not know his name) said that Mr. Smith was in the City—I went at four o'clock, and the porter, or clerk, told me he had had a letter from Mr. Smith, that he was detained in the City on business, and if I would call at twelve o'clock on Saturday I should have the money then—I called on the Saturday, and Mr. Smith had disappeared—the brass plate was not gone—I staid there till five o'clock in the evening—the rooms were not closed—the porter let me into the room—I then went to Mr. Weston, an attorney—I left town on Monday morning—I sent the solicitor an account of the bills, and how they had been stolen—I com<lb></lb>municated these circumstances to Mr. Sutton afterwards at Northampton—I</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you promised to pay these three several promissory notes, were you in a condition to have satisfied them when at maturity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if I had got the 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should decidedly have been in a condition to have paid 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when due—I forget the exact date when I came into possession of these notes again—it was about the day before the trial at the police-office—I got possession of them through Mr. Sutton—they were handed to me by him—I had stated to him the circumstances under which I was deprived of them, that I had gone to Smith and Co., that they had procured my signature, and then had left me without getting a farthing—I gave Mr. Sutton nothing for his assistance, nor have I paid, nor engaged to pay the defendants anything for the restoration of the bills.</p>

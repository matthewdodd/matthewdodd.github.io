                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and live in Old-street-road. On the 15th of April I was at the Roebuck public-house in Cannon-street-road, with some shipmates—the prisoner and his father were there—Web<lb></lb>ster and the prisoner's father quarrelled—I did not join in the quarrel—Mr. Living came and struck me—Webster and the prisoner's father got to fighting—I was near the fire—I did not quarrel with his father, but be came up and struck me two or three times—I do not know that I had spoken to him—I stood between them and the fire to keep them from falling into the fire when they were squabbling—I was not going to strike the pri<lb></lb>soner's father—the father struck me two or three times—I then endea<lb></lb>voured to strike him, and the prisoner said he would run a knife into the first person that offered to touch his father—I then gave the prisoner a slap in the face with my open hand, and said if he talked like that I would put him out of the room—I did not say if he did not get out of the room I would serve him worse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my mark—it was read over to me—what I said then was true.</p>

I was called on to attend Hawkins, on the morning of the 16th of April—he was in a state of great danger, I considered at that time—he had a small wound in the right side of the belly, about an inch deep—there was intense pain all over the right side of the belly, in the lower part, with great tension, and some degree of swelling, and all the symptoms of inflammation of the peritoneum—the wound had not penetrated the cavity of the abdomen—it extended obliquely downward nearly an inch—the size of the wound would not be increased by any subsequent exertion, but the symptoms of in<lb></lb>flammation might—walking home might increase it—fighting would do it—I considered him in danger for five or six days.</p>

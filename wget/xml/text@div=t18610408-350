                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a book called the ren<lb></lb>tal book which the Company kept? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were four rent-books—the aver<lb></lb>age amount that he had to receive was, I should think, about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I cannot say that it did not amount to more—there was a book be<lb></lb>tween the prisoner and the Company, in which he was debited with the whole of these rents in bulk—he kept the little books himself; they are here—they form part of the system—they were not his private property—he was not debited with all the rents of the Company—I believe there was also a ledger in which each individual is debited by name—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the rent books, with the names of the tenants according to the district—I have seen no book between the Company and the prisoner in which he is debited with all the rentals as a private individual, in which he wrote off from time to time from the rate-book by order of the Company those that were not received—I know what you mean, and I have not seen such a book—it does not follow that I should see it in the course of business—it ought to be laid before the Directors if there was such a book in existence, and the auditors would see it if they called for it—if there was such a book the accountant would know—I cannot be supposed to know one half of the books that are kept—a balance-sheet was drawn up each half-quarter—the prisoner was not debited as an individual with the arrears—there must be more books, which I have not seen or heard of—if the prisoner constantly paid rates out of the money of the Company, he had no right to do so—I never heard a single instance of his having paid claims made on the Company for rates and taxes, out of the monies received by him on account of rents—I am always present at the Board of Directors—it is part of my duty—I have no recollection of being present when the prisoner's accounts have been discussed; and when receipts have been produced in his behalf for rates, they have been allowed him by the Company—I have no recollection of any amount of payments made by the prisoner out of money received for the Company, or of the amounts being connected and initialed by the Directors, and it could not be done without a minute—I have never known a single instance of its being done—this first entry, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., may be-allowance for water rate, but I do not read it so—the column is headed "Arrears due, Christmas, 1859, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is a blank space, and in that is "Allowance for water rate"—the construction I put upon that is, that when the person who is debited, pays the arrears a certain allowance has to be made for the water rate—I can only take the thing as it stands—every column is headed except the last, which is for memoranda.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the column, "Allowance for sewers' rate," are you aware that that is a landlord's tax? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I presume that the landlord would deduct it if the tenant produced his receipts—the first memorandum here is "John Bentley, occupier of 3, Bishopsgate-yard"—in the first place here is put the annual rent, and as the rents fall due at the different quarters he is debited with every quarter, and any cash which may be paid he appears to have</p>

               <p>credit for; in this blank column the entry is from 25th March, 1860; my construction is that John Bentley took possession on 25th March, 1860, although the book began at Christmas, 1859—I presume, therefore, that there was a tenant prior to the property coming into his possession—here is "Allowance for sewers' rate, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that I understand to mean that when the rents are paid by the tenant if he produces his receipt for the sewers' rate it would be allowed—I never heard of the prisoner having paid rates out of the monies he received for the Company—I do not know whether he has or has not paid insurances out of the monies he received from the Company—I do not know whether the cashier would know better than I—if the prisoner paid insurances in that way, he had no right to do it—I cannot say, without referring to the book, whether the amount insured is 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not his duty to pay compensation at times for accidents that happened on the line—I believe it is very likely that he has on one or two occasions settled claims which have been made against the Company for accidents to cattle, or some other claims which occurred in the country; but in those cases he has not been authorised to pay it out of the monies received—the money has been given to him for the purpose—I know of no such in<lb></lb>stance authorised or unauthorised—he used not to pay money to the accountant, but to the cashier—he paid to nobody else—before the appoint<lb></lb>ment of a cashier there was a treasurer, which was tantamount to the' same office—he used to pay monies to the treasurer, and when the treasurer's office was dispensed with, the cashier's office became tantamount to the same thing—he did not pay money to the accountant, or to the accountant's department, to my knowledge—this "Received by permanent way" means that he has debited himself with a rental which he was not justified in doing, belonging to another department—all these items of rent in these books are debited to him—I do not know whether there are other entries, I have not examined the books to see—these are the books from which he collected the rents—he, or a clerk in his office prepares the forms—he must release himself from his debits, either by cash which he pays, or by showing that some other department has received the money—I do not know what this "Account department" means; it is a memorandum—this 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not go to the account department—I cannot tell you the meaning of an entry which I have not made myself—I do not see how the account could explain it—I should think the party who made the entry would be the best party to explain it—I do not know who made it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner, in the course of business, write under the column head-" Cash" the cash he had received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not in his writing—I do not know whose writing it is in—it was his clerk's duty to keep that book—it would be written in the land agent's office of which he was head—it appears to be after Midsummer, 1857—the cash-book is kept by him with the excep<lb></lb>tion of one or two entries—there is no entry in the cash-book of this 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If such a memorandum as that was there, would that exclude it from his cash-book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: in this very instance he debits himself with having received this money—here are two other items on this page, of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no mark of date—the persons who keep these books are the Company's servants—I cannot say that I know what this charge to the account department means—I should say that the account department has not received the money, because the accountant is not an authorized person to receive the money—I cannot undertake to say that the accountant did not receive it, whether he was authorised to do so or not; but it is no part of the accountant's duty to receive money—Mr. Wadely is the accountant—he has been so many years—he was accountant at the time we are speaking of.</p>

               <p>Holmes and Ford—they were my clerks under the prisoner—I do not remember a single instance in which they have brought me money which they had collected—I will swear my clerks have never collected money, and I do not believe Holmes or Ford ever brought money to my office—Batten and Biggs are not here—no other clerks besides them have received any money and handed it to me—there is no other name there—my other clerks have not paid me monies, which I have acknowledged to have received from Gibson and so entered—I swear that—it is my duty to enter every payment I receive from the prisoner—I am not aware that I once failed in that—I give him credit by my initials when he pays the money—I received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd from him on the morning of his apprehension—that is not entered—later on that day I received 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Holmes—I do not remember that he has made my payments before—the prisoner did not come to my office on 12th February before he was arrested and pay me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I went to his office and there got it—I had never been to his office before to get money—I went to his office and he paid me this money—I did not know then that he was going to be arrested—that was between 11 and 12 o'clock—I am not aware that the prisoner was in the habit of paying rents out of the monies that he received for the Company—he has not produced the receipts to me, nor have I allowed them—I do not know of his paying in surances or compensation out of rents.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

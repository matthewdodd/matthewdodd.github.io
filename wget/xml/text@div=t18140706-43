            , was brought there on Monday the 28th of June, near eleven in the forenoon; he died on the 20th, at near eleven o'clock at night. I examined his body after his death; I found a rupture in the right groin, and a laceration of the several intestines, and a very violent inflammation all over the abdomen. I conceive the violence done to the abdomen was the cause of his death. The rupture was a recent one. The rupture and the inflammation were connected; I conceive they were both done at the same time; both originated by the violence done to the abdomen. The hernia was produced at the time he was kicked or struck.</p>

            . I am surgeon's beadle of the London hospital I saw the deceased, O'Brien, brought there on the 28th of June; he died on the 29th. He was very ill indeed when brought in, and growing worse from the time he was brought in until he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he believe himself to be a dying man at the moment he was brought in - A. He was told so by the magistrate when he took his deposition, and he believed himself to be a dying man; he told me so as I was helping him in; he appeared to be a man approaching to his dissolution.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, while under the apprehension of his approaching death did he tell you anything - A. He told me the day prior to his being brought to the hospital there had been a quarrel with him and M'Guire; there was a challenge given to fight; he could not recollect whether he gave it, or whether the prisoner challenged him; he said, after that, in the afternoon, they met again, and he was dragged into an entry in the court, and kicked, and struck. I asked him particularly who did it; he said, M'Guire.</p>

            . I live in Tewkesbury-court, Whitechapel. On Monday morning, the 27th of June, M'Guire gave O'Brien a challenge to fight; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060026"></xptr>deceased refused. In the afternoon, between four and five o'clock, the deceased came up the court; the prisoner abused him and his wife very much. The deceased then challenged to fight, and struck the first blow. They fought together. The prisoner dragged the deceased into a passage; what happened after I cannot say. He was in the passage about five minutes; the deceased came out; he got up to the landing of his own stairs; he could get no farther. I went to help him; he begged of me to let him lay still. That is all I know, except the prisoner called the deceased many foul names.</p>
               <p>MRS. HUMPHREYS. I live in Tewkesbury-court, No. 4. In the evening I was going out of the court at the same time; I laid hold of the deceased's arm while he was standing on his legs; I said, Brien, what brought you into this skirmish; he said, they would not leave me alone. I did not see the fight.</p>

            . I live in Tewkesbury-court. On Monday morning, about eleven o'clock, I saw the quarrel between the prisoner and the deceased; the prisoner challenged the deceased to fight; the deceased would not. They parted. They met again in the afternoon; then the deceased gave the challenge to fight. The deceased gave the first blow; there were only two blows given on both sides. I did not see them in the passage. I saw the deceased come out of the passage; his mouth was filled with blood.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

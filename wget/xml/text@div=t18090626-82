On Sunday the 28th of May, I met the prisoner in the broad part of Holborn, about eleven o'clock at night; she ran after me, took hold of my arm, and asked me if I would go home with her; she had a nice room to accommodate me; through her persuasions I went with her, to <placeName id="t18090626-82-crimeloc482">No, 4, Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay with her - A. I staid in the room all night; she left the room in about three quarters of an hour; she went out and locked the door, she said she should be back directly, she was going in the yard; I said very well, make haste back.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to suppose that your watch was safe when you first saw that woman - A. When I first went into the room, I felt the watch and chain in my pocket; I put my hand into my pocket to give her the seven shilling piece, I pulled out the guinea with the seven shilling piece; I gave her the seven shilling piece, and put the guinea safe into my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she left you, had you undressed yourself - A. No, nothing but my breeches were off.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she left the room, had you any suspicion that your watch and the guinea was gone - A. No, not till she double locked the door; I then looked in my breeches; the watch and guinea was gone. It was a metal hunting watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to get out - A Not then; I thought she might come back again. I staid till four o'clock, and then I 
               <persName id="t18090626-82-person877">drew</persName>
             the staple off the door, and went out to my stable, and did my horses up. I made no alarm that morning, I thought it was better to come and catch her in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that this is the woman that you was with then - A. Yes; on two o'clock the same day, I went in company of a young man, of the name of Templeman, to this room; she was lying upon the bed; I charged her with having stolen my watch; she denied it. I told her she had better give it me, or else I would fetch an officer; she said she did not care for the officer nor me, Templeman went for an officer; and while I staid with her, she got a poker, and said she would strike me on the head; she did strike, but I kept the blow off with my hand; then the landlord came up, and asked me what was the matter; I told him this woman had robbed me of my watch; he took the poker from her, and directly she took a pewter pot and attempted to strike me; the landlord made her put it down. Before the officer came, the landlord said that if I would call again the next day at twelve o'clock, and leave him five shillings, he would take care and find the watch, and restore it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not to prosecute her - A. Not by that, but still as I had been robbed, I wished to have the law as far as I could. I went down stairs to see if I could see Templeman, I met him with an officer; he went up stairs, and then the landlord produced the watch; he said he found it in her cupboard, under a dish.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked in that cupboard while she was out - A. Yes, I searched the room, and the cupboard, and turned every thing up that was in it. The watch is in the landlord's custody now.</p>

               <p>Q. You were present when this young man came and laid hold of this young woman, were you not - A. I was present at two o'clock the next day; he asked me if I was the landlord of the house, I said yes; instead of his going into the room that he asked for, he went into the other room where this woman was; they began a bustle; he said he had been robbed, and he had slept with the woman. I searched the woman I found nothing; I opened the next room door, there were two children in it, one of the children told me that her mother put it in the cupboard.

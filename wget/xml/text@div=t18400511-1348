                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live in Rosemary-lane, he is a shoemaker. On a Thursday, in the beginning of April, be<lb></lb>tween eight and nine o'clock in the morning, he asked me for his breakfast—I got it ready as soon as I could, but it was not the proper time that he used to have it—he got in a passion and went out—he came in again, and asked me for some money—I gave him half-a-crown, and kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student at the hospital, I saw the prosecutrix brought there—the wound was about an inch long, and an inch and a half deep—it was not bleeding—she lost about half-a-pint of blood—it was in a dangerous place—some small arteries were cut—it was inflicted by a sharp instrument—the danger was from there being very large arteries there, and it would be difficult to secure them—it had not wounded any of them, but must have gone very near them.</p>

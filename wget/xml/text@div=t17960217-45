               <p>I am a carpenter: On Saturday night last, between seven and eight, I was coming past the house of Mr. Parke, and heard the rattling of copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the house open? - A. No, locked; upon hearing of this rattling of copper, which I had often heard going past the house, I called one of my men, and sent him for Mr. Dalton; he and another came, and five or six more; Mr. Dalton went in first at the casement window, which had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Broke open by you? - A. No; we found it broke open; when we got into the house, I saw the prisoner trying up copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discover where that copper came from? - A. Yes; from the top of the next house to that he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house did that turn out to be? - A. It belongs to the assignees of Mr. Park; built by Mr. Young, and assigned over to Mr. Park; it has been sold since. We took the prisoner away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the copper sitted to the top of the house? - A. No; John Dalton saw it fitted.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were they both empty houses? - A. Yes; it had been robbed a great many times of copper and sashes; I had been watching for some time back, though I was not at that moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me do any thing with the copper? - A. I was not the first that went into the house, but I saw it tied up in an apron; I don't know that it was his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the house before you went in? - A. I cannot say; we could not find any body else.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been fresh cut, or to have been cut a long time? - A. Fresh cut.</p>

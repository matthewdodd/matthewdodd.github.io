I made some of these small brushes, and sold them to Mr. Worster—the prisoner came to me on the 25th of Feb., with a sample of these brushes—he asked if I would buy any—I said I did not buy them, I made them—he said he had got some more at home—I' then remembered that Mr. Worster had told me be bad lost a good many brushes—I said I knew a person who would buy some, and I would bring him down between five and six in the evening—I went and took Mr. Worster—the prisoner is a furrier—he does not keep a shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fish-salesman of Billingsgate-market, and live at 36, Bridge-house-place, Newington-causeway—from a statement made by the prisoner same time ago, I was induced to take him into my service as clerk—his duty was to stand by me in the market and book the fish while I took the money—on 21st January I was ill and delegated him to book the money and receive it also, and to bring it to me each day as soon as the business was over, which was generally eleven or twelve o'clock—on the day previous to the 27th he brought the book and accounted to me for the money which the fish realized; but on the 27th he did not do so, though my other two young men came—in the evening my wife brought the book which had been left at a public-house—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 27th he has entered 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as money received for fish—there also in his writing 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

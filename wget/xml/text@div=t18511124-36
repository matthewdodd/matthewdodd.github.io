                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am at present living at Southampton-street, Bloomsbury-square; I carry on business in France, as a manufacturer. I came over to the Exhibition, and, while here, sold some china—the prisoner was in my employ while I was here—hit duty was to take out goods, and receive the money for them, which he ought to have paid over to me the same day, or the following morning—he did not on 20th Oct., or any day after that, pay me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or any sum of money, on account of Captain Robertson, and he has not accounted for it—I saw the prisoner on 20th, 22nd, and 23rd Oct., and received some pay<lb></lb>ments from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you receive a note from me between the 20th and 28th Sept.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced—this was dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th Oct., written in French: part of it was interpreted, as follows</hi>: "To Mr. Baron Du Tramblay. I shall not be able to come before Monday, at 9 o'clock. I went into the City to see the Captain"—<hi rend="italic">the note proceeded—"et toucher,' or 'touchais,' the money"—the writing was here so illegible as to render it uncertain whether the words were "a toucher," to receive, or "et touchais," and received; the prisoner contending that it was the latter, and that he thereby had accounted for the receipt of the money</hi>)—I was not present on the 20th, 22nd, or 23rd, when any goods were delivered to you.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in defence, admitted having received the money, but contended that he had accounted for it in the note he wrote to the Baron; after which he was confined to his bed for three days.</hi>)</p>

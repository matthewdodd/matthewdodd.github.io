            . I am a constable. On Saturday, the 26th of November, I went to the prisoner's mother's, and staid till he came in; I then charged him with stealing the four spoons and scent-box - he denied it; I searched him, and in his left-hand trousers pocket found the silver scent-box; I told him if he did not tell me where the spoons were I would lock him up; he said he knew nothing of them.(Scent-box produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The constable said if I did not confess he would send me out of the country for life; the child was playing with the scent-box, he threw it out of doors, and I picked it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 25, Belmer Street, Commer<lb></lb>cial Road East—about 12.15, on Sunday morning, 26th March, I was in Osborne Street—four men came up to me, and amongst them the two prisoners—Middleton had hold of my shoulder, and stood at the side of me—I saw his ace distinctly—the public-house lamps were still alight—Mur<lb></lb>phy took my watch out of my left waistcoat pocket—I had a steel chain, with a cent, piece on it—he took the lot from me—I saw Murphy distinctly, and picked him out of eight or nine men, at the corner of the street, a quarter of an hour afterwards—after they ran away I communicated with the police, and as we were going down to the station Murphy was standing at the corner of the street, with eight or nine others—I went and caught hold of him and said "This is the man"—the police came up and took him—I saw Middleton on the Friday following, at the corner of Mary Street, White<lb></lb>chapel,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187105010012"></xptr>
               <p>with three men—I followed them down the Whitechapel Road, and along Commercial Road, until I came to Sidney Street, where I saw a con<lb></lb>stable—Middleton was about twenty or thirty yards ahead of me—I pointed him out to the policeman, and he took him into custody—they did not use any violence to me, they only held me behind—I am perfectly certain they are two of the men who were engaged in the affair.</p>

I am an attorney, I have got a letter of Mr. Rook's, this letter came to me with some papers for Mr. Chippendale's perusal, on the 29th of March last, or following day, it is dated the 29th of March; and on this part which is cut out, it was; I have mislaid Mr. Chippendale's accompt, but I have sent him twenty pounds. I shall be obliged to you to let me have the accompt of what is due, and it shall be paid; I took the papers to Mr. Chippendale's, and read that part particular to the prisoner at the bar, after reading it over in the clerk's room, the clerk said it was perfectly right, the twenty pound he had received, I then as the letter related to the business to convince Mr. Chippendale, left the letter entire with the clerk, and the next time I got it, it was in this state.</p>

               <p>Q. His duty was not to open letters - A. No of course I never permissioned him to open a letter, it was his duty to have brought me this letter to open; I never received this twenty pound note at all, and when I received this letter, it was mutilated in that manner, that part was cut off; if there should be any doubt of his receiving that note, I have a letter from him of his own hand-writing, I received it from Mr. Davies, it is in order to shew me the extent of hig embezzlement; he requested that I would make a debt of it, and among other sums it is Mr. Rookes - twenty pounds.</p>

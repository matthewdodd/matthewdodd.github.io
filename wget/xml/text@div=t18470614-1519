                  </hi>. I have charge of the Crown and Anchor public-house, at Woolwich. I act as landlord—On the 9th of April, at eleven o'clock in the evening, the defendant came there with a man named Glover—they wanted drink—I did not serve them, as they were in liquor—they had been there twice before that day—they were not making a noise, but I did not want, them in the house—they wanted to go into the tap-room—I would not let them—I called a policeman, who came to the front door—he did not come in, but in consequence of what he said I tried to get the men to leave my house—I went to Glover, and desired him to walk out—he took me by the collar before I had done anything to him, an knocked me up against the wall, and tried to throw me on the floor—Wadlow, the policeman, was at the door, in such a position as he could see it—he came in to assist me, and took Glover from me—Dyble then took me by the collar and threw me over the table—the policeman got Glover out of the house—Dyble followed of himself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 9th of April I was on duty at Woolwich. Thorn came to me—in consequence of what he said, I went to the door of the Crown and Anchor—I saw Thorn take hold of Glover by the arms and say, "You must go out"—Glover immediately caught him by the collar, and made use of the most beastly expressions—he took Thorn by the collar, threw him back with great violence, and succeeded in getting into the tap-room—Dyble was there—he did nothing then—they were both to<lb></lb>gether—I took Glover into custody, and took him outside into the street—he then struck me in the eye, and knocked me backwards—I fell backwards, he fell on me—I still held him by the collar, while he was on me—Dyble came out of the house, and said, "You b—r, let him go," he caught me by my thumb, pressed it backwards from Glover's collar, and kicked me in the side—I became insensible—I had previous to that called out for assistance, and while I was insensible two civilians came to my assistance, and pulled Dyble off me—both the men were on me then—my hand is very much hurt—the skin is torn off—I was off duty two days—both the men had been drinking—I kept hold of Glover—Dyble made his escape, and was taken next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe it was an accident that your hand was hurt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was trampled on by one of them—the house was not closed—the shutters were up—it was eleven o'clock at night, and was rather dark—Glover knocked me down, fell on me, knelt on me, and pressed his knuckles against my throat—I struck him slightly with my staff—I had got up on my knees when Dyble came up—I am sure Dyble is the person—I had seen him inside—I have no recollection of fainting more than once; that was when I received the injury on my thumb, and the kick—I was on the ground then—some gentleman came to the station and complained of the conduct of these men—I know a man named Matterson, he was not there in my presence—I did not charge him with being the man who kicked me—he said on the following morning, "You might as well say it was me"—I can-not swear Dyble did not follow me to the station door, but he was not inside that night—there were two or three people standing drinking in the public-house, in front of the bar—I did not see them touch Thorn—I am sure it was the prisoner, and not Glover, who laid hold of my thumb—it was not so dark but that I could see that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Woolwich. On the 9th of April Wadlow called at my surgery—he was considerably bruised about the forehead, and had two black eyes—his right hand was a good deal torn and lacerated—the skin had been rubbed of the knuckles—the thumb of his left hand was severely sprained, which was followed by a good deal of inflammation—he complained of pain in his chest—the injuries were such as to keep him from duty several days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

The Walker who succeeded the deceased as Waiter at the Bagnio deposed, that a Gentleman that came to the Bagnio and enquired into the circumstances of the Fact, being Shew'd the Room in which it was done, examined the Door and Wainscot, and could not perceive any Marks of the 8 or 10 Passes made against it by the Prisoner, as had been deposed by.

               <p>I submit my self to your Lordship and this Honourable Bench; and I beg only your honourable Favour and Regard that as she Witness's for me swore positively to my being assaulted and that the Jury (to my, great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171901150008"></xptr> Misfortune) were not pleased to give Credit to the family your Lordship will make the most favourable Interpretation of it. But above all I desire your Lordship's notice, that there were many manifest Contradiction, in Vernassell's Evidence, and I may say Impossibilities in other of their Witnesses. Besides her denying on my Tryal that he did double lock the Door, which he swore he did before the Coroner, makes me with reason believe my Life has been maliciously sought; for I call God to Witness, I did not offer the least Violence to the Deceased till after I was struck and ill used by him. I submit my self to your Lordship, and hope your will make such favorable Report to his Majesty as may not obstruct, but leave room to apply to his Wisdom for Mercy.</p>

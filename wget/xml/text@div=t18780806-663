                  </hi>. I live at 34, Bridge Road, Ham<lb></lb>mersmith, and am a retired lieutenant-colonel in the British Army—in December, 1876, I was desirous of purchasing 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Egyptian stock; that was the nominal value—I did not buy it myself, I employed Mr. Byers, a stockbroker—the real value of it was 10, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid 369<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and arranged with Mr. Byers that he should effect a loan with the London and County Bank for 10,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for it—I gave Mr. Byers 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of London Chatham and Dover Stock to lodge with the London and County Bank for what they term a margin—the value of that roughly was between 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think the loan was for six months—I left the matter to be carried out by Mr. Byers—I afterwards had to arrange with Mr. Byers about renewing the loan—I was under the belief that the Egyptians had been purchased and deposited with the London and County Bank with the London Chatham and Dover stock, and that the loan had been effected on my behalf in the way I have mentioned—in September last year I arranged with Mr. Byers that the loan from the London and County Bank should be paid off, and a loan obtained from the Bank of England, and in consequence of what he stated to me about the extra margin required, I gave him 100 shares of the Lombardo-Venetian Railway; they were of the value of 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believed that the fresh loan had bean effected in that way—I think I first discovered' in March that my stock had not been deposited with the Bank of England—I communicated with my solicitor and the bank, and an inquiry took place, and I then instituted this prosecution against Gattie, Keymer being then out of the way—that was in the beginning of April—the result has been that I have parted with my London Chatham and Dover stock and the Lombards, and got nothing in exchange.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have known Mr. Byers several years—he had not acted for me before in matters of speculation—I knew he was not a member of the Stock Exchange—I employed Mr. Foster, a stockbroker, to purchase my London Chatham and Dover stock—that was no speculation—I was not aware who Mr. Byers was employing for the purpose of carrying out this transaction—I did not know that Mr. Foster had anything to do with the transaction in reference to the Egyptians—I don't know in what way Mr. Byers was to be recompensed for his trouble; there was no arrange<lb></lb>ment between us, I paid him nothing; he did it as a friend—I told him to buy 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptian stock—I knew he had purchased them, because I saw both the brokers through whom he purchased them, Mr. Foster and Mr. Davenport; he bought 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through each—I can't tell you the date when I ascertained from them that the speculation had been completed, I left it to Mr. Byers—I think it was at the latter end of 1876—I have not ascertained that the Egyptians were got rid of early in 1877; we have got some accounts which only came in on Saturday, which I think will explain it, but we have not had time to go into them; we got them from the accountants who were employed when Keymer was made bankrupt—I think those accounts disclose the transactions between Keymer and the brokers he employed—I only saw Keymer once in my life before this affair; that was on one occasion upon renewing the loan; some time in 1877, at Mr. Byers office—Keymer was the party negotiating the loan on the Egyptian stock and the Chatham and Dover, which was collateral security for the loan—I am not aware at what date the Lombards were sold; I don't know that they were sold for Keymer by a Mr. Sichell on 29th September last for 652<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the first loan with the London and County Bank was for six months; it may have been only for three; I don't remember—when the time for renewal came I left it with Mr. Byers and Mr. Keymer—I paid Mr. Keymer a commission—I think I paid him a cheque direct to himself, through Mr. Byers—I paid him on the first occasion 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, by cheque; I think I paid that through Mr. Byers—on the second occasion I paid him again by cheque, but the amount was reduced one-half; that was by an arrangement; that was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—on all these occasions I had no reason to doubt but what the loan was effected with the London and County Bank; I thought they had the Egyptians—Mr. Byers understood that they had; I don't remember that he actually told me so, he took it for granted; I was satisfied because he was satisfied they were there—I was satisfied with what he told me—I knew him very well for many years; he had been secretary to a company with which I was connected—I had no receipts for the commission I paid, the cheque itself would be a receipt—I have not got it here—I think it was in March I first heard something about this matter from Mr. Byers—at that time I think Keymer had left the country—it was after Christmas, 1877, that I first heard of the London Chatham and Dover stock having been converted—I don't remember when I first heard of Mr. Gattie with reference to this matter; it was from a commission from Mr. Byers, not from the Bank of England—I made inquiries at the Bank of England ultimately—Mr. Gattie had then been discharged—I think this was the only transaction I had through Mr. Byers's instrumentality.</p>

               <p>but not a member of the Stock Exchange—I became acquainted with Colonel Fielding in 1871—I had been buying and selling large quantities of stock, and keeping accounts for him; through members of the Stock Exchange, they of course paying me a commission on what business I brought—I kept the accounts; I acted as a kind of secretary to Colonel Fielding—in December, 1876, I was requested by Colonel Fielding to buy for him 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of Egyptian stock, and to try and obtain a loan on the deposit of that stock, and also 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. London Chatham and Dover stock belonging to Colonel Fielding, as a margin, without naming any bank—I arranged the loan through Mr. Foster, through whom 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was pur<lb></lb>chased, and Mr. Davenport bought the other 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Foster was to arrange the loan—I obtained from Colonel Fielding the transfer of the London Chatham and Dover stock, he handed them to Mr. Foster in my office, and Mr. Foster arranged the loan with Keymer and Co.—he did not deliver the Egyptian stock to me, I took no part in it after—I did not go to the London and County Bank—I did not know Keymer at that time—I had never seen him before—I was afterwards informed that the transaction had been carried out with the London and County Bank—the loan was for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the period was, I think, for three months—I am not sure the purchase<lb></lb>money was 10,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Colonel Fielding paid Mr. Foster a cheque for 367<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—10,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced—I got my commission from Mr. Foster and Mr. Davenport—I did not see Keymer till I heard of his failure—the loan had then been arranged—it was renewed for three or four months, perhaps six, up to September, 1877—I did not personally renew it, Colonel Fielding merely sent me his cheque to pay the commission, and I handed it over to Mr. Foster—I did not know Keymer in the transaction—I first saw him about May or June—nothing was arranged between us as to obtaining a loan from the Bank of England—I had casually asked him about Colonel Fielding's stock, that I hoped his failure had not affected it in any way—from the con<lb></lb>versation I had with him I believed that the Egyptian and Chatham and Dover stock was all right at the London and County Bank—it was ultimately arranged that a fresh loan should be obtained from the Bank of England to pay off the loan to the London and County Bank, because the Bank of England would do it cheaper—I agreed with Keymer in September that he should do that—he said that Egyptians had fallen in the market price, and consequently they required an extra margin of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for security—I communicated with Colonel Fielding and got from him 100 Lombards about the 27th or 28th September—I had seen Mr. Gattie before that—he called at my office, Mr. Keymer brought him, I should say a day or two before I got the Lombards—Keymer introduced him, he said that Mr. Gattie was a very old clerk in the Bank of England, and that he had facilities for pro<lb></lb>curing loans that other persons had not, and that he had arranged to renew this loan through the Bank of England, owing to his father's connection with it and his long servitude, and that his father used to sign the bank-notes—it was at that conversation that the extra margin was spoken of—I cannot recollect what further conversation passed—the Colonel was prepared to give any amount of margin that was required—when I got the Lombards I went to the Bank of England—Mr. Keymer enclosed me this letter first, it is dated 28th September: "Dear Keymer, I have got the transfers for the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Chathams, and also the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptians, please therefore send me the 100 Lombards. You will have to wait about an hour before I can give</p>

               <p>you a receipt.—Yours truly, Wm. Gattie." After that he called on me and we went to the Bank of England.; I took with me the 100 Lombards—I there saw Gattie in the bullion office behind the counter—I gave him the Lombards and he gave me the receipt (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Bank of England, Sept. 28, 1877. Received from Mr. William Gattie, per Messrs. Horace Keymer and Co., 12,680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Egyptian preference stock, 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptian unified stock, 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. London Chatham and Dover Railway stock, and 100 shares in the Lombardo-Venetian Co., as collateral security against an advance of 9, 427<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for four months, at the rate of 4 per cent per annum.—E. H. Palmer.") On reading that receipt I noticed that it did not state that it was Colonel Fielding's stock—Keymer said if I could come round to the bank he would see Mr. Palmer and get him to say the stock belonged to Colonel Fielding—he left Gattie and went with me to one of the offices of the Bank—he went round the corner and made some inquiry there, and I heard the reply distinctly that Mr. Palmer was out—we then returned to Gattie, and I told him that the receipt did not state that the stock belonged to Colonel Fielding—he said yes, and he proceeded to write, and Keymer said "I will write the receipt," and he then wrote the letter which Gattie signed in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the stock in question was the property of Colonel Fielding</hi>.) I assumed that the receipt was the genuine receipt of Mr. Palmer, and that the stock had been actually deposited by Keymer with the Bank of England—I enclosed the receipt to Colonel Fielding immediately I got them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. For some years, from 1871 up to the time of this trans<lb></lb>action, I had frequently made purchases of stock for Colonel Fielding, both speculative and for investment—the Egyptians were an investment—it was the beginning of December, 1876 that he first spoke to me with reference to the Egyptians—I heard only last Saturday that the Egyptians were disposed of to Taylor's early in 1877, and the Chatham and Dover stock in February, 1877, according to Messrs. Taylor's accounts; they are stockbrokers, with whom Keymer had transactions—in March, 1878, I heard from Gattie him<lb></lb>self that he had the Chatham and Dover stock in his possession—I don't think that was after Keymer had absconded—I got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission from Foster and Davenport—the Bank of England charged 3 1/2; per cent interest, and the London and County 4¼;—I don't know that that was the attraction—the attraction was this, that Keymer said he could get the stock renewed through the Bank of England, because Gattie was an old friend of Mr. Godrich, his partner's father, and he carrying on his monetary trans<lb></lb>actions through Gattie—I did not know Keymer previous to his failure—I knew him through Mr. Foster as a financial agent and stockbroker—I had every faith in him—I had no conversation with Gattie after the receipts were given—I had never seen him till he was introduced to me as I have described—Mr. Foster told me he had seen the stock paid over—I placed confidence in him—we had large transactions together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Gattie had dealings with Messrs. Taylor in other matters—Colonel Fielding was from time to time credited with the dividends on the stock up to the last renewal in January, 1878.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060006"></xptr>
               <p>bank notes—I was under the belief that the Egyptian stock had been deposited with the London and County Bank for the loan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had known Keymer about a year and half previous to this transaction—he appeared to be a very energetic young man in business, and I should think very clever—I had no other transaction with him—I had acted frequently for Colonel Fielding and Mr. Byers—the cheque Keymer gave me was on the London and County Bank; it was signed "Horace Keymer and Co."—I was aware that he had an account there and at Glyn's—he said that it was in consequence of his having an account at the London and County that he thought he might be able to obtain facilities for advance from them—I walked on with him to Glyn's, and waited outside—he said, "They do not care about lending on Egyptians, but I have no doubt my other bankers will do it," and he brought out a piece of paper, and said, "That is what they will do it at; I have just had an interview with the manager"—I have been engaged on Stock Exchange transactions over 20 years—Mr. Keymer was a person who conveyed to me the impression that he had means, and substance, and position, because he had a partner who was stated to have forty or fifty thousand pounds—he said his particular business was financial, not Stock Exchange—he had three or four partners, very large offices, and he banked at the Bank of England, I understood, at one time, besides Glyn's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I understood that from him, either directly or indirectly—he gave me the idea of having plenty of money and plenty of means to get loans—I knew Mr. Goodrich, one of his partners, who is the son of a very rich man—the firm was Horace Keymer and Co.</p>

I shall be 24 in November—in 1876 I carried on business with Mr. Goodrich and Mr. Dalgairns as Keymer and Co.—Mr. Goodrich's father had capital and we had capital in the business besides—we were stockbrokers and financial agents—I was not a member of the Stock Exchange—I had a private account, and the firm banked at Glyn's, the London and County, and the National Provincial—</p>

               <p>Mr. Foster consulted me about obtaining a loan—that was the first trans<lb></lb>action with him—the securities were to be these Egyptian and Chatham and Dover stocks—I went to Glyn's—they would not advance the money—I went to the London and County, and Mr. Howard, the manager, agreed to advance 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the London Chatham and Dover stock—we had a balance at the London and County Bank—I gave Mr. Foster a cheque for 5,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Mr. Davenport a cheque for 5, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed to my credit—we retained the Egyptian stock—my partner, Mr. Dalgairns, is about 40 years of age—he is now, I believe, in Italy—he signed the document in respect of this loan—I found myself in difficulties, and having been called upon to pay the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I sold the stock hoping to be able to replace it—that was on 1st January, 1877, or December, 1876—the loan was for three months, and when the three months expired we took up the stock and sold it—the Egyptian stock was ultimately sold—the value of the Chatham and Dover stock was then about 4, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Egyptian about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—on my liquidation in May, which was very sudden, Mr. Byers and Mr. Foster came to me and asked what I was going to do with respect to the loan—they seemed anxious on account of Colonel Fielding—I assured them the stock was at the bank—Mr. Foster asked me for Mr. Goodrich's address—I did not want Mr. Foster to go to Mr. Goodrich's house, so I gave him the address of Mr. Frederick Goodrich, my own partner—Mr. Foster went away—a long time afterwards Mr. Byers told me that he had been to the London and County Bank and had ascertained that the stock had been sold—he said he did not want to hurt me, but something must be done, and if I could state that the stock was all light and could be replaced in three months, he would take my word for it and would let the matter be renewed for three months—about 27th September, 1877, I went to the prisoner Gattie, at the Bank of England, and asked him to become a nominal holder of the London Chatham and Dover and Egyptian stocks—Gattie agreed that the stock should be transferred into his name, and that he should lend money on it—nothing was said about the Bank of England—I may have mentioned Mr. Palmer, but not Mr. Palmer of the Bank of England—Gattie said as he was incurring no liability, nor infringing any rule he should be willing to do it—I told him he would have a commission—that was all the inducement Gattie had—Mr. Byers afterwards requested to see Mr. Gattie, and I took him to Mr. Gattie's office, and Mr. Gattie said what I told him, that he had heard that I wanted an advance of, I think, 9,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he could get it—Mr. Byers agreed to give the requisite security for the 100 Lombard shares, but that there must be a margin—nothing was said about the Bank of England—Gattie merely acted as the nominal holder of the stock—on the 28th I went with Mr. Byers to the Bank with the shares—Gattie had nothing to do with drawing up the receipt—I drew that up—that is why I have pleaded guilty—Gattie did not know its terms—he has not seen it—the receipt was given to Mr. Byers in an envelope—I am not sure whether the envelope was fastened—the letter referring to Mr. Palmer as "your director" is my writing, but the words "a director of the Bank of England" I added afterwards at Mr. Byers's request—I left the country on 17th March—Mr. Gattie did not know the receipt was forged.</p>

I think—it had been owing some time—I had not pressed him for payment—I also had some stock-broking transactions with him—I had a stock account with him, which began the end of 1877 or the beginning of 1878—he owed me 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then for differences—I know Mr. Alexander, of 2, St. Michael's House, Cornhill—I think he is a director of some company—I decline to answer questions about my transactions with him—it might criminate me.</p>

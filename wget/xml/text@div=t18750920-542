                  </hi>. I live at 5, North Place, West Square—my husband died in January, 1874—I have known the prisoner over two years—we kept a general shop, and he frequently came there during my husband's life, and after his death—he sometimes came there two or three time a day—he promised my husband when he was dying that he would give an eye to the shop, and he did help me—in May this year he said that his wife was dead and he should expect to have me, and, if he could not, no one else should—he frequently asked me to marry him, but I always refused him—the last time he asked me was on the morning this occurred—I had a collar of his to wash, and on 15th August I took it to his house, in Ely Place, St. George's Road—the street door was open, and I went to his room door and knocked—he said "Come in"—he was lying on the floor just inside the door; he had sold his furniture, and there was no bed—he spoke first—he said "I have not been in above ten minutes; I have been out all night"—I said "You must be foolish to stop out spending your money; you will want it to keep you next week; I cannot stop now, I am going into the London Road"—I laid the collar on a box—he said "Wait a minute," and ran towards the door and turned the key, and then he held his hands over his shoulders, clasping his hands, and said "I don't know what is the matter with me"—that frightened me (I had been frightened of him some times because he threatened that if he could not have me himself no one else should, for he would do for me)—he then pushed me against the window with his left hand; his right—hand was in his right trousers pocket—I turned my head, and felt a razor go across my throat—I said "Oh, you have cut my throat"—I did not see the razor till I took it from his hand and threw it down by the box; it was a white handled one—the blood poured from my throat like a fountain—he seemed staggered for a few minutes, and I gave him a push with one hand, turned the key with the other, got into the passage, and screamed "Murder!"—he got hold of me again in the passage, and I got hold of his whiskers—Mrs. Maynard and another woman then came to my assistance, and the next thing I remember is coming to my senses in St. Thomas's Hospital—I received this paper in pencil (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 24th or 25th August—it is in the prisoner's writing—he writes two or three hands, but this is the hand he generally writes.</p>

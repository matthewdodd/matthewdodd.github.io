                  </hi>. The prisoner was my servant, and was authorized by me to receive small weekly bills on my account, which he should account for immediately, as soon as he returned home, to me, or my wife—she is not here—I have the cash-book with me—he never paid me any money that is not entered in the cash-book—he paid no money on the 29th of December—It is entered in the cash-book—"No cash" is in my wife's handwriting that day—he did not tell me he received these sums from Mrs. Robson—he used to come home about six o'clock in the afternoon, I think—if I was out, he would pay me next morning—he had paid nothing from Mrs. Robson on the 30th—her name is not at all in the book between the 29th of December and the 5th of January—my wife and myself keep the book under his inspection—the entry on the 5th of January is Mrs. Nelson's—here is no entry from Mrs. Robson—on the 29th December there is entered. "No cash for three days," in my wife's hand-writing—It means that the prisoner paid no cash for three days—on the 5th of January there are two entries, one is "Johnson 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and the other 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that entry relates to the prisoner, the whole of this account refers to him—we send him out with all the bills every Monday morning—the book was always before him when we asked him about his receipts—there is no entry on the 11th or 5th of January.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I remember the dates of payment very well, because I had the two first bills—Mr. Nelson sent me a bill for the whole three weeks after the prisoner left, and then I said I had paid him—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. The book was always open to his inspec<lb></lb>tion, and he was always asked if he had any more to enter—he paid over whatever he stated he had received—I am not aware that he was ever de<lb></lb>ficient in money which he said he had received—I have nothing to show he did not pay it, except the book—I discharged the prisoner of my own accord—I had some conversation with him about his accounts—I said I would not pay him the balance of his wages, as I suspected his accounts were not correct—he called on me on a Sunday morning in January, to ask whose was not correct—I said, "I do not believe Mrs. Robson's is correct, as she pays so regularly"—he said it was so, but that was the only one he was deficient in—that he had taken the money and not se<lb></lb>counted for it—he left me in the middle of January—it was the Sunday after the 14th—he said it was the only account he had received the money for and not accounted for—my ledger was open, and the amount was pointed out to him—he gave no reason why he did not account for it—I owed him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a fortnight's wages—I used to pay him once a week, always keep<lb></lb>ing a week's wages in my own hand—if he received Mrs. Robson's money on the Monday it was his duty to account for it the same day—he had what bread, flour, and potatoes he wanted—there was always a week's wages in arrear—there was a fortnight's due when he left, but I refused to pay it on account of his deficiency—I generally paid him on Saturday or Sunday morning—he did not state that he was in want of money—I have often had bills returned as incorrect, there being more charged then the customers had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The first week I went into his service he took 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my wages—the second week 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which made 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he held in hand all the time I was with him—on the Sunday morning, as I was leaving, I asked him for my wages, which was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—he said he would not pay me, as I was not right in my account; but when I returned from Bridghton he said he would keep Mrs. Robson's bill back, but pay me the difference—he says the book was always shown to me—it never was, and Mrs. Nelson very frequently made mistakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. NELSON</hi> re-examined. I said if I found his account right I would pay him the whole—I do not recollect saying I would keep Mrs. Robson's account back, and pay him the difference—I never knew my wife make mistakes—the book was always on the counter before the prisoner, and whenever I took money I always gave it to him to look over and see that it was right—I did not intend at first to charge this as a felony, but to de<lb></lb>duct it from his wages.</p>

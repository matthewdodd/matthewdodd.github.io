                  </hi>. My husband keeps the George and Vulture public home at Wapping-wall—I had seen the prisoner several times before I detected her—on 9th Oct. she came for a pint of ale—she paid me with a half crown—I gave her change, and put the half crown away in a piece of paper in the cupboard—after the prisoner was gone I examined it, and found it was bad—I had thought it was bad when I took it, which made me put it where I did—the prisoner came again on Saturday evening, the 13th—she had a quartern of gin in a bottle, and gave me a half crown again—I wrapped that in a piece of paper, and put it in the cupboard with the other—I afterwards examined it, and found it bad—I sent it to a pawnbroker to inquire—I then wrapped the two half crowns in separate papers, and at last I gave them to the constable.</p>

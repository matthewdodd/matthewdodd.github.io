                  </hi>. I am clerk to James Norris and Mr. Johnson, in Upper Thames-street, stationers. On the 20th of November a person was waiting in the warehouse to see my master, and the prisoner was waiting outside—the one not in custody came in under the pretence of selling goods to master, and had been there an hour and a half—our carman came in and went backwards, and there was only me left in the warehouse—I saw the one inside, hand a ream of paper out at the door to the prisoner who was outside—he ran away with it—I directly ran after him—a gen<lb></lb>tleman tried to stop him—he knocked him down, but he was stopped again at the top of the lane—I kept my eye on him, and am sure he is the man.</p>

I recollect a man coming in on the morning of the 20th of November, about half-past ten o'clock, to sell some shavings—he waited there an hour and a half or two hours to see Mr. Norris or Mr. Johnson—he said either of them would do-he brought a sample of shavings—I observed the prisoner outside several times, nearly all the time the other was waiting inside.</p>

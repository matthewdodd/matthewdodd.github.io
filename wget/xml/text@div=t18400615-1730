               <p>street? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. A month—Mr. West, a porter at the Birmingham Station, keeps the house—I am out of a situation—I worked at Euston-square Station for seven weeks, till last Saturday—I worked for Mr. Regnal, of Whitechapel, before that—the two girls went in with us to No. 6—we did not go to the house and ask for girls—I did not see any of the prisoner's money while I was there—we had been at a public-house near Phonix<lb></lb>alley for about an hour or more, drinking—we were in two public-houses before that—we had half-a-quartern of gin in the first—we did not stop there, nor in the second—we had some gin there—we had two or three glasses of wine at the third public-house, no gin—I did not see any one besides Allen when I came down stairs at No. 6—I will swear there were not more persons—the servant was not there, that I swear—I do not recollect how Allen was dressed—be had a coat on—I cannot tell what colour it was—I do not know where Brown hit him—after he fell the other man picked him up—it was Oldham—be and Oldham ran away together—Allen ran into the house right up the yard—I did not complain of losing my money, nor did Brown that I heard.</p>

                  </hi>I am a gold-beater, and life in Great Wild-street. I saw Brown and Allen scuffling in the passage of the house—it appeared to me that the prosecutor was endeavouring to expel Brown from the house—he shoved him out—they came into the middle of the alley—they then pulled their coats off—Allen threw his into the middle of the alley—a female picked it up—they were fighting all down the alley, till they came to the bottom—Brown then came to me and asked me to see him righted—I told him I had rather not have any thing to do with such things—they west into the middle of Hart-street to have another round, and after adjusting their sleeves they had a round—I saw the prisoner strike—I do not think there was more than one blow in Hart-street—he knocked the prosecutor down—I could not see a knife in his hand—there was a lamp nearly oppo<lb></lb>site Madame Vestris's stage-door—it was very light—I could see nothing of a knife—there were four persons in the road—Brown, his friend, the prosecutor and his friend, and a sidesman a-piece—there might be a dozen or twenty others in the court—there was nobody in tht middle of the road but them four—the people stood in the footpath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Was Theakston there? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—he is the man I call Brown's friend—I did not see him at the time of the scuffle in the passage—I did not see him come out of the house—there are two doors to the house, an outer and inner door—if he was in the house he must have been beyond the door, for I could not see him—the prisoner and. Allen were scuffling—Allen goes by the name of Carter sometimes—I did not see any one present while they were scuffling—I saw no knife in Allen's hand—when the prisoner knocked Allen down, Oldham picked him up, and then Allen ran away as hard as he could up the alley into his mother's house—Oldham and Brown followed him—Brown fell down.</p>

                  </hi>I am an attorney, and live in Child's<lb></lb>place, Temple-bar. I was employed by the prisoner to recover some money—I paid him between 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday afternoon before</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. They were not stripped when I saw them fighting together—I think Allen had his coat on when I picked him up—the prisoner had his coat off—whether Allen had I cannot say—I think be had it on when I took him up, and carried him to the house—I did not take him in—he went off by himself, and then the prisoner and the other man ran after me—he showed symptoms of being insensible while I held him in my arms.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I hare examined the prosecutor's clothes—the holes in the waistcoat correspond with the wound on the left-side of the chest, but those on the coat are lower down—I should think the shock of such a blow would cause a man to fall—there would fee sufficient loss of blood to cause faintness.</p>

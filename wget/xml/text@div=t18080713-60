               <p>Q. On the 20th of May at night what time did you leave the accompting house - A I left it at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time what money was there in the desk - A. Twenty six pounds in bank notes, and about thirty three pounds in cash; seven shilling pieces, half guineas, two guineas, and eight pounds in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. In the iron chest was there any quantity of copper - A. Yes; they were tied up in five shillings and half crown papers, halfpence and penny pieces; they were in blue and brown paper. I shut the outer accounting house door at ten o'clock, which is for the accommodation of the officers. I left the inner accounting house secured. The accounting house and dwelling house is all under one roof, it is a continuation of my house. The clerk sleeps over the accounting house; it is inclosed within my gates.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour the next morning were you alarmed - A. A little before five o'clock. When I came down I found the second door of the inner accounting house forced open; the first accounting house door they had not touched; a man can come to the second door without going to the first, there is a passage to it; the second accounting house door had been forced open, the staple broke, and the lock wrenched; it had the appearance as if done with an iron crow. I found the door that goes to the desk forced open, my desk and my partners throwed back and broken open. The money and the bank notes that I have spoken of, were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the iron chest broken open - A. I cannot say; the copper was kept in the iron chest; the iron chest has been opened, and the money was gone; the key was in my desk; the papers were throwed about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130042"></xptr>and by the side of the iron chest was a dark lanthorn. The lock of the wicket gate was forced; it must have been a violent wrench to break it open. The prisoner came to work that day a little after six o'clock; he took no notice of the accounting house being broke open; I said nothing to him; he went to his work, I did not cause him to be apprehended till the Monday following, then I went to his lodgings; I found penny pieces and half crowns, with some blue paper along with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him by what means he became possessed of that money - A. I did; he said it was what he and his wife had saved from their hard earnings.</p>
               <p>Q. How much a week did this man have settled wages - A. Eighteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Court. Persons employed in a brewer's service if they had a mind to save copper, would save it in that manner - A. Yes. He told me he had no more money than that which he had taken from him; he was released on the Saturday following. On the Thursday following he was apprehended again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How much money had he about him then - A. I think between seven and eight pounds in gold, seven shilling pieces, half guineas, two or three half crowns, and two shillings; I cannot speak positively to the sum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then find at his lodging any new articles that you did not find at the first time - A. Several, there were sheeting, tablecloth, a new coat and waistcoat, and small clothes, to the value of between four and five pounds.</p>

            . Q. You are a police officer of Hatton garden office - A. Yes. I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of May, about the middle of the day. I searched his lodgings on the Monday; I found there seventy six penny pieces, thirty two halfpence, a dollar, ten half crowns, and seventeen shillings; this was the first search; one half guinea, and four seven shilling piecet, and some blue paper, it had been apparently cut as if to put halfpence in. He was set at liberty on the Saturday following, and he was apprehended on the 3d. of June; I then secured him; I asked him what he had got about him; he said a little silver he believed in this purse; I found it in his left hand breeches pocket, three half crowns, and two shillings, he seemed very restless; I said let us see what you have got in your watch pocket; I found these five half guineas, and ten seven shilling pieces; I secured him, and the prosecutor and I went to the prisoner's lodgings again; on searching I found three small pieces of linen for shirting, a tablecloth, a new pocket handkerchief, three pair of cotton stockings, and a new coat, waistcoat, and breeches, which was not there on the first search.</p>
               <p>Q. What in your opinion must have been the cost of all these articles, including the clothes - A. From four to five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the money that you found before - A. No, the box was empty. On the following day I asked the prisoner what he had done with the money that he had returned to him; he said the money was laid out for these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by this money you found on the second search - A. He said he had saved it by his hard work.</p>
               <p>COURT, to prosecutor. Q. Did it appear to you that in the way it had been done that the person, whoever it was that did it, must have known the premises - A. Yes. There were two other desks belonging to the clerks which were not touched.</p>

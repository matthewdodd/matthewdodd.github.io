The prisoner lived servant with me about five or weeks, and in that time we missed several hats. I saw some hats in the privy, they had no business to be there. That was about the 17th of April. I watched and saw that they decreased. I saw the prisoner come from the privy and go out. After the prisoner went out I went to the privy, and there was one hat gone. He was gone from the shop about an hour. When he returned I spoke to him. In the course of an hour or two I asked him how he could think of robbing me in the way he had done a considerable time. His answer was, he hoped I would let him go. He pleaded his family, and said he had six children. I told him, as he had robbed me in that kind of way I could not think of letting him go. I sent for the constable. He delivered to the constable five duplicates.</p>

            . I bought that roan mare of the prisoner at the bar, in last December: I cheapened her at Morton-in-Marsh; he said he was going into Herefordshire, and his mare fell lame; he said he gave eight guineas for her; I gave him 2 l. 13 s. 6 d. to boot, between a mare of mine and that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you value yours at?</p>
               <p>George. I valued mine at 4 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you his name?</p>
               <p>George. He told me his name was Holloway, and that he lived at Hampstead; I kept her near five weeks, then I sold her; and I believe it was about three months after that, that I saw her in the possession of Mr. Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that mare which Mr. Morris had is the same that you bought of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>George. I am sure she is the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe her.</p>
               <p>George. She had a small matter a star in her forehead; one of her feet had a few white hairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I did not deal with Mr. George for that mare. In the latter end of November I bought a mare going down into Wales; on my return I swaped her with a man on the road, but not this mare. I know nothing of the matter. I gave 6 l. or 6 l. 10 s. for that I bought.</p>

            . The prisoner was my servant some time: I never was more surprized in my life than when I heard of this: he came to me on the 8th of November, 1756. I had a very good character of his honesty and sobriety from the gentleman he lived with before; and at the latter end of the year 1757, I went to Bath, and not having occasion for his service, I discharged him. At my return from Bath, I quitted my house at Hampstead; he desired me to recommend him to the gentleman, my successor, as a gardener: I did, and he was behaved very honest. The little place I had was in his care. The gentleman that took my house left it some time after, and the prisoner came to me, and desired me to recommend him to my Lady

            . I went to her since, and enquired of her whether he deserved that good character: she let me know the man had behaved well in her service, and she looked upon him as an honest man: and when she discharged him she recommended him to another successor in her house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Say. I have known him ten years; he was a servant to me as a gardener: during that time, which was about two years, he behaved always as a faithful honest servant, such as I would now admit into my family, did I want.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he left your service?</p>
               <p>Mr. Say. He has left it about ten years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Renshaw. I have known him five or six years. I live at Hampstead; he lived there in the capacity of a gardener; I have known him in several families there; I have trusted him in my garden and house since Christmas for three weeks at a time; I never knew him to be dishonest; he is a hard labouring man; I never heard any body give him a bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Mr. Renshaw. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever keep horses?</p>
               <p>Mr. Renshaw. I never knew him to have a horse in his possession in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a stable?</p>
               <p>Mr. Renshaw. No, he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he farm any ground?</p>
               <p>Mr. Renshaw. No, he does not, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was taken up on Whitsunday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gammon. I have known him ten years; he has lived some years at Hampstead, as a gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character.</p>
               <p>Gammon. I never heard but that he was a very honest man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100024"></xptr>Mr. Jones. I am a publican at Hampstead; the prisoner used my house about two years; he is a very sober honest man, as ever came into my house. If I trusted him a shilling or two he always paid me very honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what time he went into the country.</p>
               <p>Jones. He went down about Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he set out on horseback or on foot?</p>
               <p>Jones. I don't know which; I remember he talked of going down to see his friends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went down into Wales, and bought a mare at a place called Tarney. She fell lame, and I changed with this man: she cost me 6 l. 10 s.</p>

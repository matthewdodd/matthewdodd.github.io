                  </hi>. In January last, I was warehouseman to Mr. Do<lb></lb>nald ald Maclean; his warehouse is in Basinghall-street. We began taking stock on the 30th of December and finished in January—before we had completed it, the prisoner, who was in my master's service, said to me, then were three coat lengths that he had taken out to sell, which he would return the same night or the money for them, if I would put them down as being in the house—I made the entry as he requested, trusting to his honesty—I frequently afterwards spoke to him about them, and he pro<lb></lb>mised me they should come back in a few days or a week, or so on—they were not brought back—I told him on the 18th of April, that if he did not bring them back, I would tell my father; but J had told my father of it—the prisoner said he would bring them back the same night or the next morning, and if I would be there at a quarter before nine o'clock the next morning, I should see the goods—I was there the next morning—they were not there, and the prisoner was gone—I told Mr. Maclean of it on the 19th—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—it was his business to be at the warehouse at half-past eight o'clock.</p>

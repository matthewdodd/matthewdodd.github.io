               <p>Q. Was your house broken open on the 19th of January last - A. On the 20th, about two in the morning, I was awakened by hearing a noise in the shop; I immediately got up and looked out of a two pair of stairs window; the two pair of stairs is very low; upon looking out of the window I saw two men in the street' I called out watch; no watchman came; the prisoner looked up in my face for near five minutes; there was another man, he got out of the window; there was three of them altogether; two of them went towards Swallow street, and the prisoner ran down Argyle street; the two men went down Swallow street with a bag of the things they had taken from the shop; when I saw the three men run off I went down stairs and examined the shop immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How had it been broken open - A. One end shutter was forced down, and the pane of glass was broken; they put their hands in and unpinned one of the front shutters; they then cut a pane of glass out; the pane is very large, large enough to admit the body of a man; the man got into the shop. When I came down stairs I missed all the articles stated in the indictment; the value of them altogether was between twenty four and twenty five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these things in the shop - A. The night before, about ten o'clock, I had seen them all there; I fastened the shop up myself; the shutters were put up and the windows were whole at ten o'clock. I am confident the prisoner is the man that stood at the door; the snow was on the ground, and the lamp at the door being directly over his face, gave sufficient light for me to distinguish his features.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be looking at him - A. Near five minutes; he was looking up the whole time, I could see his features completely; had I have met the man in the street for this twelvemonth I should be confident of the man; he had a velveteen jacket and small clothes, the same that he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a waistcoat had he on - A. I could not tell, his jacket was buttoned.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he shoes or boots on - A. I could not see, nor his stockings I could not see what they were; he had the same dress on when I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>JURY. Are we to form an opinion, that while you were looking out of your two pair of stairs window, and was calling out watch, that the man remained five minutes staring up at you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not he come voluntary to the office, he and a man of the name of Flowers came without being in custody, he had been waiting at the public house - when you come Griffiths went to the public house and brought the man over - A. He did; I said that is the man, in the yard, when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You would wish us to believe that the man came in the same dress - give me leave to ask you whether you do not know that there is a reward of forty pounds - A. I have lived long enough in my country to know that there is a reward; I do not do it for the sake of the reward; I have heard there is a reward of twenty pounds for the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was one article of your property found - A. Not a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were robbed was it that the prisoner was taken - A. It was seven days after the robbery that he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up another man - A. Flowers was brought to the office for me to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not any body else taken upon your information - A. There was not; I could not swear to any other; I did not see any of their faces but the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150042"></xptr>Q. You continue to be positive to the man, and that he continued looking at you for that time - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat had he on - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man had a cocked hat an you must know it - A. He had a round hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man stood under you, having a round hat on, the flap would of necessity obscure his face - A. No, unless it was bent down it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. You, in a two pair of stairs window above him, the light of the lamp between you and him, the light of the lamp must fall upon the flap of his hat, that must shade his face - you said he had a round hat on - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer of the public office, Whitechapel. I received information from the other end of the town that a shop had been broken open in Oxford street; I sent to a person of the name of Flowers, and desired him to call up to me; he did, at the public house near the office; I told him that there was a complaint against him and a man of the name of Greenaway; I asked him if he would call upon him and bring him to me on the Friday; they did come to the house at time appointed; I said not a word about this; the reason of my desiring them to come was upon my receiving this information. I desired them to wait till two, and if the gentleman did not come by that time, they should go home; they did stay, and just before two Mr. Southey came to the office; Mr. Southey described the person of the prisoner to me, he said he was dressed in a velveteen jacket and breeches; I fetched the men; he looked at the two men, they were both in the same dress partly; he pointed out this man, he said he would swear to him; then I told them to walk into the office, I would put them both to the bar, which I did; an examination took place; he positively sworn to this man before the magistrate; the other was discharged. My brother searched the prisoner's lodging, no part of the property was found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent as a lamb - so far from my being in connexion with any one in that robbery, the night after the robbery was done, I was obligated to pawn my bed for two pounds to support my wife that was lying in, and my five children. I am innocent in ever having acted hand or part, or even knowing the part of the town where he was robbed; my circumstances were so low I could not afford any body to look after my wife; I was obligated to make away with my things to support her.</p>

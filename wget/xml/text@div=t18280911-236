The prisoner was in their employ on the 25th of August; I know this mat to be their property - they had received it with some things a few days before; I had not quite unsewn it, and when it was returned it was exactly in the same state - I cannot speak to the other things, but one of them has the name on; they are all such articles as they sell.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Granges. On Monday, the 25th of August, I was desired to follow the prisoner, which I did to his own house; I then asked him how he came to take the mat, which was then under his arm - he said he thought it was of little or no value; it was charged to us about 2s. or 2s. 3d. - these tools were found in the prisoner's house by the constable, in my presence; I believe them to be my employers'.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What was the right thing to do with that mat? A. To take it to an out-house, where we keep such things - we use them in packing, but not very often; the prisoner had been three or four years in our employ, and had a good character.</p>

On the 5th of July; about four o'clock, in the afternoon, the prisoner came into bar shop, accompanied by a female friend of her's; the friend purchased some articles, and as the prisoner was going out of the shop, I found information, asked the prisoner if she had any property that did not belong to her; she denied having any thing but what was her own; I told her the constable was present, I should give charge of her; She immediately ran to the bottom or the warehouse; I saw one shawl drop from her; the constable took hold of her round the bottom of her waist, and found four more shawls upon her.</p>

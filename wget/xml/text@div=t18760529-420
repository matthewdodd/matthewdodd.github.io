                  </hi>. I keep the Lord Napier public-house, "Victoria Dock Road, West Ham—on the night of 29th April I went to sleep in'the evening—I was lying on the sofa, being very bad, and I could not see from the glare of the bar—about 10 o'clock I was partly dosing—the door from the bar parlour was not shut, the window was shut, but not fastened—the gas in the room was at just a glimmer; I put it down very low because of my eyes—I woke up about 10.30—I could not see for a while—I could not get my. sight very plain, but I thought I saw a man over by the chiffonier—I caught him and said "What are you doing here?"—he said "Give me a d——d good hiding and let me go"—I turned round and called out to the barman to come and fetch a policeman—I no sooner let him go than he made his exit through the window, which was open—it is a very little height from the ground and leads into the yard—the people go through into the yard from the bar—the man afterwards came back the same way—I went to the station and charged him—I saw him searched and saw what was found on him—he made no answer to the charge—I found the staple had been broken from the back gates where the padlock goes—the doors were already open at the back, it leads into New Road—the gate is usually shut, except when beer or spirits are coming in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said something about that at the police-court—there is a convenience in the yard, but that is closed—there is one way to it for the men from the bar, and one from my room; directly you get through the tap-room there is a door—a person going to my bar parlour would not have to go through the tap-room—I cannot tell if anyone else came in my room when I was asleep—I did not say at the police-court "I was lying down on the sofa in my parlour; I had been asleep and was woke up"—I was very angry when I got up and rather frightened too—I didn't tell him I would strangle him or throttle him—I asked him what business he had in my private room—I didn't say I would give him a good thrashing, nor did he say "You cannot give me a thrashing because I have done nothing wrong"—he didn't say he thought it was the way to the yard—I didn't think he had come in by the window till I saw him go out—I stood so, so that he should not go out at the door, and directly I let go of him he went out through the window—the sofa was close under the window.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The window was examined afterwards, and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> that they have got, just fitted in the place where he prized the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Kitchen—about 10.30 on the Saturday night, he called to me from his private room to go for a police<lb></lb>man, and as I was going he said "He has gone through the window"—I went into the back yard and saw the prisoner making away to escape; I caught him going to the tap-room—I held him, and he asked me to let him go to fetch his hat—I went with him and he picked it up dose to the window—he said "I will go back the same way I came out," and he got in at the window; then I went round and saw him in my master's grasp—I</p>

               <p>had fastened all the doors and got the key in the bar—the staple on the back door had been removed—I fastened it up at 8 o'clock, when it was in proper condition—no one had been into the parlour while my master was asleep—the door is kept by the passage key so you could not go in that way—there is one entrance to the parlour; not two doors—nobody could go in without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear the prisoner say he was going to the back—ho said that he was drunk and had made a fool of himself—I gave evidence at the police-court—I don't remember anything being said then about a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> matching the window.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not there when the detective examined the window—I heard Mr. Kitchen say something about it on Monday morning at the Stratford court—I am stationed at Poplar, so should not be there on Sunday morning—I heard some of the evidence at the police-court; I heard the detective give his evidence—I didn't hear him say a single word about fitting <hi rend="italic">a jemmy</hi> to the window—I cannot say that Mr. Kitchen said any<lb></lb>thing about it.</p>

Gleed marked one shilling, and two sixpence, and gave them to me. I and King went to the corner of Essex-street; a short man came up and spoke to King, he left us, and came up again with the prisoner, the short man told me to go to the side of the prisoner, and he would give me the things; I went, the prisoner asked how many I wanted, I said seven. The short man then said, we only wanted to play tricks with them, and began to abuse me, we left them, and as we went up Osborne-street, the short man came up and said, "When can you get the other money?" He could not let me have less than forty, and for them I was to give ten shillings; the prisoner was not with him, I said in about an hour, I then went down Brick-lane, to Slater-street, Gleed followed, and gave me eight marked shillings, I returned him one of the sixpences he before gave me. We then went towards Essex-street, I met the prisoner before I got to the corner, he asked if I had got the money? I said, "Yes." I gave him nine shillings, and two sixpences, and he gave me a paper, containing the counterfeit money. Gleed came up, took us into a public-house, took the counterfeit money from me, and the good from him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I and Gleed applied to Isaacson, we all met at the Seven Stars, public-house, and marked one shilling, and three sixpences, and gave them to Isaacson; he and King went together, we followed them, and in a few minutes, I saw the prisoner, and another Jew, conversing with them, we were on the opposite side, they went towards Osborne-street. The prisoner parted from the other, we followed Isaacson to Slater-street, and gave him eight shillings, and took a bad one from him, we followed him into Petticoat-lane; Gleed took the prisoner and him in charge.</p>

            . The last witnesses account is correct. I saw Isaacson with the prisoner, and saw something pass between them; I seized Barnett's hand, and found all the marked money in it, and a bad shilling in his pocket. I found a paper on Isaacson, containing thirty-nine shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. The shillings are all counterfeit, of the same die, and have never been in circulation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the first batallion of Grenadier Guards. I was at the Forresters' Arms on Saturday the 6th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—Wiltshire came in and asked me if her hus<lb></lb>band was in the hospital—I had seen her before, and knew the person whom she described—I said I believed he was—Shea then came in—Wiltshire spoke to her, and I gave her some beer—Wiltshire then went away, and came back—I staid there till six—I then went away with the two prisoners and another woman—while I was going down Gloucester-place, talking to Wilt<lb></lb>shire, I felt my right hand coat-skirt fall—Shea was walking close behind me—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse and four half-crowns, and a small metal seal—Wiltshire was at that time close to me, and had hold of my arm—Shea was about a pace in the rear of me—when I turned I ac<lb></lb>cused Shea of taking my purse—she said she had not, and she ran away—I caught her, and took her to the Sovereign, in Park-row—I found Wiltshire there—I saw Wiltshire throw my purse on the ground—it had my seal still in it, but no money.</p>

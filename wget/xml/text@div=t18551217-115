               <p>of my innocence, and trout to my own arguments, from whence you will draw your own inference; when I left home, I left behind me that which I can scarcely do without, an eye glass, and left the necessary amount of cash which might have been wanted for any expenses; I went to the station, and you heard the question I put about the egress or ingress; You are was that the northern side is for persons going down the line, and the southern side for persons coming up the line, and there are two passages lead down from the front of the building—this occurrence took place in the middle of the day, 5 or 10 minutes before 12 o'clock; there was no throng, nothing to induce a person to commit any robbery; you all hear that I went in and sat down, and a person came in dressed as a traveler, and placed under the table several packages, and a railway wrapper; if I had been dishonestly inclined it would have been sheer madness on my part to take up these things in presence of so many persons—but I expected my friend there, and sat immediately opposite the door watching for him—when this gentle<lb></lb>man came in with his luggage, I thought I detected my friend in him, and I followed him to look for him; not being able to find him, I came back, and then not being certain, I went out again and came back—I then sud<lb></lb>denly bethought myself that he might hare gone to the lobby to obtain his ticket, and as my intention was to ask him to take me to Stratford with, him, I thought there was no harm in taking these things to him—now it appears that this was a trap to detect some shabby fellow who stole a clergy-man's portmanteau; when they saw me they could not say I was a shabby fellow, and the very clever man who took me, if he thought I was going to leave these premises, do You think he would have laid hold of me there; no, he would have let me have gone down and get into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and followed me to my destination; if he had thought for one moment I was a thief, that is the line of conduct he would have pursued; but Mr. Bale knew I did not intend to leave the premises with these things, he saw that I was going towards the pay place, and he knew very well I must have thought if I did not see somebody I was looking after, I should come back to the wait<lb></lb>ing room again; but a victim was to be caught, and there had been com<lb></lb>plaints of non-performance of duty in looking after persons in that waiting room, and therefore I was taken; the Rev. Mr. Cheshire says he lost his portmanteau on 23rd Nov., which is the day that this female detector was appointed to watch for thieves; she waited from 10 o'clock in the morning till a quarter before 4 o'clock, and saw a person she declares to be me, get up and leave that room, but before leaving it lift up the portmanteau, and come back, take the portmanteau and leave this room; and I must not Only have left the room, but walked twenty yards, and gone down a flight of steps, and all this in one minute and with a package in my hand weighing forty or fifty pounds; can 'you believe that could be done before a woman, a special detector, appointed there for her acute knowledge of all these things; is it possible that any man could come into a room like that, take a package of forty pounds, and walk away with it; but I have a witness whom I will tender, who will on her oath declare that on that 23rd, I arrived at my own house, which is as near as possible three miles and a half or four miles distant from it, and that I was at home about 6 o'clock, and I was dressed in my usual way; I never leave" my house without being shaved, my clothes and hat well brushed, and my shoes decently polished; I shall prove that on the 28th Nov., which was on Wednesday, that I brought home these identical shoes, and another pair of shoes as well with me, and</p>

             was my Lodger, and the Prisoner having some Acquaintance with her, came to see her now and then; and so it fell out that she came one Day when I was attending the Child; and the Child was a little cross vixen Thing, and it had befoul'd itself lamentationly: So, says the Prisoner to me, Mother Benson, says she, you look as if you was very weary and sleepy: I would have you go and take a Nap, and lay the Child by you, and I will wash its Things the while. And so I went; but when I waked, and found that this wicked Jade was gone, and my Cloaths were gone too, it put me into a strange Confirmation, for I never respected she would a' served me so. The next Witness deposed to this Effect: My Name is Mary Lee; and tho' I say it, there is never a Woman in the Parish that takes more Care for an Honest Livelihood than myself. I turn my Hand to any Thing to get a Penny: Sometimes I sell Things in Leadenhall Market; and sometimes I do an odd Char at one House, and sometimes at another. We Market-Women are up early and late, and work hard for what we have. We stand all Weathers, and go thro' thick and thin. It is well known, that I was never the Woman that spared my Carcass; and if I spend three Farthings now and then, it is nothing but what is my own. I get it honestly, and I do not care who knows it; for if it was not for something to cheer the Spirits between whiles, and keep out the Wet and Cold; alackaday! it would never do: We should never be able to hold it; we should never go thro' stich with it, so as to keep Body and Soul together. But as for this Jenny Johnson the Prisoner, she coming sometimes for a Quartern to the same Shops that I made use of, we now and then had a Dish of Chat together, and so we became pretty well acquainted; whereof she came to see me two or three Times; and of all the Times in the World, she happened to come that Day as my Landlady lost her Things. Now after that, she comes to me at a certain Place, and there we had two or three Quarterns of such simple Stuff as we poor Souls are glad to drink. And from thence we went to another Friend's House, and there truly she would needs treat me with a Quartern of right French Brandy; whereof I wondred at it, because we had had but a very indifferent Market that Day. Oh! says she, I do not want for money; I have got above a Crown in my Pocket; and so we went to another Friend's House, and another, and another to that; and so by way of Discourse about this, and that, and t'other; and a Talking about my Landlady, and how she lost her Things, and all that; Why, says Jenny, says she, as for your Landlady's three Mobs and a Handkerchief, I sold them all for a Shilling.

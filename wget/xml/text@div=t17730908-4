I saw the prosecutor and prisoner pass my shop together the day of the robbery; they went into a public house to drink, then they went down a lane to gether; in about a quarter of an hour the prosecutor came back running up the lane and said he had been robbed; I went to a public house to take a description of the man; they said he was dressed in a white waistcoat with black binding; I followed him along the road; in about a quarter of a mile; I came up with him, I enquired of some men that were working there, if they had seen such a man go by; they said he was gone down such a field, I went there; I saw him coming; I lay under a hedge till he came up; then I laid hold of him; the prosecutor was about a field distance from us; I carried the prisoner to the prosecutor, and took him to an alehouse; I am sure he is the same man I had seen in company with the prosecutor; the prosecutor challenged him with robbing him as soon as he saw him; I searched him at the public house; and found a 9 s. piece in his shoe. I found two shillings upon him, but found no half crowns; one of the shillings he changed at the alehouse for some tobacco.</p>

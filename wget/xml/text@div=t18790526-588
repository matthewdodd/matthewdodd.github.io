                  </hi>. I am a railway clerk, and live at 47, Bird-in-Bush Road, Peckham—the prisoner was in my employ—I had been to church on Sunday evening, May 11th; I came home about 9 o'clock with some friends, and there were other persona in the house—when we got home the prisoner and her sister, and my wife and Mrs. Dawson, Mr. and Mrs. Morton, and Mrs. Fitter and her child—they came to supper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187905260093"></xptr>
               <p>with me, and when they were about to leave, a smell of burning was dis<lb></lb>covered, and one of them went upstairs to a bedroom—I then went up, and saw the bed in flames, and the room full of smoke; I called for water; the prisoner brought it, and with assistance I put the fire out; no fire had been lighted in that room—two of my friends then left, and about an hour afterwards some drawers were found burning in the breakfast-room; they were extinguished, and about an hour or an hour and a half afterwards a third fire was discovered in the breakfast-room in the book-case; Mr. Morton and I put it out, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards a fourth fire was discovered; some wadding was burning: that was extinguished, and about half an hour after that a fifth fire was dis<lb></lb>covered by the side of the breakfast-room; two table napkins were found to be on fire, that also was extinguished—about 9.30 a. in. a sixth fire was dis<lb></lb>covered in a bedroom, some ladies' wearing apparel was on fire, and the shelves—that was extinguished by the Rev. Mr. Hazell, and no further fires occurred—the prisoner was sent out once on the Sunday evening, but not by me—she was in the house on the Monday morning—I asked her on the Sunday evening if she knew whether there were any candles in the house—she said "No"—I did not say anything to her about the fires on the Sunday evening.</p>

I did'not go out at the same time as she did, but Mr. Morton did—she went to church and returned about 8.30, or probably a little later; she returned before me with her sister—I had been in the house two hours before an alarm of tire was given, that brought it up nearly to 11 o'clock—Mrs. Dawson was the first person to go upstairs and discover the fire—I had two men in to help extinguish it, and gave them some refresh<lb></lb>ment and some money—I gave them two bob and said that I would give them two more when I got the insurance—I was up all night, and the persons I have mentioned were all there except Mrs. Fitter and the child—the prisoner went out for a policeman—I do not know who sent her—I have heard that she is only 13 years old—there has been no altercation between her and I, nor with my wife to my knowledge—I had not lighted a fire myself in the grate in the breakfast-room when I came home from church, and I do not believe that there was one then, but there was one about 4 o'clock in the morning—I recollect coming down and finding the prisoner apparently asleep in the room filled with smoke, and I said to her "There is another fire, and in another five minutes you would have been suffocated, and you would have looked a pretty dear"—I told her about 8 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing to go and empty the slops in my bedroom, I was then in the breakfast-room—I did not stand on the stairs while she went up—my bedroom is on the first floor; there is a second floor—I told her to empty the slops as quickly as possible and to come down to the kitchen—I told her at some time in the morning to go to bed—she came down again before 8 o'clock—I don't think she said she was so frightened she could not sleep—my wife was up—I do not know, whether the prisoner spoke to my wife during the night—I had told her from time to time to keep a look-out in case there was another fire, and to have a pail of water in readiness—Mr. Morton, I believe, went out for a policeman about 3 o'clock—I removed the burning wadding into the garden, saying that I was afraid of it; I said "This is the stuff that is doing the fire"—the prisoner slept at the top of the house—she had a lamp in her room which she used to light when she got up there—I provided her with the same kind of matches which I use—I sent her to bed</p>

               <p>before 7, and she came down about 8—I did not observe the time, she was upstairs, but about three hours—I laid down in the drawing-room, but did not go to sleep, at the time she was sent to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 168, Camden Grove, North Peckham, and am an outfitter's manager—on Sunday evening I went to Mr. Laughton'e house after church—I know the prisoner, her sister is in my service—we had supper about 9.30, and when I was leaving, about 10.45, Mrs. Dawson called out—there was an alarm of fire—I ran upstairs and found the bed on fire and the room full of smoke—I called out for Mr. Laughton and to the prisoner to bring some water—she brought some, and with the assistance of some men who came on hearing the shouts, we extinguished the, fire; the men went down and had some refreshment and left—in about an hour after<lb></lb>wards we were downstairs in the breakfast-room, every one except the prisoner, who, I believe, was in the kitchen, and there was the smell of burnt paper—I found a cupboard in the basement in flames, the flames were coming from under the door—I called to Mr. Laughton, who was at the top of the house, to make haste, as there was another fire—I got a pail of water and threw it under the door; he opened the door and throw a second pail of water in—we put the fire out—a muslin dress was burning, to the best of my judgment—after that every one but the prisoner went upstairs to the parlour, and while we were sitting there the prisoner's sister left, and I sent to tell the prisoner to go to bed—on my return I saw more smoke coming from the breakfast-room—I ran upstairs and saw the prisoner sitting in the breakfast-room near the fireplace—the room was full of smoke, and a flame was coming from the book-case—I believe she had been told to light a fire in the breakfast-room, but I do not know; that fire was put out, and Mr. Laughton and myself said to the prisoner "You had better have some water about the place in case any other fire should break out"—she went to the right and I to the left, and when I returned she went downstairs and then called out, "Oh, here is something burning"—she was then in the break-fast-room—I ran down, and some wadding was burning in a cupboard in the breakfast-room—I threw some water over it and put it out—the breakfast-room is in the basement—a few minutes afterwards she gave the alarm that another cupboard was burning in the same room—I ran down, opened the door, and saw a blaze and smoke—I poured some water into it, and after it was out we discovered two or three table-napkins which had been used during the day, burning—the shelf was burned, and so was the door—a pail of water soon extinguished that, and I said in the prisoner's presence, "This is a very serious affair, have you any idea of the cause of these fires?"—she said, "No; I know nothing about it"—I said, "Do you think somebody set fire to the house?"—she said, "I don't know"—I said, "What do you think ought to be done to them?"—she said, "Their place ought to be set on fire"—I said, "Supposing they have no place to set on fire?"—she said, "Then they ought to be in prison"—I went out again for a constable, and brought one back to the house.</p>

On Friday morning, the 21st of April, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came and bought a gold watch-key for 6 s., and tendered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170042"></xptr>me a 1 l. Bank note. I asked his name and address, and he gave me</p>
               <p>"Cox, Joiner-street, Tooley-street, just at foot of the Bridge." I immediately wrote that address on it. I then looked at it and suspected it was bad - (looks at one) - this is it. I then told him I suspected it was a bad one; and I asked my fellow shopman's (Rogers) opinion on it. He said I had better take it to the Bank, and see if it was good or not. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't like it, here is another for it;" and he tendered another which I refused, and said,</p>
               <p>"I shall take it to the Bank." I left him in care of Rogers, took it to the Bank, showed it to Mr. Christmas, an inspector, and he and Foy returned with me. I ran on before and found him in the house, and they came in, in three or four minutes. I then heard the prisoner say he lived at No. 15, Joiner-street. I have been to Nos. 13, 14, and 15, Joiner-street, and found no such person lived there.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Chaffers, and remember the prisoner coming to the shop. Hewitt showed me a note, and I said it was bad. He took it to the Bank, and left the prisoner with me. While he was gone, the prisoner asked me several times if I would not take the other note and give him change, and he would call again for the other. I said No, I was convinced it was a bad one, and he should prove how he got it. He said he took it of his master for wages; and that his master lived at No. 16, Joiner-street, and he lived at No. 15. He did not mention his master's name. Hewitt returned in about ten minutes with Christmas and Foy.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 21st of April I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Chaffers's shop. Christmas asked him where he lived; he said No. 14, Joiner-street, and that his was name Chear. I said we would have a coach and take him there, to see if his address was correct. He then said he did not live in Joiner-street, but at No. 7, Bett-street, Ratcliff-highway. I then asked where he got the note that he had paid, he said he received it on the Wednesday preceding, at Billingsgate, for some oyster-barrels, from Mr. Roberts, fishmonger, of No. 180, Oxford-street, and that he had sold him barrels two or three times before. I found a 6 d. on him, and a good 1 l. note, which I gave him silver for. I took him to Marlborough-street, went to No. 180, Oxford-street, but found no such person as Roberts there. It is not a fishmonger's, it is a house under repair, and has been so for some months. I made diligent enquiry in the street, and could find no Roberts, a fishmonger. I did not enquire at Billingsgate.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live in Grove-park, Camberwell. About twelve months ago I was residing in Calvert's-buildings, Southwark—I had the prisoner to take care of my wife—she had the entire charge of her she came into my service in May, 1849—this shawl, toilet-cover, cambric handkerchief, and lace collar, all belonged to my wife—I have the dress here from which this piece was taken—I know that such things were there, and were missing; but there is no mark on them—the prisoner's term expired on 28th May, 1849, but she remained about ten days after that—I missed some articles about a fortnight or three weeks after she left—there was a short piece of ribbon missed.</p>

On 10th June I was in Larkhall-lane, Clapham—I saw the prisoner going towards James-street, with a large bundle under her arm—I asked her where she was going—she said, "What is that to you?"—I took her to the station, and found the bundle contained china plates—she then told me she lived at Dr. Bell's, at Tottenham-green—I went there, and traced her to Mr. Turnbull's—I searched her box, and found these articles and other property in it.</p>

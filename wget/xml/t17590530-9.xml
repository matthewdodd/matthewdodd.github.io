The prisoner happen'd to meet with me near Kensington on the 12th of May. I ask'd him the road to Amersham in Buckinghamshire. He said he would put me in my way. We went in at the White Horse near Shepherd's Bush. I intended to give him part of a quart of Beer; but I gave him part of six or seven quarts. He said he would get me a bed at a house that he would direct me to. On the road he wanted me to give him 3 d. I told him I would not. Then we got a little wroth with one another, and wrestled among the nettles.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>Ross. About a mile and half from Shepherd's Bush. This was betwixt six and seven o'clock. Then I saw him so quarrelsome I was going to give him 6 d. to be quit of his company. When I was taking my purse out of my pocket I turn'd a little about. He snatch'd the purse out of my hand and ran away. He fell down. After that I happen'd to fall down. He got up and went through a gap of the hedge and ran away. I went back to the White Horse, and told the people what had happen'd, and some men desir'd me to stay 'till they came back. They went. One of them came back and told me they had taken him. Then they brought him back, and he was brought to Hammersmith and sent to the cage. The next day he was carried before justice Beaver. I had in my purse half a guinea in gold, and 1 s. 6 d. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear?</p>
               <p>Ross. I can't say I was. I was a little in liquor, but knew what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you to deliver your money?</p>
               <p>Ross. No. He just left me without a farthing to bless myself with. I never got it again.</p>

I said, I will put you into the road; then he said he would treat me; we came to an ale-house, call'd the London Apprentice; there he treated me with a pot of beer, and after that another; then I took him through Kensington to the road; then we went on to the white horse; there he call'd for six or seven full pots of beer, and was very drunk; then I went to part with him at the door; he wanted me to go with him a little farther. After we parted, he went back, and said I robb'd him; he was much in liquor, and fell down in the dirt, and daub'd his cloaths.</p>

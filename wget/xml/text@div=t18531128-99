                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On Wednesday, 26th Oct., about half past 5 o'clock, I was on duty in Trafalgar-road, East Greenwich, and met a man coming in the direction of Greenwich, with a sack on his back, which I examined, and found it contained half a firkin of butter, a piece of cheese, and two jars of pearl barley, covered over with a blue slop—in consequence of what he said, I went to a house in Hatcliff-street, East Greenwich, about 150 yards from where I stopped him—I knocked at the door, a female came; and, in consequence of what the man told me, I asked for a person named Evans—the prisoner came, and I asked him if he saw that the man was stopped with the butter—he said, Yes, and that he had the other part himself—I asked him where he got it—he said, From a ship, near Woolwich; and said he gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it—I asked him how many pounds there were—he said, About 105—I asked him what it would amount to in money; and he said nearly 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I should take him to the station, and charge him with stealing it; on that the other man ran away, leaving the property behind—I took Evans, and going to the station be made a statement to me—I had not told him it would be better if he told me; I said nothing of the kind—the only words I Raid were, Where did you get the butter from?—he said, It is as well to tell the truth; I stole it from a railway truck in Angerstein Wharf—I afterwards went up stairs at the prisoner's house, and found half a tub of butter, which he said he had, before I took him to the station—it was half a firkin, and there was another half firkin in the sack; I compared them, and they corresponded—after the prisoner was committed, I went with sergeant Carpenter and weighed the butter; the two portions together weighed about 90 lbs.</p>

I was at the station when the prisoner was there—I took the charge, and read it over to him—he said, I did take it, it was part of a wreck; it is the first thing that I ever did, and I hope you will take my bail for my appearance to-morrow.</p>

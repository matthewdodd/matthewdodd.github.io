             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a turnkey. I have the watch. It was given me last Wednesday morning by one of the debtors confined in the gaol. He turned his back to the gate, and somebody gave it him; he said he did not know who. The prosecutor complained to me he had lost his watch, and went with me to the gate, and pointed out the prisoner. There is the name, Sweet Hart, upon the watch.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>TOWNSEND's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am totally innocent of the affair. Fletcher was not at home the ensuing morning after the watch was lost. The man came to enquire for the watch, and said, if it was delivered to him, he would not go on with the prosecution. I knowing nothing of the affair, went and enquired about it. I could hear nothing of it; but soon after heard it was given up. Fletcher had the animosity to me on account of a dog: he told me he would have revenge of me, and persuaded these people to do this for the lucre of the reward upon conviction. O my unhappy body! After we had been drinking together, I was in the yard, with my watch in my hand, winding it up. His brother came up the yard, and said his brother had been robbed of his watch.</p>
               <p>Blakey. I leave myself to your Lordship and the jury.</p>
               <p>To Fletcher. Had the prisoner a watch of his own? - Yes: the prosecutor described him as a man with a watch, and a single iron on. He was the only man in that yard that had a watch.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. When you saw your watch in his hand, did you observe his own in his pocket at that time? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>How do you know the watch he had in his hand was your watch? - I saw the chain: it had four seals to it; and mine was a long chain, with one seal. When my friend hauled the blanket off, I had my eyes upon him immediately.</p>

               <p>Timms. The prisoner's watch had round seals; this is a flat seal. He was standing by the fire, talking to him about his garnish-money, and I took particular notice of it.</p>

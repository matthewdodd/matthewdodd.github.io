That Dickinson sold the Snuff-Box for 9 s. and the Hilt of the Sword was sold for 35 s. that he knew the Prisoner very well, that he was Transported 6 Years ago, and lately return'd. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he was out of England at that time, but could not prove it because the Captain he was with then, was now gone to the Baltick; that he had other Evidence, but they were in the Country. Then endeavoured to invalidate the Evidence of Reading, by saying that he took up John Grimes and let him go again, and also one Shaw, and had 10 Guineas to let him go, and called

Reading being call'd again to answer to that, deposed that Grimes was just run away from his Master and come to them and was very desirous to enter into their Gang, whereupon he had him secured for that Night, and the next Day told the Justice the matter, who then told Grimes that he was his best Friend in preventing his Ruine.

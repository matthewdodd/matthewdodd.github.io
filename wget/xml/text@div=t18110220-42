               <p>Q. Did you deliver over to him gold for the purpose of working up. - A. I did, fifty-nine ounces odd, from the time of his coming, to the 9th of February. He quitted my house on the 7th of February at dinner, and left word that he should return on Friday at dinner, I met him on the Friday in Fleet Market, I observed to him, I was surprized at his conduct in stopping away, and leaving the men in the shop, that he knew they wanted his directions, he said it was a dispute in the family, but he would be with me on the Saturday morning. He came on Saturday morning about nine o'clock, the usual hour I went up into the shop, he was busy about a pair of ear rings, his conduct appeared singular, I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wiltshire, I should like the account settled," he went into the accompting house, and the account was settled, and the deficiency appeared to be thirteen ounces, six pennyweights, and twelve grains of gold, of the quality of four pounds per ounce. I had two officers in my house, I said</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wiltshire, you have no objection of going with me to your lodging," he said,</p>
               <p>"no, but you have no occasion of giving yourself that trouble, there is nothing there. On our going to his lodgings, he said,</p>
               <p>"I do not blame you for going, you will find gold there, and a number of things that are not finished, but they are my own property. We went to his lodging, there was a board in his bed room, fixed the same as the boards we work at, on the side of that board was a small cabinet, and several drawers to it, the first drawer we opened, contained a sketch of the principal part of my drawings, which no person in the business has but myself, in the next drawer was an ingot of gold about two ounces, I said when the ingot was taken out,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wiltshire, could I suppose you had been so cruel a man," in the drawer we found another ingot of gold of a commoner quality, which had been reduced after being taken from my house, in the fourth drawer we found a paper containing four lumps of gold, they might weigh ten or twelve pennyweights a lump, in the same drawer we found a box containing some garnets and pearls, three of the garnets were taken from my drawer, I have the collets out of which they came. He was taken to St. Anns watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that gold per ounce. - A. Perhaps not more than three pounds, and that common ingot and the lumps about forty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How many men had you at work in your house. - A. There is nine or ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a waste in gold during the time it is worked. - A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the commencement of this account take place, you say fifty-nine ounces odd, were delivered to him during the time he was there. - A. The commencement of this account took place on the 23d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. All these men that were working in your shop, had the handling of this gold, and the working it. - A. I weighed it to the foreman, and he has to give it the workmen, he does not weigh it to them, it would be impossible, we gather the filings, put them into a pot for the purpose of bringing it into one body.</p>
               <p>Q. Now that would occasion a deficiency. - A. Perhaps ten pennyweights.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that as it is not the foreman's business to weigh the quantity of gold given to each man under him he had not the means of ascertaining whether each man used that gold that was not weighed to him, and it was not weighed when taken from the men. - A. It would be impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know in the course of your trade there would be a loss. - A. Yes, we allow for that.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you do not mean to swear to that gold. - A. I cannot swear to the form of that gold, I am confident it is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Among other deficiencies, there is the sweepings. - A. I allowed him two ounces and a half for that.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you in your trade allow your foreman to carry on trade for himself. - A. No, never, a man with a salary of three guineas a week.</p>

            . These are the articles that I found in the prisoner's room. This case contains a dozen gold seals, here is several papers of gold and garnets, these are the three garnets, Mr. Musgrove said he could swear to being his property, the prisoner said it was all his property, he now and then got a light guinea, which he melted down for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am quite sure that these three garnets came out of this collet, they are worth about three shillings, I am confident they are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. BONNET. Q. You belong to Messrs. Cox and Merle, refiners. - A. I do. On the 8th of February I purchased an ingot of gold of the prisoner, it had been left on the 8th of February for the purpose of being essayed, in order to ascertain the quality. On the 8th the prisoner came to our accompting-house, I paid him for four ounces, sixteen pennyweights, fifteen grains, at fifty-five shillings an ounce, it amounted to thirteen pound, four shillings, and ten pence. Wiltshire, Charles Street, Long Acre, is the address he gave me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Those seals have been the work of my own time nights and mornings, I sold four ounces odd for money to purchase the garnets and pearls, I purposed leaving my master on the Monday, and going into business for myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

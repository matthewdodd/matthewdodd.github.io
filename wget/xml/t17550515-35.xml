             came voluntarily to me, and said, go and take Coulson up, for he is the biggest rogue amongst them. He was taken and brought into my shop, there Heard charged him with stealing ten gallons of red wine out of the store-cellar of Mr. Grimes, in Suffolk-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say this was stolen?</p>
               <p>Bruin. I can't say what month it was stolen in. Mr. Barnes was along with Coulson when Heard charged him. He asked Coulson if it was true? Colson down'd on his knees, and said yes, it was, and hoped we would forgive him this time, and he never would do so again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any wine out of the cellar ?</p>
               <p>Bruin. I know nothing of my own knowledge of his taking it; a person may go and take twenty or thirty gallons, and it never be missed, out of the great quantity there is in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take Collins before ?</p>
               <p>Bruin. I was with him before aldermam Bethell, alderman Chitty, and alderman Hankey; before them he was charged with stealing this wine; but to the best of my knowledge, he denied it before them all.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say against Westwood ?</p>
               <p>Bruin. Westwood was my apprentice, and worked in the same vault, and he has laid out of my house many nights, and this Coulson has harboured him in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he has harboured him?</p>
               <p>Bruin. I have taken him out of his house, and I have great reason to believe he has been drawn into bad company by Coulson; there they used to drink wine together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his delivering him any wine?</p>
               <p>Bruin. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Coulson?</p>
               <p>Bruin. He is a taylor; the affair was discovered by a quarrel between Coulson and Heard.</p>

            . I asked my father, the day the Medway man of war was launched*, to give me leave to go to see her, which he did. Coming home between five and six at night through Barking-alley, where Westwood and Coulson had a cellar; I saw a light there, and Coulson was standing with a ten-gallon cask in his hand, and wiping the sweat. I said, you sweat; he said he had a good load; he had brought that cask from the vaults in Suffolk-lane; Westwood said it was the same vault that you have been with me in; he had put it down but once between Suffolk-lane and there, and that was near Mr. Wilton's, a cheesemonger. There was another little cask by it, and I was going to sit down upon it; but they bid me not, for fear I should jostle it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see Westwood there?</p>
               <p>Heard. Yes, many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear? as a visiter?</p>
               <p>Heard. He might be there seven or eight times a day at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Coulson rent a house?</p>
               <p>Heard. He rents two rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever present whenever any of the prisoners confessed taking this wine?</p>
               <p>Heard. I never heard them confess any otherwise but then in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words, we are to make up so many gallons, or I must make up so many gallons?</p>
               <p>Heard. Coulson said to Westwood, we must make up so many gallons, and we must have ready money for it; and Westwood said, if they would let him have ready money, he would spend ten or fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. from Westwood to Mr. Bruin. Whether or no we were doing any business in that vault at that time?</p>
               <p>Bruin. Westwood was at work there a little after Christmas, I can't recollect the time.</p>
               <p>Q. from Westwood to Heard. At what time was it you saw me in the cellar in Barking-alley?</p>
               <p>Heard. I don't know the day of the month; it was the day the Medway was launched at Deptford, about six or seven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did it begin to be dark at that time of the year?</p>
               <p>Heard. It began then to be dark about half an hour after four. I went that morning to Westwood, and asked if he would go and see the ship launched? He said he could not go.</p>

            . On the Monday morning after the last sessions ended, I was at Mr. Bruin's house, he lives next door to me; he told me his man had been out all night, meaning Westwood; he frequently used to lie out of nights; there came a servant maid, I took it to be the witness Heard's father's maid, to tell him Westwood was at Coulson's house. Said Mr. Bruin, I will go and fetch him; so he and a watchman went and fetched him home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Coulson come with him?</p>
               <p>Barnes. No, he did not. I heard Mr. Bruin say to Westwood, you use me very ill. No, said Westwood, I don't think I do. He said, you had better confess, and perhaps you may save yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. Confess what?</p>
               <p>Barnes. That was about stealing some linen, which Mr. Bruin charged him with. In the evening on the same day Heard the evidence came to Mr. Bruin's house, and said I will clear myself, for I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by then?</p>
               <p>Barnes. There was I and Mrs. Bruin together; then she said, who is this? though Heard is my neighbour, I do not know him. He said that Taylor is the biggest rogue; if you will but take him, you will find this house has suffered prodigiously; he has stolen wine out of a vault in Suffolk-street. I went and fetched Mr. Gardner the constable, and he and I went and took Coulson.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the taylor the evidence which Heard meant?</p>
               <p>Barnes. He is; he happened to be at home. I laid hold of him, and said, you are my prisoner, and you must go along with me. He said, so I will with all my heart. Coming down the bottom of the street, he made a spring to get away; but having hold of his collar, I held him fast; then he said, what business have you with me? You are no constable. Then Mr. Gardner held his staff to him, and said, smell of this. We took him to Mr. Bruin's house, there was Heard the evidence, who charged him with stealing lead from the Customhouse, and wine from a vault in Suffolk-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Westwood then?</p>
               <p>Barnes. He had been sent to the Compter that morning; Coulson and Heard then began to charge one another, each saying it was not me, it was you; upon being charged with taking wine from out of a vault in Suffolk-lane, all on a sudden Coulson called out, for God's sake have some pity and compassion on me, and let me go, and I shall never do so any more. I have always lived well.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150034"></xptr>Q. How much wine was he then charged with taking ?</p>
               <p>Barnes. A ten gallon cask of wine from that vault; I asked Coulson if it was true what the lad said, he said it was true, and still kept begging for God's sake I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. from Coulson. Whether ever you saw me do any thing that was bad?</p>
               <p>Barnes. No, never in my life; I have seen him go backwards and forwards as a taylor, but never had any acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Q. from Westwood to Mr. Bruin. Whether there was any ullage or any red wine missing in that cellar ?</p>
               <p>Bruin. There is an ullage of red port in that vault.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you with him before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Gardener. I was before alderman Bethell, alderman Chitty and alderman Hankey; there was Westwood also, they both denied taking the wine when charged with it before them.</p>

            . I have known Westwood from his infancy, he was always a very sober and dutiful lad to his parents. I never heard any ill of him till this affair, he has been seduced to it I believe by the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chapman. I have known Westwood ever since he was put in breeches, I knew him at the boarding-school at Sydenham, where I thought him remarkable above the rest of the boys. I knew his first master extremely well.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was his first master?</p>
               <p>Chapman. His name was Fish; I had some conversation with him about the lad, I have heard him say the lad should work with any apprentice upon the keys; I have also heard that Coulson has been a rogue from his cradle, and, I believe, that he has enticed the lad into this affair.</p>

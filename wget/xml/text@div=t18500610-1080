                  </hi>. My husband keeps a pork-butcher's shop. On 8th May the prisoner came and asked if I would buy some waste-paper—I said yes, if it was clean I would give 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it, but it must be very clean—he left the shop, and in two or three minutes he brought this paper—I asked him where he got it—he said his father sent him to sell it, and he came from Sea-coal-lane—he did not say that four boys had given him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece to sell it—I had bought a very small quantity of paper the day before; the prisoner said his brother brought it—a person named Robertson had tried to sell some paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had been looking for work; I saw four boys opposite the shop; they said, "Will you go in and sell this paper?" I took it in; they weighed it and gave me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He asked no questions, but was in a great hurry to get away—he said it came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he would have taken that without its being weighed—I saw no boys there: if there had been four boys opposite the shop I must have seen them.</p>

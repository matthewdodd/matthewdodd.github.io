I did not see what he took, but he gave something to Madden, who put it into his pocket, and turned round to leave the prosecutor. I laid hold of them both; the prosecutor looked round, and called out,</p>
               <p>"That is my handkerchief." I looked and saw it drop from Madden. Collard picked it up.</p>

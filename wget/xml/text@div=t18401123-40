                  </hi>. I am servant to Robert Hodgson, of Willsden-green, Mid<lb></lb>dlesex, in the parish of Willsden—he keeps the house—on the 29th of October, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was surprised by a knock at the front door—I went to it, and nobody was there—I then went to the back kitchen door, and found two policemen at the back door, which was open—I know it was shut overnight, and was safe when I went to bed—I found the back kitchen shutter split from top to bottom, and one pane of glass broken—I missed a pair of pattens, a pair of clogs, of Miss Arabella</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 29th of October, I was on duty in Edgeware-road between one and two o'clock in the morning, and heard footsteps coming down Dolly's-hill-lane—I waited two or three minutes and the prisoner came up the lane—I asked where he came from—he said from Kilburn—I asked which way he came from Kilburn—he said by Kneesdon, and he had been at the Dog public-house having some<lb></lb>thing to drink—I asked if they kept open till that time in the morning—he said no, he had been to a friend's house since he left the public-house—I asked what he had got under his arm—he said "A smock frock, do you suppose I stole it?"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said he bought it at Kilburn at a pawn-shop, and gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and a pair of pattens he bought at the same place for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that the night cap was his wife's, and the other articles were his own—I asked where he was going—he said to Mill-hill—I asked, if he lived there—he said, "Yes"—I took him into custody, made inquiry and found Mr. Hodgson's house broken open—I have the articles here—he bad some in his hat and some in his pocket, the smock-frock, pattens, and clogs were under his arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

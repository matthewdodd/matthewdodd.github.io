I live at the Earl of Cork's, 8, Grafton-street—in November last I was in Devonshire-street, St. Mary-le-bonne, at half-past four in the afternoon—it was broad daylight—I had a purse—the two prisoners came up to me, and Wilcox asked me the way to Grosvenor-street—I directed them, and White said "Yes, but we want to go to Hanover-square—my puree was safe about two minutes before that—they were very close to me, and I felt a hand sweep across my dress—I did not think of my pocket, but felt for my watch—the man was the closest to me, and I suppose it was his hand—they left me, and about two minutes afterwards I went to take my purse out, and it was gone—I had passed no other person—my watch was in this side pocket.</p>

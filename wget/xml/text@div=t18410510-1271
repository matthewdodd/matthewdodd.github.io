                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Staples Inn. In January 1839, two people named Beagarie and Antrobus met me in West<lb></lb>minster Hall—they said that a man named Mayes, in Orange-street, was going to do a bill, and he required a reference from some respectable person to show that he was known—I wrote this letter, but there has been a good deal of interpolating—the words "and responsible" have been interpolated after "respectable"—I did not put these words in—Beagarie asked me to interline "and responsible"—I told him I could not do that—when I had written the letter, I folded it up and gave it to Mr. Beagarie—I do not recollect seeing Norris—neither of them said a word about the 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I had no clerk at that time—I lived in Southampton-place, opposite the Grotto public-house.</p>

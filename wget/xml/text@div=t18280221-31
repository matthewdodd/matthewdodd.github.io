When I recovered, I went on and found I was in the Hounslow road - I called at the first house, and desired a lodging for the night; I said I had been ill used - this house was about five hundred yards off - they refused me assistance; I called at another house, and the gentleman sent me to the turnpike - I sat there all night by the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time of night was this? A. It might be ten minutes later than half-past ten o'clock: I do not think it that it was eleven; I had no time piece - I cannot say how far I was from London; I have ascertained since that the place is called Isleworth-corner; I walked all the way from town - I set off about seven o'clock from No. 69, Old Bailey - I was as collected as I am now; I had taken nothing but what was necessary to support my spirits in travelling - I have no recollection of meeting anybody on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told anybody you were going to put your bundle into a waggon, and walk by the side of it? A. I had not; I did not ask anybody to go and drink with me- I did not throw my bundle at anybody's head: this happened on Tuesday - I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday night, at the Queen's Head public-house, at Heston, in the care of an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say of one of the men that you should know him again, if you saw him in the same clothes as he had on that night? A. I said I would describe the clothes he had on that night, but I should know his person in any clothes; I did not say I should know him by his clothes - I knew him by his face; it was a fair evening, not moonlight - there was a gas-light on the opposite side of the road: I do not suppose half a minute elapsed from the time the prisoner took my bundle, till the other took my hat off - I had received the blow before the second man came up, but had not fallen into the ditch; I fell into the ditch about two minutes after I received the blow; I might have had two or three glasses of beer on my road, but did not sit down in any house - I cannot state what were the public-houses I called at. I was in London about three months ago; I have been in London three times since I have been in Bristol; the first time was a week before his present Majesty was crowned - I staid about a week then, and a fortnight the second time - which was when this happened, and this is the third time. I am a native of Wales, and never lived in London; I might have called at three public-houses before I was knocked down - I know the Half Moon public-house at Brentford; I will not swear that I did not call there, but I do not recollect it - I think I called at a house at Brentford, but did not look at the sign, that might be about ten o'clock or a quarter past; according to what I can judge, I suppose the Half Moon is about half a mile from where I was robbed - it might be twelve o'clock when I was taken into a house; after I was robbed, I was loitering about, and did not know what to do or where to go, as I had been refused quarters at two or three houses - I did not see any watchman or patrol; I was much fatigued and alarmed.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Will you swear you were perfectly sober? A. Yes; I have not a doubt of the prisoner's person; I never expressed a doubt about it; I was robbed about a quarter or half a mile from the Half Moon public-house I suppose; I suffered very much from the blow I received at the time; I suppose I stopped ten minutes at each house trying to get admittance; I called at two houses, and then at Mr. Chapman's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you complain there of your ill treatment? A. Yes; they did not like to receive me; their's is a private house; I am quite sure that three men were in conversation together, and the prisoner was one of them, he separated from the rest, and came up to me.</p>

            . I am a market gardener, and live at Brentford-end, Isleworth; my house is about four hundred yards from Isleworth-lane. On the 8th of January, about 11 o'clock at night (I suppose), the prosecutor came to me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210045"></xptr>I sent him to the turnpike, and in the morning I went to the turnpike; I afterwards went to the corner and saw a place where there had evidently been a scuffling, and in the ditch was a night-cap, which I produce: the prosecutor seemed in a dreadfully agitated state when he knocked at my door; he held up a handkerchief saturated with blood; I opened my window; he begged of me for God's sake to admit him, saying he had been robbed, and was bleeding; he held up his handkerchief, which he had been holding to his mouth, and I saw the blood on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear sober? A. He stated his case clearly to me, and stated where it had happened; there was nothing to induce me to suppose he was not sober; I directed him to the turnpike, and he went there immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. A little after eleven o'clock; I was in bed, and only looked out of the window; I did not come down stairs; it was a very sharp frost, and a clear star-light night, with a cold easterly wind; he might be a quarter of an hour there; he begged of me earnestly to let him in; I asked why he had not gone to the public-house, nearly opposite; he said he had tried there; I directed him to the turnpike; he had no hat on his head.</p>

            . I keep the Half-moon public-house, at Brentford, which is nearly a quarter of mile from Isleworth-corner. The prisoner was at my house on the night of the robbery, in company with others - I think he came in about twenty minutes before nine o'clock; he came in with William Steers and others - I can swear to Steers. There was no woman in their company - there was one at the bar; she went out - I suppose there were four or five of them in company. I think they left my house about a quarter before ten, together - I cannot say how many of them exactly - the woman had gone out about an hour before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Do you know the prosecutor? A. I know him since this happened - he was not at my house on that night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You say other people were in company with the prisoner; did they come in together, or about the same time? A. Several came in together - I was not in the tap-room myself; I expect they were in company together; they did not all go out together - I cannot say whether any one went out with the prisoner - it was a market-day, and a great many people came to my house; the prisoner went away, about a quarter before ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have no recollection of the prosecutor having been there that night? A. No; I cannot say; I am quite sure that Steers came in with the prisoner and the others - if they did not, they were not a quarter of a minute apart - I suppose they knew one another, for they seemed to be jovial together.</p>

On the 8th of January, the prisoner came to my house, about ten minutes before ten o'clock at night - there were five of them in company; four besides himself - they were all men - they went away between twenty and twenty-five minutes after ten - they all went out, one after the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they drink together? A. Three of them came in first, and called for a pot of beer, and before I had drawn it, the other two came in - that was Steers and the prisoner; they came in together, and when they went away, they turned to the left, towards Isleworth-corner - my house is on this side of Sion-gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the three men who came in first? A. One of them was Alexander and his brother - I do not know the third. They all five drank together - and handed the pots to each other; they only had two pots - I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

On the night of the 8th of January I saw the prosecutor, about a quarter to eleven o'clock - I should know him again if I saw him; that is the man (looking at him); he has not got the same top coat on now. I saw him at a quarter to eleven o'clock, or from that to ten minutes, opposite New Brentford church; I was coming from Isleworth, over the bridge, and he was coming towards the bridge; he had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210046"></xptr>bundle, (it appeared to me a double bundle), thrown over his shoulder, with something in the form of a hat in front; he ran up against me, and pushed me off the pavement. I said, "Halloo, my friend, what are you up to now;" he said, "I am going home." I said, "That is a strange way, to run against me in that manner;" he said, "Don't you like it?" I said, there was plenty of room for him to go by - he said he had been waiting a long time for a waggon to go by, for him to throw his bundle into, and said, "I have been in company with some cursed girls, and lost all my money except 2 1/2d., and that I will spend if you like." I said, if that was all he had got, he had better keep it; he swung his bundle at me - it went off in his hands; he was not able to stoop to pick it up. I took it up - put it over his shoulder, and left him, and before I got to Brentford Church-yard, where I live, the church clock struck eleven; I have no doubt at all but he was intoxicated; I have seen him since in the same way, intoxicated, between the Half Moon, and the lane leading into Sion-fields, within the last ten days.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. How do you get your living? A. As a witness for informations.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you get for your information to day? A. Why, my expences being paid, eating and drinking; and I rode up in a cart with a woman who is a witness for the prisoner - she is not a witness, but came to protect her daughter, who is to speak on his behalf; I am what is termed a common informer - I have been so two years; I do not altogether get my living by it; I have been at work as well, at haymaking, and coal-heaving, or any thing to get a living for my family; I never failed in any information.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have laboured at haymaking, and so on? A. Yes, in an honest way, and I have given informations in an honest way.</p>

            . I live at Heston; my mother brought me to town this morning. I was at Mr. Trimmer's, at Heston, when the prisoner was to be examined; I heard some conversation between Mr. Cook and another man - (looking at the prosecutor) - I believe that is the man; he said he did not think he could swear to both of them; Cook said,"Poh, poh! you swear hard and fast against them both;" I was in the passage at this time, and they were on the stairs, at Mr. Trimmer's - it was in the school-room; I belong to the school - a good many of the girls were there; the school-room is near the church; the prisoner are examined there.</p>

            . I did not see this girl before the Magistrate, nor do I believe she was there; I understand she has accused me of having said something, but I could not hear her.</p>
               <p>COURT. She says the prosecutor was talking to you, and said he did not think he could swear to both the men; that you said, "Poh, poh! swear hard and fast against both" Witness. So help me God, it is the greatest falsehood that ever was uttered - it is most shocking! I know the prisoner's solicitor is acquainted with all the thieves in the place; I say it is false - I will do my duty as an honest man at the risk of my life; I never in my life said such a thing- the prosecutor identified them both; he said the prisoner had an immense large fist, and he should know him in a moment - he went into the room, and saw him sitting there; he came out, and said, "That is the man;" (that was Wyeth.)</p>
               <p>I was told this girl was coming forward; I know her family are very bad, and think she will swear any thing she is dictated to by the party.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever hear her examined as a witness? A. No; I speak from the reprobacy of the family.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARK. I am an attorney, and clerk to the Magistrate for the division of New Brentford. I know John Thomas, and would not believe him on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you entertained that opinion? A. Within six months. His informations have been received, perhaps, half-a-dozen times, upon his oath, but the Magistrates will not convict on his testimony; I have an order from the Magistrates not to receive informations from him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Has he so conducted himself before the Magistrates, as to lead you to say you would not believe him on his oath? A. Most certainly I would not.</p>

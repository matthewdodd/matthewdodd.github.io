             I am a Police-constable. I fell in with the prisoner, in Hackney-road, on the 4th of January - he was intoxicated, and had lost his coat and waistcoat; I took him to the station-house - he said, in going along, that he was in great trouble of mind; he kept pointing to his heart, and then indicated he had robbed his master six weeks ago of a coat and shirt - I at last found who his master was, and went to Mr. Boyd's; the prisoner became quite sensible soon after I took him up, and said he had sold the things in Field-lane.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. Reynolds brought in the prisoner, who turned to me, and said he felt great pain at his heart - I cautioned him, and said what he told me must be stated to the Magistrate - he said he had sold the coat for 18s. in Field-lane, and the shirt to a woman for 3s. in Petticoat-lane - he went with me to Field-lane, and pointed out Walker as the person to whom he had sold the coat - he said he had been starving for three weeks in the country.</p>

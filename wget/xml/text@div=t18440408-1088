                  </hi>. I am a widow, living with my brother; the last witness. On the morning of the 9th of April, about ten minutes past seven o'clock, I concealed myself in the parlour—Garrett came home from work—the first thing he did was to go to the salt meat tub, and take out the salt meat till he came to this piece with a piece of fat—he laid all the others on the salt beef tray—he laid this on the block till he had finished taking all the others up, and then laid it on the top of it, with the pork—he came and looked into the parlour, to see if he could see any one, and when be found be could see no one, he sent the boy out for some coffee; then he went to this beef, brought it up, put it on the scale board with, the fat; then went behind the door, took a piece of neck of mutton, and laid that also with "the beef—he then took a large cloth, went to the same place, took out a large piece of suet, and concealed it in the cloth—he then" took three pieces of flap of mut<lb></lb>ton, and laid it on the scale-board; Dunford then came in, opened his basket and Garrett put all the meat into it but the flap of mutton—he then put the flap of mutton in the scale, and then in the man's basket; and the moment he was putting the hammer through the end of it, I, said, "Stop, I will have no more of this game carried on"—I shut the street door, and shut both the prisoners in—I sent the servant to call my brother—Garrett then said he had done nothing wrong—I said, "This does not look like it—he had weighed none of it—I said I had seen him do it repeatedly.</p>

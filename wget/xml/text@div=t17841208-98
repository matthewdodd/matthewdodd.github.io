               <p>I live at No. 24, in Wapping-street, I lived there in September last; the prosecutor lodged with me at the time of the robbery, he is a seafaring man, he had lodged with me about five weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. How had he conducted himself during that time? - Very sober and steady, the prosecutor went out of my house between seven and eight at night, and not coming home all night, I was very uneasy about him, it was on a Thursday night, I am sure it was in the month of September, he never slept from my house only one night before; in the morning the prosecutor came home, he had borrowed an old jacket and trowsers, and told me he had been robbed, scraped acquaintance with him, and said he was a country man, and insisted on going to get some supper and sleep with him that night; and that he took him to the sign of the Dark-house, in Dark-house lane, and I went with the prosecutor there about half past eight, the prosecutor came home about a quarter before eight, and I could find none of the prosecutor's things; but soon after a woman came and gave information of the prisoner, and I went upon Tower-hill and took the prisoner; I went past him two or three times before I took him, and I observed the prosecutor's waistcoat and handkerchief upon him, it was a handkerchief of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Did you on the appearance of these things, immediately believe them to be the prosecutor's? - I did, I secured the prisoner, and took him to the publick-house where the prosecutor was, I think it is the sign of the old King's-arms; the prosecutor immediately challenged the prisoner, and told him he had his handkerchief and waistcoat, and his sleeve buttons, he had his shirt sleeves over his hands, he did not challenge any thing else at that time; the prisoner said they were none of his, he knew nothing at all about it; I asked the prisoner if he had not got a silk purse about him, and he asked me what business I had with any thing belonging to him; I said I believe you have one; he asked me if there was any particular mark upon it, I told him there were two steel rings upon it, I told him there were some stitches which I had observed before when the purse was in the hands of the prosecutor, and the prisoner pulled out the purse in a hurry, and said where are the stitches? and I shewed him that very moment; I said this is the purse belonging to the prosecutor; nothing else passed, but I took him to the Justice's, and I gave the purse to the prisoner after I had shewn him the stitches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I resigned myself willingly or no? - He did, after I said he must go with me; he said he would go with me any where, he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did the prosecutor buy that purse? - No, he did not, my wife gave the prosecutor that purse, that made me so well acquainted with it.</p>

            ? - Yes. I was at my warehouse, where some things were upon view, prior to an auction. My boy came down, and said he had seen a man put three pair of stockings into his pocket; I bid him point the man out. When the prisoner came down the boy said he was the man. I stopped him, and searched him, and found three pair of stockings in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks upon the stockings? - No. I cannot swear to them.</p>

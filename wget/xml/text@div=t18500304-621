                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bruce; the prisoner was in our employ, to carry out coals. About a fortnight after Christmas, he told me he had an order from Mr. Christmas, of the Burlington Arcade, for two dozen caps, which would come to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he should be obliged to give the order away for want of money, if I liked to have the order, he would give me the first chance, and my husband should go and get the caps from Union-street, in the Borough, and then get the money—my husband agreed to that, but afterwards could not go, and my husband asked him if he could be trusted with the money to go and get them without him—he said, "Yes"—I gave him the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was my husband's money—I gave it him, believing he would go and get them.</p>

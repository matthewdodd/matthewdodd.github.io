A Quarter of an Hour after Eleven, this Davis and a little Boy along with him, one Saunders, wanted a little Pit of Candle, I told them if they wanted Candle there was a Tallow-Chandler's hard by; some Time after this, I saw this Boy, the Prisoner, run as hard as he could; he was hardly gone but Mr. Camden came down and said he was robb'd, and ask'd me whether I saw any Body; but he was gone off; and I am sure that is the Boy that ran away.</p>

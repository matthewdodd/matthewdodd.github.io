               <p>PETER MASON. I am an officer of Worship street. On Friday the 27th of last month, I was going through Shoreditch to go to Worship street; I saw a waggon at Mr. Holmes's warehouse unloading of bags; I saw the prisoner, who was the driver of the waggon rolling up the tilt to cover the goods; when he had rolled it up, he put it on the forepart of the waggon, and went immediately to the mouth of one of the bags and endeavoured with his hands to close it; I went up to the warehouse to see Rouse, Mr. William's man; I asked him if Mr. Williams was in the way; he said no. If you have got any message I will deliver it to my master; I said no, come with me to the door, he did so; I asked him if the prisoner was employed by his master; he said no, he was a person employed occasionally to draw goods from the wharf; I then desired the prisoner that was upon the top of the waggon, to chuck down the tilt; he seemed confused and asked me what I said; I said chuck down that tilt directly, which he did. I then desired Rouse, Mr. Holmes's man, to unroll the tilt, as it was rolled up; in unrolling it he found this quantity of horse hair rolled up in it. I desired Rouse to take care of the horse hair; I gave him that handkerchief to tie it up in; he did so, and when the waggon was unloaded I took him down to the office; on going down to the office he took this knife out of his pocket, and said he found it in London wall; it was open as it is now. I told him I was very sorry he had a knife, for if he had not he could not have cut the mouth of the bag; he said he did not cut it open, it was partly sticking out and he pulled it out, and he could not think what possessed him to do it; he did not know what to do with it when he had got it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

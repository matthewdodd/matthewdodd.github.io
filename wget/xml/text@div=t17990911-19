            , I live at Charvey-green, near Windson, in Buckinghamshire. A black-horse, of my father's, was taken off the Common, between Tuesday the 18th and Wednesday the 19th of June; I missed it on the Wednesday morning, and saw it again on the 21st, at the Saracen's-head, Aldgate-pump; I know the horse again, we had had him three years come Christmas: he was bald-faced, had two white legs behine, a little white over the fore leg, and an iron lock on his foot, and he was run in the shoulder by hard work.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he this iron lock when you saw him at the Saracen's-head? - A. No; it had been taken off at the Saracen's-head.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, positively, that the horse that you saw at the Saracen's head, was your's that you lost from the Common? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am ostler at the Saracen's-head, Aldgate: the prisoner brought two horses in, about five o'clock in the morning of Wednesday the 19th of June, one of them was owned by Mr. Joel; he told me to put them into the stable and give them some hay; he came in again about ten minutes before eight for the horses; when I went into the stable, I saw the lock upon Mr. Joel's horse; I asked him the reason that the lock was upon the horse's leg; he told me the horse had been to grass, and he had lost the key of it; I asked him whose horses they were, and he seemed quite confused, and could not tell whose horses they were; I told him I suppose he had stolen them, and he made no answer; I turned my back to lead a gentleman's horse into the stable, and he jumped upon Mr. Jagger's horse and rode up the yard as hard as he could ride, with both the horses; I thought he did not come honestly by them, and I took a horse out of the stable, and followed him; I went down Whitechapel and did not find him, he had been and got the lock taken off before I found him; I met with him in Whitechapel-road as I was coming back, it might be about twenty minutes after he set off from our yard; he had got both the horses with him then, he was then upon Mr. Jagger's horse leading the other; I stopped him, and had him detained till the Friday following, when Mr. Joel came to our house and de scribed the horse; I did not deliver him up till we had had a hearing at the office.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jagger.) Was your horse upon the same Common? - A. Yes; I found him at the Saracen's-head.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to the Police-office, Whitechapel: On Wednesday the 19th of June, I took the prisoner from the ostler; I had two horses delivered to me, one of them was Mr. Joel's; and in searching the prisoner, I found this iron lock and key in his breeches, (producing them); I advertised the horses on the Thursday, and printed bills, and sent them down by the different stage coaches into the country.</p>
               <p>Joel. I can swear to this lock, but the key is not mine; the lock is marked No. 2, and I have got the right key in my pocket belonging to it; the key is marked No. 2, as well as the lock.</p>
               <p>Smith. The key which I took from the prisoner, appears to have been filed to make it fit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a sand-man by trade, and keep one horse and three carts; I used to let my horse and cart; I wanted two horses to work in my other carts, and a man overtook me on the road with these two horses; he asked me twenty guineas for them, I agreed to give him nineteen for them, and I paid him seventeen; I was to pay him the other two guineas at one month after date.</p>

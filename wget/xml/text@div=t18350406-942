                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Whitehead, a haber-dasher, at Islington. On the 10th of March, about half-past eight o'clock, the two prisoners came into out shop together—one of them had a child—I was in the parlour—I went forward and asked what they wauled—they said a pair of shoes at half-a-crown—I went round the counter and unfastened the guard—I was going to hand them the shoes, when a strange man came in for one pennyworth of tape—I was not going to serve him, but one of them said, "You may serve this gentleman, we are not in a hurry"—I went across the shop to get the tape—the man stood hesitating about the width of the tape—I saw Wheeler take a pair of shoes, and secrete them under her shawl—the man went away—I went to Wheeler and asked her to pay for the shoes she had got—she said she had got none—she then said, "You have no shoes to fit me," and was going out—I said, "Stop,</p>

               <p>I will call my husband"—she then took the child out of Thrope's arm, put the shoes under the child's clothes, and went out past the window—she returned with the child, but not shoes—they were than taken to the station.</p>

               <p>(Sarah Coleman, of Belton-street, Long Acre; and Morgan Keefe, of Princess-street, shoemaker, gave Wheeler a good character.)</p>

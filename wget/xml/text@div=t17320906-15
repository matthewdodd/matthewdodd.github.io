We search'd my House without finding the Thief, but then seeing the Back-door open we went into Mr. Ashley's Yard, and found the Prisoner under a Dresser in a Shed. We examin'd his Pockets, and took out these 2 Spikes, all these Picklock-Keys, this Wax-Candle, this Lancet, which he said was to let People Blood, and this Iron-pin, which is the Pin of my Cellar-Window.

I told him I thought they had not hurt him much. Yes, but they have, says he, so much, that I believe I shall not be able to walk to the Watch-house; but I wish I may die of my Wounds before I come to be try'd, for my poor Father's Sake, because I have requited him so ill for his Kindness in getting me off from Transportion.

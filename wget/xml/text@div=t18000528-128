             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live at No. 12, Swan-place, near the Bricklayer's-arms, Kent-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what prosession are you? - A. I do not prosess any thing at all but that of an honest man, and pay for what I have; I live upon what my ancestors have worked for: On the night of the 9th of May, I came through Covent-garden at twenty minutes after eleven o'clock; I came within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280109"></xptr>ten yards of the door of the Theatre when I saw the prisoner at the end of the Piazzas, going towards Drury-lane Theatre, standing against one of the pillars; I was wishing to see a friend of mine out of Lancashire come out of the Theatre; I asked the prisoner if the play was nearly over, he said it would not be for half an hour; are you from the country, sir, says the prisoner, because I am; I said I was from the country; he said, so am I too; he said, I am a <rs id="t18000528-128-deflabel744" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Was it by your private parts that he seized you? - A. It was; he screwed me most violently round with his hand as he laid hold of me, and said I must have your money, or I will cut your b-d throat; and then he held me, not by the collar, but where I alluded to previous to the word collar, until he put his hand into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, he there took out some halfpence; he felt in my coat-pocket, which is in the inside of my coat, and insisted upon my, that moment, giving him all I had, or he would say - I am ashamed to say what.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell us what? - A. It is a word that you will find written at the beginning of the Bible.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell us the words he made use of? - A. I screamed out watchman, and he said he would call sodomy.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was that the word? - A. It was, so help me God; I then begged him not to cut me any more, for he had made several attempts to cut my throat with one hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he in that hand? - A. Something resembling an instrument commonly called a penknife; my throat and my face were cut in several places; I begged for mercy, and told him he should have all that I had about me; he then put his hand into my coat-pocket, and took out my pocket-book; he asked me whether it contained bills, or what; I told him letters of consequence to me concerning a law business; and of no use to any body but myself; he said, I must have some money, have you no more about you; I replied that I had not, but that I would give him any money he should require for the pocket-book back; that if he lived by robbing, I was willing to redeem my papers back; he said, how much will you give me to have it back again; the prisoner said, if you will give me half a guinea I will let you have it, for I must have half a guinea; I said to him, you may stay here, and I will fetch you half a guinea; he said, will you not hang me, and I declared I could not swear to his face; that if he chose to go along near Temple-bar, I would procure the money; he walked along with me, and when we were opposite St. Clement's Church, he said he must have a guinea, or he would not let me have the pocket-book again; that he was very sorry if he had hurt me, for he lived by that way, and no doubt, he said, I was up to the gossip; I told him I did not know what gossip he meant, without it was cutting throats, and robbing people; he then said that three or four and twenty shillings, I am not sure which, would answer his purpose for the present night; I then asked him to come with me for the money, and he repeated again, will you not hang me; I told him, upon my honour I would not; I went to the Magpye and Stump public-house, where I knew the landlady, Mrs. Young; the prisoner followed me in; my physicians and surgeons, as I live in the country, come there to consult me concerning my health; I went in and asked for a glass of porter, and begged to speak with her alone; I told her to send for a constable; she said it was too late to get a constable, and she sent for a watchman; the prisoner was in a back-room, commonly called a parlour, and I in the tap-room; the watchman came in about two minutes; I was then in the parlour; I gave charge of the prisoner; he said, I have not got Mr. Oliver's pocket-book, but please to look under the table and about the room, and you will find it, I have no doubt; Mrs. Young called me Oliver when I first went in; the pocket-book was found under the table; the prisoner then insulted me with a great deal of bad language, that I was a false man, and should I attempt to swear that that was my pocket-book he would lay such a train against me as should ruin me for ever; the watchman and Mrs. Young were present; then the watchman took him away; (produces the pocket-book and bracelets:) I received it from the person who picked it up; his Christian name is James; I can swear to the pocket-book and its contents.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Here is a letter directed to you at No. 49, Aldermanbury? - A. That is a Mr. Lee's, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280110"></xptr>friend of mine, to whom I have letters directed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me that you were a gentleman's servant? - A. I did, in order to induce him to restore my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish your Lordship to ask him what he is now, and what he has been? - A. I am a country farmer's son in Northamptonshire; I have had a great deal of friendship from the Earl and Countess of Kinnoul, and the Drummond family, and with what my own friends did for me, and these noble families, I have always been kept independent; I married a lady of most respectable family in Lancashire, a Miss Hart, Counsellor Hart's cousin, and was by that means made independent; she is dead, and I have since married another lady, the daughter of Mr.

               <p>Court. Q. How came you to tell him you were a gentleman's servant? - A. To save my life; he said he thought he had got something of value in his clutches.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your second wife living? - A. I cannot say, she was nearly twelve months ago, when I came up to London upon some law affairs in Chancery respecting my son by my first wife.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not walk arm in arm with me on the 9th of May? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where were you going that night? - A. To Temple-bar; I had been at a house in May's Buildings, to speak to a friend from Liverpool.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gentlemen were with you? - A. I believe there were about thirty; it was a society of people that meet together called Odd Fellows.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going? - A. To Lieutenant Marsh's, No. 12, Swan-place, Bricklayer's-arms, where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to stop at the play-house? - A. I wanted to see a gentleman of too much decency to mention with such a man as the prisoner, to whom I had lent a pair of silver buckles of a particular pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that gentleman's name? - A. They call him Lee, he comes from Liverpool.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. I cannot altogether say.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he a gentleman of property? - A. I cannot say any thing about any body's property but my own; he had a country house a little way out of Liverpool, but I have not spoke to him these four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intimate with him? - A. So far as taking a cup of tea with him, or drinking a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lend him this pair of buckles? - A. They were quite a new fashioned pair from London; I would have sent him ten thousand pounds if I had had it, and he had wanted it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lee lives up two pair of stairs in Milford-lane.</p>
               <p>Oliver. The Mr. Lee that I mean is too much of a gentleman to live up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to know that Mr. Lee was at the play-house that night? - A. Because I had met a Mr. Jackson near Temple-bar, a cousin to me by marriage, and he told me Mr. Lee was in town; but I have not seen him these four years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before that night? - A. To the best of my recollection I had never seen him; but I have every reason to believe he had seen me.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Oliver.) Q. I asked you, in your original examination what you were - what are you? - A. My profession, I before told you, I am the son of a country farmer, I lived till I was, perhaps, twelve or fifteen years under the care of my uncle, an alderman of Leicester; I was afterwards sent by the Drummond family to try if I could learn the cotton business at Stockport, but it did not agree with me; then I went to Edinburgh to study the profession of a surgeon, and I carried it on for some time, but I did not practice for the last four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you drawn teeth within these four or five years? - A. That is a question I can hardly tell, for I believe I drew a stump a few days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Young has said, that you are a dentist, are you or not? - A. I was once, but not for the last three years, unless a friends asks it of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell the Gentlemen of the Jury so before? - A. I have no profession that I live by.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at Warwick? - A. No, I do not know any thing of such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen me at Warwick? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible that you should not know-upon your oath, were you never there? - A. I have been through it in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you never in the daytime in court at Warwick? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Court. There is my clerk, swear him.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You are my clerk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the witness who stands there with a blue coat? - A. I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him before? - A. I think I have seen him at Warwick, I recollected his face the moment I came into Court, and his speech.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what year it was in? - A. I think about two years ago, for an assault upon two young gentlemen, I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Oliver. How dare you say so, unless you can prove it; I say, it is a lie, and you are a villain for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280112"></xptr>saying so; two years ago I was at Bradlington, in Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you believe he is the man that you saw at Warwick? - A. I do believe he is the man, and I think it was by the name of Oliver.</p>
               <p>Oliver. There was a man of the name of Oliver, who was hung, but I am not that man, he was a surgeon too, and it came to Liverpool in the calendar, I was at Liverpool at the same time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 9th of May, I met with the prosecutor, he came up to me, and asked me what it was o'clock, I told him it was past eleven; he asked me whether the play was over, or whether I had been to the play; I said, I had; I told him I belonged to the Sheer bulk, and I was going into the city; he said he was going that way too; he laid hold of my arm, and we walked together down Drury-lane, till we came to this passage, there he put his hand round me, and squeezed me very hard in the side; I then up't with my fist, and knocked him under the eye, he said, he did not think a young man. would use him so, but he was sorry for what he had done, he knew it was not right: we went on to the Magpie and Stump, and I called the watch close by the door; he then ran into the house, and said, he would get somebody to bail him; as soon as he had got in, he called for a pint of porter, I followed him close, and I called for a pint of porter, I would not drink with him, he winked at Mrs. Young, and sat for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I saw him go out into the tap-room, take something out of his pocket, and put it under the table; as soon as he had done that, Mrs. Young sent for the watchman, and he accused me of robbing him; I then said, I dare say, if they searched, they would find it about the table where I saw Mr. Oliver throw it.</p>
               <p>Oliver. I say, that this man robbed me identically, used me cruelly beyond description, and said, he lived by that means, and I swear by the God of heaven and earth (and I am well known throughout the kingdom) that I never did an indelicate action in my life, by God he is the man that robbed me.</p>

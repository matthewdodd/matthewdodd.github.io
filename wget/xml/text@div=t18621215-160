                  </hi>. On Friday, 28th November, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was returning home from Hounslow, and when I reached Fulham Church two men passed by the side of my cart, one on one side and one on the other—I got a little frightened, and turned my horse round as quick as I could to go back to Hounslow—Clark then came on the near side, and Humphreys on the off side—Clark pulled me down in the cart, put a handfull of mud over my mouth, and held me down, whilst Humphreys took my money, 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from my right trousers pocket—there was</p>

I am a greengrocer of Hounslow—on the evening of the 28th November I saw Hill, with his horse and cart, by Mr. Cousins, the butcher's, in Hounslow—I saw no one behind him—but about an hour afterwards I met the prisoners going down the road, and I heard Humphreys say, "I will give it to the old b—"—Clark said, "I will fill his mouth with mud"—they were about half way down the road—I could not see Hill then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, and live at Hillingdon. On Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, I went to the Jolly Ostlers public-house to have some beer—I fell asleep—I was awoke by the sergeant asking if I had lost any thing, and missed my tobacco-box, containing three half-crowns and a knife—I was sober—I had taken the money out at the Jolly Ostlers to pay for a pot of beer—the knife and box now produced are mine.</p>

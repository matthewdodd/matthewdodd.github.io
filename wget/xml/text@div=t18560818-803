                  </hi>. I am an officer of the City detective police force. On Tuesday, 12th Aug., I went with three other officers to Upper Berners-street East—I noticed some windows of a room on she ground floor of No. 42—the window was partly up—we threw open the blinds, and I jumped into the room—Huggett, another constable, followed me—two other officers at the same time entered the room from the street door—when I got into the room, I saw the three prisoners—Thompson was standing at a press which I produce, turning the handle of it—Freitag was standing at his side, and Bohm was lying on a bed in the same room—they had their coats off—Bohm's face was turned towards the window—seeing Thompson turning the handle of the press and watching it particularly, I seized the press, which I produce, with one hand, and Thompson with the other—I unrolled the press</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180088"></xptr>
               <p>—I found in it some pieces of foreign newspaper—the press was then in the same state it now is—I searched the room—in a cupboard I found a copper plate (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is engraved so as to strike off an impression which would very much resemble the impression of a Bank of England note—I also found fourteen pieces of paper which I produce—they have waves on them, and the words "Bank of England," in the upper and lower parts, and the word "five"—the water mark on this paper bears a strong resem<lb></lb>blance to the water mark on a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—I also found in the cupboard three cakes of gelatine, a knife, damp with printers ink, and four pads—there is a faint impression on one of them, such as might be pro<lb></lb>duced by the copper plate; upon another there is an impression that might be produced by a wooden block, which will be produced, and which resem<lb></lb>bles the water mark in the paper—I found this steel plate with a small por<lb></lb>tion of engraving upon it, and a portmanteau containing twelve pieces of paper, similar to those I have already produced—I went into a back room, behind the room into which I broke, I there saw two lines suspended by either side of the wall—I saw several pieces of paper adhering to them, they were common cord lines—I examined those pieces of paper which I found in the back room with the paper that I found in the front, they corresponded in width, quality, and colour, with most of them—in the fireplace in the back room I saw a quantity of ash from burnt paper, and I also saw paper burning on the fire—I examined some of the papers that I found in the fire<lb></lb>place, they corresponded with the paper that I have already produced—I also produce a piece of metal which I found in the cupboard of the front room; it is the same kind of metal as that of which five figures are made, and will be produced by Huggett—I also found a magnifying glass.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City. On 12th Aug, I went with Spittle into the window on the ground floor of No. 42, Upper Berners-street—I took Freitag—I searched him—in his trowsers pocket I found a small purse in which was five metal figures, on one piece the figures 8875, and on the other the figure 2—it appears to be the same metal as the piece produced by Spittle from the portmanteau—the 2 can be put either before or after the 8875—in a cupboard in the room I found this wooden block, it is an imitation water mark, such as is used for making bank notes, at the top and bottom are the words, "Bank of England," and in the centre the word "five"—that is the water mark, it imitates the water mark of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—there is no date on the block; the date on the plate is 12th May, 1856—on the table by the side of the press was a stone slab, a square piece of stone with wet ink on it—I told Freitag I should charge him with being in possession of the articles which stood before him, for the purpose of forging Bank of England 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes (the other two prisoners were standing by his side at the time)—he said, "Me know nothing, me a paper hanger," he said that in English—Thompson and Bokw did not say anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Freitag. Q.</hi> Did not this Ulrick lodge in your house one pair of stain higher, before I came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he did—he was with you, and you, and he, and Thompson left together on Tuesday, 22nd July, in a cab—this last time Ulrick went away before you—he left about the 8th, I think—I did not know that Ulrick was a lithographer and engraver—they introduced them<lb></lb>selves as stewards coming from America—I saw this press standing in Ulrick's room, up stairs—Thompson brought it into my house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thompsons Defence.</hi> I came here on the 7th of this month without any money, without anything almost, except what I have on my body, to loot for Freitag; I found him living at No. 19, Little Alie-street; I told him the distress I was in, that I had no money to proceed further, and that I had no work, but that I had written the day previous to my relations in America to send me 100 dollars; he replied that he had but a few shillings himself, that he also had written home for some money; nevertheless, I could lodge with him, and as long as he had something to eat I should have something likewise; so I staid with him, but I could not sleep with him, because there was another young man in the same room who slept with him; upon this Bohm offered me to sleep with Urn; the following day the person named Ulrick left the house secretly, saying that he was going to ririt the Crystal Palace; Freitag complained very much, saying that he had lent some money to him, and also some wearing apparel, ana he did not know the cause of his not returning; the week nearly came to an end, and we had no money to pay the rent we owed; he asked what we should do; I said I did not know; he gave me four shirts, and I sold them at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-piece; he said, "We must look out for a cheaper lodging; "I went to No. 42, Upper Berners-street, and paid one half crown out of the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had received for the shirts; upon this 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. we lived on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, we three together; Bohm had no money; on Tuesday morning the money was given to me as cashier, to make it as economical as I could; after we had had our dinner, we had 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left; we mid the best we could do was to sell this press, though it belonged to Ulrick; Freitag had taken it with him out of the house, likewise this little black box, but he had no key to open it, and, an it was rather heavy, we expected there was some<lb></lb>thing in it, out of which we might make money; having no key, it was broken open; the first thing we found was a shirt, which I am wearing now, with the name of Karl Ulrick upon it; we found also a few stockings and old rags, and in a paper wrapped np we found the two plates and several pieces of paper, these little boxes and bottles with the materials in them, and at the bottom the large, square stone slab, which had been used for printer's ink; there was also a roller for printing; Freitag was much astonished, and so was I when we found all these; Bohm was not then in the room, and we called to him, and we stood laughing at it; then, we took counsel as to what we should do with the things; I advised to have the papers burnt, to break the plates, and sell the press; one of the two, I do not know which, said, "Perhaps the best thing would be to bring it to the police court, and we might make some money out of that," but neither of these were executed, and we, being strangers, did not know how to act; I took some of the papers and set light to them, and threw them into the</p>

               <p>fireplace; during this conversation we took our dinner, and on account of that, Freitag put the things in the cupboard; after dinner I went out to take a walk in the City; I did not return till about 3 o'clock; I found the press still standing on the table where we had put it in the morning; Freitag asked me if I had found a place where I could sell the press; I looked at it again, and said I did not know who would buy it, and also it was too heavy for me to carry; at the same time two or four men jumped in at the window, like robbers or thieves, and took possession of everything, and told us we were accused of forgery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Freitag's Defence.</hi> What the former prisoner has stated is the truth; I have known this person Ulrick, and knew his parents to be very respect<lb></lb>able; we served in the same regiment; I lent him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he promised to repay me when he received money from his parents; I went to lodge with him at his request; he had a business as a lithographer and engraver; he told me that he was at work for a person named Beeves, in Falcon-street, that he wanted a press for his business, and for that purpose I lent him the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this Ulrick I never saw work, though I have often told him he ought to work; he lodged one pair of stairs higher than I; I could not find work here in my trade as a paper hanger, upholsterer, and saddler, and was only waiting until Ulrick repaid me the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner con<lb></lb>cluded his defence by a strong appeal to the Jury for their favourable consi<lb></lb>deration, as a foreigner who had been fighting for this country, and who had no intention of committing any fraud</hi>).</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Bohm, in his defence, made a statement to the same effect as Thompson, and stated that he had served in the same regiment with Freitag, and happened accidentally to lodge at the same house where he and the others were living; but that he had no knowledge of anything criminal being carried on, and that he had taken nothing to the lodging but a small box containing his wearing apparel.</hi>)</p>

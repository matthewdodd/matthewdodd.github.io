I was with the prosecutor on this evening, walking in Tothill-street—the prisoner was with another female—she came from the other, and began using some very loving words, and particularly to the prosecutor, who was in the middle—he said, "Go on"—she stopped us—I saw her pass her hand to the prosecutors's bosom—I saw that his pins were gone, and told him—I caught her hand—he felt and missed the pins—he took hold of her hand, and took the pins out of it.</p>

On the 3d of June, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I left my house, and left no person there, except a corpse. I locked the front door, and latched the back. I returned a little before twelve, and found the front door locked and the back door shut, as I had left them; I missed a sheet off the clothes-horse, opened the back door, went into the yard, and found a trunk there which I had left up stairs at the head of the bed - it was broken open, and the articles stated in the indictment, except the shirt, taken out - it was emptied; a shawl, two cloaks, a shift, and a piece of cotton, were quite gone, the rest were left on the ledge of the wall; a red cloth shawl was also taken off a basket by the back door. In less than an hour I found some of them at the pawnbroker's. No door or window was left open. I suppose they must have got over the wall, and opened the back door, which I am certain was latched.</p>

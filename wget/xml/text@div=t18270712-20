            . I am a surgeon, and live in Sloane-square, Chelsea. On the 1st of June, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came to me; he seemed in great distress, and said he was afraid his wife was dead; he desired me to go with him directly, which I did. As we went along he said."I am afraid I have killed her." I asked him which way he had done it - he said he had given her two blows in her left side, with his elbow; that with the first blow, she said, "You have hurt me very much," and at the second, she said, "I am very bad, get up;" that he got up and struck a light, and got some vinegar, with which he tried to recover her, and used what means he could - but vinegar was the chief thing; he said they had been quarrelling a great deal; that it originated from jealousy, and he had struck her in her left side - he came to me to endeavour to restore her; when I got there, I found her with her head at the bottom of the bed, propped up with a pillow, and her feet hanging over the side of the bed; she was quite dead. I attempted to bleed her, and used other means - I endeavoured to introduce some hot spirits and water into her stomach - only two or three drops of blood came from her - there were some scratches on her nose, a grazed mark on the left collar bone, and the appearance of a blow on the left arm - those were the only external marks; I went again on the Saturday, by order of the Coroner, and opened the body that evening - Mr. Laisne, a surgeon, was with me - upon opening the belly there was nearly five pints of fluid and coagulated blood - I also found the sixth rib under the breast fractured, and the spleen ruptured - every other part of the body was quite sound - the blows she received caused her death; from the account he gave, in my judgment they were sufficient to occasion those appearances, and to occasion her death - in my opinion, she died from the internal hemorrhage, occasioned by the blows.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was from his own lips you had the account of what had happened? A. Yes; it was all voluntarily - there was no external mark where the spleen was ruptured. He kissed his children affectionately, and was in the utmost agony - there was a strong smell of vinegar in the room - the external marks had nothing to do with her death; I have known them for twenty-one years; I never saw any thing unkind on his part - I occasionally attended them.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Grosvenor-row. I was at the prisoner's house on Friday evening, the 1st of June, and saw his wife - she was then dead - the moment I felt her hand, I expressed my opinion that she was dead - Mr. Turnbull was endeavouring to administer some warm spirits and water, and attempted to bleed her - I perceived some slight marks, but not sufficient to cause her death; the prisoner was below stairs when I first went in, and gave me a candle; I attended the Coroner's Inquest, and assisted Mr. Turnbull in opening the body; the cavity of the belly contained five pints of blood in a fluid and coagulated state - the sixth rib was fractured, and the spleen ruptured - in my opinion her death was caused by hemorrhage, from the rupture of the spleen; he stated in the course of Friday evening, that he had given her two violent blows in the side with his elbow, and expressed that they were blows given as if in an angry feeling or rage, with violence - he expressed that to convey the manner in which he might have done it; he said they had been quarrelling in the course of the day - that she knew he was of a jealous disposition, and ought not to have aggravated him; in my opinion the blows were sufficient to have occasioned the rupture and the hemorrhage; the rupture must have been from some violence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The blows he described could have been given with his elbow as they lay in bed? A. Yes; there were no marks of violence immediately external to the seat of the injury; he appeared in great agony of mind - the woman appeared to have had her face bathed, and I smelt the vinegar.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the night in question a gentleman fetched me from the watch-house, and pointed out this house - I knocked at the door, a woman opened it - I told her my business, and asked who was there; Mr. Laisne came down - he went up to the prisoner, who came down and showed himself to me, but said nothing; I went up-stairs - he seemed in a good deal of trouble; I told him it was my duty to take him into custody, but I did not wish to hurry him - he said he had struck her, but did not mean to kill her, he hoped I would wait a little while, and he would send for his brother, who came; and been treated him to take charge of his house and children, and some money which he had in his pocket; he then knelt down in the room where two children were in bed, kissed them, and said, "Good bye;" he entreated me not to put him in irons, and we went arm in arm to the watch-house; he made no resistance; he forced some conversation on me on the road - he said he did not mean to kill her - it was not a likely thing that he should, for there were 200l. coming to her in a short time, and it was not likely he should kill her before that at any rate, for that would make them all comfortable; he said he had struck her with his elbow, that she had dropped a word which very much displeased him, which was the cause of his striking her; he wished me not to put him into a cell alone, and I allowed him to sit up with me all night; he was agitated during the night, and frequently said, "Oh! my soul! Oh! my Nance!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He pronounced her name in great distress? A. Yes; he certainly appeared much distressed; and was very affectionate towards his children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I loved my wife, and if I had one fault, it was having too strong an affection for her - my whole soul was devoted to make her happy; I was never happy out of her company, and never spent an evening from her, except when business called me; had I contemplated murder, should I have fetched the sister to give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120013"></xptr>evidence against me - it is contrary to nature, which dictates self-preservation; I should have quitted home instead of going for assistance - it was the furthest thing from my thoughts; I would have given my soul to have called her back to life. You will find by reference to the medical evidence there was not sufficient to cause death; therefore, reflect - weigh well - consider, and if any doubt arises, I trust you will give an unfortunate prisoner the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

On the 31st of March I was in my front room, and saw Wilson, the prisoner, go into No. 12, Margaret-street; the door was open - after some time he came out with this thermometer under his arm - he went down Market-street, and was joined by Saunders; they went on towards the Seven-dials, and in crossing Oxford-street Wilson gave it to Saunders, who put it under his arm - they went on, occasionally looking back, to see if any body was watching them; I saw a Police-officer just after they had got through a crowd - I told him to take Saunders, who still had the thermometer, and I took Wilson.</p>
               <p>Saunders. Q. Did I look back? A. Yes, once or twice, and so did Wilson; and you stopped at a corner while I went into a baker's shop to inquire for a Policeman; I kept my back towards you, and got the lady of the house to observe you.</p>

               <p>MR. COWING. I saw Wilson go into the house; he looked up stairs and then down - he then attempted a door at the end of the hall, and at last came out with this - the servant said he must have gone up two pairs of stairs to get it.</p>

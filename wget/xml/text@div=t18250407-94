            . I live at Chiswick. I bought this mare of the prisoner on the second or third Saturday in February, 1824 for 7 l.; I think it was the first Saturday after the 12th; I never saw him before nor since, till he was in custody; I had applied to one Bevan, a horse-dealer, at North-end, for a horse, and one Saturday, about a fortnight after, he and the prisoner came over with two horses; I went with them to the Feather's public house and looked at them - the prisoner claimed the one I chose, and asked 8 l., for it; I tried it, and offered 7 l., which he at last took; I kept it till I sold it to Platt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Bevan is a horse-dealer? A. Yes, - I paid the prisoner for it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner in Smithfield, and told him he had better come to our office about a peace warrant, which I had against him - he came, and I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When had you received information about this felony? A. About September last; I told him there was a talk about a horse, but whether the charge would be made against him I did not know; I had received information about it in September, but having been ill since, I did not know whether he had been examined or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is customary with me, when I get up in the morning, to go to my stable, and take my horse to water - and at the bottom of Millman-row, I met a man on this mare; I asked him to exchange it for a larger one - he said No; we went into a public house, and I bought it of him, for 5 l.</p>

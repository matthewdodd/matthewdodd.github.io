            . I am a journeyman pawnbroker. I live at the cannon in Hounsditch. On the 13th of last June the prisoner brought a remnant of scarlet shag. I asked him, if I had not taken such another remnant from him about three months ago; he denied it, but I was very certain I had; I told him I would go home with him, and if I found it to be his property I would lend him money upon it, but in going along he took an opportunity to escape from me. I made it my business to enquire after him, and was at last directed to him at Mr. Farmer and company's dye house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Farmer. Have you any partners in your business ?</p>

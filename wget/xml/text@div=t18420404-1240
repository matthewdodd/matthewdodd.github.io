                  </hi>. I am a medical student, and live in west Smithfield. On the 20th of March I was going along Holbom, about twelve o'clock at night—I met the prisoner in Holbom, nearly opposite Red Lion-street—she accosted me, and asked me to come with her—I went with her up Red Lion-street, and turned down Featherstone-build<lb></lb>ings—we were walking together—while going along she asked me for 1<hi rend="italic">s,</hi> which I gave her from my purse, without taking the purse from my pocket—I had in it a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a sovereign, four half-sovereigns, three half-crowns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—while standing in Featherstone-buildings I found her hand in my pocket—she drew up the purse, and took out the money—she had the money in her hand, and the purse also—the purse did not quite leave my pocket—she drew it to the top of my pocket, and took the money from it, and kept it in her hand—I took hold of her hand, and she tried to wrest it from me—I held it firm till the policeman came—she had a sovereign, four half-sovereigns, and a sixpence in the hand I had seized—I know I had the money in my purse in the morning—I gave her into custody—I kept my purse—the money she gave up to me, and I gave it up to the policeman—at the police-office she said I had promised her half-a-crown, which was false.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On this night I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and prosecutor in Featherstone-buildings—I asked them what was the matter—the prosecutor said the prisoner had had her hand in his pocket—he had hold of her right hand and arm—I saw this money come from the prisoner's hand—it was one sovereign, four half-sovereigns, and one sixpence—no shilling was found—when I came up, the prisoner said the prosecutor had promised to give her a half-crown, and that he had given her the money.</p>

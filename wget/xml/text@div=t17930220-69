               <p>I am a watchman to the society of Staple's Inn; just before nine o'clock the custom of the inn is, for the watchman to go up the stair case; and the outer door of Mr. Andree's chambers was then shut; I know his chambers he is an attorney; these chambers are No. 8, the first floor on the right hand, the door was shut as usual, I tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it broke open at any time, or that night? - It was not broke open as I know of, it was a window; when I went up the stair case, when I went up in the morning at five o'clock, before the chambers were opened, I found the door on a jar, I was in hopes it was left open by some body carelessly, I just peeped in and I saw all the papers scattered on the ground; I then went into every room, and the chambers, which consists of four; and I found every thing as in the first office; I had the key of Mr. Andree's chambers, my wife was the laundress to it; the desk in the first office stood wide open, then I went for the key, and got the key; and went back and double locked the door, and and did not go in again till my wife went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you suppose the persons got into these chambers? - Through the window, the shutters were broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shutters usually broke or was it broke in the course of that night? - In the course of that night; the screw that was in the middle I think was broke and a little hole was made at the bottom of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the window when you first discovered these chambers open? - I did not see it then, I did not discover it was broke till my wife was along with me, about an hour or an hour and a quarter afterwards, I have never found any thing of the things since.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Allen. I was bringing some goods home on the 17th of January - there was a small parcel, and some sugar, in separate packages<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160016"></xptr>- I was bringing them from Messrs. Travers in Swithens-lane - when I got to the corner of <placeName id="t18260216-14-crimeloc72">Birchin-lane</placeName>

Travers'; I put it into the truck again, and went home with it; he dropped it on the ground and I took it up. I am quite sure I saw it under his arm, and saw him drop it by the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever say to any person that you doubted whether it was the prisoner who took it? A. No, not to my recollection. I do not know that he was the person who pushed the truck. When I first saw him he was about a dozen yards from the truck - there was no other person near it.</p>

            . I am messenger to the Guardian Fire Office. I was in Lombard-street a little after seven o'clock - I heard the cry of Stop thief! and looking round I saw the prisoner running from Cheapside towards Gracechurch-street; a gentleman tried to stop him but missed his hold - I jumped off the curb and secured him- he had nothing in his possession - I did not see Dunkin while I had the prisoner; he tried to get away but I held him till Rogers took him in charge - I then left them altogether.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! I had seen the prisoner running about forty yards from the corner of Birchin-lane - he ran past me and I cried Stop him! Forrest stopped him in my sight - I ran and took him into custody - I kept him till I saw Dunkin, and asked if this was the person who stole his sugar - he said he had stolen a loaf of sugar from his truck. I did not see the sugar till the next morning - it was dirty weather, and the outside paper was rather dirty - Dunkin said "That is the man who stole the sugar" - I am not quite certain whether the prisoner made any reply or not. Dunkin took the sugar home, and I saw it at Mr. Allen's the next morning.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The officer asked if I was the person who stole the sugar, and he said some one had, but he did not know that I was the person.</p>

            . He never said so to my knowledge - I asked him if the prisoner was the person, and he said he was.</p>
               <p>JURY to FORREST. Q. What distance was it from the watch-house that you first saw him? A. Just by the watch-house - I had not an opportunity of seeing him drop any thing - I could have seen from the corner of Birchin-lane by means of the gas light.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At the time you first saw him, and heard the cry of Stop thief! was there any other person near him? A. Yes, there was a person coming towards Cheapside, and there was a person who tried to catch the prisoner but he missed his hold - I did not see any other person.</p>

               <p>ROBERT McCREBER. I am a Thames Police-surveyor. On the 9th of December I was sent to watch a house kept by Larkins, a plumber, in <placeName id="t18320105-124-crimeloc710">Charles-street, Westminster</placeName>

            . I live in Charles-street, Westminster. I knew Mr. Larkins, he is a plumber; I had seen the prisoner go to his house before with lead of this description on his shoulder - on Friday, the 9th of December, I was in my shop, and saw him go by with Mr. Holroyd's cart; I did not see him go to Mr. Larkins' that day - the cart was standing nine doors lower down, and I saw the prisoner take a roll of lead out of it on his shoulders, and go towards Mr. Larkins; I saw the officer stop him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Larkin keeps a plumber's shop, and so does your husband, I believe, in the same street? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any one from the State Paper-office here? A. Yes; it was Jubb who went with the waggon, not the prisoner.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Holroyd - the prisoner was a labourer employed at the State Paper-office, and Jubb was the carman. On the 9th of December four pieces of lead were loaded into the cart, which had come from Mr. Maltby's wharf; this piece appears to be one, but I could not swear to it when it has left the shop.</p>

               <p>MR. HOLROYD. I have the invoice of the lead - a sheet of lead is very large, but this happens to be the end which has the mark No. 5,178, and the weight 12 cwt. 20 lbs. - I have no doubt it is mine.</p>

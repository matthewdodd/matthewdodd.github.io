I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060030"></xptr> asked her what it was o'clock, she said it was not five. I lay down again and went to sleep; I waked about half past five and missed the prisoner out of the ward; I got up and went to a locker to look for the things I had pulled off after dinner on Sunday; I found it empty; I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); some were taken off a table. When I was sent for to give charge of the prisoner, the instant she saw me she voluntarily confessed taking the things, and begged I would be merciful to her; she said she had pledged them and I should have them again; but she would never tell where she had pawned them. I have never got the things.</p>

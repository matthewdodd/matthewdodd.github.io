                  </hi>. I live at 17, William-street, New Kent-road—I know Dennis Bryan; he used to live at the same place; he did on Sunday, 29th April—on that day, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him at the door of the house standing in the passage; some females came up; one of them tied a stone in her handkerchief and struck Bryan on the head—I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after—he rushed into the passage, knocked Bryan down, and kicked him violently while down he then got up and ran out, and the prisoner ran after him—I saw nothing more—Bryan left that house on the following Thursday; he had been to the police-court on Wednesday the day before—I was present when he was examined before the Magistrate—the prisoner was at that time charged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>of Sunday, 29th April, I saw Bryan standing at the door of his house—I also saw the prisoner, he rushed into the passage, knocked Bryan down, and kicked him, and ill-used him very much—I saw him pick up two two shilling pieces, and he had more money in his hand—I did not see where the money came from, only from the floor as he picked them up—I saw that the prosecutor's trowsers were torn very much by the pocket—I had seen his trowsers before the scuffle; they were not torn at that time; no other portion of his dress was torn—Bryan then ran into the back yard, and the prisoner after him—the prisoner afterwards came up and went down the street—he walked out—Bryan was in the yard, frightened to come out.</p>

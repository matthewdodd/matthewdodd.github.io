I am the wife of Henry Silcock, and am the land<lb></lb>lady at 13, Mansfield Street, where the prisoner and his wife were lodging, and the last witness—on this afternoon, at about 3.50, I heard Mrs. Wren scream—I ran upstairs to see what was the matter, and she, Mrs. Wren, had hold of the prisoner's whiskers, scratching or punching his face—Mrs. Wren said "He has hit me"—When said "I have never touched you; she has pulled me all to pieces," and his waistcoat was all torn open—she left her husband and said "This is all about the boy"—Wren said "It is because the boy said he was hungry; I asked the boy when I came in if he was hungry, and the boy said 'Yes'"—Mrs. Wren said "Is that a proper question to ask?"—I said "It isn't much to quarrel about," and I left the room then and went away—I went up about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards to see if they were all right, and Mrs. Wren was then holding her left side; no one saw them the first time but myself—she was sitting down when I went in, and then she stood up—I said "Has Wren hit you again?" and she said "No"—the prisoner was making the tea; I called to the other woman to look to her side to see if she was hurt, and she wouldn't allow the woman to touch her—about half an hour afterwards I heard them both go out together, apparently all right—I never, saw her again—about 10.30 that night Wren was at the door looking for his wife and enquiring if I had seen her—the deceased was in the habit of drinking—I think she drank all she could find money for, and sometimes more—she</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, Elizabeth Wren, believing myself about to die, do hereby solemnly declare that I had been out with my hus<lb></lb>band this afternoon, that we returned home between 4 and 5 p.m., and that we had a quarrel about some money affairs, my husband being in drink at he time. I was quite sober. He was very angry indeed; came up to me while I was standing beside the table and struck me on the face and then in the stomach with his fiat. I fell on the floor, and then he struck me several more blows in the stomach; cannot say whether he used his hand or his fist. I swear that I did not strike him first, but she flew at him afterwards and scratched his face. Severe pain in the abdomen came on about half an hour after the accident. My husband is frequently in the habit of beating me. I left him in the house when I came away. Signed, Elizabeth Wren, X</p>

She died about 10 o'clock the next morning—the cause of death was rupture of the <hi rend="italic">aorta</hi>—such an injury sometimes arises from natural causes—it did not in this case—I am certain it was produced in part by violence, but had the vessel been perfectly healthy perhaps the violence would not have been suffi<lb></lb>cient to cause a rupture—any violence might have caused it—a fall, blow, or anything over the region of the injury—a blow inflicted where I found the bruise would have been likely to produce it.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">aorta</hi> is a large vessel of the heart, the rupture of it might not cause immediate death—it would depend on the extent of the rupture and the amount of blood that escaped—the rupture was not di<lb></lb>rectly through it, but it extended between the coats to some distance—it was an extensive rupture, but still it was obliquely through the walls of the artery—I found a bruise outside the chest, and between that and the inside, by the artery I found the tissues buried in extravasated blood—the time between such an injury and death would be very variable; they generally die directly—there was nothing inconsistent with what I saw in her walking to the hospital—I mentioned before that she had some brain changes; I don't think that appears on the evidence.</p>

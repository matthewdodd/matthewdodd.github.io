                  </hi>. I am a soap-maker, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. At the latter end of February, Thomas Fitzgerald came to my warehouse, and produced a letter purporting to be from Mr. Parton, of Chatham—I read it, and returned it to him—it stated that he was a buyer of soap—I inquired of him as to Mr. Parton—he stated that he was a most respectable man, and he had done a great deal of business for him; he wished to recommend him to us—he advised me to send him some samples and prices—I furnished him with four samples—he called again in three or four days afterwards—he produced a little memorandum-book, from which he read an order, which he said he had received from Mr. Parton, which he said was to be sent, in the course of the week, to Cole's Upper Wharf, to be sent to Chatham—I directed sixteen hundredweight of soap to be packed up to his order, which came to upwards of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he returned again on the following Wednesday afternoon—he was in a hurry to have the soap sent off, as he said the barge would be going—the soap was then packed and sent—while it was being packed, he came to me and said he wished me to send it in his own name, as he had other goods which were going at the same time, and he wished them to be sent in one invoice—he produced a bill of exchange, drawn by a Mr. Ormsby—I did not accept, or consent to accept, that bill for the payment of the goods—I expressly refused it—I then went to the warehouse, and met Merrell at the door—I told him I had agreed that the soap should go in Mr. Parton's name alone, and he was to make the bill in that name; the prisoner then said it was the last time he would take any orders for soap—I told him he should have the usual commission, which is one shilling per hundredweight—the soap was then sent off in the cart; and Thomas Fitzgerald left about the same time—he left the bill of exchange on the desk—I did not see my clerk make the invoice, but I saw the bill of parcels which our clerk sent; it was in the name of Parton—our clerk after<lb></lb>wards addressed a letter to Mr. Parton—here is the letter and invoice which were sent—on the 7th of March, James Fitzgerald came to the counting-house; we had, in the mean time, received a letter from Mr. Parton—I asked him how it was that Mr. Parton had not ordered the soap, which we had sent down—he stated that they found, upon going down, that Mr. Parton was in bad circumstances; he had called his creditors together, and he did not think proper to deliver it—I sent Merrell to Chatham, and in consequence of what I heard, I took James Fitzgerald into custody.</p>

I never gave you any orders to that effect"—he said, "I know that, I was going to take it down to your house"—I think James Fitzgerald could hear that—I said I had a letter from Mr. Sturtevant, making a demand on me for the amount, and that a person would call upon me for it—he seemed rather to doubt it, but said, "Well, I can get rid of it in the towns; I can dispose of it"—alluding to the three towns, Chatham, Stroud, and Rochester—I was close to the barge, and I saw the ends of two of the chests of soap—I saw this paper, which I took off and read—it contains the weight of the soap, and has my name upon it—I had not compounded with my creditors, nor called them together—I have been in business fourteen years, and am in good circumstances.</p>

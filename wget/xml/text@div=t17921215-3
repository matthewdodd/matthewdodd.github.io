             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 31st of October last, I was going from my house in Long Acre, to my manufactory in Dyott-street, and part in New street, I believe it was a quarter before seven; I took my son along with me into High-street; I made a pause whether I should go up Dyott-street, which I have twenty thousand times, all times early and late; and within a few spaces of <placeName id="t17921215-3-crimeloc14">Plumb-tree-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. I think you say you had your boy with you? - I had him in my hand, but seeing the prisoner coming on, I was obliged to let him go to get on one side of the prisoner; but he still came against me. The watch I lost, was a gold watch, a metal chain, and a cornelian seal, set in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended? - The next day I sent to Bow-street, and left the name of my watch; but I was told there, that they dare say it was christened; the prisoner was apprehended on the 15th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was going along, at what distance was it when you first observed him, - three or four paces, he appeared to me to come from Dyott-street, and met me near the top of Plumb-tree-street; and he came so forcibly, that I could not avoid him; but my eyes were upon him to avoid him.</p>
               <p>Q. What space of time might it be you observed him? - Not above two seconds, for he came against me at the rate of a man galloping Twelve miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No, never before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch ever found? - No, never; when he was apprehended, I was sent for to Malborough-street, and I saw the prisoner; this was on the 15th of November; and I fetched my son from Lewisham, and he saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner did you recollect he was the same? - I believe I recollect the very words I said at the office, when the prisoner was brought into the office, I looked at him, walked up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150006"></xptr>him, says I, prisoner, I have not the least doubt but you are the man, but I will not swear positively to you; those are the words I said; but after looking further at the prisoner, and seeing of him now I have no doubt at all about me; I told the justice he had altered his dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what manner he was apprehended? - He was in the custody of a constable belonging to St. Giles's parish, not on this charge, when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Since you saw the prisoner first, you have heard Sanders give an account of this transaction? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe that your expression before the magistrate was, I will not swear positively to you; and so it appears, for he was only committed upon suspicion? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. It was as transient as a man's galloping at the rate of fourteen miles an hour, as you stated it yourself - except lightening, I don't know any thing so transient as this.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at No. 12, Broad-street, Bloomsbury, I am not a police officer, on the 31st of October last, I was standing at the bottom of Vine-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was this from Plumb-tree-street? - Very little; three or four men came running down Vine-street, somewhat in great haste; I looked at the men as they passed me; there was no alarm of the robbery at that time; I took no farther notice of them; I saw Mr. Wallis about a fortnight after the robbery was done, and asked him if he should know the man that knocked him down; he gave me such a description of him, that I supposed him to be the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, was he one of the three or four persons running down Vine-street? - I am sure he was one of them, I have not the least doubt, because I knew him a twelve month ago, and another or two of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this prisoner? - It cannot be of any service if I relate any circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge, had you known him before - I do not think he had any visible way of living; he used to use the Bedford Arms; there was a great many in society in Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were running down Vine-street, had you made such an observation of this person so as to know he was one of those three or four - most certainly, I had been acquainted with him before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not the first time you have been here; - it is not, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sanders you told my Lord, that you was not called a police officer; this is not the first time you have been a witness? - No, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sanders has it ever happened to you to receive a portion of a reward, for a highway robbery? - Yes, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150007"></xptr>Q. Was that for a street robbery. When a gentleman of consequence like Mr. Wallis prosecutes, he does not take the reward, then one gets all oneself; the reward is 40 l. I believe; how much did you share the last time? - I believe I had about 6 l. the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. On this occasion you would have 40 l. - Mr. Garrow, I did not come here for any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Sanders was not this man about to be discharged on the subject he was taken up upon? - I asked Mr. Rumley if he had any charge against him, and whether he had had his hearing; he said no; says I he is one of the men that robbed Mr. Wallis, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was it by your advice that the son was fetched from school? - It was not, Mr. Wallis said his son would know him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Now it turns out he does not; that is rather unlucky; were the men going pretty fast? - Partly as fast as they well could.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other business on your hands of the same sort at present? - I have some at Hicks's-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it last Session you received a a portion of the reward? - No I believe it was three or four sessions ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You are neither a police officer nor a parish officer, but a gentleman, having time you do this business? - It is for the good of the public.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Wallis. What time was this? - It was seven o'clock at night, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark, or a light evening? - It was very dark; but a lamp was near the place.</p>

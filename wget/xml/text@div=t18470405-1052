I was on duty Woolwich on the 20th of February—I saw the two prisoners in the marked—I saw Gillett give something to Pearson—she went into Mr. King's shop, and Gillett waited on the opposite side—when Pearson came out I went into Mr. King's—I spoke to her and she gave me half-a-crown—the prisoners joined company again, and they walked up Wellington-street—Gillett then gave Pearson something again, and Pearson crossed the road and went into Mr. Lyle's shop—Gillett stopped at the door—I caught hold of him, and dragged him into Mr. Lyal's shop where Pearson was—there were several soldiers there, and as soon as I caught hold of Gillett the soldiers caught hold of me, as they thought I was assaulting him, as I was in plain clothes—when I took Gillett into the shop I saw him put this black purse behind a basket which was standing on one side—I told the person in the shop to let no one touch that basket till I returned—I then, with the assistance of the soldiers, took the prisoners to the station—when I came back I asked the women in the shop if any one had touched that basket—she said "No"—I looked and found this long black purse there, where I had seen Gillett place it—it con<lb></lb>tains ten half-crowns, two crowns, and two shillings, all bad, and all placed in different pockets in the purse—this is the half-crown I got from Mr. King.</p>

                  </hi> I am an inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. This half-crown, passed at Mr. King's, is counterfeit—the ten half-crowns in this purse, which are all placed separate, are all counterfeit, and all cast in the same mould as the other is—these two crown-pieces are also counterfeit, and have been cast in one mould—these two shillings are counterfeit, and have been cast in one mould.</p>

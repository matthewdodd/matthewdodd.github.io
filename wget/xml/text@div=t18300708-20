On the 26th of April the prisoner asked me to let him light his pipe - I said I had no fire; I went to speak to a gentleman, and saw him dart out of the toll-house -I ran and took him a hundred yards off; we found sixpence on him; the knife and other monies have not been found - there were four other persons, but three of them got away: I missed this property from the toll-house - it had been safe a minute before; we took the prisoner and one of his companions, who said."You had better give the gentleman the money," and I think the prisoner said,"I have not got it:" we detained his companion, but as I could not swear I saw him leave the toll-house, he was acquitted; the sixpence had no mark, and I cannot swear to it.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I met the prisoner and three others running just by the priory gate- the prosecutor said he saw him runout of the toll-house and run away; I took the prisoner and another - I found sixpence on the prisoner; he said it was his own - I did not bear the other say any thing to him.</p>

When you walk out, you no doubt feel quite conscious of your own safety; but, in one of those walks, you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> see that which will make you start back with affright. I do not intend wasting my time in making use of a lot of vain and foolish words, but merely to write that which will be to the purpose. A party formerly boarded at your establishment, but who having now left you, for certain reasons, which you are aware of, and who has, as yet, eluded my grasp, and who has gone, I know not where. How<lb></lb>ever, you may rest assured, that you will not be able to follow in her ways. You have very deeply embittered my days, and I should have a mean spirit indeed, were I not to resent such conduct from you. In my own opinion, I have done nothing but what is quite right in thus writing to you." [No. 2.] "London, Dec. 4, 1848. Miss Ward,—Fearing that my last letter was never received by you, I have again written, and if I see this one safely delivered, why it is not my intention to write to you any more. I should not have had occasion to write to you now, only I find that when you walk abroad you are accompanied by a gentleman, besides other of your friends. It was my intention to have come to your house to see you one night last week; and, indeed, I was about to demand admittance, when I suddenly thought of something, and I found that I was right in my own thoughts, for you had got a gentleman with you. However, rest assured, that the time will come when I shall meet you by myself, and then I shall send you to your last home; in fact, I shall never rest satisfied until such times that I have fulfilled what I have said respecting of you. My reasons you are perfectly aware of. Yours truly." No. 3.] "London, Dec. 19, 1848.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">MISS WARD</hi>,—I hope you will excuse the liberty I hare taken in thus writing to you; but, however, when you have read my letter, you can throw it aside, and treat its contents with scorn; but, mark me, there is but two ways to act, and either one or the other you shall (yes, shall,) conform to. The first is, that I want you to give me the address of Miss Elizabeth Spriggs, who I am confident you know the address of, owing to some little difficulties which they could not prevent that is, owing you some money. In the second place, mind you, if you refuse to give me the address (why), I shall only have one course to pursue; and remember, that when once I have begun my work, I 'will not stop until I have seen you deprived of every comfort that this life can afford; I will send some of the most hor<lb></lb>rible letters that the human mind can possibly frame, to the higher class of society, all of which shall have your name signed to them. I will also send some powder to different parties, which will cause instant death, <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> name being signed to the letters which shall contain this deadly powder; and, in fact, <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> name and address shall be coupled with such horrid things that they will eventually believe you are the party. After I have done all this, then, remember, I will make you tell me what I am anxious to know. How<lb></lb>ever, you have it in your power, and you may prevent all this by merely sending me the address of that girl. What is my reason, perhaps you may ask, for my going on in this manner. I will tell you—you refused to let me see her once, when I came to you. In conclusion, I tell you you <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> tell me the address of Elizabeth Spriggs, or I will hunt you to the very death; so now take heed, and remember what I have said. Yours truly."[No. 4.] "London, Dec. 21, 1849. Miss Ward,—I am utterly amazed to think that you do not give me the address I asked you for, viz., that of Miss Elizabeth Spriggs; and you mast also be perfectly aware that you art acting a very foolish part; in fact, it is but little short of madness to go on in the manner that you are. Now, young lady, let me beg, nay, intreat of you, not to refuse me what I have asked of you; for you will not be doing yourself any harm. In conclusion I must tell you, that I shall expect an answer between this and next Sunday week, 31st Dec.; and mind you, if you refuse to send me one, why I shall be under the painful necessity of stopping you in the public street. I beg you not to misunderstand my meaning, nor be deceived as to how I shall act. I can be patient a little while, but not too long. Yours truly. (Private.)"</p>

               <p>John Kinneer. About seven weeks ago, I lost a quart bottle of pickled mushrooms which stood in the shop-window for show? I gave it up for lost; about a fortnight after I was inform'd the prisoner was enquiring the price of a bottle of mushrooms. I went to seek after him but could not find him: my man

I charged the constable with him and he was committed.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Kinneer; we lost a bottle of pickled mushrooms from the window; we heard the prisoner wanted to sell a bottle about a fortnight after; I went to enquire after him and found him in an alehouse; I told him I wanted to speak with him; I took him into the skittle-ground, and said, how could you be such a fool to take the bottle of mushrooms out of the window? master has not missed them yet; let me have them that I may set them in the place again. He said, he knew nothing of them. I told him he had offer'd them to sale. Then he told me he had taken a bottle from the window, and said he would bring them on the Monday morning. I said, let me have it now. He said, it is late. I said, It is not half an hour after 10 o'clock. Then he took me into his room; there was the bottle. I had sent for my master, he came; then we sent for the constable and gave him charge of him.</p>

            . I am constable, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and the mushrooms were deliver'd into my custody; I took him to Bridewell that night, and the prisoner was committed.

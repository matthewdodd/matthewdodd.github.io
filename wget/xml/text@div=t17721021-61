The next day Halliburton and I went together; the prisoner brought these three pieces ( producing them;) I agreed with him for the price; I put them into my bag, and then told him I had not money enough about me, but would get it of my brother; I went to the door and called in Halliburton. When I went to the prosecutor's house, I found the shop door shut and the side door open. When Halliburton came in, he rung the bell; the prisoner said to me, make haste before my master comes down.</p>

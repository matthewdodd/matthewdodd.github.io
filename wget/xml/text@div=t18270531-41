            . I am a journeyman in the prosecutors' employ. On the 11th of April I had been making some salt-ladles - we have a leather apron nailed to the work-board, the other end of which we fasten before us to catch the silver filings - I went to dinner about twenty minutes after one o'clock that day - there was then about 9 ozs. of scrapings in the apron - when I took it off my neck I hung it over the rack to keep them in; I left the prisoner and several others in the shop; I came back in about an hour, and missed about 4 ozs. of scrapings and filings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many men did you leave behind? A. There might be six; I was absent when the prisoner returned.</p>

            . I work for Messrs. Lias, and was in the work-shop on the 11th of April, when Wallis went away, and I left the prisoner there about half-past one o'clock, with Hagger, the boy - the rest of the men were all gone before me - nothing was ever done to Wallis' apron while I was there, or I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How large is the work-shop? A. About twenty feet by twelve. I was shaping spoons; I could see all round the shop while I was at work, and am certain nobody touched the apron.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner on 16th June last; I was then residing at Reading, and was a widow. I lived at Reading about five weeks after the marriage, and then came to London, and lived at No. 1, Purton Street, Ledbury Road—my husband did not continue to reside with me—he was away from me five weeks, and the last time seven weeks—he was at home on 19th Nov.—he only came home the previous night—we were about to move into the country, and were packing up our things—on the 19th, after dinner, we were packing up the bed clothes, and as I was reach<lb></lb>ing the sheet I received a very severe blow on the right side of my head from behind—it quite stunned me; I did not know where I was for a time—there was no one else in the room but myself and my husband—he was standing behind me at the time I received the blow—when I recovered my<lb></lb>self, I found myself lying on a pillow before the fire—the pillow was in my mouth, and my mouth was full of blood—I cannot tell at all how long I had been insensible—I got to the top of the stairs, and called the landlady, Mrs. Fisher—she came to my assistance—a policeman was called in, and a medi<lb></lb>cal man attended me—I had had no quarrel with my husband that day—I never had any quarrel with him at all—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Purton Terrace, Ledbury Road. The prisoner and his wife lodged at my house about three months—on 19th Nov. Mrs. Fawn opened her door and called to me—I came down from up stairs—I found her covered with blood—she said, "Mrs. Fisher, pray run after him"—I ran down the stairs, but he was gone—she followed me to the street door; I went for a surgeon—I saw the wound on her head—I cut her hair off, and washed the wound—we have other lodgers, but they were none of them at home at the time—I had seen the prisoner that morning—I know that he and his wife were in their room together, about half an hour before this, because he brought the plates and knives and forks which they had been using at dinner into the wash house, where I was washing—I have the pillow and clothes here—they are covered with blood—I saw nothing more of the prisoner till he was in custody.</p>

I think he was away for five weeks—I should think on the whole he was not at my place above three weeks—I believe they had no friends come to see them, but I do not know; I was not in their room at all times—I never knew him bring plates and knives and forks out before this—I do not know why he did it—his wife generally did it—I have never heard him complain about his head—I never knew of his being ill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Adelaide Terrace, Notting Hill. On 19th Nov., I was called to see Mrs. Fawn—I found her sitting on the foot of the bed, in a state of great excitement, with a wound on the right side of the head, on the parietal bone, and blood issuing from it—I also found a great deal of extravasated blood under the scalp, around the wound, and a great quantity of blood over her shoulders—I probed the wound, and found that it had been laid bare, and felt rough—such an instrument as this life preserver would cause such a wound—I attended her for nearly a fortnight—in all cases of wounds on the head, erysipelas or inflammation might ensue—no such symptoms did supervene.</p>

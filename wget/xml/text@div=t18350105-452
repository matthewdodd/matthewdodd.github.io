                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 92.) On the 24th of December, I was in Tothill-street—I saw the prisoner in company with two others—I knew them all—the prisoner came out of a court in Tothill-street—he had something in his left hand, and was rubbing it with his right hand—I went and seized him by the arm—he dropped something out of his left hand on the ground, which sounded like a shilling—I looked, and saw a shilling—one of his companions, the big one, came and struck me on the arm, and knocked my hand away from the prisoner, who then put his left hand into his trowsers pocket—I saw Goose on the other side—I called him—he came and took hold of the prisoner—I saw Goose shake his trowsers, and two shillings fell on the ground—the first shilling the prisoner dropped, I had picked up myself, and have kept it ever since—Goose examined his trowsers, and there was no bottom to the pockets—Goose found two shillings in his left shoe.</p>

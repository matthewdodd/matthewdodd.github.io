               <p>I was coming home on the 7th of May at four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner coming down stairs with a bundle, I alarmed Mrs. Elphy directly, I asked her if she had lost any thing in the garret, Mrs. Elphy kept her eye upon her, this lad followed the prisoner, I and the prosecutrix followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040032"></xptr> her, and we took her at the bottom of the street.</p>


               <p>Court. Is the prisoner the same person you saw coming down stairs? - I am sure she is the person that came down stairs; she dropped the things in the street, she was not out of my sight; she denied being in the house; I saw the prisoner on the two pair of stairs, as I was going up the one; Mrs. Elphy run into the fore-room to look out, and I went down stairs to follow her.</p>

               <p>I saw her come down the steps with a bundle, I was on the other side of the way, I looked at her about two or three minutes, a woman came to the door, and seemed flurried, and I asked her if she had lost any thing, she said she had, I followed the prisoner down the street, she had got about fifty yards, I lost sight of her: She went up a court with the bundle, and when I got to it, she was coming down without the bundle; It was a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Was you sure enough when you saw her to know her again? - She was the same person who came out of the house; it was near the top of Whitecross-street, I went up the court, and found the bundle behind a door that leads out of the court; when I came back they had stopped her; I brought the bundle, I gave it to Mrs. Elphy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was before the Justice they all swore to me, by a green bonnet I had on.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she a bonnet on? - I did not take much notice of her bonnet, I took notice of her face, I don't know whether she had a green bonnet or not.</p>

               <p>I went into the front room, and looked out of window, I saw a tall woman stepping off the last step, with a black gown, a black cloak, and green bonnet; she had a bundle, I kept sight of her twenty yards, till I knew whether any thing was missing; I was not certain then, that the things were mine. After I told Mrs. Price in the street, to keep sight of her, I ran down, and she was stopped about fifty yards from my door, when I first got out of the door she was then in my sight, I never lost sight of her after; she had a child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Had she the child when you first saw her? - No, she had the bundle, and no child; I saw her turn into the court before I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>(The bundle produced and deposed to).</p>
               <p>Court. How long had the woman been out of your sight? - Two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Could you be three minutes running fifty yards? - I cannot exactly say, I run before she turned into the court, and when I got to it, she was returning; I did not see her with a child in her arms.</p>

               <p>What became of the woman who took the child? - She followed us to the Justice's, but did not go in.</p>

               <p>I was going down Whitcross-street, with a child, and they stopped me, and took me into a shop, and beat me unmercifully; the child belonged to the young woman that was along with me; the constable said, if I could raise half a guinea, my prosecutor would not hurt me.</p>

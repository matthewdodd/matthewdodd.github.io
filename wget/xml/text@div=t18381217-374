                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Tuffnell, of St. John-street, Bethnal-green. We rent the house, and occupy the upper and lower parts, but have a lodger, who has the middle part—there is one common outer door to both—about three weeks before the robbery I put eight so<lb></lb>vereigns in a small bag, into a drawer in my bed-room—it was safe last Fri<lb></lb>day or Saturday—I saw it, and the money in it, but did not count it—the prisoner lodged with me at that time, and for nearly four months—he went out at one o'clock on Monday, and returned between seven and eight o'clock, but I was not at home then—I missed it between nine and ten o'clock at night—he was not in the house then, and did not return all night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday morning last, as I was at the Spitalfields station-house, the prisoner came up to me, and asked me questions about some parties that were down at a house in Fleet-street—I understood he had previously been down to make a statement to the inspector—having had information of this robbery, I asked him if his his name was not Henrutter—he said it was, and I took him into custody for this robbery—I found two sovereigns, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper on him—his coat, waistcoat, and hat were new—I went to fetch the parties up to identify him, and he then said the money he had was money they had been and received on his account—he did not mention the amount they had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I went this night and told the Inspector to take the landlord and landlady of the public-house, for I had lost a sister down there—it is not the only one who has been murdered down there, but several others were going down there one night, and my sister came and told me she had been murdered down there, and not only her but upwards of one hundred. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He came and told the Inspector that one hundred people had been murdered down there—he appeared disordered in his mind—he pressed the Inspector not to let me go down to the house alone.</p>

               <p>did not know, but he walked about from morning till night and could get no money, there was none left for him—he would get up next morning and go to work for four or five days, as steadily as ever—he is a weaver—Understand he has been with the army in Spain—I do not know of his being wounded—he told us he never had any thing amiss with him.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with us about three weeks before this happened - my wife had known her nine years ago; she went out washing when she lodged with us - she lodged in the second floor back room; I occupy the first floor - I had fourteen sovereigns in a bag, which was in a box; my wife missed them on the 29th of November, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning -I was out at work at the time; I had gone out at six, and I did not miss it myself till I came home at one - I had seen it all secure on Wednesday night, the 28th, the night before; the box was locked - I found it broken open, and I also missed the other articles stated in the indictment; on the 8th of January I found the handkerchief in the prisoner's box, which was down in the kitchen - she had left the house on the 29th, leaving her things behind; I did not miss the handkerchief till I found it - she had left the house as soon as the money was missed, but my wife followed her, and found her with the money in her hand; she was taken up then about the money, but nothing was found on her, and she was liberated by Mr. Laing, the Magistrate - that was in November, and when I found the handkerchief in her box, she was taken before Mr. Laing again, and I believe he would have committed her, but an officer came forward; I then indicted her.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I have known the prisoner nine years - she lodged with me before I was married; I saw the fourteen sovereigns and a half safe in the box in my first floor room, on the Saturday night and Sunday morning, in a red bag - I locked the box, and had the key in my pocket; on Monday morning, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner told me to go and make my bed, fetch the water, and do what I had to do, and she would sweep up the room - I did not go out of the house, only into the yard: I was not gone above a minute, and when I returned she said she was going out - I said."Where are you going?" she said she would be back again between one and two, and on my opening the box to put my husband's coat in, I found it unlocked, and missed the money - not a soul had been into the room besides her; a man and his wife live up stairs, and the prisoner lodged in the back room - I ran out immediately, and found her in the witness' room with the money in her hand; she would not open her hand to let me look at it, but she had it in her hand - I asked her to return me what she had not spent; I saw a sovereign and some silver in her hand - she would not open her hand to show me the whole of it; she only just opened her hand, and said she would not give me a bit of it - this was about one o'clock; she had left me about half-past ten; I brought her back to my house, and was going to shut the door to take the money, but she abused me - this was about two o'clock; I lost the handkerchief out of the same trunk - she said she saw a great many more good things in the trunk, and she was to blame that she did not help herself to more; she never came for her things - she never called for her trunk.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was called into Miles' house on the 8th of January, in the evening - he said he suspected the prisoner had a handkerchief and some money of his; she went in with me, and opened her trunk herself - she looked to see if her things were correct, and threw this handkerchief out of her box, saying "This is not mine;" Miles picked it up, and said, "It is mine." and that he knew it by a mark - I found some loose silk run into the edge of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN HEMUS. On the Sunday before the prisoner was taken she came into my mother's - I think it was in December: she told my mother she had no money, and was very poorly off - she drank tea with us, and next day, at one o'clock, when I came home to dinner, she was very much intoxicated, and asked me to go to the play with her- she said she would treat me and my mother, for she had plenty of money; I said I had to go to my work - this was two or three days after the prosecutor lost his money.</p>

            . About Christmas I heard a man who was with the prisoner, and who she called Harry, say,"What a fool you was, you had not taken all Miles' money;" and she said, "Was not I?" - I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, denying the charge, stating that she had left the house in consequence of the prosecutor's ill-temper, and had summoned him afterwards for 1l. 19s. 11d., for things detained.</p>

A cry of stop thief! was given, and they ran up Finsbury-place into the square; two young men pursued them, with the watchman, the prisoner was stopped on the south side of the square.

I had lost sight of him myself; but I am certain the prisoner is the man, I had an opportunity of seeing him: there are two gass lamps, one on each side of the street, I saw him plainly, and will swear to him; the whole transaction did not last ten minutes; he at first ran from me, and then passed me again. I am sure that the same persons who robbed me came back again. My watch, except the case, was found in the square.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; we were coming home together on the 29th of December; just before we turned the corner of Crown-street, we were stopped by two men-the tallest took hold of me; I begged of them to go about their business, and not interrupt us. As soon as the tall man let go of me, I saw the watch go out of my husband's fob, and called out, they have got your watch; I turned towards them, they were making towards South-street, I cried out, thieves, you have got his watch! They turned round, came back again, and passed us at the corner of Cross-street, Finsbury-place: when they had got past Lackington's shop-door I heard the glass of the watch break, and called out, you are breaking his watch, thieves. I turned round, and saw the prisoner hold up his hands, and he said, I have got it (speaking to his companions). I pursued them, crying, stop thief! several people were gathered in the square, and I stood with my husband till they brought the prisoner up. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I am sure that the same men that ran down South-street came back again; I did not lose sight of them till they got into the crowd; my husband was not in liquor. When I saw the prisoner at the watch-house, I knew him to be the same man, he came up to us, and followed us, in Broad-street, about a quarter of an hour before; he said something to us, I do not know what, and Mr. Stubbs said, what does that fellow want? It was on the dark side of Broad-street, we crossed over to the other side, the lamps gave a good light at the time, quite sufficient for me to see him, so as to know him; I looked at him several times. I lost sight of him in Moorfields, but I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am porter to a master-tailor. On the 29th of December, I was coming along Finsbury-place at the time, the prisoner was with another man, taller than himself; I saw them running from the prosecutor. I pursued the prisoner, with the watchman, till he was taken. I ran from Finsbury-square to the corner of Wilson-street, and from Wilson-street to Lackington's, where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they took that direction did you see them take any thing - A. No; I saw them run from the prosecutor to the place where the prisoner was taken; I did not see them come back again; I did not see them go towards South-street. I am sure that the prisoner is one of the men that I saw run from the prosecutor, he was not out of my sight of the whole of the time. I saw them run straight, from the prosecutor, down Wilson-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you first see me - A. In Finsbury-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did I run - A. From Lackington's, round the corner into Wilson-street, which is the next street to Lackington's, and leads into Moorfields. When the prisoner was taken, he said he was not the thief, but that he was running after the thief. I am certain that he is one of the men that ran from the prosecutor; I did not lose sight of him the whole time till he was stopped. He had a silk handkerchief tied round his neck, which covered the lower part of his face. When the watchman said that he would take him to the lady and gentleman, to see if he was the man, he pulled off his black silk handkerchief, and put it into his hat; he had a white one on underneath, which made him appear quite different. He was taken to them, and the lady said he was the man.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square. On Sunday night, the 29th of December, at half-past ten o'clock, I was crying the hour; I had got to the end of the street which looks into the square, I heard a woman say, "You villian, you have got my husband's watch: I know you have, I heard you break the glass." She cried out "thieves! these two men have robbed my husband of his watch." I being on the opposite of the street, facing them, I saw a bustle by the gaslights; I ran across the road to the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner, in company with another man, run from Mr. Stubbs to the other side of the square, towards Sun-street. I sprung my rattle, and called out stop thief! I ran as fast as I could, and some persons passing at the time, held out their arms, and prevented the prisoner from getting any further; I came up and collared him. I said you are my prisoner, of whom the alarm was given; I will take you to the prosecutor to see if they will know you again. As soon as Mrs. Stubbs saw him, she said he was the man. When I told him I would take him to them, he took off his silk handkerchief, put it in his hat, and said,"Take me to them, they will not know me, I am not the man." I took him to the watch-house, and searched him, but found nothing on him. We found the watch on the pavement, the glass was broken, and the case gone, opposite Lackington's, in Finsbury-place.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the handkerchief tied round his neck - A. It was round his neck quite up to his nose.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SHREWSBERY. I am a head boorough; I was on duty in Chiswell-street, about half-past twelve o'clock, on the 29th of December, I heard the cry of stop thief! I went to the place where the cry came from; when I came up the prisoner had been taken into custody by the watchman: I went to the watch-house with him, and searched the prisoner. I found a red handkerchief in his pocket, and some copper - He had nothing in his hat. Mrs. Stubbs knew him directly. I found the watch on the pavement, where he had been taken; I did not find the case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Stubbs came into the watch-house, did he not charge two or three persons with it - A.He said two men did it. I told him to look round to see if the other man was there, he said, no.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent; I had been spending the evening at my cousin's; I heard the alarm, and went to the lady to see what was the matter, she ran from me towards Cross-street - I followed her, a young man stopped me, and attempted to stop two or three more, Mr. Stubbs was intoxicated, and charged several men with the robbery; his wife said, she could not say I was the man.</p>

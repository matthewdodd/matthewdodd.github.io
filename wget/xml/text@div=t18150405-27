               <p>On Monday the 18th of February, I watched him about dinner time. I was below; he was above in a room where the yellow thick post paper was kept. I saw him looking out of the window; I then went up stairs; on his seeing me, he threw a quantity of paper out of his apron. I took no notice; I came down stairs, and kept on the watch. In about five minutes he came down stairs. I watched him to the Post-office; it then appeared to me as if he had something under his apron. I left the prisoner at the Post-office. I communicated to Towgood what I had seen; he watched him.</p>
               <p>Mr. TOWGOOD. I followed the prisoner from the Post-office to Mitre-court; he hurried down Mitre-court, and stopped at the corner. I came upon him unexpectedly, by reason of his stopping, and told him to come back; he came along with me as far as the public house in Sherborne-lane, then David Gibson, another clerk, came up. I told Gibson to go up to him, to see that he threw nothing away. I saw found upon him half a ream of paper.</p>

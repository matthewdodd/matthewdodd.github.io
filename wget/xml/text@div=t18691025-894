                  </hi>. I am a servant at the Old Swan—I was in the bar when the male prisoner came in, and saw him shake his sleeve—Eldridge said, "This won't be for me," and took it out of his hand, and bent it four times—I sent him for a constable; and when he had gone the prisoner walked out, leaving half his <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi>—he went up Swan Lane, and nearly at the top of it met the female prisoner; he put his hands to her breast, and she dropped what, I think, was a shilling, but which sounded bad or cracked—I said, "What do you do with that bad shilling?"—she stooped to pick it up, and I said, "What has that to do with you?"—she went down Swan Lane, towards the house, and I followed the man to the corner of Lawrence Poultney Lane, where he took a guard off his neck, and either threw it away or put it in his pocket—he went into All hallow's Pier, where I gave him in custody—I went to the Mansion House next day, to prefer the charge, and saw the female prisoner walk to the cells where the male prisoner was put—I pointed her out, and she was taken in custody and brought into the Court.</p>

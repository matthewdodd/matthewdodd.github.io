                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Monmouth-street, Cannon-street-road. On the night of the 14th of April, from nine o'clock till eleven, I was at the Royal Crown, and saw the prisoner and a female, named Mary Ann Jones, at very high words—I saw the prisoner strike her once or twice with, his fist in the mouth—I afterwards saw him take up a poker, and threaten to hit her on the head with it—he threw it down among the ashes, as I interfered—I afterwards heard her exclaim that he bad hit her on the head—she did not say what with—I turned round, and he was standing by the fire-place, with the poker in his hand—he did nothing with the poker—she was at the other end of the room, six yards off—he put the poker down into the ashes a second time—I saw a wound on the top of her head, which was bleeding—he walked out of the room, and she walked out after him—I believe they were both in liquor—they had been drinking to<lb></lb>gether for an hour, and she aggravated him to it, calling him very bad names, and his mother too—when he hit her with his fist she called him names—he took out the poker and said he would hit with it if she did not get out of his way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 151.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief" near the Royal Crown on this night, and saw the prisoner run across the road from the house, pursued by other persons—another man found him lying down under a wall—he was charged with having done something in the public-house—he said nothing, but in going to the station he said he hoped I would be lenient with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Royal Crown. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I was going into the tap-room, and saw the prisoner take the poker up, and strike the young woman with it—I noticed blood come from her head, but not much—they were both having very high words, and when she went out of the room he followed her out—it was a single blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. Mary Ann Jones was brought there on Friday morn<lb></lb>ing—I examined her head—she had received a lacerated wound of the scalp, of about two inches in extent, and a contusion of the back of the right shoulder—there was a little extravasation of blood—it might have been attended with serious consequences if neglected—it was such a wound as a poker would make—it extended through the scalp, it broke the skin, but not the bone.</p>

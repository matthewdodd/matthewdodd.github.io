               <p>Cornhill. On the 14th of march between nine and ten o'clock in the evening I was in Cornhill very near my own residence wallking home alone—I felt a pull at my pocket—I immediately turned round and seized both the prisoners—Johnson was withdrawing his hand from my pocket at the tie—they were not close to me—I have never recovered my handkerchief—I re<lb></lb>member taking it out at the Mansion-house not a minute before, and I put it in the pocket where I felt the tug—it was a red silk handkerchief, with a yellow border—I could only hold Johnson—I gave him in to custody—Bird was stopped and taken by Collis almost immediately—I belive him to he the same person for in the struggle to get away he left part of his shirt in my had and when he was taken par of his shirt hir was found deficient and the piece corresponded.</p>

                  </hi> I am a glass cutter and live in Clerkenwell green. I first saw the prisoner in King William-street with a third Preston—I watched them for about twenty minutes attempting several gentlemen's pockets lifting them up and putting hands in, as sit seemed to em—this induced me to watch—I saw prosecutor in Cornhill—Johnson had hold of Mr. Fletcher pocket—I saw him take something form t(I cannot swear it was handkerchief and give to third one whom I pursued, but he got away a—I then heard a cry of "Stop thief "and Bird was run<lb></lb>ning away—I caught hold of him—I am positive he is the one I never lost sight of him—Mr. Fletcher had part of his shirt in his hand.</p>

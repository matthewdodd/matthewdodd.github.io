                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 9, Windmill Street—on Sunday night, 3rd August, I was standing outside the door with my mother and bister and heard the prisoner and his wife quarrelling upstairs; he said, "I will put your b——light out before the night is over," after that I heard a thumping noise—while I was standing outside the deaf and dumb boy came down and made some signs to me which I could not understand—he went upstairs again, stayed three minutes, and came down and went up the street with his brother George, who said something to my mother; they bath went away and returned with the police.</p>

On 3rd August, after midnight, George Pilfold and his dumb brother came to me together—George spoke to me and I went with them to 9, Windmill Street, to a room on the first floor, where I found the prisoner partly undressed and apparently asleep; a woman was lying on her back on the part of the bed next to the wall, her clothes were wised up to her knees—I saw she was dead—I saw some blood on the hearth, and sent 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., who was with me, for an inspector and a doctor—the prisoner lay still asleep, and in a short time another constable came, bringing the dumb son, who had left the room, and who woke his father up and pointed to the dead body of the woman—the prisoner said "What is the use of taking notice of that b——drunken cow, she has been drunk like that for the last month, and a b——good job if she is dead who the b—hell fetched you two b——great fellows to me in my own room 1 I suppose it was that lazy young swine, George; how is it that he has not gone to work? if you don't let me out I will jump through the window"—he went towards the window and partially raised it up, but was prevented by another constable—the inspector then came, and Mr. Wilson, the doctor—I found this pearl-handled knife under the dead woman's body when Louisa Marks was taking off the clothes for the doctor to examine—I also found some halfpence and a farthing on the bed and took them—nobody had interfered with the bed till the inspector came—the woman was on the hed, as if she had been put there—she was on her back, and her legs were stretched out straight.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a police-inspector at this time, and on duty at Kennington Road Station, when George Pilfold and Constable 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. came to me about 12.20, and from what they said I went to 9, Windmill Street, and saw the deceased's body lying on the bed next to the wall—the prisoner and his dumb son were there, and Walsh—on the right side of the hearth I found a patch of blood about 12 inches by 8, and a great quantity of blood about the room and about the bedding—the woman's clothes were quite saturated—I sent for a doctor—I asked the prisoner his name—he said "George Pilfold," and that he was a tinplate worker—I asked him if the deceased was his wife—he said "She is not a b——wife to me, a b——good job if she was dead"—I said "I am afraid she is dead"—the doctor then came—I asked the prisoner if he had a knife—he handed me a small white-handled knife, and said "This is what I use as a toothpick"—he proceeded to take the things out of his pocket, and I said "I will search you myself"—in the inside breast-pocket of his coat I found this brown-handled knife—I could trace no blood on either of the knives—I saw blood on the dumb boy's clothes, and asked the prisoner how his son came by it—he said "He got that by lying down there," pointing to the blood on the hearth—the dumb boy made some signs, and another brother who was in the room, not George, motioned to him to be quiet—I know that it meant that because he ceased directly—the sergeant was acquainted with the sign language a little, and he commenced to communicate with the dumb boy, and the same son said "He won't tell him anything, let him stop till to<lb></lb>morrow and go to the gentleman at the schools. (<hi rend="italic">The interpreter</hi>)—I said that I should take the prisoner in custody on suspicion of murdering his wife—he said "I will go with you"—I examined him, and found no blood on him, and I handed him over to Sergeant Hawkins—I measured the room—it measures 11 feet by 10—I made a survey, and there was no sign of any struggle taking place—the bed is a piece of sacking with some flock—I also looked at the chairs, but found no blood on them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was nothing inconsistent with them both having laid down and gone to sleep that night—the prisoner had not his coat and waistcoat off when I went in—it was not necessary for me to search him—he would have given me everything willingly—he did not make a show of resistance, or give me any trouble—he was drunk, and I do not think he knew what he was about.</p>

I live at 33, Great Charlotte Street—I was called on the night of 3rd August and found the body of the deceased lying on a bed on the floor; the prisoner was there and Inspector Whitney and one or two constables—I first examined the body in the position in which it was lying and discovered a large quantity of blood on the clothes which were covered with liquid motion which had escaped with the blood—I could not see externally where the blood proceeded from on account of the dirt which was upon the body, and requested that a woman should be sent for to wipe away some of the dirt and help to remove the clothes—I then saw blood flowing from the vagina, but there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150192"></xptr>
               <p>was no wound or abrasion outside the vagina. (<hi rend="italic">A diagram was here put in showing the situation of the wound, and this part of the evidence was unfit for publication.</hi>) The inspector showed me the small blade of a knife which fitted the wound exactly, but it might have been done by any penknife—I made a post-mortem examination next day with Dr. Cyril Jones—the wound could have been inflicted while she was lying on the bed, but I do not think it could have been done if she was sitting flat on a chair—her clothes were very scanty—her age was 59; the brain was healthy, but almost bloodless, and the body was very empty of blood—there was a slight bruise on the right temple, and a deal of bruising under the scalp and extravasated blood—if she was sitting on a low chair and in front of the edge it might have been inflicted sitting, but I did not notice the height of the chair—I noticed a patch of blood on the hearth, it appeared to be bright arterial blood, which would be the first to flow from such a wound—my opinion is that it was inflicted near the hearth; it was the only clotted blood, the ordinary blood was soaked into the bedclothes—when the wound was first inflicted the blood would flow more freely, and being in larger quantity it would not be absorbed by the clothes—there would probably not be time for blood to be on the knife—that is the result of an experiment I made that night—my idea is that the knife was inserted under the clothes—the whole-handled knife which fell from the woman's body would inflict the wound; there would be very little difference—the blood would certainly spurt from the arteries very quickly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If she had been drinking heavily she might sleep very heavily, and the insertion of the knife without violence might not wake her, but it might have been done by a stab.**********</p>

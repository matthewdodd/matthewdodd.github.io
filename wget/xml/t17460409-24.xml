            .) What do you know of these Spoons?</p>
               <p>Woodifield. I lost one in January last, and the other in February; and they were pawn'd at Mr. Brown's Shop. I advertis'd them, and Mr. Brown brought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Woodifield. Yes, my Lord, I took him to my own House, and he own'd the Fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the Prisoner with them both?</p>
               <p>Woodifield. He carried the second to Mr. Brown, and he stopt him.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090017"></xptr>Woodifield. I took him before the Justice, and he own'd the taking of the Spoons; he said, that it was thro' great Necessity that he did it, and that he never did any such Thing before.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner was a Foreigner, and spoke by an Interpreter.</p>
               <p>Interpreter. My Lord, he says he only borrow'd the Spoons.</p>
               <p>Court. Ask him if he will ask the Prosecutor any Questions.</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He has no Questions to ask.</p>
               <p>John Brown. The Prisoner came to my House the 12th of February, and brought this Spoon I have in my Hand. I saw something fil'd on the back Side of the Spoon, which made me have some Suspicion, or I should not, for I have known the Man for three or four Years. He said that it was his own. I advertis'd the Spoon, and several People came, but none came up to the Marks of it: After that I saw an Advertisement of Mr. Woodifield's. I went to Mr. Woodifield's with the two Spoons, and Mr. Woodifield compar'd them with some other Spoons, and we match'd the Silversmith's Mark; we compar'd them with some other Spoons of theirs, and found that they tallied exactly. I describ'd the Person I had them of; they said he came to their House very often. The same Day he came again; upon that they stopp'd him, and he own'd he took the Spoon, and said it was pure Necessary put him upon it. When he went before the Justice, he own'd the same, and seem'd very ignorant of the Nature of the Crime.</p>
               <p>Court. That's the Spoon you are sure you had from this Man?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, tell him, is his Time to make his Defence, and call any Witnesses if he can.</p>
               <p>Interpreter. My Lord, he says the Gentleman that keeps the Tavern in Pall-Mall would speak for him, and that several would have appear'd for him, if they had known of his Trial coming on.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor gave the Man a very good Character, and believ'd it was mere Necessity, that he had a sick Wife, &amp;c. and he offer'd to take him into his House himself.</p>

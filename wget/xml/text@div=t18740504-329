                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of Silas William Baggs and others, accountants at 28, King Street, City—on the <hi rend="italic">evening of</hi> 27th February, about 7.30, I went down in the basement and saw two piles of books ready for removing—I went up and told Mr. Baggs what I had seen—he told me to go down and lock them up again—I went down and the books were gone—I went to the street door and I saw a barrow in the middle of the road, about 50 yards from the house—I saw three men and the prisoner by the barrow—I could not distinguish the books then, as there was a covering over the barrow, but I saw them afterwards and they were the same books that I had seen in the basement—I went in and told one of the partners, and I followed the barrow in consequence of what he said—when I <hi rend="italic">got</hi> into Lawrence Lane with a constable, I saw the barrow tipped over and the woman and one man wore trying to set it right again—one of the partners came and gave them into custody—I heard her say at the police station that the man was her husband and he denied it—the lock of the door where the books were, I found was loose, and there were marks on the door as if there had been something put in to force the lock—it had to be mended.</p>

I was in Cheapside about 7.45 on the 27th February—I was called to King Street by the first witness—I saw a barrow in Lawrence Lane tipped up—I saw a man at the back of the truck and the woman was assisting him in lifting it up—I said to the woman "I shall take you into custody for stealing those books"—the first witness said the books belonged to his employer and I sent for Mr. Baggs and he came and charged them—at the station the woman said that George Young the prisoner who was tried last session was her husband—he said he was not she then said she had nothing to do with it whatever.</p>

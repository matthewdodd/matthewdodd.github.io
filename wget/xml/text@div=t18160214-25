On Friday last, at a little before eight at night, my lad was shutting up the shop; I was backwards in the parlour, and I saw the prisoner struggling with the lad, who was trying to prevent his gitting from behind the counter; he pushed the lad down, but shop was close to the street door, the lad gave the alarm of stop thief, and the prisoner was almost immediately brought back again. The stockings in question were removed from the shelf where they had been, and were on the ground under the counter, where the prisoner had left them.</p>

            . I was going along Fenchurch-street, and I saw the prisoner enter Mr. Pitt's shop; he had no hat on; I waited a short time, not knowing but the prisoners belonged to the shop, and then I went about my business. When I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140026"></xptr>got about thirty yards, I heard the cry of stop thief; I perceived the prisoner running in the direction which I was going, and I met him, and tripped him up, and look him back.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Pitt. As I was shutting up the shop at about eight o'clock on the night in the indictment, I observed the shadow of a man when I was outside, going towards the shelves; it caught my attention, and I looked behind the counter, and saw the prisoner there; I called my master, and the prisoner sprang against me, as I had a shutter in my hand, and pushed me with the shutter down, and with an endeavour to stop him, I knocked his hut off. I pursued him, crying stop thief, and in a minute afterwards he was brought back.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating his various services on board's numerous list of ships in the inte American War, and that on the evening of the 9th of February, he was passing by Mr. Pitt's door, and some drunking sailors sky-larking took off his hat, and threw it into Mr. Pitt's shop, behind his counter, and that in his attempting to recover it, he presumed he must have knocked the stockings down, and the fear of being taken into custody innocently, and for no real criminal cause, when the cry of stop thief was raised against him, made him run.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service as a carpenter—on the 3rd of December, in conse<lb></lb>quence of suspicion, I watched him from Whitecross-street into Three-Kings-court, where he had been working for me at some old buildings for five or six months—I saw him bring down a batten on his shoul<lb></lb>der, and take it to his own house, which is a quarter of a mile off—he left it in the yard, and there the policeman found it—he had no business to take it there at all—I know it belongs to me, by the quality of it—he had the care of it—I kept it there to shore up some buildings.</p>

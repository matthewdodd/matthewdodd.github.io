               <p>About a fornight since I put a sum of money in my desk, in the counting house, in the evening, when I went to lock up my money, I should something short, one and an half, or two, but one and an half positively; I put in thirty guineas and an half, and I found only twenty-nine. I suspected that some person in the house had robbed me; I clear the till in the middle of the day and lock it up, an uncertain sum, it is not usual for us to tell it, but this was a certain sum I had taken of a customer; I mentioned my apprehensions to my partners, and asked them if they had taken any money from the next box, they said no. I said I would mark some money, and put it into this box; I marked fourteen guineas and an half, and put it into the same desk, in a little bowl; in the evening I found only thirteen and an half of that I am clear; the prisoner stood near me, he was clerk to us; I had not resolution enough to seize him, though I strongly suspected him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the desk open or locked? - It was sometimes left open, and he had access to it by that means; I did not take him that night, but I told one of the servants to ask him to lend him three or four guineas, which he did, but he said he had only some silver. I put in the remaining thirteen guineas and an half; and the next evening, which was last Thursday, while I was up at tea, the servant whom I told to borrow the money of him, came up to me, and said, Sir, I am very fearful the clerk is the person that you suspected, for I saw him at your desk with the bowl in his hand. When I went down, which was not immediately, I found the money just as I had put it in, thirteen and an half: hearing that the prisoner had been at the desk, I suspected that he had found he had a marked guinea. I determined to mark some money in another way; this was a visible mark with a cross; next morning I marked 19 guineas; in the afternoon between four and five, I called the servant into the counting-house, and bid him see that I put nineteen guineas into the bowl; and between six and seven I went to the money, and told it, and found one guinea gone; I told my partners here is one guinea short of what I can swear I put in, and I suspect the <rs id="t17821016-16-deflabel84" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

I went and mentioned it to the prisoner, and told him my suspicions: he said, How can you suspect me, you are welcome to search me? I found nothing about him but a few shillings; he persisted in his innocence; I told him to pull off his shoes, I found nothing there. I was fearful I had suspected a wrong person; I was ready to make concessions to him. Then I searched the rest of the people in the house. I told the prisoner if he would confess, I would not take any notice of it, he still persisted in his innocence. The servant said, let him take off his breeches; the prisoner replied, you would not be so indecent as to have me strip. I insisted he should pull off his breeches, and he pulled them off, and immediately the guinea dropped out. The prisoner fell down on his knees, and said, for God's sake, have mercy on me, I am a ruined man. I took up the guinea, I found it marked in the same manner as the other eighteen guineas; I gave it to the constable

At this time there was near 50 l. due to him for wages, he put into our hands 15 l. at interest. He had lived with us three years; he lived in a stile that we thought he could not afford, but we knew he had good friends: I am much hurt at his conduct; I feel for him as a man: but I thought the guilt was too great to escape public justice.</p>

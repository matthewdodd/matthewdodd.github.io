                  </hi>. I am one of the prosecutors in this case, and carry on business as wine merchants at 9, Mincing Lane—I have known the prisoner as a dealer in casks for some time—on 13th March I received some information from Mr. Putley, a cooper, of St. Mary-at-Hill, and I sent a clerk round to see if the cask was ours he sent about—on Monday, 17th, I asked the prisoner where he got the cask from—I said "Where did you get that octave from that you sold to Mr. Putley on Thursday?"—he said "I bought it of Martin"—he is one of our servants—I sent for Martin, and I said "Did you sell the new octave to Mr. Gillingham?"—he said "No, I never sold any to him"—the prisoner said "You did sell it me, and I promised you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—I asked him when he bought it: he said "At the same time as I bought two other casks from Harris—he is our bead cellar<lb></lb>man—I asked him which way he took it up, "Did you take it through the flaps or through the staircase?"—he said "Through the staircase"—casks are never taken out that way—Osborne, the police officer, Harris, and Martin were present—I asked the prisoner where he got the previous octave from—he said "Martin sold me that also"—Harris had sold him two casks on the previous Thursday—that I knew—I saw the new octave at Mr. Putley's, with our brand on both heads—we never sell new casks—we have given no one authority to sell a new cask—Martin had not authority to sell a cask of any kind—he was under cellarman—they were generally sold by myself—the value of the cask was about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave the prisoner in charge—anyone could come through the staircase and take that away through the building, without the men seeing it.</p>

I assist my father, who is a cooper, at 40, St. Mary-at<lb></lb>Hill—I have known the prisoner for some time as a dealer in casks—on 13th March the prisoner brought three casks to me; there was a port pipe, a port quarter cask, old casks, and the third was a new octave—we do not ordinarily buy new casks—it had Ronaldson's brand on—I asked him where he got it—he said it had been one sent in and not used—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I had bought one of the same kind on 6th March—I sent round our clerk to ask if it was all right—the value of a new cask would be 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

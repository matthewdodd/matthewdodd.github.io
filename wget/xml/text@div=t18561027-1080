                  </hi>. I am a widow, and take in mangling, at No. 4, Bridge-road, Battersea, I rent a house, and have some lodgers; Mrs. Alcroft occupies the back parlour adjoining the room where I mangle—I the mangling room fronts the street—the room is entered by a door on the left of the passage from the street door—there is a string through the street door from the latch, so that it can be opened from the outside—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, the 15th of this month, I left home a little after 8 o'clock—I locked the mangling room door, and took the key with me—I returned a little before 11 o'clock—I found the street door open—it appeared as though it bad given way to a sudden jerk—I found a night dress under my feet the minute I opened the door—I picked it up, and then looked to the basket, which I left full, and found nearly all the things missing—there were six chemises, four table cloths, a lot of children's things, a night dress, and several other articles—I know the female prisoner—she had been in my mangling room that afternoon—she is not a friend of mine—she came in to know whether a next door neighbour was there; and then the party sitting there asked her to drink out of the pot she was drinking out of-these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a portion of the articles I missed—I know the male prisoner by sight—he and his wife live near me.</p>

I received some information from the last witness, on the morning of 16th, at about 6 o'clock, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's house, No. 0, Europa-place, about one hundred yards from the prosecutrix's—I saw Mrs. Pritcbard—I told her she was to consider herself in custody for stealing a lot of linen, the pro<lb></lb>perty of Mrs. Skinner—she said she knew nothing at all about it—I then told her I should search the place—in searching her room I found a small portion of the things—I then made a further search in a box up stairs, and found the remainder; all of them that were stolen—when I found the second lot, she said, "Oh, my good Lord!" and threw up her hands—I examined the lock of Mrs. Skinner's mangling room—I found the lock had been forced away from the wood work, by pushing.</p>

               <p> A Newbolt+. On Tuesday night the 25th of June, I was with the Society of London Scholars (Bell-Ringers) at the Cock and Lion, in St. Michael's-Alley, Cornhill, where I stay'd till one in the Morning; and then I and a Weaver,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173306280010"></xptr> went away together, we parted at Bishopsgate, and I turn'd down Hounditch. My Business requiring me to be up at 3 in the Morning, and I seeing a Light at the <placeName id="t17330628-20-crimeloc87">George Alehouse</placeName>

The Prisoner and her Husband and another Man and Woman were sitting together, and when I had paid my reckoning and was going, the Prisoner's Husband ask'd me, if I would not drink with them? Yes, I said, I am not Charish. I staid till 2 Tankards were brought in, and then I paid 6 d. which was more than my sha e came to; they saw which Pocket I put my Money into, and if they had seen my Watch too, I might have lost that. I went out and stood to make water, when in a minute, I felt the Prisoner's Hand in my Pocket, I catch'd hold of her wrist, and heard the Money chink in her Hand, but before I could get it from her, she had shifted it to the other Woman who stood close to her. The Prisoner was not out of my Hands, till I gave her to the Watch, but the other Woman went off directly. I had half a Guinea, 6s. 6d. and some Copper in my Pocket, all which was then taken from me.</p>
               <p>+ The Poulterer, who 3 or 4 Years ago, walk'd 100 Miles in Moorfields in 27 Hours.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you go into the George with me, or the other Woman ?</p>
               <p>A. N. With neither,! went in alone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it me or the other Woman that you pick'd up? That's your own Opposal. I don't know what to say to him. He's not worth my Argument; I was with my Husband.</p>

He went with her to one end of the Table, and sing'd a very fine Song to please Ladies, and then he brought her to us and sing'd another Song, and then he paid 6 d. and went out with her; and., like a Jack-Aks as I was, went out to do what no Body could do for me, and the other Woman stumbled against me, and went away; and so he took me for her, and said, I had pick'd his Pocket.

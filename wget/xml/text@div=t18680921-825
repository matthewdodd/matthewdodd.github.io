                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 28th August, about 5 o'clock in the morning, I was in Bouverie Street, watching the "Daily News" office—I saw two carts standing there, I longing to W. If. Smith &amp; Co.—Brown was the driver of No. 10 cart—Donovan came out of the office with a bundle of papers on his back—he spoke to the driver of the other cart, No. 18—and then went to Brown, who opened a bundle of papers that were lying on the foot board of No. 10 cart—he took three quires and put them on the top of the bundle that Donovan was carrying on his back—Donovan then left, and I followed him into Tudor Street—on the way I had the three quires of paper marked as he was currying them—I did not mark them myself—he carried them to Mr. Atkinson's shop in Tudor Street, put them down at the door and waited a quarter of an hour till Mr. Atkinson opened it—Donovan took up the three quires that were marked and gave them to Mr. Atkimon—he then took the bundle he had brought from the "Daily News" office into the shop—I waited about ten minutes, when Donovan came out—I asked him whose papers they were he had taken into the shop—he said they be<lb></lb>longed to Mr. Atkinson—I told him I saw him receive three quires from the driver of one of Mr. Smith's carts in Bouverie Street, a short time since—he said he did not—he said "All the papers I took into Mr. Atkinson I brought from the "Daily News" office—I took him in custody, handed him over to another officer, and then went to Mr. Atkinson's shop—I found the</p>

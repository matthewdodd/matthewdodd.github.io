                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live in Northumberland-street, Mary-le-bone, and am a valet. On the 19th of February I was in Northumberland-street, and met the prisoner face to face—she came close to me and put her hand into my trowsers pocket, and I pushed her—after she left me I felt my pocket and missed my purse, which contained five sovereigns and a half, and a £5 note—the moment I found it was gone, I ran after her—she was running very fast in the New Road—I called a policeman and stopped her—she said, "There is your money, there is no need of calling police," and gave me a purse, but it was not my purse—the policeman showed me my purse afterwards.</p>

On the 19th of February I was in the New Road—about ten o'clock at night I heard a cry of "Police"—I ran up, and on the opposite side of the way saw the prisoner and the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, and two other men, standing—I crossed over—a gentleman who under<lb></lb>stood French explained to me what the prosecutor was complaining of—at that time he had a purse in his hand with four farthings at one end—he said there should be a £5 note in the other—I said, "Where is the £5 note?"—he directly said, "That is not my purse"—I put my hand under the prisoner's cloak and found another purse, containing the sovereigns and a £5 note—she said, "Oh, give him the purse, and don't take charge of me"—I said, "Yes, you must go to the station-house"—the farthings in the purse were new, and would look like gold at night.</p>

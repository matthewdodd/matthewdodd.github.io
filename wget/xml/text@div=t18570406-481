                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Howe, a groom, of No. 32, Middle Grove Street, Commercial Road. On 25th Feb. I went with the deceased Eliza Bunn to the prisoner's house, in Commercial Road. I believe he takes likenesses—we were shown up stairs, and saw the prisoner—I asked him for my boy's likeness, which he had taken in the morning—he said that the boy did not sit still, and he did not wish to let me have it, he would like to see the boy again—I said, "You cannot see him again, for he has gone to sea; he went this morning; it is very unkind and ungrateful of you not to let me have the likeness, as the boy has gone away, and I may never see him again"—he said it was not correct, and he would not let me have it—I said, "I have recommended you several customers, and it is very unkind of you;" and I said, "It is the generality of men like you, who take likenesses and keep them if they are good, to hang at the door for show; and if you don't let me have it, and I see it hanging at the door or anywhere else, I will smash it"—upon that the prisoner caught me by the shoulders, and went to push me out of the room—the deceased was standing close to me—she was thirty-six years old—she was a neighbour of mine—the prisoner pushed me towards the door, and Mrs. Bunn went in between us, to prevent his pushing me out of the room, and with that the prisoner fell down—Mrs. Bunn merely said, "Don't push my friend out of the room"—I did not observe whether he had anything in his hand at the time; I was very excited—there was a pan by the side of the fire, with water in it—the prisoner fell by the fire; the room is very small; I do not know whether he fell on the pan; the pan was broken, and the water was all over the room—I ran out of the room on to the landing; I turned round to see whether my friend was coming, and they were both scuffling together—I went into the room again to part them, to get my friend to come away—I then saw that the prisoner had a hammer in his hand, and he struck Mrs. Bunn on the head with it, and it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060034"></xptr>
               <p>sounded just like you would sound an empty tub—I said, "Oh my!" when he struck the blow, I was so frightened—she said, "You fetch a policeman, and I will hold him till you come back"—I then went and fetched a police<lb></lb>man, and the prisoner was taken to the station; we charged him there with the assault, and then we went before the Magistrate that same day, and he was fined 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or eight days' imprisonment; the deceased and I then went home to my place, and we then went to her own house, which is right opposite my place—I did not think at that time that she was seriously hurt; the blood was flowing all down her face when we went to the station and to the Magistrate—I saw the blood in the room when she was struck—I did not see her again till the next day, Thursday; she was then in bed, and complained of her head—I saw her again on the Friday; she seemed a little worse then—on the Saturday I fetched a medical man to her, and from what he said I went with her to the hospital—I went to the hospital on the Monday, and found that she was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the prisoner fell, did you observe whether the deceased pushed him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not say whether she pushed him, or how it hap<lb></lb>pened; she might have pushed him away from me without my seeing it—I do not know whether she did or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I believe you told Mr. Yardley that the blow was not struck at the deceased, but at you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said it might have been meant for me; I was so agitated at the time that I really could not put my statement pro<lb></lb>perly, I was in such a way about my boy going away; I meant that you might have struck at me instead of Mrs. Bunn—I had not been drinking that morning, I had had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy to drink my boy's health with, and that was all—the deceased had had two glasses of gin.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 21). On 25th Feb., about 2 o'clock, or half past, in the afternoon, I was called to a house in Langley Place—I went up<lb></lb>stairs to a back room on the first floor, and there saw the prisoner, the deceased, Mrs. Howe, and another female, named Willis—I saw blood com<lb></lb>ing from the fore part of the deceased's head, apparently from a blow, it was running down her face; she had hold of the prisoner by his neck tie, with her hand twisted so as to bring it tightly round his neck—she gave the pri<lb></lb>soner into my custody, and said that he had struck her on the head with a hammer—the prisoner replied, "See how I have been served; I did strike her, but I was excited into it," at the same time pointing to a small scratch near his eye, and to his shirt, which was slightly torn at the bosom—he also said, "They then threw me into a pan of water," and he turned his coat tails on one side, and showed me his trowsers—he said, "They threw me down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060035"></xptr>
               <p>and I fell with my behind into a pan of water;" the pan then lay in the room broken into four or five pieces, and the water was spilt about the room—I then said, "What is this all about?"—Mrs. Howe then stated in the prisoner's presence what she has stated here, about her son's likeness—that the prisoner refused to give it up, and tried to put them out of the room; that they refused to go without the likeness, a scuffle ensued between them, and he struck the deceased on the head with the hammer—I said, "Where is the hammer?"—this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was then brought to me by Willis—I then took the prisoner to the station, and to the Magi<lb></lb>strate—on 2nd March I heard of the deceased's death, and took the prisoner again into custody—I said, "Mr. Clark, I must apprehend you in conse<lb></lb>quence of the woman, Bunn, being dead in the London Hospital"—he said, "Is she dead, I am very sorry for it"—he seemed much agitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you recollect what kind of weather prevailed on the morning of the 25th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I recollect it was a dull morning, rather inclined to rain—I know that you walk lame, and are said to be paralyzed on one side—you walked lame in going to the station, and I had a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to take you to the police court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he seem weaker than an ordinary man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—he did not appear to have that use of his left side that a person usually has—he said that he was using the hammer at the time, knocking in some small tacks to hang his pictures on—Mrs. Howe said that he took it off the chimney piece—when I first went into the room, great excitement prevailed amongst all the parties—the prisoner was trembling; he appeared to have scarcely strength enough to stand, the deceased hanging on to him in the manner in which she was, having tight hold of his neck tie; she was in a state of great excitement, and so was Mrs. Howe—I had my doubts about their being sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon at the London Hospital. On the afternoon of 28th Feb., I saw the deceased, Eliza Bunn, at the hospital, she was not sensible—she had a wound on the right side of the forehead—she continued insensible till she died, on Monday, 2nd March—I examined her skull next day—I found a very small punctured fracture, evidently made by some small pointed instrument; it had perforated the outer part of the skull, and the inner part, being of a more brittle nature, it had split and fractured two pieces off—in my opinion that Was the cause of death—this hammer would be precisely the instrument to cause such an in<lb></lb>jury, the sharp point of it—I tried the hammer, and found it fit exactly with the external fracture of the skull—I consider it would have required a hard blow to cause the injury—I should say it must have been a smart blow, not a blow of extreme violence; it would cause blood to flow immediately.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have admitted from the first that I used the hammer, but I used it in self-defence, being in mortal fear of my life, struck down as I was by two able bodied women standing on my own hearth; it would have been of no use for me to attempt to obtain the protection of the police, because, before the police could have arrived, I should have been in the same position as the unfortunate woman whose death I lament; it was in defence of my own life and property that I struck the blow, and the moment it was struck I regretted it; I had no idea that anything like death would have resulted from it, it was not a blow calculated to produce death; it was done without premeditation, without any other impulse but that which has been considered the first law of nature, self-preservation; if you can convict me of manslaughter on this charge, I do not believe there is a gentleman among you who will be safe in his shop or warehouse from the attacks of persons who excite their passions in gin shops, and then come to your premises; I had no intention of injuring the woman, still less of de<lb></lb>priving her of life; I only wished to defend my own life.</p>

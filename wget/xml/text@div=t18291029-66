               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Have you always said he took the bacon from the shop? A.From the window, and that he put his arm in and took it - I am sure he did not hold it up, and call out that he had found it; several people came round.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had he any body with him? A.There was a man with him, who kicked the bacon when he dropped it; the prisoner was a little intoxicated - he was walking with a man when he came into Grafton-street.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Brown's employ at this time. I was in the shop, and heard a noise at the wire of the window - I turned, and missed the bacon, went to the door, and saw my brother holding the prisoner; I took the bacon off the ground, and took it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this a kind of projecting-place? A. No; it was in the window - my brother was coming up the street; I was standing with my back to the window: when I got out five or six persons were round.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day in question I had to receive a bill in the City; on my return I called on a person, and took a glass of ale - between five and six o'clock my wife came for me, thinking I was out late; we all drank tea together, eight of us, and left to go to the Theatre - as I passed this shop I saw the bacon on the ground, and not being quite sober, took it up, and said, "Here is a bit of bacon:" the young man immediately collared me, and I said I had just picked it up.</p>

I apprehend the prisoner at No. 3, Palace-row—as he went to the station he said he had a very good master, that he had done very wrong, and was very sorry for what he had done, that he had taken the money and absconded, made use of the money, and went down into the country as a drover, and his father and mother had nothing to do with it—I cautioned him that I should have to relate what he said.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, St. Mark's Road, Notting Hill, and am store man at the Pimlico Stores—on 5th August (Bank Holiday), a little after seven in the evening, I was in the Admiral Blake public-house in Ladbroke Road, and met Murphy and some more females there—I went in to ask the barman if they had a <hi rend="italic">later vine</hi>; they said no, but there was one at the house opposite—while I was talking Murphy asked me if I was going to stand them anything—I paid for something for them and left to go home—the women followed; there were two; one has absconded—I went into the fields across the footpath; they overtook me and dropped into conversation with me—we were standing talking together when Finn came up; he seized me by the throat with his left hand and dealt me a blow on the chest with his right, and said "What the hell are you doing with my wife?"—he still held on, and with the assistance of the two females they got me down; I struggled with them for a time; the man rifled my pockets; they then released me—I called out for assistance—there were plenty of people passing to and fro; it is a public thorough fare; two persons came to my assistance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187809160058"></xptr>
               <p>—my watch was disconnected from the guard, and was thrown on the ground at a little distance from where I had been lying—the prisoners ran away; I followed them; the police came, and I gave Finn in charge—Murphy picked up the watch and gave it to me; she did not lay anything; that was when the policeman was coming—the blow Finn gave me stunned me for a time—I had had two pennyworth of whisky, that was all, and I had not finished that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at 146, Clarendon Road, Notting Hill—on Bank Holiday, about 7.30 or 7.45, as I was passing down this field, my attention was called by another witness, and I saw Murphy and another female talking together with the prosecutor in the shed—all at once I saw Murphy go out round the shed and beckon to Finn; he and two other men were lying down behind the shed—Finn came round into the shed, caught the prosecutor by the throat and struck him twice in the chest—I was about 10 yards off, on the public path that goes just by the shed—I saw Finn take the prosecutor's watch and drop it—I went and called the policeman—Murphy said to me You blasted fool, why don't you mind your own business instead of interfering?—I saw the watch on the ground; I did not see who picked it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There is a public path within 30 yards of the shed—there was not a great crowd when Finn was given into custody, there were several people—the shed is about 100 yards from the public-house—Finn had his coat on when he was taken—the prosecutor and females were in the shed about five minutes—I was looking on—I had not been to the public-house.</p>

I am a butcher, and live 4, Goulburn Terrace—on the Bank Holiday, about 7.15, I saw the prosecutor talking to Murphy and another female outside the Admiral Blake—I was there about twenty minutes or half an hour, waiting for my brother-in-law; he did not come and I went on towards the fields—the prosecutor left the two females and came in the direction I was going, towards the scrubs—about five minutes afterwards I saw the two females coming behind me, they went up and spoke to the prosecutor again, they got into conversation and went and stood by the shed—three men came running close behind, and one of them as he passed said to me "Come on, mate, we are going to have a bob or two out of the <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi>"—Murphy called to Finn, who came up, and just before he got there she put up her hand to stop him—the prosecutor then walked away behind the hut in the direction of a second shed; before he</p>

               <p>got there the two females joined him again—I spoke to Goldsmith, asked him to stop as I thought there was something wrong—I than saw Film run round the hut and collar the prosecutor by the coat and strike him—the watch was dropped close to my feet, and I believe Murphy picked it up and gave it to the prosecutor—the policeman came up—I asked Goldsmith to go and fetch him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The watch was no doubt dropped in trying to pass it—I had been in the public-house, and I saw the prosecutor standing there with the two females on the opposite side of the bar—to the best of my recollection he had a glass of ale, the glass was standing right in front of him—I was standing outside these sheds about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The prosecutor was a perfect stranger to me—I was about a yard from the male prisoner when the watch was dropped at my feet—the glass was broken—the prisoner and prosecutor had just got off the ground—the female was close to my side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 15, Equity Buildings, Somers Town—on 6th April (Easter Monday) my husband went out about 6.30 in the morning, he said he would come in to an early breakfast—we were quite happy and comfortable—he did not come in, and at 12 o'clock I went to look for him, and saw him standing outside a public house with three more persons—he called to me twice and said "Come here, I want you to speak to these people"—I felt very much annoyed and said "You have played me a very nasty trick, why not come home to breakfast?"—I could see that he got cross, he said "Come here and speak to these people"—I said I would rather not, I must go home to my baby for fear she should cry, and I turned round and said "It appears to me that anybody's company is better than mine, when a man has got a good wife he should know how to take care of her," and I walked away and came in doors—I was speaking to my little girl, when the street door was burst open and my husband came in, he tore off his coat, put it on the bed post, tucked up his sleeves, and sparred as if he was going to fight a man—I did not think I was going to be struck, for we had been so happy lately—he said "You b----you have tried to get me out of my work"—I said "No, that would not be to my interest for my children's sake;" and with that I got a blow in the face and was sent up against the wall—I had my baby in my arms—I stood there and said "Alfred, what is the matter 1" then I could see that he was in liquor, and that he had been drinking spirits and spirits do not agree with him—he struck me another blow on the left breast, swearing at me at the time—I gave my baby to the little girl and sent her into the</p>

               <p>street that she should not hear the vile language; he then threw me on the bed—I could see that he was working himself into a dreadful fit of passion—he took the bread knife off the table and said "I will murder you, that I will"—I said "Kiss me, will you be calm?"—he got his knee on me, took off my shawl and untied my bonnet, and rubbed his thumb along the edge of the knife and said "This is not the knife for you"—and he pulled out a spring-backed clasp knife out of his pocket—I screamed for mercy—as I saw the knife come down I put up my hand and got the knife in my hand, but I don't think he intended to murder me—I was cut, but he was sober immediately it happened, and he went and got a bowl of water and said it was nothing but a mere scratch, and told me to put my hand in the water—it was a severe cut, but I think he said that because I should not be frightened—he threw the bowl of water out—I tried to calm him and took no notice of the cut—he said "I will see to it for you, it will be all right"—I said "You have got no sticking plaster or strapping in the house" he said "I will get some"—he did not want me to go out—I said "Very well, you go and get some and do it for me"—I was weak with loss of blood—I had only been confined eight weeks with this baby, and my little ruse was to get out into the street and when he went out I ran into the next house and shewed, the people my hand—I went to a doctor and met my husband coming with the sticking plaster and some lint—he seemed very hurt at my being in the street—the doctor refused to bind up my hand unless I gave him half-a-crown, and I could not afford it—we were going home, and as we come along we met the policeman, and he said that he should take him—I did not want to give him into custody—I forgave him for it soon after it was done—I don't believe he-would have done it, but he had had no breakfast and had had some spirits—we have been very happy lately—he had a good situation as a brewer's man—I have been married twice, he is my second husband—I was in service before that as housemaid—we have been married about five years—I have five children, two by my first husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I was called to the police-station to dress the prosecutrix's wound—it was about two inches in extent, jagged circular wound, between the index finger and thumb of the left-hand, it was a superficial cut, not dangerous unless erysipelas supervened—it was evidently done with a knife—this knife was shown me at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I can explain how it was. I went out in the morning to clean my horses. I said most likely I should be in to breakfast, but I was not; I very rarely am. I had some letters to take for the firm. I went back to the stable to clean the harness, and stopped to speak to a man and his wife, and another man opposite a public-house. I had had something to drink certainly. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> wife came on the other side of the road and sung out to mo. I did not like it; I wanted her to come across and speak to me. She would not and I felt vexed, and we had high words at home. I don't recollect hitting her with my fist. I picked up the knife. I had not the slightest intention of cutting her. I thought of frightening her. Directly I saw the blood I was frightened, and I was very sorry. I hardly know what I did. She is a good woman.</p>

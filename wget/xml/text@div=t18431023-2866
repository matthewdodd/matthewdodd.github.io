On the 17th of Aug. the whole amount I owed him was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I paid the prisoner, and he gave me a receipt—I have three bills, and Mr. Poulton was in our shop when two of them were paid—I do not know which they were—I cannot say whether I paid the prisoner 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in Aug. or Sept.—I have paid two or three bills since the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know the amounts—this bill was left with me—I cannot say who re<lb></lb>ceived the money—Mr. Poulton took some of the money—the prisoner formerly lived with my husband—I have known him seventeen or eighteen years.</p>

               <p>the prisoner into my employ, he having been with the former proprietor—he was authorized to receive money on my account, and should account to me when he came home, but if late, in the morning—on the 17th of Aug. I re<lb></lb>ceived two guineas from him on Mrs. Payne's account—I have his book here in which he entered that amount—he did not say he had received any further sum from him—(<hi rend="italic">entry read</hi>)—"Payne, cash, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., pays all up to July 27"—that would be the amount due—that was in the book when he came home—he carried the book with him—he ought to make the entries at the time he received the money—there was a larger sum than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due at that time—if he had entered only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I should have known that more was owing, and I should then have asked why more was not paid—the entry that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was all up to July, appeared correct according to my know<lb></lb>ledge—I do not think I looked at the book to see whether up to 27th July two guineas was owing—there was more than that owing, but I was not aware of that at the time, as I did not make the account up till afterwards—I afterwards received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of Mrs. Payne—I never received the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for this bill marked B—there was another amount of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I did receive—it was in two amounts, and here are the two bills—the whole amount I have received since the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had received none before—this 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is entered in his book, in his writing, but not as paid—I never received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as having been paid by Eleanor Allen in Sept.—I gave him into custody on the 18th of Sept.</p>

I paid the prisoner for 129 dozen in a week—I never owed the prisoner any money—he always had his money on Saturday night—he has never owed me any money, except what he robbed me of—there has not been a dispute between us of about as much as 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he would have to call on perhaps twenty or thirty customers a day—he always took the book with him—he has not been a week or ten days without settling, nor three days—he might have been three days, but not more—he had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he is married, and has three or four children—I deal in soda water and lemonade, and also sell oysters—I was present on one occasion at Mrs. Payne's when the prisoner was paid, and only on one—I was round with him—I may have been round with him two or three times lately—he usually delivered me this book every night, when he came home, and sometimes not till the next morning—I had no notion that he was going into the service of another ginger beer seller—I very seldom play at skittles—I believe I may have played one game with the prisoner, but I would not swear that I have, it was in his presence, I played with the landlord—I have played at cards with him in my own house at night, when he has been there to mind the shop, when my wife or sister have been out—we did not play for any thing, only to pass the time.</p>

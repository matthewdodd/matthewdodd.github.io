                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Park-street, Grosvendor-square, and am a baker. The prisoner was in my service in April last—Charles Tibby, the deceased, was also in my employ, and Lid been so a fortnight or three weeks—on the 26th of April Tibby came into the bake-house, soon after one o'clock—there was nobody there besides me—he took off his coat, and I sent him out with dinners—it was usual for him to take them out with<lb></lb>out his coat—he returned shortly, and was going to take a tin dish from a cupboard outside the bake-house—the prisoner was either coming into the bake-house or going out—Tibby was taking the small dish out of the cup<lb></lb>board—the prisoner said, "Don't take that dish; I shall want it"—I saw them close together at that time—Tibby took the dish—I sent the prisoner out with some dinners—he returned in about five minutes, and I left Tibby and the prisoner together in the bake-house—(I did not know of their having any quarrel then)—in about ten minutes afterwards I heard a bit of a noise in the bake-house—I distinctly heard the prisoner's voice in a crying kind of a tone—I had just sat down to dinner—I jumped up, and was going to run down to the bake-house—when I got to the shop, at the top of the stairs leading to the bake-house, I heard one of them commence run<lb></lb>ning up stairs—I was going to call out, "What to heaven is the matter with you?"and just then Tibby made his appearance, with his arm bleeding, which he showed me—I told him to go over to Mr. Elsgood, the doctor—I gave him a kind of linen bag to cover his arm with—he went, and I ran down into the bake-house, and saw the prisoner sitting on the trough-board eating his dinner—I said to him, "Good God, what have you been doing to the young man? do you know how you have cut his arm?"—he said, "I was sitting on the board, eating my dinner—he went to strike me, and he struck the knife,"or "ran against the knife,"I cannot say which he said, I was so flurried at the moment—I left him then—the prisoner has lived with me about two years—he was as inoffensive a young as never entered a house—I never saw him disposed to quarrel with anybody—they were both quite sober at the time—I never saw the prisoner tipsy—I consider they were on good terms—I never saw any thing to the con<lb></lb>trary—I went over to Mr. Elsgood, who advised the deceased being sent to St. George's Hospital—I fetched a coach, and took him there my<lb></lb>self.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of St. George's Hospi<lb></lb>tal. The deceased was brought there on the 26th of April, about half-past two or three o'clock in the afternoon—I found a wound, about five inches in length, in his left arm, nearly to the bone, about three-fourths of an inch deep—I dressed it immediately—it had been dressed previously, but was still bleeding, and I dressed it again—it went on favourably for the first four or five days—it then sloughed, or, as it is called, mortified—he lost a large quantity of blood at that time—I was called up as many as five times in two nights to him, as he was bleeding—it was necessary to ✗mputate the arm on the evening of the eighth day—afterwards, secondary depo's formed in the knee and shoulder joints—he died on the 18th of May—his body was opened—I examined it the following day, and found it generally in a healthy state—there were no traces of disease but in the knee and shoulder joint—there was a small abscess in the lungs, but not of great importance—the immediate cause of death was the formation of the secondary depo's, and the constitution being much pulled down by loss of blood—I was informed he had been in the habit of drinking—the remote cause of the secondary depo's was, no doubt, the injury of the arm—his King addicted to liquor would add much to the sloughing—the wound in the arm would have an effect on the shoulder and knee joint—it is a common thing after a wound has closed for depo's to take place, which may be as much in one part of the body as the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe what you mean by depo's is an accu<lb></lb>mulation of matter in different parts of the body from the circumstance of the mortification? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was no appearance of that till he under-went amputation, which was on the eighth day—the appearances that I saw after death confirmed the reputation that he had of being addicted to drink—that would make him a bad subject to overcome an acute injury—I never saw the prisoner at the hospital—Maria Frost was a night nurse in the charge of the deceased, together with an extra nurse, whom I ordered, as his was a dangerous case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the situation of the wound, and the length and depth, can you undertake to say, as a matter of certainty, that the injury might have arisen from the party receiving the wound attempting to strike, and striking his arm on the edge of the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot undertake to say whether it might not have been inflicted in that way—it was a wound from which I should have expected a healthy man to recover—I have seen hundreds recover from much worse wounds—the pre-disposition of the man's con<lb></lb>stitution contributed very much to the fatality which happened.</p>

               <p>"The said Charles Tibby being in full possession of his senses, saith, I do not think I shall get over or recover from the wound under which I am now suffering. About two o'clock in the day-time, on the 26th of April last, George Gray, a baker, in the employ of my master, and I had a few words about a tin dish; Gray got off the trough-board, where he was eating his dinner, with a carving-knife with which he was eating his dinner, in his hand, to fight with me. I was leaning against the oven. I had used no violence towards Gray. Gray made a blow at me directly he got near me: at first I thought it was the handle of the knife, till I saw the blood gushing out of my arm, and then I ran away to a surgeon's directly. The quarrel about the dish had lasted about five minutes. George Gray had been eating his dinner, and making use of the carving knife all the time we were quarrelling. George Gray was very jealous of me; and two or three days before this threw an upset at my head, and threatened he would send me to St. George's Hospital. On the day I was stabbed, George Gray and I were both per<lb></lb>fectly sober."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the nurses at St. George's Hospital. On Saturday, the 28th of April, I found the deceased in the Winchester ward, in which it was my duty to attend—I attended to him in the manner pre<lb></lb>scribed by Mr. Chappell—on the first night I attended him he wished to be talking, and I checked him—on the following night, Sunday, when I went on duty, the deceased asked me what I thought of his arm; if I thought he was likely to lose it—I told him it was not for me to answer those ques<lb></lb>tions; but referred him to the house-surgeons in the morning—he wished to ask me several questions, and I said, "Was it an accident?"—he told me it was an accident through a quarrel with his fellow-journeyman, in con<lb></lb>sequence of a tin which ho wanted to got from him (the prisoner)—that he</p>

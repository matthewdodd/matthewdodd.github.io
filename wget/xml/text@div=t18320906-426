Yes; I was not in the public-house five minutes, for it was time for them to shut up - I had only one glass of ale there; we had two glasses of rum a-piece - I knew in the morning where I was; I did not know that night - I did not know the number of the house, nor the name of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060169"></xptr>street - I was sensible - there was one young woman there when we got there, and another afterwards, and a young man who belonged to the house.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl, and live at No.7, Collingwood-street. On the 19th of August, about two or three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came there, and the prosecutor with him - the prosecutor laid on the sofa, and went to sleep; the prisoner said, "I will go and see what money my friend has got;" he put his hands into both his waistcoat pockets, and took some money out -I saw some silver, but I did not see any gold; he put it into his trousers pocket - the prisoner then wanted to go up stairs with my friend Miss Slater, but she would not have any thing to say to him; he then went out, brought in two Policemen and the watchman, and said that Miss Slater had robbed him; the prisoner took off his coat, and threw it down at one end of the room; the watchman took it, and found in it an old silk handkerchief with a sovereign and a half tied up in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What house is this? A. A lodging house - there were myself, Slater, and Mr. Farley the landlord there, besides the prisoner and the prosecutor; they did not come to see us - they came, and wanted something to drink; the prisoner went up stairs with Slater, but he did not stop - we were all there when he took the money from the prosecutor's pocket; we did not say any thing to him; I saw some silver in one of his hands - he turned one of the prosecutor's pockets out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A painter and glazier - I let the house in different apartments not to young women in particular - there was one man in the house named Size; the prisoner came to see him - I do not know what trade Size is; I believe these young women see gentlemen, but when I found what house it was I left it altogether - I was not there when the prosecutor and the prisoner came; I came down when the prisoner was making a great disturbance, and begged him to be quiet - I saw a sovereign and a half found in the coat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor - he knew perfectly well where he was going, for he named it to me; these two girls and this man were in the room - one of the girls went up stairs, and I after her, leaving the prosecutor on the sofa asleep; I then missed a sovereign and a half from my pocket, and being in liquor, I suppose I took it out of my fob and tied it in the handkerchief - I then called in the Policeman; we went into the parlour - the prosecutor was still asleep; the watchman came in, awoke him, and asked if he was robbed - he said No; he said,"You had better feel," and then he said, "I have lost 1l. 15s." I said,"Well, I will be searched," and I pulled off my coat; the girls said, "Serve him out;" they then beat me, and gave me a black eye. <rs id="t18320906-426-verdict2405" type="verdictDescription">

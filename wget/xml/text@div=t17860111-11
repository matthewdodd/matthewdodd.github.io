             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Branscomb, I am perfectly acquainted with his hand writing, I see him write his name many times in the course of a day.</p>

               <p>Is that his hand writing? - No, Sir, it is not.</p>

               <p>Does it bear much similitude to his hand writing? - I do not think it does.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Does he make B. like that at all? - I do not think it does.</p>

               <p>Court to Rogers. Look at that bill? - I recollect this perfectly well, this is the draught the prisoner presented to me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not make any mark upon it? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>But you passed it over to Mr. Lubbock? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What is there remarkable in it? - Mr. Branscomb's name upon it, I think I should know it.</p>

               <p>Can you venture to say that this is not the same signature to another note? - I do not think it is.</p>

               <p>But I apprehend you do not mean to say as a conscientious man, that it is not the same signature; some person might have imposed upon you? - No, I do not think it would, unless the paper had corresponded also.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow objected to the note being read, as it was signed J. Branscomb, and he said it was equivocal whether John or James; and he also objected that the Banking-house was not properly described, there being no such firm as Sir

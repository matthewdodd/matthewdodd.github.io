                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">watch-maker, King-street, Cheapside.</hi> About a quarter-past six o'clock, in the evening of the 12th of Feb., two strangers came to my house, and occupied my attention about a quarter of an hour, and during that time they managed to extract four gold chains—this one now produced is one of them—I am certain I had not sold it—it was bought on the 29th of Jan.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant A</hi> 11.) On the 9th of March I took the prisoner, in Adam-street, Walworth-road, on another charge—on the 24th, he came to Union Hall with his solicitor, to claim the chain, which was in the hands of an officer, and I told him he must consider himself in custody for receiving that chain, knowing it to be stolen—he said it was given to him by his uncle, named Wood, a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor, in Hanover-street, Walworth-road—I made inquiries, and saw Wood—there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> there with the name of Wood on it, and the address is Hanover-street, on the license.</p>

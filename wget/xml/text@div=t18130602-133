            . I am a bookseller, in Broad-street, St. Giles's. On Saturday evening, the 10th of April, the prisoner came into my shop; he offered to sell me this book; it is Ovid's Metamorphosis; it is the last translation; he asked me seven shillings for it. I told him I thought it was handsomely bound for a man of his appearance; he said his son was a bookbinder, he got it from his son. I asked him is son's name; he said if I would let him go he would bring his son to prove that he had given it him. He was a miserable looking creature, and the book by no means corresponded with his appearance; however, I let him go for that time. On Thursday morning following he came into my shop while my boy was taking the shutters down; I came down half dressed; the prisoner was then in my shop demanding the book in a peremptory manner; I said have you brought the person that gave you the book; he said he had not. I took him to the watchhouse myself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the book worth - A. I have valued it at two shillings; it has ten shillings and six-pence marked in it, that is the selling price; the ten shillings and six-pence is my private mark; it was never sold by me or my people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18130602-133-person1162">Wright</persName>
             I got it of a person to sell; I throw myself on the mercy of the court. I am past my labour.</p>

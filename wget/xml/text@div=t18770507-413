                  </hi>. I and my little sister Louisa, lived with my mother, the prisoner, at 31, Wellesley Street, Somers Town—on the Thursday before I went to the police-court, my mother came home and beat me with her hand, because I was asleep, and threw me up against the door—she then told me to go into the bed-room; she then undressed me and told me to go into bed—I lost a scapula that she had put round my neck and she put the poker in the fire and told me to undress, I did undress and she took the poker out and held my hand and commenced to turn me—she burnt me on the neck and sides, and on my back and arm—the poker was red when she put it on my arm—it ceased to be red whilst she was doing <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, but it was hot, it hurt me—it was late at night when this occurred—three days after<lb></lb>wards I was seated on the door-step, and Mrs. Hazlehurst spoke to me and took me into her room, and afterwards to the police-station—this is the poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 1, Oakley Square—on Thursday, 22nd March, I saw the boy at the Pratt Street station—he was suffering from severe injuries in various parts of the body and the upper extremities, he appeared to be in pain and was crying; I found numerous marks of burns on him, about twenty at least, they were such as would be made by this poker made hot, they were serious, they destroyed the whole depth of the skin and were ulcerated—the worst were across the bend of the left elbow, also across the arm at the back of the shoulders five or six across the abdomen, and as many across the buttock, especially the right buttock where the poker or something similar had been laid across—he was taken at once to the Infirmary.</p>

I was medical officer of St. Pancras Workhouse—on 22nd March, I examined the boy—there were marks of severe burns on his upper extremities and across the chest—the tissue of the skin was destroyed and ulcerated—they were of such a character as might be produced by a poker made red hot; they were dangerous to health, he was under my care until the 17th April—at first he suffered very much pain, he was Compelled to be kept in bed.</p>

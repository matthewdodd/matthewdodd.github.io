She went into the shop, I can't tell the day of the month, it was between the 28th of June and the 6th of July, I was along with her, she took down the canisters, and I took down some; she took half a pound of tea, some green and some bohea, half a pound all together, a pound and a half of soap, half a pound of candles, that was the first time. The second was the 24th of July in the night. I let her in and let her lay with me; I left her in the parlour, and while I went down in the kitchen, she pushed the lock back and got in the shop; and out of a little room, which is between the shop and parlour, she took two shirts, a quart bottle of wine, and a quart bottle of cherry brandy. The white wine belonged to a lodger in the house. She carried them out, and said, she'd go and pawn them to make a little money, but would return them again. My master and mistress missed the shirts, and she was taken up ; she owned she took the things, and sold the tea in German street and the soap for six pence, before justice Fielding. I lived there six weeks. I am married, my husband is a soldier. The two shirts produced in court. I know these to be my master's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shepherd to James Smith, a sheep-dealer, in Black Lion-lane, Westbourne-green. On the 10th of January I had a flock of sheep to take to the London market—I put them that afternoon in Mr. Chapman's field, at Northolt—I removed them from one to an<lb></lb>other of his fields between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and re<lb></lb>mained with them till between twelve and one in the afternoon, which was the last time I saw them that day—they were then all safe—there were a hundred and eighty-six of them—I went there the next morning between six and seven o'clock, and missed one Down wether sheep—we had twenty of that sort in the flock the day before—I only found nineteen—I counted them, and then searched about the field, and found the skin, with the head and neck left in it, in a field called Workhouse-field, not one-eighth of a mile from Mr. Chapman's field, where I had left it safe—it was hid in</p>

James Ste<lb></lb>vens, the young man who found the meat first, is not here—he showed it to me—there is no thoroughfare through the field—I jumped out of the hedge and ran between the prisoners at once—I did not jump on them—one stood out of the ditch, and the other in the ditch—I do not think I frightened them—the meat fitted the skin—it was a four-year-old sheep—sheep are full-mouthed when four years old—no farmer has got any of these kind of sheep round about where I dwell—there are very few sheep about there, and I believe none of this sort—I live at Sudbury, which is nearly thirteen miles and a half from here—I did not find the whole of the sheep, only part of the hind part—the legs and shoulders were gone—I found the rump, loin, and best end of the neck—the loin and rump fits to the loin of the skin, and comes back to the tail—it is here—one of the prisoners was taken on the Saturday, and the other on Monday night—I knew them by sight before—I have spoken to them if I met them on the road—I was before the magistrate—a man named</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Crown at Northolt. I was a butcher for twenty years. White produced part of the carcass of a sheep to me—I compared the carcass with the skin—there was part—of the hind quarters—it corresponded with the skin, in my judgment—I believe it had belonged to the skin—the legs had been cut off and left on the skin—I mean the legs, not the thighs—it is what we call the shank bone without the thigh—I have seen the skin produced and the meat—it is the same I saw before the Justice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that two legs were left in the skin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. the two leg-bones—the part usually left on a leg of mutton is the thigh—the legs are in the skin now—the thighs have been jointed off at the hip bones, and left in the thigh—there is as much of the leg left with the loin as is cut away—it was not cut in a butcher-like way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Northolt. On Saturday night, the 7th of January, I took George Jackson into custody—I and Giblet went to his father's house at Northolt, and asked if he was at home—I went into the house, but did not see him at first—we searched the house, and took the candle to go into the bed room, and either his father or mother blew the candle out—we got another light, and searched under the bed—we found the prisoner George between the bedstead and the wall, naked, except his shirt—we told him he was our prisoner—he came out and dressed himself—we told him he and his brother were together after this mutton—that we had got a warrant out against him and his brother for taking the sheep—he said nothing—I took him to Hanwell cage that night—on the Monday night following I took the other prisoner, between Westend and Northolt, about half-past eleven o'clock I met him in the road with another—when he saw me coming, he jumped across the road to the other side—I went across, caught hold of his collar, and said, "Jackson, you are my prisoner"—the other man ran away—he said, "What do you want me for?"—I said, "You know what I want you for, for Mr. Smith's sheep"—I took him to the Plough at Northolt, and asked him whether he was the man who killed the sheep—he said, no, he was not the man who had killed it—I said, "You know who did kill it"—he said he should not like to transport any body—he told me William Harris killed the sheep—I took him to the cage—next morning I took Harris—I was before Lord Montford, the magistrate, when the pri<lb></lb>soners were examined—I heard them examined—I saw his Lordship write down what they said.</p>

On 9th Nov., Mr. Gilbertson was not at home—Mrs. Gilbertson was in the morning, and when she went out she left the female prisoner (whose name was then Mary Parker) and myself at home—she said, at dinner-time, that she would go out and get some yeast, to make some cakes for tea—she had then been in the service five or six weeks—she left at five o'clock, and did not come back—I had seen of mistress's watch the night before, and I think I saw it that morning on the washhand stand in her bedroom.</p>

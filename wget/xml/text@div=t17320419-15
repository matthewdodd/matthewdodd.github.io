She told me, That as she was sitting upon the Vault something had forc'd from her. I went immediately for a Midwife, who came in half a Quarter of an Hour and examin'd her, and said, there had been a Child. We got her to Bed, and then took a Candle and look'd down the Vault, where I saw the Leg of a Child, or something like a Leg; for in the Surprize I was in, I hardly knew what was what.</p>

            , Midwife. The Prisoner was in a very dangerous Way: I thought she would have dy'd. We were forc'd to cut off her Cloaths; for she was so bad that we had not Time to undress her to put her to Bed. I ask'd her how this Disaster happen'd? She could hardly speak then; but after some time, she said, As I hope to be saved I had no Notice of my Labour, but thought it was only the Cholick when I went to the Vault, and while I sat there I had but oe Pain ; a forcing Pain that brought down the Child from me, and I was in such Disorder and Surprize, that I could not stir my self if it had been to have saved my Life.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it usual for Women to have such hasty Labours? Midwife. 'Tis not common, but I have known 2 or 3 Instances that have been under my Care. Court. Did she tell you that she had a Child? Midwife. Yes; and I asked her whose Child it was? and she said her Husband's. Court. Was this before or after you had examined her? Midwife. It was after; for she was swooning away and dying, and not able to speak before. Court. Do you think it was likely the Child should come from her in such a Manner? Midwife. Yes; I took the Child up and wash'd it. Court. Did you see any Marks or Bruises? Midwife. No; it was clear. Court. And full grown? Midwife. Yes.</p>

            . I was with the Midwife when the Child was taken out of the Vault; we wash'd it in a Tub, and carry'd it up to the Prisoner, but she took no Notice of it. The Midwife ask'd her what she had provided for it? and she said, She had one Shirt in Goodman's-Fields, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taken with a Pain like the Cholick, and thought it was nothing else. I went to the Necessary-house, and there I had a violent Pain that brought the Child into the World. I was not able to stir. I call'd for Help, but the Vault being in a back Place no Body heard me. I have been lawfully marry'd 14 Years. My Husband often went away from me, but he has been with me several Times within this Twelvemonth.</p>

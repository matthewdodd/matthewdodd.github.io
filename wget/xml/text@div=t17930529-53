               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; I lost all the articles mentioned in the indictment, on Saturday the 19th of July; I lost them from No. 14, Cleveland-street, they were all carelesly thrown into the two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room locked? - Yes, I put in the things and went out Saturday three o'clock, and never saw that room till Sunday morning half after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you apprehend they could get at these things, did the door appear broke? - The door was locked the same as I left it, when I came back</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any window to the house by which they could get in? - No. On Sunday we had not a thing to put on our back.</p>
               <p>Q How do you conceive the people got into the room? - This prisoner had the house a year and a half before we went to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no violence done to the window? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no violence about the room at all? - Not the least, my key opened the room door the same as ever; I don't know how they could get in except by picking the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover the property? - They are in the court with the pawnbrokers, all that I could find, I have found none but what the pawnbrokers own to that are in court.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he kept the house before you went to it? - He told us that he kept the house, but I was to have the house till I could suit myself with a house.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he to do with the house, did he sleep in the house? - There was nobody in the house but his wife and him, and his two children.</p>
               <p>Q Did he sleep in it till the time he was taken up? - He never was taken up till about a fortnight ago, he was about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290106"></xptr>house the Sunday and Monday after the things were put in, but after that Monday he never came into the house, till about a fortnight ago when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty. How long is it since you got in this house? - Only on the Thursday before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath when did you take lodgings in that house? - Mrs. Fisher told me I might be there till I could suit myself with a house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The fact is I keep this house, and I have pawned these goods with them gentlemen; this good woman was turned out of her house in Mary-le-bone some time before this happened, through keeping a bad house; Mrs. Rivers being my landlady, begged me to let her have a room in my house, accordingly I agreed to it; Saturday the 21st of July she came to me, and asked me to help her to move these things into the lodging, she told me if I would go and help her in with the things she would pay me; a fellow workman called on me expecting I would go to work, but I did not; in the midst of it she told me that she was distressed for a little money to make up her rent, and that her landlady had told her that she would cartainly seize the things if she did not make up the money, and she asked me to go and pawn these things; accordingly I told her I would, and I went to these places, I carried the things that she gave me, I went out once and after I came back, she told me that was not enough, and she desired me to go again, I went the second time, and when I came back I gave her the money and the duplicates, before my fellow workman; the Monday following I went into the country to the harvest, this woman never said a word to me good, bad nor indifferent. I found on Sunday that she came with three women of the town and abused my wife very much; on Monday morning I spoke to her and she said she had got a drop in her head, and did not know what she said; Monday evening I met her and she told me she had got a warrant against me; I told her she had no right to have a warrant against me; she did not say any thing to me, good, bad or indifferent; and when I was in the country she turned my wife away, and never let her come into the house any more.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner at the bar for some years back, he worked along with me; this Saturday morning that the woman has been speaking of, he stayed away and did not go to work; he was moving in goods for this woman into his own house, and I lent him a hand down with two or three stoves into the kitchen for her; I see her give him a bundle, I know there was in it two gowns and a black cloak, and he went out and brought in some money and duplicates. I think it was the 19th or 20th of July, it was a Saturday. She told him to pawn the things, I waited till such time as the man came back again, and he gave her some gold and silver and duplicates, and they wanted me to go out and bring in some gin; there was some gin got, a shilling worth, and we drank together, and she had the money the things produced herself, and the first time he came back she said that was not enough; she sent him out the second time with another bundle, and she was very well satisfied at both times.</p>
               <p>Q Had you more gin when he returned the second time? - Indeed we had; the gentlewoman had almost a pint mug full of gin when I came into the place.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you insist upon it on your oath? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court to Gordon. Do you mean to say upon your oath that that fact passed? - I do.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty to Watts. You say these things were pawned with you the early part of the day? - Yes, before dinner time.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call dinner time? - Before two o'clock, but I am not very exact in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were they found at your house after they were pawned? - I think she made an enquiry on Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. This woman swore positively that she went out at half after three o'clock, and then all the things were safe; do you think they were pawned before that time? - I firmly believe they were; I believe they were pawned before two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q You are now stating a transaction that happened ten months ago; what reason have you to induce you to suppose it was earlier than the time she speaks? - Because on the Monday when the enquiry was made I had the recollection of it in my mind, that makes me have little or no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you have little or no doubt, in opposition to this woman's positive oath, or what is the ground of your belief that they must have been pawned earlier? - I recollect being very particular in taking them in, he told me he was a housekeper, and that I might go and see or send.</p>

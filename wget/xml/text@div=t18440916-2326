In the evening of the 12th of Sept., I went to a house with a female, not the prisoner—I went to bed alone, and put my jacket on the bed—I went to sleep, and when I awoke in the morning I saw the prisoner there, and missed my jacket—I asked her for my jacket—she was the only person who came up in the morning—she said I did not pay</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in the Minories, and am in partnership with John Tyler: On Friday, the 1st of November, I let two of my men servants into the shop, about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop a part of the dwelling-house? - A. It is; when I had let them in, I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150029"></xptr>into the accompting-house, where I found the press, in which we kept our silk handkerchiefs, lying upon the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You carry on the <rs id="t18000115-31-viclabel168" type="occupation">slop-selling business</rs>

Yes; the whole stock of silk handkerchiefs was taken out of the press, the accompting-house desk was forced open, the watches and the cash, which I locked up there the night before, were gone; I then went to the back part of the house, my servants accompanied me, I found the shutter of the door wrenched out, that is the door that opens into the yard, the iron work wrenched from the shutter, a pane of glass taken out of the door, the box which the lock locks into wrenched off, the inner bar which makes fast the folding doors continued across the scullery-door, and at the end of that bar a staple with a hasp goes over, and a pin through the staple, that was taken down and lying upon the floor; lighted matches had been made use of to unfasten that bar to give light, for there were matches lying about; then we proceeded into the yard, and found a piece of supersine cloth, two pieces of fine Yorkshire cloth, two great coats, a boy's great coat, a new pair of boy's shoes, and an iron crow; we then proceeded to the outer door, which communicated with a court that goes into Hayden-yard-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an open public court? - A. Yes; it is called Red-lion-court; the bolt of that door was drawn back, and the staple drawn out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the back part of your premises when you went to bed over night? - A. I saw them all secure, the bar, the windows, the door and all, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us what articles you have lost - I will read them to you: ten dozen of black silk handkerchiefs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(Goes on reading.) Twelve dozen of bandana handkerchiefs, six pocket handkerchiefs, a piece of blue cloth containing thirty-six yards, another piece of blue cloth containing thirty-six yards, four pieces of fancy mixture cloth containing thirty-six yards each, ten remnants of cloth containing twenty yards each, two pieces of blue and orange striped cotton containing twenty nine yards each, three pieces of blue striped cotton containing thirty-three yards each, forty-five yards of check calico, one hundred and seven striped cotton shirts, three pair of men's new shoes, two silver table spoons, a silver pap spoon, a pair of silver sugar tongs, four silver watches, five guineas in money, thirty shillings, six sixpences, and four thousand three hundred and twenty halfpence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know there were so many halfpence? - A. I counted them last Christmas but one, and they have remained there ever since, and have been increasing since that time; there was then ten pounds eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Of what value may the whole be? - A. Two hundred and ten pounds, and upwards; they were the joint property of the partnership concern.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Tyler live in your dwelling-house? - A. He does not sleep there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you heard any noise in the course of the night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no watchman in this yard? - A. There is, but he was off the beat, I believe, that night.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Hall and Chapman? - A. Yes, two of the prisoners at the bar; I was hired by them on a Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the officers took you into custody? - A.About four days, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day of the month it was? - A. No, I do not; I was hired by the prisoner Hall, between twelve and one o'clock at night, in the Minories; Chapman was with him, and another man that is not here, to carry some bundles to the top of Crown-street, Finsbury-square; I was standing at the corner of Haydon-yard, in the Minories, when he hired me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there at that time? - A. I was watering my horses to go home; Hall said, he wanted a coach to go to the top of Crown-street, Finsbury-square; I staid till near four o'clock, and then they all three came and ordered me to the top of Crown-street; they had three large bundles which they put into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what they put into the coach? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any thing of these people in the intermediate time? - A. No; not till they brought the bundles.</p>

               <p>Q.Which of them rode on the box? - A. I am not positive, but I think it was the man that is not here; when I came to the top of Crown-street, they were there; they all three went into a house there; they took the bundles with them into the house, and I thought I saw them take out an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did they take that iron crow? - A. Into the house with them; they did not pay me any thing; I was to follow them into the house, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not? - A. After I had seen the crow I thought they had been doing something wrong, and I did not like to follow them; and I went home directly without being paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with the officers to this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew them the same house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were first called in the Minories, by Hall, you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going home; you had no idea of a fare at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you were spoke to and hired by a person at some other part of the town? A. Yes; but that was at Drury-lane House: I had a fare to the Minories; I got there about half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. And you staid there till between twelve and one, watering your horses, and waiting for the person that spoke to you at Drury-lane? - A. No; that person wished me a good night there, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no idea in the world but that it was a common regular thing, till you saw the crow? - A. No; I did not know any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said any thing to the contrary? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you staid there till near four o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Without their giving you any earnest? - A. Yes; one of them took my number.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see where they went to? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When one rode upon the box and the others walked, you had no suspicion then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you had a guinea for your fare? - A. No; Hall told me I should have a guinea, when he hired me.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man accosted you in the Minories, told you he would give you a guinea, kept you three hours, and then brought out the bags, and yet you did not suspected any impropriety? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not follow them into the house, but drove home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been promised a guinea for three hours work, before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as you suspected something wrong, of course when you went home you told your master this? - A. No, I did not; I told him I had been waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you had lost your fare? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did not tell him you had been waiting three hours for three persons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you had been carrying an iron crow? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At last you were taken into custody by the officers, and then you accused some other persons? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The officers enquired of you where you had been? - A. Yes, and I told them.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. What did you suppose these people meant to give you a guinea, instead of eighteen-pence, for? - A. They did not tell me for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you had no suspicion at all that there was something going on that was not right? - A. I did not till I saw the crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should they offer you a guinea, then? - A. It was late at night, and rainy; they were dressed in sailor's clothes, and said they had come from on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this man that spoke to you at Drury-lane play-house? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his name? - A. No; I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never mentioned his name? - A. I believe his name to be Powell, but I do not know; I had seen him several times before.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you seen him before? - A. He was a coachman formerly; and travelled about the country with a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the town does he live in? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you met him before? - A. I had met him in the street, and I had seen him at different watering-houses; and I have seen him in the ranks with his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing all the time you were waiting; you were not watering your horses for an hour and a half? - A. I had been in the public-house, and had my supper.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon were you taken up? - A. On the Sunday night after.</p>
               <p>JOHN READ sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable: I apprehended Salmon, the coachman, on the 3d of November; and in consequence of some information I received from him, I went and took Hall and Chapman in Crown-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150031"></xptr>street; I saw them come out of a house in Crown-street; it was a house belonging to a Mrs. Batt; Sansum laid hold of Hall, and Chapman made his escape as far as Finsbury-square very near, and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you explained the business before Chapman ran away? - A. No; Smith came to my assistance, and we took him to the Compter. I found Mrs. Batt in the house; I searched the house, and found the property that Sansum has to produce; here is a stamp for stamping dollars that I found, and an instrument for casting bullets; that is all that I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mrs. Batt was taken into custody, was she not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SANSUM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went with Salmon to a house in Crown-street, adjoining Sun-street; Read, Tipper, and Smith were with us; he shewed us the house, No. 19, Crown-street; Mrs. Batt's; as I came past the the window, I saw Chapman and Hall talking with Mrs. Batt, in her room; the window was open; I immediately pulled the check-string; we were in a coach; I said, there is Hall, for I knew him very well; I jumped out of the coach, and when I got to the house, they were both got out into the street, and walking towards Finsbury-square; I ran and pursued, and caught hold of them both, one in one hand and the other in the other, by the collar; Chapman got away from me, and Hall I secured; I then brought Hall back to Mrs. Batt's room, where I saw him first; Read and Smith brought back Chapman; I then began to search the apartment where I saw them, and in searching in Batt's work-shop, these things were found; and in the room where I had seen them, we found this ticket and a bit of cloth; I searched Hall, and found the copy of his freedom as a fellowship porter, and his tally, and a watch; I then went up stairs into the garret.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Look at this bit of paper, marked seventeen yards? - A. Yes, that is the ticket; in searching in Batt's work-shop, I found these scattered about; (producing a quantity of cuttings of great coats;) Batt is a chair-maker; and in searching farther, I found this fag-end of some blue cloth, with a ticket upon it, as it is now; (produces it;) in searching further, I found this piece of brown paper with some mark upon it; (produces it;) I also found this centre-bit, this small saw, and this iron crow; this crow I have tried, both ends of the crow, the small end at the outer door, and it just sits the place to wrench off the lock; the mark between the two folding-doors corresponds with the broad end; I afterwards went to search the prisoner Boreham's lodgings; in consequence of information I received from Mrs. Batt, on Wednesday the 6th of November, I asked her for the property that was brought from Mrs. Batt's apartments; and she said she knew nothing of any property; I said I was sure she did; and I, with the assistance of another officer, searched the place; I told her she must go along with us; then she said there were two boxes brought from Batt's apartments; I cannot rightly say whether she said Sunday night or Saturday night; and that they were fetched away by two porters in smock frocks; she said she had an order to deliver them; I asked her where is the order; then she said she had not got it; but that she delivered them to two men; I asked her who they were; she said she did not know who they were; she described them as large boxes, corded up; I then brought her away with me to the Lord Mayor; I searched her, and upon her found half-a-guinea, in this small bag, separate from the rest of her money; I gave her the half-guinea back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you know where Batt is? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have taken some pains to find him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe he has absconded on this account? - A. I believe he has.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it to be Hall's lodgings? - A. I made every enquiry that I could; I found his wife living there; on searching the room, I observed upon the dresser a velvet jacket, and in searching it, wrapped up in it, was a check shirt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. That is just as common a jacket and as common a shirt as any about own, I believe? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Salmon.) Q. Look at that jacket and shirt; did you see such a jacket and shirt the night your coach was hired? - A. Hall had such a jacket as that on; but I cannot say it is the same; and he had a check shirt on, but I cannot say that that is the same.</p>

            : I live at No. 19, Crown-street, Finsbury-square: I had known the prisoners about two months before they were taken up; on Friday, the 1st of November, the two prisoners, Hall and Chapman, and another man, came to our house in a coach, I believe about five o'clock in the morning; I heard the coach stop; I believe my husband opened the coach door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they bring any thing with them? - A. Yes, a great many bundles; I do not know rightly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150032"></xptr>how many; they were carried up into the workshop, up three pair of stairs; they seemed to be cloth and checks, and I believe there were handkerchiefs.(Mr. Gurney and Mr. Alley contended that the witness was an incompetent witness, and the Court being of the same opinion, her examination did not proceed.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Laycock.) Q.Look at that piece of brown paper? - A.This is part of the paper that one of the pieces of cotton was tied up in that was lost that evening; I know it by the writing upon it; it is the manufacturer's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece of cloth with the ticket sewed to it? - A. This is the head-end of one of the pieces that was taken from our shop that night; here is our private mark upon it, E B, in the handwriting of one of my clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that ticket upon the piece of cloth? - A.This is the ticket that was upon one of the pieces of striped cotton; it has our private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at those cutting found by sansum? - A. I have no doubt but these are pieces of coats that I lost, unmade-up. I was present when Sansum tried the crow upon the door, and the marks corresponded with the crow.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the name of the clerk whose handwriting you say that is? - A. Phillip Prouting.</p>
               <p>PHILIP PROUTING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am clerk to Messrs.

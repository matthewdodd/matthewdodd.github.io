            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at High-street, Shadwell; I bought this watch of a man of colour, about eleven o'clock in the morning; I will not be positive that it was the prisoner; he said he wanted to sell it; I gave him 25s. for it; they are to be bought in the trade now for 28s.; I asked if he lived at Mrs. Gold's, who keeps an establishment for black men; he said, Yes; I sold the seal; I gave 25s. for them both together.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUNT. This is my watch; no other man of colour resided in our house.</p>

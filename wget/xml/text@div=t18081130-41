I heard him say is the landlord at home; I went out of the parlour, I said what do you want; he said, I have a sack of coals, will you buy them, he said they are very good coals, you shall have them for four shillings and six pence; I said bring them up; he said he would. I had an officer in the house, I told the officer there was a man had offered me a sack of coals. In the course of three quarters of an hour Wild returned, the officer remained in the room. Wild brought a sack of coals on his back; I told him I would have nothing to do with them, I did not think he had got them honest; he said never mind, I can soon sell them. Leadbetter the officer insisted upon looking at the coals. He took him in custody.</p>

            . While Leadbetter took Wild in custody, I saw a cart at the bottom of the court, I saw Mr. Brickwood's name on the copse; it was a coal cart and three horses. I found the carman tying up the tail of the cart, his name is Pullen; I asked him if a man had not taken a sack of coals out of the cart; he denied it, made his tail rope as fast as he could, and drove his cart away; I stopped it, he drawed off on the other side of the way in the Poultry; I told him I was an officer, I should take him into custody; I took him into the compter gateway and delivered him to Leadbetter in the Poultry tap. I went down to Austin, he was sitting in the cart, I told him to come out of the cart: he said he would not leave the team; I told him I should take care of the team; he then came out of the cart, I took him up to the compter and delivered him to Leadbetter; I then took the whip and drove the team to Mr. Brickwood's wharf in Upper Thames street. The sacks and bushel measure and ladder were laying at the bottom of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay to see the sacks counted - A. Yes; there was only eighteen. On the next day I shewed the sack that was brought into Mr. Eldridge's by Wild to the foreman, before the lord Mayor.</p>

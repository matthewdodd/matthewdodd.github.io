I am a farrier, and live in Warwick-place, Whitecross-street I saw Burke on Easter Monday, about 8 o'clock in the morning—he is a costermonger, I believe; a sort of itinerant fishmonger—he said he had some pieces of deal, or quartering, or pieces of wood to sell—I told him I thought I knew a man who would buy them, who dealt in old wood, and chairs, and tables—I did not mention the name—I told him he lived in Long's-buildings—I referred to Perkins—he said he would sell them to Perkins—I went with Burke to Perkins—I heard him offer to sell Perkins the deals, and Perkins agreed to purchase them of him—I saw one shilling pass between them, to bind the bargain, and we had some gin together—I had seen Burke at Young's on the Sunday evening, the evening before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live at No. 5, Thomas's-court In that court there is a water closet, which is common to all the inhabitants—there are five small houses—I was in that closet on Easter Monday—I saw some deals in the corner of the court, and Phipps and Perkins were looking at them—Phipps pulled the deals down on his head, while Perkins measured them with a two foot rule—I did not see Burke.</p>

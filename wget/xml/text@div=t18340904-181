            . I am a Thames police-surveyor. On the 5th of July, in consequence of information from Mr. Jackson, I went to the George public-house, Commercial-road, with Fogg, a brother officer, and there apprehended the prisoner Frampton - he asked what he was charged with - we told him with stealing a quantity of books from Baldwin and Craddock's - he asked me if it was for stealing any particular quantity, or whether it was for stealing them generally - I said I did not know, that Mr. Jackson would be at the office and make his charge against him - I took him to the police office - I made him no promise or threat - on our way to the station-house, before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040095"></xptr>I met Mr. Jackson, he said it was trouble had brought him to all this - he was detained until Monday morning, the 7th; I then took him to the police-office - Mr. Jackson was there, and said, "Why, Frampton, I am sorry to see you in this situation; it is a duty you owe to Baldwin and Craddock's, to society, and to the young men in their employ, to disclose the whole transaction" - Frampton said,"I wish to keep nothing secret - I wish to tell the whole truth and keep nothing back" - Mr. Jackson said it would save the officers trouble if he would tell them where the things were - he did not say that i'n a manner of encouragement, or solicitation; he said it straight-forwards, as one man would to another - Frampton said he would tell him where the things were - nothing was said to induce him to think it would be better for him to say any thing.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the prosecutors. I saw Frampton, and said to him that I was sorry to see him in that situation, and the only reparation he could make to his employers, to society, and to the persons in their employ, was a full disclosure - he said, "It is my intention to do it; I have sent to Baldwin's to that effect - but I must tell you I have employed Mr. Hobler to attend for me" - I do not remember making any reply to that - I believe, I said, "Where are the Hogarth's prints you took?"</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not your manner that of encouragement to him to make a disclosure? A. Decidedly not: I had no intention to inspire any hope in his mind that mercy would be extended to him - my only motive was that he should retrieve himself; but not that the law should not take its course.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL CHRISTOPHER EVANS re-examined. Mr. Jackson asked him where Hogarth's prints were, saying it would save the officers trouble if he told them where the things were - upon that Frampton said they were in a case on the wharf - he did not think the case was yet shipped - that it was No. 6 case - after that, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner Whicker, at Stebon-terrace, at the back of the London Hospital, not a great way from the docks - he was in a ready-furnished apartment there - when I took Frampton into custody, there was a young man with him, who he said was his brother - I went to Whicker about two hours and a half or three hours after I apprehended Frampton - I found there the same young man (Frampton's brother) and a young woman, who Frampton said was his wife, they were with Whicker - I told Whicker he had got a box there belonging to Frampton, and asked if he had beard the difficulty Frampton was in - I said, "I suppose you have heard about Frampton" - he said, "Yes" - I opened this deal box there - Fogg put some questions to Whicker - Whicker said he had some books on board the Britomart, and he said he had often given Frampton money to buy books, for he had known Frampton from his childhood - that he knew he was in a bookseller's shop, and thought he could get books cheaper, being in the trade - he said he was going out to Sydney, and meant to take Frampton out as his clerk - I do not recollect his naming any body else who had books there that night - on the 7th of July I went on board the vessel, and Whicker met us there by appointment - while we were on the deck together, Whicker said there were two cases in the hold belonging to him - I said, "But you have another case on the wharf, Mr. Whicker, which is not yet shipped" - the wharf is at the London Docks - he said, "Oh, yes, there is, there is another case on the wharf" - I said I wanted to see the contents of it - he said, "Very well," and went on shore with me: we went to the wharfingers belonging to the Dock Company - Whicker said he wanted to examine a case of books which was on the wharf - he gave every facility to have it examined - the case was marked"G. W. L., 6" - the dock officer sent a cooper with us to open it, under Whicker's direction - the dock officer asked why he wanted it opened - he said, "I am the merchant - I want to examine the property" - it was opened, and I found a quantity of Hogarth's prints, and some maps, as soon as it was opened - on the next day, the 8th of July, I went there again, and brought away the two cases on board the Britomart, and the case on the wharf, and took them to the Thames police-office - the same cases are now in Court - when we went for the cases on board the ship, we went to the searcher's office - Whicker asked if he could have the seals taken off the packages, as he was the merchant, and wanted to examine them - the searcher looked at some document, and said Whicker's name did not appear - that there was the name of Robinson, and they must have Robinson's consent - Whicker said, "I am the owner of the property, Robinson is my agent, why cannot I see them?" - we went to the Custom-house, and at last the searcher allowed him to open them - we got the cases out of the hold - they were given up to Whicker - the searcher said, "As you appear the owner of the property, I shall give them up to you" - I said, "Now, Mr. Whicker, I must seize this property - I insist on having them opened and detained" - I opened them on board the vessel - one of the prosecutor's men was present, and took up several books, and said he could swear to them - I told Whicker I had found him in possession of stolen property, and the onus lay on him to show how he came in possession of them - I said that without having instructions from any body - he said he could not identify any of them, and said, "Take them to the police-station" - he said, while the packages were on deck, "There is mine, and Frampton's, and the Doctor's all packed together, and it is impossible for me to identify any of them" - I asked him how the doctor could identify his - he said, "The doctor had a catalogue of his"- I expressed my surprise at his not being able to identify his - he said, "They came to my house one evening in a cab when I was out - they were all packed in paper parcels, and were not opened."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you told us every thing that passed at the apprehension? A. I think so - Frampton was not present when the cases were searched on the wharf - some books had been taken out, but the packages were not opened in his presence - some books were produced before the magistrate - they were not shown to him in any other way - he was not present at any of the conversation with Whicker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. You alluded to the charge made against Frampton when you first went to Whicker's house? A. I did - from the first moment of my interview with him, he knew the charge against Frampton - I saw Whicker on Saturday night, Monday morning, and Tuesday morning - he was twice at the Thames police-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040096"></xptr>office without any charge being made against him - he kept the Court waiting the third time about half an hour, and then we sent a constable after him - he was committed for trial the third time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He kept the magistrate waiting: was he committed after that? A. Yes; he was committed at that examination - I desired to see the contents of the cases before Whicker said what he did to the searcher - it was in consequence of what I said that he endeavoured to have the cases examined.</p>

            . I was in the service of Baldwin and Craddock for nearly twelve years and a half - Frampton came into their service some time in August, 1833 - in the beginning of last May Frampton told me he was going out for three or four days - that was a few days before he had asked to go - he never returned into their service - in July last an application was made to me by Mr. Baldwin, in consequence of which I made a full disclosure of the transactions I had been engaged in - I afterwards attended at the Thames police-office as a witness on this charge - I was there shown the contents of the three cases, which are on the floor of this Court - I have looked through them all, with Mr. Jackson - I identified some of the works which I had been concerned with Frampton in taking from the house, but the greatest portion of them I could not swear to - I believe they were all of them such works as the prosecutors had in their possession - a portion of them are in sheets; they were taken at different days and times - here are some of Hogarth's prints which we took from the prosecutor's stock in March - nothing was taken at the same time with them - there are about sixty-four prints - there is one in particular, I swear to as having written on it in pencil,"Cook's plate, Heath's repairs" - (this was found in the case on the wharf) - this enables me to recognise it - they were taken from the prosecutors' premises by Frampton - he had no authority to take them - they were stolen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you receive any money in consequence of his taking these prints? A. No; I was present when he took them away in a roll under his arm - I gave them to him - in one of the cases was found a list of sheets of imperfections, and some memorandums in my handwriting on it - and there is the Annual Register from 1758 to 1819- they were in the three cases, some in each - I have a memorandum on them, which enables me to recognise them as the property of the prosecutors - I can identify the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, fifteen volumes, quarto boards - I can recognise them as their property - there are three sets of books in quires which I could not swear to: but which I had agreed he should have, "Paley's Works," "Cook's Roman History," and "Mills's India."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know in whose employ the prisoner Frampton was before he went to the prosecutors's house? A. Yes; Mr. Dowding, the bookseller in Newgate-street, who has a considerable quantity of prints and books - I am not aware that he has a number of Hogarth's prints - he has bought a great many things from our house - Hogarth's prints were kept in a room - the door was locked, and I kept the key - the prisoner went into the room with me on this occasion - I let him in - I went to look over those prints for him to have a selection of them - I let him in to steal them - that was not the first transaction - he wanted a complete set of Hogarth - it was his object to steal them as well as mine - I do not exonerate myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not to exonerate yourself you gave evidence? A. Partly that, and partly to remove it from my mind - I never shall forget it - I wish to do justice to my employers - I was not taken up myself - I recollect going with my wife, on the 4th of July, to

             - Mrs. Hand was present - I knew Frampton was under suspicion when I went to Harris, and that she had been to Paternoster-row - I told Harris that I had lent him Hogarth's prints - I had thought of telling this before he was accused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, in the presence of Mrs. Hand, that you would say you had lent Hogarth's prints to Frampton? A. I think I did say something of the sort, but I thought better of it afterwards - I had helped him to steal them - they acted deceitfully towards me - Elizabeth Harris said,"Oh, I did not know they came from you - I thought they came from a different quarter" - I did not tell Mr. Baldwin that I had lent them to Frampton - I cannot tell why I said I would tell him so - I do not wish to exonerate myself - mine is an waful situation to be placed in - I have turned King's evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not for the pure sake of public justice that you have come here? A. It is both to save myself and for the sake of public justice - I should be sorry to perjure myself - I do not understand the law.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to be saved in proportion as the Jury believe you? A. Yes - I should be extremely sorry to deceive Mr. Baldwin - I never did wrong before, nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. Not since the Hogarth prints were taken? A. No; the things are taken in a different arrangement to what I expected - the Hogarth prints was the last trasation - I have had no correspondence with, or any letter from the prosecutors, since I went to gaol - I sent a letter to them, not with an object to get back to the situation - I do not expect to get back - I wrote to them for forgiveness - it was after I was detained in the House of Correction to give evidence, the prisoners were committed for trial - I have come from the House of Correction this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the writing on the print your own handwriting? A. No; it is the handwriting of Mr. Ebbs, the person who lived in my situation before - I have sold books to the prisoner, and taken money for them, which money I did not account for to my masters - it was not understood so - he gave me money for books which were to be stolen - I received half the usual trade price, and kept the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it half the sale price? A. The sale price is 30 per cent off the selling price, and it was half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040097"></xptr>that price - they went at half the usual sale price - the sale price is 5 per cent. lower than the trade price - the trade have 25 per cent. off the selling price, and the sale price is 5 per cent. below that - I sold them for half the lowest price, which would be 35l. for 100l. worth.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you begin to rob Mr. Baldwin first? A. In January - I never robbed my employer before I began it with the prisoner - I am not aware that Mr. Baldwin had complained of losses of books or prints before the prisoner came into his employ - I do not recollect that - I never did a dishonest act till January - I swear I never stole any article before January - it was Frampton urged me to steal at first - I ought to have gone and told my master, but I did not - after two or three times I fell into the project - I was rather coaxed - I was unwilling at first - I refused at first, and said I would not do it - I did not make the proposal to him - I began to take money from him in January - I took some in part of the first transaction - the "Retrospective Review" was the first he had- I never told my master of this till the prisoner absconded - I was never taken up - I was accused of this, and did not hesitate a moment in telling of it - it was from fear I told of it - Frampton had absconded about six weeks before I told of it - I do not know whether I should have told of it if I had not been accused - I felt miserable under it - I think I should have told if I had not been accused - I do not know how soon - it dwelt on my mind very much - I never knew Frampton was going to Van Dieman's Land.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your motive for telling to save yourself? - should you ever have told but for that object? A. That was my object - I was under the prosecutors's roof in the day time during the six weeks - I never saw any prints of of Hogarth brought by Frampton from Mr. Dowding's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a single syllable about the robbery of the prints till you heard Harris had gone and made a communication, which would implicate yourself? A. No; it was after she had made a disclosure that I gave information.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You have been asked about other robberies, and you say sometimes you received money from Frampton; on those occasions were the books delivered to him in the prosecutors' house? A. Some were, and some not - he was perfectly aware I stole them from the house - he lived at No. 12, Noble-street - this system began in January - one Saturday he was standing at his desk in the binding department, with the catalogue of our works before him, which was open in a place were the Records of Parliament were mentioned - Frampton said to me, "I understand you are going to waste some of these?" - I said "Yes"- he said, "Can't you let me have a set of them?" - I said"No" - he said, "You could if you liked" - and after a little bit, it was agreed he was to have those which were to be wasted, at 10l. - "wasting" them means selling them as waste paper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you always said January was the first transaction? A. Yes; I remember a trade sale at the Albion in October - I have said, that it was immediately after that sale that I began robbing my masters, but I received no money on that transaction - it was a misunderstanding saying January - I gave my evidence to that effect at the Thames police-office - that was merely the time I received the money - I had robbed my master without being paid for it in October - he asked me for a set of books for his private reading - it was sixteen volumes - he was to keep it - it was sold off cheap at the sale - it was a"turn-out," as we call it - I did not steal them for sale till January.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. About how many times did you part with property from your master's house? A. About ten times; it was property that my master intrusted me with- I received some paintings in February from Frampton, valued at 7s. 6d. each - I have delivered those paintings to Mr. Jackson since - he had thirteen volumes of the Records of Parliament, which I delivered all at one time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were Hogarth's prints complete sets, or odd prints? A. Odd plates - there wanted fifty or sixty to complete the set - he had one of each as far as they went - there were sixty-four - the Annual Register was imperfect - they were found in a box - I received a note from him of the imperfection, and it was completed afterwards - I made up the set from 1758 to 1819 - they have an index to that date - it was agreed at 8l. - I was to have received the whole of the 8l., but it was put down with other things, and there was a balance - it was set down in a catalogue at 19l. - that was a lower price than usual.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Excise. On the 12th of May, I attended at Whicker's lodging to pack some books - Whicker was there, and Frampton with him - I saw the books - some on a table, and some on the floor, in the room in which the prisoners were, at No. 7, Stebon-terrace - some of the books were lying open, and some in brown paper - some laid loose on the floor - I attended to pack them to ascertain the weight, that they might receive the drawback when they were exported - the drawback is regulated by the dates of the books - in order to ascertain that, I cut the packages open in their presence - I asked Whicker if he was a bookseller - he said no, he was not" - in order to be entitled to receive the drawback, a person must be in the trade - I asked him whose the books were - he referred me to Frampton - I asked him if he was a bookseller - he said he was in the book line, which answered the same thing - I found a great many second-hand books among them, and said to Frampton, "These books are not entitled to the drawback" - he said, "Throw out any you please"- and I did so - I weighed all the books that were entitled to the drawback - I was there from about ten o'clock in the morning, till about eight o'clock in the evening - it did not take all that time to examine them, but there was a case of stained paper, which I had to cut the ends off - Frampton was not there quite all the time, but he and I packed the books - Whicker had nothing to do with packing the books, but he was backwards and forwards - they were packed down stairs in the yard - Whicker had the opportunity of seeing them - the paper was all taken off in the room in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you mean he was there all the time? A. All the time the books were being examined up stairs, but not below - he was there - I was attending to my business, and do not know what he was doing, but he was in the room, and it was a small room - any body could see what was going on - the books were on the floor, and on the table - I believe the books on the floor were open, and the others were in brown paper parcels,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040098"></xptr>about a half cwt. each - I do not know that Frampton lodged in the house, nor that Dr. Hall lodged there, and was going out in the same ship - I understood Whicker to say, some of them were Dr. Hall's works - he did not say"books."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were known to Frampton, as an officer of the Excise? A. Yes - I told him I had seen him somewhere before - he said, "Perhaps you have seen me somewhere, "I had seen him frequently at Baldwin and Craddock's, where I frequently go - he had not sent for me himself - the note was written by the agent of the vessel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In how many cases were the books packed? A. Two - I sealed them - they were sent to the docks - they went on board ship - I did not pack the one on the wharf.</p>
               <p>ELIZA HARRIS. I lived with the prisoner, Frampton, as his wife, at No. 12, Noble-street: about three months ago I went to the prosecutors' with a few books he had made me a present of, and asked them to purchase them - I saw Mr. Jackson - in consequence of what I told him, I went before a magistrate, and was examined as a witness - I have seen Whicker several times - I saw him twice at our lodging, in Noble-street, about two months or more before Frampton went away - I cannot recollect the time - I did not know what he was there about - Frampton was at home - they talked together, but I did not pay attention to it - that was at both the times I am speaking of - Whicker lived in the Strand at that time - I understood he was going abroad - I have seen parcels at Noble-street, but I did not know they were books - I think I have seen some plates of Hogarth's works there - it is no use my looking at them, because I do not know them - I have seen pictures - I do not know that they were Hogarth's - they were these kind of engravings - I have seen Poole in Noble-street, several times - Poole brought a note to me once, to deliver some paintings to him, which I did.</p>

             - I have no share in the business - my attention has been called to the three cases of books - I took an inventory of the contents, and examined all the books and works - Poole made a list of them, under my direction - they are all books which the prosecutors deal in, and they have more interest in most of the works than other booksellers - they are exclusively the publishers of some - some are in sheets - we sell to the trade in sheets - the Annual Register wants some sheets, and at the bottom of one of the cases I found a list, stating the imperfections of it - that list, has Poole's writing on it - I know Poole's handwriting, and believe it to be on that paper - I cannot say which case it was taken from. (This paper being read, contained an account of several sheets which were necessary to complete the Annual Register.) I have looked at these engravings of Hogarth's works; in the early part of this year the prosecutors had engravings of this kind in their possession - here is a pencil memorandum at the corner of one - it is in the handwriting of Mr. Ebbs, who was formerly in their employ - this was not intended to be sold - these plates were kept at the top of the house - a conversation once took place between Frampton and myself respecting these plates, while he was in their employ, (about April) - he stated to me that there was at the top of the house a quantity of Hogarth's plates, which would sell, and it was a pity they should remain in the state they were in, and I went and saw them, and have since looked in the same place, and they are gone - at the police-office, when he was there, I asked him where the prints were which he had taken - he said, "They are in the case, on the wharf"- I believe none of the plates have been sold since he showed them to me - I produce eight paintings, which I received from Poole, in the presence of Fogg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been in the house of Baldwin and Craddock? A. Nearly twenty years - the stock is very large - I do not know that they missed property before Frampton came into their service - I never heard of such a thing - I never missed any - I believe Poole did not make any statement untill Eliza Harris called at the house - I missed a copy of the Annual Register, because our stock of that is so low - I cannot miss the other things, the stock is so large - I saw Frampton on the 7th of July - I said I was sorry to see him in such a situation - I did not say I thought he had been led into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you knew every thing, and he could hide nothing from you, as you had every evidence against him? A. I think it very likely that I did say it, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before he made any disclosure, that the best thing he could do for himself - the only means he had of saving himself, which indeed he was bound to do, in justice to his employers, and the benefit of mankind, was to disclose every thing? A. Certainly not - I have not a perfect recollection of every word I said, but I can be sure I did not say a certain thing, without recollecting exactly every thing I might say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him at the same time that Poole was in custody? A. There has been some misapprehension on that point - I do not know whether I did or not - my impression is, that Poole was under the same sort of government as if in custody - whether I told him so, I do not know - it is very likely, if he put such a question to me, I might have said so - I do not think I should have said so if he did not ask - there was some conversation about Poole - Mr. Baldwin had allowed Poole to go home, on the express condition that he should return again - he was not in the custody of the law, I considered him in the custody of his employers.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that, when you knew he was not in custody, you did not represent to Frampton that he was in custody, for the purpose of extracting something from him, to learn more on the subject from him? A. I swear I did not - I say I did not, to the best of my know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040099"></xptr>ledge, tell him he was in custody; but if such a conversation came up, I might consider him in the custody of the house, for the crimes he had committed - no officer had been sent for, but I considered him in custody, to be called on when wanted - I might have said they felt a desire to punish all parties concerned - I did not say that the object was more to punish the others concerned, than Frampton, nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever lead him to think your object was to punish Poole, and induce him to think he would be favourably dealt with? A. Certainly not; I said every thing was known - he said, "I intended to make a disclosure, and have sent to Mr. Baldwin to that effect" - I told him it was his duty to make a full disclosure, therefore I cannot say I held out no inducement to him - I said we had evidence against him, for Harris had given full information - I had no object to extort confession - my object was that he should make a full disclosure - I had no indirect object - I told him it was his duty to make a confession, and he said he should do it - I did not state that to extort, but to induce a confession - he was taken to the police-office.</p>

            ? A. I do - on my oath I did not state to Frampton that Henry Lamming was coming forward that morning to make a charge against him - when I found there were others implicated in the business, and knowing Frampton and Lamming were acquainted, I certainly said, "Is Lamming concerned in this robbery?" he said, "No; he is not" - I did not tell him that Lamming was the person who would bring forward a charge against him that morning, nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Frampton ask you the nature of the charge, and you state you were in a delicate situation, and could not tell him? A. I have no recollection of it, nor of any such conversation - I can swear conscientiously I never said it - I have not the most distant recollection of saying that Lamming was the person who would bring a charge against him - I have the most moral certainty that I never said Lamming was about to bring a charge - my feelings were excited at seeing him in such a situation - I cannot state every word that passed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you such a recollection of what passed, as to take on yourself to swear you never said Lamming was coming forward against him? A. I have the most perfect belief I did not - I swear I never said so.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you undertake to swear it never passed? A. I do - I recollect no conversation respecting Lamming than what I have said - I have not the most distant recollection of any conversation regarding him, except asking Frampton if he was concerned in the robbery - Lamming did not come to the office that morning - I had not seen him at that time - I saw him afterwards - I did not ask him if he had any charge to make against the prisoner - I asked him if he knew of any delinquency of the prisoners - that was after opening the cases and seeing Frampton - I saw Lamming at Messrs. Baldwin and Co's. - he is in their service.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, do you mean to swear, without reservation, that you said nothing to the effect that Lamming was coming to bring charges? A. I swear I have not in any way a recollection of any such conversation - I do not recollect a word that passed, in reference to Lamming, but what I have said - I may have forgotten it, but I should say it never occurred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. You asked him if Lamming had any thing to do with it, and he said not? A. I did - I have no recollection of asking him a similar question about Whicker, and receiving a similar answer - I did not recollect the conversation about Lamming till it was brought to mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of Frampton's saying Whicker knew nothing about it? A. I have not - I cannot recollect all I did say - I cannot undertake to swear it, having been mixed up in the matter, and making inquiry - I have no recollection of putting the question - if I am to swear through it, I must say I did not say it, as you will take it in no other way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are asked if it passed, and say you do not recollect it; you are then asked whether you could sufficiently recollect, so as to undertake to say it did not pass? A. Certainly not - I will not say it did not pass - it may have passed.</p>
               <p>Q. MR. BODKIN. Q. Whatever conversation might take place respecting Lamming, was it before or after Frampton told you where the property was to be found? A. I cannot say - Lamming is still in the service.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you aware that Whicker was an acquaintance of Frampton's? A. I had been informed of that by Eliza Harris and I believed at that time they were equally guilty - it was not an unlikely question to ask him if Whicker was implicated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been a considerable time in the prosecutor's employ? A. About nine years - there have been books missing at various times, and to the best of my belief before Frampton came - it was while Poole was in the house, for the came before me.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Baldwin and Co. I have seen the prisoner Frampton write - he has sat near me writing - (looking at the letter) I should think this is not his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been in the house? A. Seven years - I have heard complaints of works in quires missing before Frampton came - I cannot say I have known it.</p>
               <p>Frampton's Defence. I must throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court - I would call the attention of the Jury to the witness, Poole; whether the books have been proved ever to have come from the house, I leave it to them to say.</p>
               <p>Whicker's Defence. I wish to examine witnesses who will prove my innocence of any knowledge of their being stolen - I told the officers I would give them every information - Frampton might have stolen the property: I could not think it possible - I gave every facility to the boxes being examined - they were not shipped to myself - I knew the property belonged to myself, the doctor, and Frampton, but I could not point out Frampton's property - they were brought to my house merely for the convenience of packing, by the Excise-officer - I had a great quantity of paper hangings, entitled to the drawback, and the officer being there for the purpose, Frampton's books were there at the same time - he had agreed with me in March, as a young man who was going over to the place with me as clerk declined going - Frampton heard I had offered to take a young man to Sydney, and said he should very much like to go out with me - I agreed to pay half his passage, and after being in the country three months, he should go where he pleased - he agreed to the proposal - he said he would consult his employers whether he should go or not, for he had formed an improper connexion, and wished to get out of the country - I said, "What is it? tell me" - he said he had formed an improper connexion with a female, and invited me to come to his house and see the person - I went, and saw Harris, whom he called his wife - I came out, and remonstrated with him very much, and told him he acted imprudently, in representing that woman as his wife, and the sooner he left her the better - I advised him to leave the house that day - he said he would leave as soon as possible - I asked if he had any property of his own - he said yes; he had been with Mr. Dowding some years in Newgate-street, and I knew he sometimes purchased books at the trade sales - he said he had bought them very cheap, and asked if I wanted an Encyclopedia at a very cheap rate - I asked to see the work - he brought a few copies, but I was engaged, and made no agreement for them - he referred me to Mr. Paul, at the Mansion-house, who he said had bought some of him - I called on Mr. Paul, who said he had known him many years, and bought books of him, and that the books he did not consider were any bargain - I named it to my wife, that I was about buying an Encyclopedia of Frampton - she wished me to decline it, and buy what she required herself in lieu of it; and I did not buy them - about a fortnight afterwards, Frampton came, and said he had seen his employers, and he could leave; that he had upwards of a quarter's pay coming to him, and he would go out and pay half his passage; and he gave me the money a few days afterwards - Captain Jackson, who is gone out to New South Wales, was to have been a passenger with us - Jackson wished to study mathematics while he was going out - I said Frampton could get him the books he required - I got Frampton's brother to buy some books, and those books were brought to No. 7, Stebon-terrace - with respect to the other books, they were to have been brought to the Strand instead of my house, to be mixed up with Dr. Hall's and my own books; but when the exciseman came, he asked whose books they were - I told him the new ones belonged to Frampton, and the old ones to myself and Dr. Hall - indeed, I was quite ignorant but what all the books were entitled to the drawback; but when I understood it must be new books, I told him some were Dr. Hall's, and some my own, and the new books were in parcels belonging to Frampton - I never interfered with them; they were taken down in the yard, brought back, and packed in the passage; but before they were finished, they put in some books not entitled to the drawback; but I could not swear to my own books, as some my wife had I never saw in my life - on the 5th of July, two officers came, and they have given evidence most unfairly, for they have not stated what I did say to them; for the moment they came, (Frampton's brother had told me, only five minutes before, that he was taken,) I said to them,"This woman has not taken him into custody, surely," as she had been watching about, and I thought she had had a child by Frampton - I had no idea that it was for felony - I asked the officers what the charge was - they said, "For stealing books" - I said, "It is impossible; I have known, Frampton for years, and I do not believe a more honourable man is in existence" - they said it was the fact that he had stolen the books, and confessed every thing, and he would be received as the evidence; "But," they said, "he has quite acquitted you; that you are innocent of any thing" - I said, "I am glad he has spoken the truth, and if there are any books on board the ship, I will go and point out the cases, that you may identify them" - Fogg said he called on Sunday; but I proved that was wrong before the magistrate - he never called on Sunday, though he swore he did - I can prove he was never near the house, though I remained at home all day on purpose - he called between seven and eight o'clock in the morning - I went down to him - he asked what time I would meet him on board the ship - I had told him there were two cases in the ship, and one on the wharf - on Monday, I went on board, and pointed them out; but being shipped in the name of the broker, I had no control over them, and many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040101"></xptr>of them belonged to Dr. Hall - at the second examination, Frampton acquitted me clearly of knowing the books were stolen - I was three days before the magistrate, and allowed to depart - Mr. Ballantine let me go, on my promise to return; and, though I had paid a deal of money for my passage, I would freely give that up, and be a witness even against Frampton, if he was guilty - I appeared four times before I was committed; and the last time, the evidence was very different to what it was before; in fact, both the policeman endeavoured to entrap me in every way, and misrepresent almost every thing - I never anticipated men would be so base and wicked as to entrap a man - I have given them every opportunity a mortal man could do, to let them see the property - I got the Excise seals broken, and ran the risk of losing the drawback, for the ends of justice, to show there was no transaction improper on my part - I think there is not an individual I was connected with, but knew they were Frampton's and Dr. Hall's books - Frampton told every body I had nothing to do with the books, long before he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. HANSARD. The Parliamentary History was published at my house - Frampton bought a complete set of me on the 20th of April - I knew him when he lived at Dowding's - he always bore the very best of characters.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. The Parliamentary History is published by you? A. Yes; I know nothing of the Parliamentary Records, Baldwin and Co., I believe, are agents for that.</p>

            . I am a widow, and am proprietor of the house, No. 7, Stebon-terrace - I know both the prisoners and Dr. Hall - they all three lodged in my house - Frampton had been there about a fortnight or three weeks, Dr. Hall about seven weeks, and Mr. Whicker three or four months - they were going to New South Wales - Mr. Hall brought a quantity of books when he came, and Frampton brought some - Mr. Hall's books were all put into Mr. Whicker's apartments, and he had some books of his own, before Mr. Hall came - Mr. Whicker brought a quantity of books the day he came to my house - I remember Frampton and the officer packing the books - nobody else took any part in the packing - Whicker did not pack at all, nor give any direction about it - Dr. Hall has sailed.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you been in Court during the trial? A. Yes; the Excise-officer, who was examined, is the person I speak of - it took the best part of the day to pack the books - I was in different parts of the house - Whicker was at home, but I do not believe he was at home when the officer first came - I cannot say the day the books that were packed came to my house - there was one cab came with some books which Frampton took out, and took up stairs - I did not see what they were, for they were packed in paper parcels - they were put in the drawing-room which Whicker occupied - Frampton occupied that room with him, he being his clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Were the things which were going out in the ship all put together? A. Yes; Mr. Hall's books and all.</p>

            . I am a friend of Dr. Hall's, who sailed to Van Dieman's Land. I was present at the police-office, but the books were not produced - I saw the books in Store-street on Good Friday - I saw Dr. Hall's books - I could identify part of them, Bell's Anatomy of the Teeth - I have a list in my pocket - there were two or three volumes of Scott's novels, which I made a present of to Dr. Hall; Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, 1 volume; 12 volumes of Gibbon's Rome, and a book on Botany - there were forty volumes in all.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you found those forty books in either of the cases? A. No; I have not seen the cases - I know Dr. Hall had forty volumes, which I have a list of, and they were sent to Mr. Whicker, in the Strand, by a porter - whether they were packed in the cases, I cannot say - there were more which I cannot recollect - they were sent to Whicker to be packed to go to New South Wales.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. Shortly before this investigation, I came to London to take leave of him - I stayed about ten days at his lodging at Stepney - we have relations of the family who have property at New South Wales - I know he was going out to settle there - I knew it for two months before - he has talked about it for twelve months - Frampton told me, in my brother's presence, that the new books and prints belonged to him, pointing to some which lay in the room - I did not look at them to tell what they were - there was a quantity of new books lying there - he said he had agreed with my brother to go out to Sydney as clerk - I said, "Are you going to take out an adventure?" - he said, "Yes, I am going to take out these books, which are worth 80l. or 90l. here, and if I meet with success at Sydney, I may make 150l. or 200l. of them" - he did not say how he had bought them.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long ago is this? A. About three months - it was some time in the latter end of May - I came to town on the 9th of May - I went there next day, and stayed ten days - it must have been between the 10th and 20th of May - I saw a large quantity of books in different parts of the room, some on the floor, and others on the table - Frampton was then living entirely in the house - I believe he came about the same day as I did - I came from Devonshire on purpose to see my brother, and arrange my own affairs with him - I am a farmer - my brother is a gentleman - my father has supported him for these eight years - I know that, because the money comes through my hands - his father is retired, and lives as a gentleman - he was going out to cultivate land.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What was your brother when he lived in the Strand? A. The same as he is now - he was going into the employ of Dr. Gilchrist, his uncle, who was going to establish a newspaper, I believe, and my brother was going to superintend it for Dr. Gilchrist - I suppose he had paper-hangings to furnish his own apartments at Sydney - I saw a great many paper-hangings, and guns, and muskets.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he the money to make the purchases, if he received his support from his father? A. He has, since that, married a woman of some property - I let him have some money myself, and my father did also; - hundreds of pounds within the last eighteen months - he was a maltster, and farmer and brewer, in the country.</p>

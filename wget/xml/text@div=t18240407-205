On Saturday evening, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked if I had a pair of shoes to fit him; I said I thought not. He reached two pairs, and tried one, and then a third pair - another man came in, and said,</p>

               <p>"Don't they fit?" he made no answer; they did not fit, and he asked me to measure him - I did so, and asked what he wanted; he said,</p>
               <p>"I want them like yours Jack," speaking to the other man. I asked what name I was to put on the measure; he said Dickenson, then said,</p>
               <p>"Put down Starkey." He came close up to me; I looked, and saw the other was gone, and the shoes also. I ran out - a woman said he had run up the court, as hard as he could. The prisoner was going, but I detained him. He said he would call on Monday, and pay 5 s. off them.</p>

            . On the 8th of Nov. between 7 and 8 at Night, the Sash of my Shop was lifted up by some body, and three pair of Breeches taken away. On the Monday Morning I sent my Man about the Trade to stop such Goods if they should be offer'd for Sale; and accordingly on the Thursday after, Mr. Cope sent me Word, that he had such Breeches brought to him to be made up; I saw and knew them to be mine. I went again to his House at Night, and found the Prisoner there; it was then too late to take her before a Justice; so the next Morning we went to the White-Bear, in Row street, and she came to us; she denyed the stealing of the Breeches, but said at first, that she bought them over against St. Andrew's Church in Holbourn; and afterwards, that she had them from a Man, who lives in a Court in Drury-Lane.</p>

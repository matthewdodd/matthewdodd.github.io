               <p>On the 5th of April I went to bed about eleven or twelve at night: in the morning I went out into the yard, and found a pane of glass broke out from the bolt of the kitchen window; the persons that did it must have got over a wall eight feet high to get into the court this window looks into; there was a ladder found in the court the next morning.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Sunday morning about the hour of six I met the prisoner; first of all I had met two men before, whom I suspected to be bad people. I asked her what she had got; she said some pewter. I asked who it belonged to; she said she was going to carry it to one they used to call my Lord Woolgree, who lived in Mutton-Lane. I found this pewter upon her; I saw the direction upon the back part of the plate; I detained her and sent to the prosecutor's house; the man came and said the house had been broke open in the night.</p>

               <p>[The plates were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

               <p>[The prisoner in her defence called one witness who gave her a good character.]</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in Devonshire-street, Marylebone. The prisoner was in my employ—on Saturday, the 29th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, I missed a half-sovereign from a drawer in my desk, which stands on a counter in my surgery—I told the prisoner that I was convinced he had taken it, and I would not retain him in my service longer than the end of next week—he said he had not taken it—I was present when he was before the policeman—he was not threatened or promised—his mother was present, and exhorted him to speak the truth—I then asked him again about it—he con<lb></lb>fessed he had taken it on Friday evening.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 116.) I took the prisoner on the 3rd of November—I cautioned him against saying anything—his mother said, "Speak the truth"—when I was taking him down to the station, he said Howe's brother took the half-sovereign from him, and when he went to change it he was taken because it was a bad one, and he never received a farthing of it.

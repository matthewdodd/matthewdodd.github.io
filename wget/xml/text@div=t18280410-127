            . I lodged at the house; the prisoner slept in the same room with me. On the morning of the 1st of March he got up and went down stairs; I followed him, and saw him in the parlour; he came out with the picture under his arm, and went into the street - I followed him, and asked him what he was going to do with it - he said, "For God's sake let me go;" I said, "I cannot think of letting you go" - he said, "Let me go," and went on a little further; I stuck to him, and gave him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did you see me first? A. In the parlour; I was at the bottom of the stairs - the parlour door was open.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up between six and seven o'clock - I went down into the tap-room - the gas was faintly on; I saw this picture on the table - I took it to look at, and while I had it in my hand two persons came to the door and knocked; I went to the door with the picture in my hand - the back door was open; the street door blew to, and I was shut out with the picture in my hand - I would not let the men in who came to the door, because they were tipsy; I called to the witness, but he did not hear me, and I went to leave the picture at a public house; the witness then came to me, and said, "Let us go, and have some gin" - I said, No, I would have a drop of beer; we were going along when he met a constable, and said, "I give charge of this man."</p>

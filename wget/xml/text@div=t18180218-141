On the 14th of February, in the evening, I locked up my ten fowls, in a place by my house; next morning I found it broken open, and ten of them gone.

               <p>RICHARD GEE. I work at the wharf, which is fenced off from the canal, I found the heads of the fowls, and their blood, lying by the door. I traced them by the blood and feathers, into a boat, in the Grand Junction-wharf, which is a 100 yards off, and found feathers, and blood in the cabin-the prisoner Green worked that boat; I found him at a cook-shop; he said, he knew nothing about it, and that he slept at the White Lion, that night; the landlord told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180046"></xptr>him he did not; he then said, he laid in the boat, with Meade, Sumner, and Maile; I afterwards took Meade.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SELLERS. I am a constable. On Sunday the 15th of February, about one o'clock in the afternoon, Coates, and I, went and took Summer, Maile, and Meade, at the Horse and Sacks, public-house; while I was searching them, Meade began to cry, and said, that he, Sumner, and Maile, got into the wharf, between twelve and one o'clock-Sumner broke the lock, and they took the fowls, and cut four of their heads off; they then took them on board Green's boat, and next morning at seven o'clock, he Sumner, and Maile, carried them to Lloyd's; Sumner took them in, and that they staid out; Sumner came out with them, and said she was not up; that they went again in half an hour; Sumner came out, and said he sold them for 10s., and gave him 2s., and Maile and Green, 18d. each; that they then went to the Horse and Sacks, to drink-the other prisoners were present, and did not deny it-they must have heard it. I went and took Lloyd, on Monday at eight o'clock, and told her what Meade said; she said, if she had known, she would have been out of the way - She keeps an old iron shop. I found feathers, and blood, in a tub, in the shop.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Franklin, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, Sumner, Maile and I, went to Harding's premises, and got over the wall-Sumner broke the lock, and took ten live fowls out; we killed them, and took them to Macintosh's boat, where Green was; he was not with us when we stole them. Next morning between seven and eight o'clock, we took them to Lloyd's-Sumner carried them in; he came out, and said she would be up in half an hour; we took them there again, in half an hour; Sumner came out, and said, he had sold them for 10s., and gave me 2s. 6d. - after that we went to the Horse and Sacks; the officers came and took us. I gave Sellers this account-the prisoners were not present at the time.</p>

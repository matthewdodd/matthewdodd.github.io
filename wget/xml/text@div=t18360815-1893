                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Uxbridge. On Fri<lb></lb>day, the 15th of July, at about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was called on, to see the person of John Murnan, at his lodging, at about ten minutes after a scuffle had occurred—I found him perfectly dead—on the Monday following I examined the body—I opened it, and examined every part of it carefully—I found he had an enormously enlarged heart, which subjected him, at any time, from violent excitement, to sudden death—the conclusion I arrived at was, that the man died most certainly from the violence used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he had been in a struggle with another man, and thereby became excited, would that produce what you found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was the result of previous long-standing disease—the heart was between three or four times its natural size—that is a very advanced state of disease, so much so, that I believe, in only one instance, has a heart been seen of larger growth—he would be very liable, in the least state of excitement, to die suddenly—he died suddenly of excitement, coupled with the violence of pressing on his chest—I did not see any external marks of violence on the chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of John Murnan. He died on the 15th of July—I live in Tollit's-court, Uxbridge—my husband used to attend the markets—when he came home that day, I went with him to the prisoner, who stood by the side of the cart—he used to attend the market—my husband offered him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was what he charged—he refused to take 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my husband asked me if I had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid Brown the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he afterwards went on the pavement and asked for his goods out of the cart—Brown gave him the pictures out of the cart, and we took a box out of the back part of the cart, and directly afterwards he came up to my husband on the pavement, and struck him in the face.</p>

               <p>not strike with it—he gave it me back again—a few words occurred again, and Brown repeated that he would not carry any Munster man again in his cart, and deceased made a second attempt to get the stick—his goods were lying on the curb, and his wife was standing by at the time—I begged of them to go home peaceably—I got hold of one of his bundles, and said, "Come, let us go home;" and I said to his wife, "Bring John home"—I turned away about four yards, and when I turned round they were in a scuffle in the street, but I saw no blows struck—that is all I know—I picked up his property, which was scattered about.</p>

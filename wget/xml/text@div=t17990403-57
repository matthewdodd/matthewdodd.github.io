             sworn. - I was in the room waiting for a pint of beer when the girl came in for a glass of gin, he refused to take the sixpence; the boy said, in her hearing, this is the girl that gave you the bad sixpence a day or two ago; she said she never was in the house before; the boy then said there was another woman at the door; I went out and found Jacobs, they denied knowing each other at that time; I told Mr. Barker it would be proper to search them; I found upon M'Laughlin eight or nine pennyworth of halfpence, most of them good; I asked Jacobs if she had got any money about her; and she said, no, she had none; upon searching her, I found this box, containing five sixpences, (producing them); I asked her how she came by them; they were both together at the time; she said, the other had given them to her, and M'Laughlin acknowledge that she did; I received this sixpence from Mr. Barker.</p>
               <p>Barker. This is the same sixpence that M'Laughlin offered to me.(Mr. Parker proved them all to be counterfeit.)</p>
               <p>Wainewright. When I asked Jacobs-pray do you know any thing further about how she came by this bad money; says she, I believe I can; when she gets one off, I give her another.</p>
               <p>M'Laughlin's defence. Whether they were good or bad I did not know, I received them at Spitalfield-market, sixpence from one, and sixpence from another, for carrying loads; and as this young woman lodged in the same house, I gave them to her to take care of for me.</p>
               <p>Jacobs's defence. I had the box of money from this other woman.</p>

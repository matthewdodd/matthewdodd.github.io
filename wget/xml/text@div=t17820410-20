               <p>The prisoner broke my shop window open on the 4th of March, between seven and eight, I saw him, my wife said to me, the windows are cut again; I am constable, I saw the prisoner come with another man and shove a piece of the glass out of the window which had been cut before; I stood at the pitching block, just opposite the window in the street, he ran away, and returned in two or three minutes, and looked to see if any body was in the shop, he then whipped his right hand through the glass and drew out a pair of silk and worsted stockings, I then ran after him, and with my bludgeon knocked him down, then I saw him drop the stockings out of his hand, a gentleman picked them up and gave them me, I then took him into custody, I am sure he is the same man, and I saw him drop the stockings, my eyes were never off him, day-light was gone a great while, my shop is part of my dwelling-house, I keep the house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100033"></xptr>Prisoner. Please to ask him if the window was not broke before he saw me? - One part of it was out, and I saw him actually push out a bit more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from Cheapside and met a young man, we went to have a glass of pepper-mint, I asked what it was o'clock, so then I began to run, and this gentleman knocked me down, a gentleman picked up a pair of stockings, and gave them to the prosecutor, and so he accused me; I expected a witness here that is a gentleman, that was passing by, and will swear the window was broke a quarter of an hour before, but my friends did not find my name in the list to be tried to-day.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find the piece of glass he pushed, in or out? - I found two or three bits.</p>
               <p>We understand the window was broke, some part of it, before the prisoner broke it? - Yes, sir, but it was mended with putty, in the corner.</p>
               <p>You did not see the stockings in his hand? - I saw them.</p>
               <p>You should have had some other evidence besides yourself, there must be somebody in the shop, had you nobody in the shop? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Your sister was in the parlour? - Yes.</p>

Upon the second day of this month, as I was coming from the farther end of the shop towards the door, I saw the prisoner in the shop near the door; I asked him what he did there; he said he came to take it away with him, alluding to a parcel which he had then wrapped up in his apron; he desired that I would let him go; I acquainted Mr.

             that I had taken a boy with a quantity of tea in his apron; he came down stairs, and an officer was sent for and the prisoner was taken into custody; he then said that two men had promised him sixpence if he would take that parcel out of the shop; he described the two men; we went in search of them, and found them at a public-house; when they were taken into custody the boy said they were not the right men; afterwards one of the men leaped out of the window and ran away, but was retaken. The parcel was in a place that was visible to any body going by.</p>
               <p>What is the worth of the tea? - It is a sort of tea of very little value; it is worth twenty-five shillings.</p>

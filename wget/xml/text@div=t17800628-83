I saw the mob come up to the house in a small number; somebody spoke to them and they went a little back from the house; they returned again to the door and broke it open; they entered the house, and in a little time after they threw out the goods; they broke the windows and the furniture was burnt in the street before the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner any where? - Yes, I observed him before the house of Mr. Doughty throw something into the fire, that was as near as I can recollect a quarter before four o'clock. I did not observe him do any thing else.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation respecting him further than what you have mentioned, or hear him say any thing when he was there? - No, I did not; I saw him take a man aside who had a bell in his hand, but what he said to him I cannot tell, I was not near enough to hear.</p>
               <p>How long in the whole was it you had an opportunity of seeing the person of the prisoner? - Above half an hour.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a thick-set coat and a plain hat with a blue ribband.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again after this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280197"></xptr> morning? - I saw him again about the third day after, standing at his master's door (as I imagined it to be) in Great Ormond-street. I said nothing to him but enquired directly whose house it was. I told Mr. Ambler the next day of it; he asked me if I should know any of them again; I said there were two gentlemen's servants I should know. I saw the prisoner two or three days after go across Queen-square, when I was waiting at dinner; I told Mr. Ambler again that was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You did not see the prisoner in the house at all? - No.</p>
               <p>What side of the street was he on? - The same side with Mr. Doughty's.</p>
               <p>What did you see him throw into the fire? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before? - Not to take notice of him.</p>
               <p>Did you see him throw things into the fire but once, or at several times? - I saw him throw some things into the fire twice.</p>
               <p>How far was you from him when he threw any thing into the fire? - The length of this court. I could not discern what it was; as soon as he had thrown it into the fire I made a remark to my fellow-servant, and bid him see if he should know any of them again.</p>
               <p>Were you and your fellow-servant together all the while? - Not all but most of the time Mr. Doughty's things were burning.</p>
               <p>You say you observed to your fellow-servant that you saw that man throw something into the fire, did you make any observation to him of his speaking to the man with the bell? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your fellow-servant see that? - I believe he did see it.</p>
               <p>Did you go away together? - No, I went away and left my fellow-servant there.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Ambler in Devonshire-street. On Wednesday morning, when Mr. Doughty's house was attacked, I saw the prisoner among the mob, before Mr. Doughty's house. My fellow-servant observed him to me. I did not observe him before. After that I saw him throw something into the fire, but what it was I cannot say. Some time after this I saw him take a man by the arm who had a bell; he went on one side, and they talked by themselves.</p>
               <p>You are the man who gave information against the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long after was it before you gave information against him? - I cannot say, last Thursday was the day I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you mentioned it to any body? - No, only to my master's clerk, and my master.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner after this before he was taken? - No, not till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are the person who made the discovery to the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know that in consequence of that information you are entitled to the reward? - I do not know that I am, because my master mentioned it first.</p>
               <p>You was the first who gave an information to the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you are entitled to it, do you mean to claim it? - I do not know, I shall consult my master; if he thinks it right I shall, if not I shall not; I do not care a halfpenny for the reward.</p>
               <p>At what time was you there? - Between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>You have no acquaintance at all with the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>And have never seen him since? - Never till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was it when you suppose he threw that something into the fire? - About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>You did not hear what he said to the person with the bell? - No.</p>
               <p>How far was you from him? - About fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>How long might you be there? - About an hour.</p>
               <p>And all you saw then by the prisoner was throwing something into the fire and speaking to this man with a bell? - Yes.</p>

While we were talking one of the rioters came up, who had a scar in his face and was bloody; he said they would go and pull down that house in Great Ormond-street, meaning the Lord Chancellor's house. The prisoner said they had better not go there, it was dismal enough to see what had been done. The rioters said the Lord Chancellor's house was to come down; and another house; I understood him Mr. Langdale's. I staid there about a quarter of an hour; then I left him there, and came to the corner of Great Ormond-street.

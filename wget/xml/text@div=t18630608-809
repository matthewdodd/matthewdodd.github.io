                  </hi>. I live at 16, Curzon-street, Mayfair—rather more than two months ago I bought a horse at Tattersall's; I afterwards sent it there twice for sale, but bought it in—I then told my coachman, John Wood, that rather than be bothered about it I would sell it at a con<lb></lb>siderable loss, and requested him to find a purchaser—he came to me on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, the Monday upon which it was last bought in, and said he thought he had found a, purchaser at twelve guineas, to which I consented, warning him not to let the horse go without the purchase-money being paid—he brought me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said the man had given as a deposit to prove that it was a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> purchase—the horse and harness together were worth at least 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman to Sir Henry Rich—I made an agreement with William Goodram to sell the hone for twelve guineas—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on 7th May, and I gave him this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Received from Mr. a Goodram, for Sir Henry Rich, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a bay gelding. J. Wood.")—he told me to put "S. Goodram"—both the prisoners came to see the horse three times at Sir Henry's stable, and William took it out twice to try—he was in livery when he came, with several horses; I have seen him on three or four different horse—he took out the horse several times and brought it back—on the 11th he came and asked if hit brother came would I allow him to take the horse away to exercise, and he would bring it back in an hour or an hour and a half—I said, "Yes"—on the Tuesday Shelton came; he said he was sent for the horse to take to his brother to ride for an hour or an hour and a half and to bring him back again to the stable—he said he was going to take it to his brother's stables—believing what he said, I let him have it, and also lent him a bridle and snaffle, two knee-caps, and a martingale—he did not bring it back—I next saw it when it was brought by the police-sergeant last Monday three weeks.</p>

I am a sergeant of the detective-police—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 16th May, from information I received, I tracked the prisoners to Mar<lb></lb>gate to some stables in Addington-street, where I found Sir Henry Rich's horse and the harness with them—I said to William, "You must consider yourself in custody for stealing a hone from Sir Henry Rich, in Curzon-street, Mayfair"—he said, "I paid for the horse, and you will find a receipt for it in my trunk"—I found the receipt for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. produced—they said the saddle, martingale, and bridle were lent by the coachman—on our way up to town William remarked that he drove down in a light horse and trap, with his wife, and led Sir Henry's horse behind, and he had great trouble in getting it down to Margate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner Shelton Goodram, in his defence, stated that he was merely employed by his brother, and acted under his directions. William Goodram stated that he purchased the horse, relying upon a friend to advance him the money: and being disappointed by him, he made several efforts to sell it, and, had he done so, he should have paid the remainder of the money.</hi>

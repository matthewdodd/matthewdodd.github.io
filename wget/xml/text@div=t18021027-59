               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I ask you for any thing? - A. He said he was afraid somebody would take his key from me.</p>
               <p>- TROTT sworn. - I am an officer: On the 28th of September I met the prisoner; he said he wanted to speak to me about a person who had been robbing him of fourteen or fifteen shillings; I asked him the nature of it; he said, he had got to bed to a girl the day before, who had picked his pocket, but he could not swear it; says he, that is not all, I want to have the first pull, for if I don't take her, I am afraid she will take me about halfa-guinea, she says I have robbed her of; I said it was a poor story; when I went to the office I found the prosecutrix waiting to make a complaint, which she did, and described the fathing, that it had a cross and a piece out of the edge; we went in search after him, and found him in Nightingale-lane, and took him to the office, searched him, and found three shillings and sixpence in silver, a quantity of halfpence, and four farthings; I asked the girl if she should know the farthing; she said yes. (Produces the farthing).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gorman.) Look at that farthing? - A. I am not positive to it; I had such a one, but whether it is the same I cannot say; when I took it I said it was remarkable; I had taken it three or four days before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I got four shillings from the girl, on Monday morning to keep for her; she said, keep that for me; I went out, and on my return, laid down in my own bed; she came up intoxicated; when I awoke she was gone; I opened the door, and saw her coming into Sun-yard; she said, I hear you have lost your money Browne; if I have lost it, I said, I suspect you of it; I put my hand in my pocket, and my money was gone; she said she knew nothing of it, only she had lost half-a-guinea; then she got a warrant against me, fearing I should go first. <rs id="t18021027-59-verdict322" type="verdictDescription">

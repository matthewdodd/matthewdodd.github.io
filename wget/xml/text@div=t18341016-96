             asked me to pawn these pictures, and I took them to Mr. Russell - Henry Worseldine was with him - it was at the top of the court, by Mr. Russell's private door - they were behind a board, wrapped up in a white apron - Henry Worseldine came to my mother, and asked her to let my brother Benjamin go on errand - she said, "No" - he then asked if I might go - Henry gave them to me, but both desired me to pawn them - I think the pawnbroker gave me 12s. for them - I do not think the prisoners gave me any thing for pawning them.</p>

No - I am going on for ten years old - I clean knives and forks - my brother has pawned things before - I had been in a pawnbroker's shop before with my mother, but I never pawned any thing myself - I did not count the money - I mentioned a sum to the pawnbroker - I forget what - he asked me whose they were, and I said,"My father's patterns," as the prisoners had told me - I kept the money in my hand - the pawnbroker knew where I lived, as he comes down the court after

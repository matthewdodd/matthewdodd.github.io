               <p>On the 22d of February, I was going to the washerwoman's with my brother's things, I live at Brompton; I was going from Compton-street to the washerwoman's in Wells-street; there was a shirt, a waistcoat, a pair of linen drawers, seven handkerchiefs, and I do not know how many pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150022"></xptr>of stockings, in a bundle, they were tied up in a coloured handkerchief;

               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. No; he got it from me and run away, I ran after him and cried stop thief; there were some people belonging to the Mews heard the alarm and they ran with me; he chucked down the bundle, and then one Starkey, who lives in Wells's-mews, heard the alarm, and seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was this? - A. About eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark then, was not it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and see if you can see the person? - A. That is the person in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes; he never went out of my sight; when he threw down the bundle it came open, and I picked it up; when the man was taken, I took the bundle and left it at the washerwoman's; the prisoner was brought up facing the washerwoman's door, and then the two witnesses charged the watch with him; after I had got to the watch-house, they sent a man with me to the washerwoman's to get the bundle, and I went and serched it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bundle in the same state in which you had left it? - A. No; when I left it, it was open, and the washerwoman had counted the things, for the bill was in it, and she had tied them up again; the prisoner was in the watch-house that night, and the next morning I saw him again.</p>

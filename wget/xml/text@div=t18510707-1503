                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-driver. Last Saturday night, at half-past 12 o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Dunning's-alley, Bishopsgate-street, with Savage—the prisoner and a friend of his came up, and ran against me and Savage—Savage said, "Halloo, governor, take care of my foot"—he had a bad foot with the rheumatic gout—I said, "Why don't you run over people?"—the prisoner turned, and abused roe—he said, "Who are you, you B—y snot," and swore in a strange degree—at last he came up to me in a fighting attitude, and said, "What will you do, you <hi rend="italic">Cockney</hi> b—r?"—his fists were clenched—I struck him, and knocked him against the shutters of Mr. Groves's shop—his friend stepped forward, as if he were going to take it up, and I struck him—the prisoner partly took off his coat—he stood and looked at me for a second, and put it on again—he said, "I will give you something," and walked into the road, as I thought, looking for a policeman—a young man who was standing by said I should not have struck him first—I asked if he knew what provocation I had had—he said he did not—while I was talking, the prisoner came behind me, and gave me a very heavy blow, but with what I cannot tell—it cut my hat, and stunned me—he ran away directly—as soon as I recovered myself I ran after him—I saw him standing against a gas—lamp—I knocked him down—that was two or three minute after he had given me the blow—he got up, and raised his right arm—I thought he was going to strike me, and I put up my left arm, and received I knife through my jacket and into my arm—I went to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder. Last Saturday night I was with Ryan—I had a bad foot—the prisoner and his friend came up and rolled against me—I told them to mind my foot—I think they were both tipsy—Ryan said, "You had better run over people"—the prisoner said to him, "Go to b—y"—high words ensued on both sides, and the prisoner</p>

               <p>asked Ryan what he could do, and put himself in a fighting attitude—he pulled away from his friend, and rushed towards Ryan, as if he were going to strike him—Ryan then struck him, and knocked him against Mr. Groves's shutters—the prisoner then stood and looked at him, and took his coat partly off—I thought he was going to strike him—a young gentleman named West advised him to put his coat on again, and he did, and he either said he would get somebody for him, or do something for him, I do not know which—he went into the road; and West said to Ryan, "I would not have struck him first; that was a shame"—Ryan said, "You seem to know a good deal about it"—while we were standing, explaining the matter, there was a blow given—I did not see it, but I heard it, and saw the prisoner running away—Ryan ran after him to a lamp-post—I hobbled to him with one leg and a stick, and was just in time to see him give the prisoner the blow and knock him down—he got up, and made a thrust at him, but I did not see any knife—he then ran away towards the station.</p>

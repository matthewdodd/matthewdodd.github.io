I am a pastrycook of 1, Nightingale Lane, Limehouse—at 1 am. on 26th November I was in Church Row, Limehouse, and had On me a silver watch value 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and a chain and locket, when I saw Marney and another man—Marney knocked me up against a post and dragged me through the mud—he then ran away—I do not identify Carrol—he was too quick and ran away after taking my watch—I ran after Marney and a policeman caught him just round a corner.</p>

At 1 a.m. on 26th November I was on duty at Colt Street, Limehouse, about 300 yards from Church Lane, when I heard a scuffle and I saw Marney and another man running towards me—I cannot identify Carrol—I ran across the road and stopped Marney and took him to the prosecutor, who said he had been robbed of his watch and chain—Marney said he saw a man running away and ran after him—the prosecutor was covered with mud and in a very exhausted condition—he had had something to drink and was very excited.</p>

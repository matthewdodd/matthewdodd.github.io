On one Saturday in April he shewed me a ring with seven stones in it, which he desired me to clean; he asked me the value of it - I said, as near as I could guess it was worth 7l.; he seemed to agree with me - I took it home and cleaned it, and took it back on the Monday; it was very dirty - he did not say how he came by it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known him? A. Seven or eight years; I do not know a more respectable man - I considered he was in doubt as to whether it was of value, or not; I do not think he is a judge of such things; it was in a very dirty state - I do not think any one, who was not conversant with diamonds, would have known them to be diamonds; they would have passed for paste with many shopkeepers - he has not much to do with such things; he is a clockmaker.</p>
               <p>KITTY HURST. I live with Mr. Hind, in Torrington-square - Mr. Terrade was lodging in the house. I went to clean his room, and saw a ring with seven clear white stones in it, lying on a table; I took it, put it into my bosom, and went away with it - in the afternoon I was sent out on an errand, and at the corner of the square I met a girl called Kitty Barrett; she asked if I had any thing for her - I gave her the ring; she went up Store-street with me - she told me to go to a shop, and ask 4s. for it; I went to a shop, and saw Mr. Stiles - he looked at it a few minutes, and asked what I wanted for it; I said 4s. - he said it was not gold, and he would make it 3s. 6d. for me; I left the ring, and came away with the money - he did not ask my name, nor where I lived, nor how I came by it; I think it was on a Tuesday or a Thursday - I went before the Magistrate as a witness on Easter Monday; I think it might be a week before that, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You stole this ring, did you not? A. Yes - I knew it was not right; upon my solemn oath the man did not ask me where I lived - I did not hear him ask that question; there was a little boy in the shop - I had not dropped the ring in the mud; there was no mud on it, nor streaks of mud - I did not offer it to a cheesemonger, who refused to buy it, nor to this gentleman, Mr. Franks; I never saw him before in my life - Mr. Stiles did not ask me where I lived; I did not tell him that I lived at Mr. Stevenson's, a linendraper, at the corner of Bowyer's-court, in Oxford-street, nor that I lived at any linen-draper's - mistress missed the ring, and asked me to tell her God's truth, and I told her; I never went to sell any thing before in my life - I lived at Mr. Ayers', No. 165, Regent-street; I left them because they were going to let the house as ready furnished lodgings - I did not state at the office that I was turned away from Mr. Ayers for having committed a robbery; that same girl wanted me to take a prayer-book from there, but I would not - that girl is not here, she was let off at Marlborough-street; I never was in any place of confinement till I was brought here - I did not mention before the Magistrate that there were seven stones in the ring; the reason I mentioned seven stones to-day was because there are seven - I counted them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was it clean or dirty when you sold it? A.Clean.</p>

            . I am keeper of Torrington-square. On Sunday morning, the 22d or 23d, I was sent for to Mr. Hind's; there was some conversation about Hurst and a ring - she was turned out for stealing 15s. from the cook; I took her to Mr. Stiles on the Monday morning, about eight o'clock - she said he was the person who bought the ring, and pointed to the boy and said he was present; I asked the prisoner if he knew the girl - he stood for a moment, and said Yes; I then asked if he recollected buying a ring - he said Yes; he went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110125"></xptr>the window and got it; it was exposed for sale - any one might have seen it; it had seven diamonds in it - I asked what he gave for it - he said 3s. 6d., and said to the girl,"Did I not ask where you lived, and you said you lived at Mr. Stevenson's?" she said he did not ask any such question; he said it was all dirt, and she said she found it - that induced him to think she had found it; he said she told him she lived at Mr. Stevenson's, and he had sent to inquire there, but found no such person lived there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.All this took place in a very few minutes? A. Yes, not five minutes - I remember your taking the ring in your hand at the office, and you asked a person, who is not here now, how many stones there were in it, and he said five; the prisoner was there at the time - it did turn out that the ring had seven stones in it; I took the prisoner's word for his appearance he - came voluntarily to the office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mr. de Terrade claim the ring at any time? A. Yes; he lives at that house in Torrington-square - his name is

             de Terrade; he is not here - this is the ring.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the girl came to me the ring was all over mud; I have no knowledge of diamonds, and I thought it was only paste - she said she found it a little higher up; I thought it was not gold; she said she lived at the bottom of Bowyer's-court - I said, "I hope you have not taken it from any where;" she said, "If I did such things as that, how could I keep my places?" I said,"Where do you live?" she said, "At the bottom, at the draper's;" and then I incautiously purchased it; I am always active in stopping any thing I have suspicion of, and bringing people forward - one case particularly which Lord Winford knew of.</p>

            . I live at No. 29, Tottenham-court-road, and am a cheesemonger. On the 16th of April a girl came in and offered me a ring for sale; I thought it was one of those common rings, it was all over dirt like the street dirt - she asked me if it was worth 6d. - I could not exactly recollect her person - it was a little girl; it was a ring of this appearance, and had seven stones in it - I thought it was glass; there was no stamp on it that I could see - I have known Mr. Stiles these three months.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How far had you to go to the linen-draper's? A.Thirty or forty doors I should think; the girl was gone then; there is but one linen-draper at the corner.</p>

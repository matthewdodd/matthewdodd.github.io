I am a wheeler employed in the Royal Arsenal—Ihave been employed there about fifteen years—I was there in the beginning of the present year—the prisoner was employed there at the same time; he came there after me—since the beginning of the year I have missed a spoke<lb></lb>shave; it is somewhere about three months ago, but I cannot say exactly the date—I had last seen it on my bench—the prisoner worked two benches from me—after I missed it I made inquiries—I asked all round the shop—it was not restored to me—I next saw it produced by a policeman in the waiting room at the Arsenal gates; that was about the 24th March—I never lent it to the prisoner; I have a distinct recollection that I did not—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my spokeshave—I had seen it safe two days before I missed it.</p>

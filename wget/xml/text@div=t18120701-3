               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes. She was recommended to us as a <rs id="t18120701-3-deflabel21" type="occupation">nurse</rs>

               <p>Q. I believe you have since lost your wife and child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You carry on the business of a baker. Did your wife assist you in the trade - A. Yes; a good deal. Sometimes she carried the money that she had received up stairs, and put it in a drawer, and the money that I received I put in the till. The day before my wife died I had occasion to go up stairs and open the drawer. I missed some gold.</p>
               <p>Q. By gold, do you mean guineas - A. Yes, and in course my missing the gold, led me to look after the notes. The notes were deposited in a silk bag, and on my putting my hand into the bag I found the notes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen the money and the notes previous to your missing them - A. About five days before she was discharged; and about three days before I discharged her, she said, I think my mistress has lost her hearing. I said, I hope not. She said, if I open the drawers, or speak to her, she cannot hear me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your wife die - A. On the 26th of May. The prisoner was discharged on the 26th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the money about five days before she was discharged - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any notes there with any marks by which you should know them again - A. Yes; perfectly well. There was on one of the one-pound notes, Slaughter and Co.; and on a two-pound note, Retten, August 12, at the back of the note: and on the back of one of the one-pound notes was Bersdell, that is my wife's hand-writing. I lost a new shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010005"></xptr> and a sixpence. There was a hole through both. They were tied together with a blue ribbon, and there were three thimbles in the drawer. I lost two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the officers to the lodgings of the prisoner - A. I sent for a friend. My wife lay dead at the time. The officer went to the prisoner's lodgings, by his direction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a baker, I think you said. Have you been long in business - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a good deal of money your wife had - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you keep the cash you take in the shop - A. Yes; what we want for the usual business; sometimes we carried it up-stairs, in case of an immergency, that we might want it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, leave the money that you took in the shop under your own immediate observation, downstairs - A. No; I carried it up stairs, and put it in the drawer when it was more than was likely to be wanted for the usual concerns of the shop. When I missed the money, I sent for my friend, Mr. Day.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke to a shilling that had a blue ribbon in it - A. Yes; I think it is mine; I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, had you told your friend, before you found your notes, that there were written upon them such a name, and such a name, and your wife's mark - A. When the officer brought the notes to me at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not mentioned to your friend, that there was a name to them, not till you saw them at the Police-office - A. Just so.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square office. I went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Peter-street, Wardour-street, on the 8th of May. I went with Scofield and Mr. Day. We found her at home. On going up stairs Mr. Day asked her, how she could do such a trick as she had done? She said, she knew nothing at all what he was talking about. When we got into the room, he then asked her about some gold, and some bank-notes. He told her, if she had got it, for God's sake to give it up. She said she had got none, neither notes nor gold. I went into the room that she had taken us up to. I told her I had got a search warrant. I said, do not be foolish, give up those guineas. She said, I have got none. I have got no money at all. I then began to search her: in her pocket I found a three shilling piece, a shilling, and a sixpence. I said, you have got some notes as well as guineas. She said, she had got none. I put the question to her several times; she always denied it: we began to search upon some little band-box; in this band-box there were twenty or thirty little parcels, tied up; we opened them; they contained rags. We afterwards came to a large chest, the key we could not find. We tried several keys; they would not fit: after that we found a key, in a little box, that opened the chest. We searched this chest, and in a pocket-book in this chest, that I produce, I found thirty-five pounds, consisting of ones, twos, and one five-pounds, in all thirty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding the notes, what did she say - A. She said they were her's. I said, why did not you tell us this at first, without giving us all this trouble? The other officer searched a bit further, he found some more notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have spoken positively, that she said she had neither money or notes. Did not she accompany the observation, that she had none but her own - A. She said she had no notes at all.</p>

            . I am an officer. When we first went to the house, where the prisoner lived, she was called down stairs; she answered, what was the matter? Mr. Day, he replied, there is nothing the matter particularly; we asked her which room she lived in? She said, up stairs. She went up stairs, into the one pair of stairs back room. We asked her if that was her room? She said, yes. We told her we had a search warrant to search for Mr. Wilcox's property. She said, she had no money at all. We told her, he had lost bank-notes and gold. She said she had neither. We searched her person and found four shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Confine yourself to what you yourself found - A. I searched the tea-caddy. I found that bag, containing four one pound notes. We searched several boxes. We came to a large box, which was locked; the key at last was found. I found in the box this book, containing a one pound note and four guineas. I have had them in my possession ever since. On searching further, I found, in a drawer, a small box, containing two thimbles, a shilling, and a sixpence. This ribbon runs through them both. When we found these things, the prisoner first said, she saved them up; after that she said, she had them given to her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Have not you said, that they were all new notes - A. No. I never saw them opened. I saw the two ten pound notes lay open in the drawer. I gave them to my daughter: she put them in the bag that contained the other notes. She

I think it came from Mr. Slaughter, at the corner of St. Martin's Lane: it is one that I had seen several times with that name on it: on another one pound Bank of England note, is the name of Bersdell: it is my wife's hand-writing. I had seen that note once or twice previous to my loss; and here is a two pound note, with the name of Retten, August 12, on it: I had seen it once, previous to my loss.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. to prosecutor. Whereabout is the value of all the property you lost - A. Upwards of forty pounds.</p>

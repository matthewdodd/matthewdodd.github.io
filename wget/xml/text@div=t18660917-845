                  </hi>. I am a baker at 6, Hanover Court, Hart Street, Covent Garden—soon after one on the morning of Sunday last I was in Fleet Street—the prisoner came up and spoke to me, and asked me to go home with her—I said, no, I would not, and told her I was a married man—she caught hold of my arm and walked along with me, and as we came to the corner of a court she put her hand in my left-hand trousers pocket, where my purse was—she pulled it out—I caught hold of her hand, and she dropped the purse and money down—I picked up a sovereign, two half-crowns, and the purse—a constable in private clothes came up and held her tight—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my purse—the policeman picked up a shilling—I lost 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (City Policeman 436). About twenty minutes past one on this morning I was on duty in Fleet Street in plain clothes—the prisoner and prosecutor passed me—my attention was drawn to her by the way she had hold of him—her right arm was round his left, and her left hand was feeling about, as I understood, to see where he kept his money—just as they came to the corner of Johnson's Court I heard money fall—</p>

               <p>I ran up and took hold of the prisoner by her left hand—I said to the by-standers, her companions, "Stand on one side; give the man an opportunity of picking up his money"—at that time I saw a policeman in uniform, and called to him to turn his light on, and the prosecutor picked up his purse and part of the money—he gave the prisoner into custody—she said she did not take it out—she only asked him for sixpence.</p>

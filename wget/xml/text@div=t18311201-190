            . I keep a marine-store shop in the New-road. My husband went for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge, on the 20th of October; the prisoner has brought three, four, five, or six pots in a day to our house, to sell; but on the 20th he only brought two - the pots we gave to the Policeman are what he brought; I have known him about five months - I used to give him 1s. for quart pots, and 8d. for pints.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How long have you been in that shop? A. About three years; I never bought any pots but of you; I bought four measures, but no pots - I did not sell any pots to a person who opened a new beer-shop.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CARR. I am a Police-officer. I was at the station when the prisoner was brought in - I found one quart pot in his pocket, and seven duplicates.</p>
               <p>A. W. STEWART. This pot found in his pocket, and these other ten are my mother's; I have seen him at our house repeatedly, but had no suspicion - he used to sit and read the newspaper, but it was rave that he had half a pint of porter.</p>

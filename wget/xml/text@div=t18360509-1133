                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 7, Charlotte-street, Tooley-street, Borough, in the parish of St. Olave. I am the house-keeper—I let out the top garret, and middle room, and occupy the lower part myself—I and my wife went out on Saturday evening, the 9th of April, between eight and nine o'clock—it was then dark—I believe the people who occupy the upper part of the house were at home—I left nobody in our apartment—my wife locked the door as she came out and took the key with her—when I came out of the house I observed Rearden and Fry near the house—Fry was within six or seven yards of the house—he is my wife's brother—I had employed him to work for me for five or six months, and he then lodged in my house—I discharged him about three months age—he knew my house very well—I am quite certain I saw him near my house that night when I went out, and I saw Rearden with him, and a third per<lb></lb>son, but I am not certain who that was—Rearden was about thirty-six feet from Fry—he was two arches off the Greenwich rail-road from him—the third person was further away—Rearden stood westward of Fry, and the other man was still more westward—he was double the distance—I returned home about ten o'clock with my wife—I found the padlock of the door had the staple drawn, the lock and staple were taken away, and the door left half open—I missed a box containing a suit of clothes, a blue cloth coat, a pair of new cloth trowsers, a waistcoat, a cloth cloak belonging to my wife, two merino gowns belonging to my wife, a silk shawl, two silk</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman, of 5, Star Court, Little Compton Street—on Sunday morning, 3rd January, about 1 o'clock, I was with two friends, going home along Compton Street—I think I was in advance of my friends, but I can't be certain—I was knocked down by somebody, and lost my watch—I had seen it a few minutes before—it was a man who knocked me down—I can't identify either of the prisoners—while I was on the ground I was kicked about my head; I become insensible for a few minutes—I got up, and found my watch gone—I was deaf in the left ear for nearly a fort night, from the injuries; I am not deaf now—I was the worse for liquor.</p>

I live at No. 35, Church Street—I was with the prosecu<lb></lb>tor on this evening, in Compton Street, a few minutes to 1—I know that he had a watch with him, for he looked to see the time in Compton Street—we were all walking side by side—I saw the prisoner Gale, and I believe Redman; but I am not so positive of him—they stood at the corner of the Street till we came up, they then whistled up a passage, and Sliney I believe then came—I saw four of them on the top of the prosecutor—when I went to his assistance they were knocking him about—I saw Sliney strike him—I ran to his assistance, and picked him up—he said he had lost his watch—I saw Sliney on Sunday afternoon, and identified him as one of the men.</p>

                  </hi> I am a broker, at ward's-row, Bethnal-green—the prisoner was in my service about seven weeks. On the evening of 15th Feb. I told her if she did not mind how she behaved I should discharge her, and if she was in any way impudent I should give in charge, and prove a robbery against her—she said I could not do that, and said, "Pay me my wages"—I left home about an hour after, at twenty minutes to nine o'clock, came back about twenty minutes to twelve, and she was gone without her wages—I went to my drawers next morning and missed two shawls, and 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and gold, which I had put into a box under my bed about eight the night before—there was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—three half-sovereigns were left—I missed a pearl ring and six sliver spoons from the same box—I left it locked, but found the lock wrenched out—I searched, and missed other things—I saw the shawls safe on the morning of the robbery—I informed the police, and described the prisoner—she was brought from Bath in Custody—I used to give her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—we were on friendly terms—we slept together all the time—these shawls are mine—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

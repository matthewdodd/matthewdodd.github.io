I did not know it"—I asked him where he got it—he said in Cheapside, opposite Bow Church, in change for a sovereign—he asked me to let him look at it—I said, "No"—I came round on the other side of the counter, and he said, "If you let me look at it, I will give it you back"—I had shot the door, and on his promise to return the half crown, I gave it him—he put it into his pocket, and offered me a sixpence in payment—I was going to take the sixpence, and be took it up, and put it into his pocket—just afterward! I opened the door to let a gentleman in, and the prisoner ran out, and broke the corner pane of glass as he passed—he was given in charge—I never <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the sixpence—I was present when he was searched—there was no half crown found on him—on his paying for the window he was let go—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I am sure the half crown was bad.</p>

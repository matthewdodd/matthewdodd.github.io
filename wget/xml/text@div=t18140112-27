Mr. Jones that keeps a public-house sent for me; he shewed me a basket in the bar, he asked me if I knew any thing of that basket; I said no, I do not know the basket. He asked me again, and then he said I am sure you will know something of the basket if you look in it; on my feeling about the basket I felt there were shoes inside of the basket. I asked Mr. Jones how the basket came there; he told me my servant had brought the basket into his house as soon as he was up; that was

I made up my mind that I would obtain a constable and get him to be at the public-house at the time the girl said she would call for the basket; I got Mr. Shephard, the constable to go to the public-house.

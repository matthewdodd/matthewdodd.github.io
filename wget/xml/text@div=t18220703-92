On the 27th of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and bought some net, which came to 4 s.; she then asked to see some muslin, which I shewed her. A lady came in at the time, which took off my attention, as I was the only person in the shop. I observed her putting her hand into her pocket in a flurry. I shewed her the muslin, and called down one of the men to fetch Mr. Veall from the other shop. The prisoner said she could not wait, and would call again about the muslin; she paid for the net, which I gave her in a paper, and as she went out I called her. She said she could not stop - I went and brought her back, and told her I suspected she had some net which did not belong to her (there was a box on the counter with remnants in it) - she said she was certain she had not, and would take her oath of it; she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out two handkerchiefs, and in the middle of one I just saw the end of the lace - it was on a small roller on the counter - she then said she had taken it up by mistake.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have offices at 1, Cloister, Temple—I first became acquainted with the prisoner about the beginning of December, or latter end of November—he was brought to me by a Mr. Arundel, with reference to a bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I was applied to to have cashed—the prisoner said that he had the means of procuring the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, that he had bespoken 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of discounting that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he said that in the presence of Arundel; they both said it in fact—that transaction went off, the money was not required—about 19th December, I was desirous of discounting a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a client—the prisoner came to my office about that time to know whether I could give him the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill which had not then been disposed of—I told him the money was not required for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and I asked whether he could apply the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of discounting the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he said he could, that it made no difference whether I gave the bill to him or Mr. Arundel; it was one and the same thing—he was Mr. Arundel's agent in the matter—I gave him the bill, and took this memorandum from him—<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "23d December, 1863, I have this day received a bill of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. accepted by Mr. T.

"On receiving that memorandum I gave him the bill—he called on me frequently respecting the bill within a few days from the time, and showed me the bill nearly every time he came—the last time he called upon me was on the Friday, I think, immediately after Christmas-day—he then told me that application had been made to the drawer to know if the handwriting of himself and the acceptor was correct, and the money would he handed over to me between 3 and 4 on the following day—he did not call on me on the following day—I never saw him afterwards till he was in custody—I did not get any of the money—I called on the following day, Sunday, at the place where he represented himself to live, 17, Munster-street, Regent's-park—I did not find him there—I next saw him when he was</p>

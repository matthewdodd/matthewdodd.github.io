                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. George Joseph Ford, a boot and shoe maker, on Snow-hill. On 4th Jan. the prisoner and another man came to the shop about 7 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner asked me to get him a pair of shoes out of the window, and while I was taking them there was one pair taken off the counter—the prisoner did not buy any—he and the other man went away without buying anything—I did not miss these shoes off the counter till about 11 o'clock the next day—I knew I had put them on the counter the evening before—I have seen them since, at the pawnbroker's—these are them—they are the same I had put on the counter—they are my master's property—I know them by our journey-man's work on them—I had paid him for mending them—you will not find one pair in a hundred made as these are, with cloth all round—they have been sold—they are English make—I am confident they are my master's—I saw them on the Wednesday evening, I should think a couple of hours before the prisoner came in.</p>

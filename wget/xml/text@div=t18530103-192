                  </hi>. I am managing wharfinger to Messrs. Wilkinson, of Botolph Wharf, close to London-bridge. On 22nd Dec, about half-past 2 o'clock, in consequence of information I received from the watchman, I inquired of a man whether he had seen a man pass with a case on his head—I requested him to follow me into the street, and we traced a case containing sixty drums of figs, which had been lost, into a shop on Fish-street-hill, about 800 or 900 yards from the wharf—the prisoner was in the shop, in the act of placing the stolen case on a man's head—I knew the case, but not the man—I went up to them, and requested them not to trouble themselves to reload the case till the arrival of the police—Neill, the prisoner, said he had nothing to do with the matter; he was passing through the premises, and bad given the man who had carried it, a lift, placed it on his head—the other man stated, in Neill's presence, that Neill had employed him to carry it—the case was the property of Messrs. Wilkinsons—I had seen it before it was lost, standing with others in the lower part of the gateway of the wharf, within the premises—I know the prisoner—he is a supernumerary fellowship porter—he has worked in the neighbourhood, and carried cases of a similar description for parties in the neighbourhood for years—he was never employed by us, but has been in the constant habit of presenting orders to us from wholesale grocers in the neighbourhood—they employ him and send him to us—when he used to come in that way he brought a delivery note—had I met him with the case, I should not have suspected he had stolen it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would goods be delivered to any person who brought a delivery order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They must produce an order which is examined by clerks to see if the duty is paid, as the goods are under Crown bond—the order would be marked by the clerk, and then handed to the delivery foreman for the purpose of being properly entered in a book before the goods were taken away, and after the order is signed the goods would be allowed to go away—there is one person who signs orders if he is present, but if he is away some one else signs for him.</p>

                  </hi>. On this Saturday I was at work at Botolph-wharf. About half past 12 o'clock I saw the prisoner on the wharf—he went on to the quay, and came again on to the wharf, and brought two men with him—Nicholls was one of them—Nicholls had a knot on his shoulder, and the others lifted a case from under the gateway on to his head—Nicholls went off with the case on his head—the prisoner followed, and I cannot say whether he said, "Clark Austed" or "Ansted."</p>

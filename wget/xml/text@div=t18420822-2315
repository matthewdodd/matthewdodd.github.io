                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Palmer, and keep the Sugar Loaf, in Mile-end New Town—on the afternoon of the 25th of July I was in the parlour, by the side of the bar—there was a chain to the key of the till—I heard the chain make a noise—I got up, and saw the prisoner go from the direction of the till towards the door—I went after him, and caught hold of him three or four yards from the house—he asked me what I held him for—I said he had robbed my till—he said he had not, and got from me—I asked Topping to hold him—he made a catch at the pri<lb></lb>soner, but he ran away, and Topping ran after him—I went back to my till, and missed a little tin dish, and the silver which had been in it, about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had seen it safe about half-an-hour before—I cannot say whether the till was locked—the key was in it—the officer brought the prisoner back—one of the witnesses brought the dish—the prisoner said he never was in the house—this is my dish.</p>

I was passing, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I saw Mrs. Palmer outside the house, and the prisoner making his escape from her—she said, "Take hold of this boy"—I tried to do so, but he ran off—I pursued, and called out "Stop thief"—the prisoner dropped two sixpences—I pursued him and another, who made his escape—on my return, a little girl gave me a tin dish.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Locke—I was at my window, which is opposite Mrs. Palmer's—I saw the prisoner and two others, on the trap door by the side of Mrs. Palmer's—the prisoner then went in, he came out in two minutes, and said something to one who was on the trap door—the prisoner went into Mrs. Palmer's again with another—they came out nearly together, but the prisoner was more behind than the other—I saw the prisoner pad some money to the other—Mrs. Palmer carne out and took him—she could not hold him—Topping came up and pursued him.</p>

On the 22d of July, the prisoners came to our shop between one and two in the afternoon; I was shewing some stockings to two gentlemen: the man prisoner came in with a basket; and the woman came and stood between the two gentlemen, which prevented me seeing the man; he went towards the corner of the counter: I called Mrs. Burgher; the woman said she was in no hurry; she wanted to look at a pair of stockings that were in the window.</p>

               <p>I live with Lovell and Curtis, wholesale hosiers, in Wood-street. On Thursday, the 22d of July, about two, I was passing the house of the prosecutor; accidentally, on turning round my eyes, I observed a hand rush into the window, in the inside, where there were some stockings; and that hand

             some stockings from the window, which I have in this basket; that person was the prisoner Brown; I am sure of it; I waited to see if he made a second attempt, but he did not; I then went into the house, and he had this basket in his hand; I have kept it ever since; these are the stockings I took from him; I asked him what he had in the basket? he made no answer, but seemed quite astonished. With respect to the woman prisoner, she was standing between two gentlemen, who were serving by the last witness, quite to her obstruction: and the man was secreted behind her: it was morally impossible for her to see the man. Mr. Burgher went to Bow-street for an officer: he searched Brown, and found nothing in his pocket but a nail: he then searched the prisoner

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner Smith's Counsel. The woman was standing near the counter, as close as she could, by the two gentlemen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are those two gentlemen here? - No.</p>
               <p>You had no difficulty in seeing the stockings taken? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>They were not taken slily? - It was entirely slily to the person that was serving.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150060"></xptr>It seemed to be the impulse of the moment? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the woman prisoner speaking to the woman of the shop, when you came in? - I did.</p>
               <p>You say the prisoner Brown was secreted behind the woman? - Yes: where he stood was close against the window: the two gentlemen were nearly close to the window, not so close as he was: the woman was standing in a direct line with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any conversation between the woman and the man, the two prisoners? - None.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner secreted behind the woman? - I only mean to say that the woman stood before the man.</p>
               <p>Did the woman stand otherwise than any other two persons would have done? - I do not directly say to secret him, only in imagination.</p>
               <p>(The stockings deposed to by Mrs. Bridges, being marked A. in the foot.)</p>
               <p>They are the property of Mr. Burgher; I saw them in the window not five minutes before the prisoners came in: the value of them under valued at eight shillings a pair, is thirty-nine shillings and six-pence.</p>

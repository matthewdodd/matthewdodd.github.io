The prisoner and another girl laid hold of me, and asked me to give them some gin. The prisoner said, I live in the court, just here. I went out of curiosity as far as the door. A girl came out with a candle. I gave one of the girls twopence-halfpenny, to fetch some gin. The prisoner began to feel about my pocket. I thought of my watch, took it out, and held it in my hand a little time; and then, to secure it, I put it loose in my coat pocket. She saw that, put her hand in, and took it out. She blew out the candle, whipped round the door, and pulled it to, and shut me in. I put up the sash, and got out, and took the girl that went for the gin. I called the Watch. When the watchmen came, they brought the prisoner from another house, and asked me if that was the girl. I said I did not know then; I was in a flurry with losing my watch. On Monday morning I went into the court. The prisoner looked out of the window, and I knew she was the girl. We took her to Justice Girdler's: there she owned she took it out of my pocket, and had sold it to a Mrs. Mealing, in Turnmill-street, for 8 s. I have never seen it since.</p>

               <p>JAMES ROUGH sworn. - I met Godfrey and Bentley in the street, opposite Somerset-house, on the 29th of September, between twelve and one o'clock at night; I went home to their apartments on the 30th of September, and between two and three o'clock I got up, and missed the 22 l. Banknotes.</p>
               <p>Q. How late had you seen these notes before you went into the room with these women? - A. I saw them when I went into their apartments; I took them in my hand, and put them in a cloth; they were loose in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look them over in their room, so as to know you had 22 l.? - A. I did privately.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither of the women saw you do it? - A. They were in the room, they might see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose you went to bed with some of these women? - A. I went to bed with Godfrey and Bentley.</p>
               <p>Q. With both? - A. Yes; about two o'clock I went to bed, and about three o'clock they absconded, and I found I was robbed; I got up, and searched my breeches; I called for a light of the landlord, and for the watch; the landlord did not give me a light then; I found the women were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your money since? - A. Yes; there has been one 5 l. note traced back with these women's name on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the other woman, Ann Madkie? - A. That woman was not in the room at all, I did not see her in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. My Lord asked you how you came to know that you had that property - you say you looked at them privately, and counted them over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18051030-27-person385">Q. </persName>
            Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was not drunk, nor I was not what they call real sober; I was sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been before you met these women? - A. I had been drinking with two or three people, after I came home, a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you felt in your pocket, and afterwards you took them out and looked at them, and the women were in the room? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you looking at them? - A. A very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one, two, or three notes? - A. There were five altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took them out, what occasion had you to count them over? - A. I was with those people, I did not intend to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to be robbed when you went into the house? - A. Yes, I thought I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you went into the house, and went to sleep there also - there were two women in company, did you give them any money? - A. I gave them three shillings and a dollar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give a Bank-note to either of them? - A. I did not; I told them I would give each of them a seven-shilling piece in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get these notes? - A. I got them five days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that person here who gave them to you? - A. He is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know any thing of the 5 l. note you have mentioned - had you at the time you went into the house a Norwich Bank-note so numbered, that you should know it again? - A. I knew it by the number, and by looking at it in my hand it was dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the number? - A. I went to the Bank about the number.</p>
               <p>Q. That was afterwards? - A. Before that I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then any paper, with the numbers upon it, with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the Bank and changed a 30 l. note, did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day, did you change a 30 l. note at the Bank? - A. I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some time before changed a 30 l. note at the Bank, and you had received others in change? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you took account of the numbers when you exchanged the 30 l. note at the Bank? - A. No, not till I went and stopped the numbers of them at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not know any thing of the numbers? - A. No, not till after I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you went into this house, you only knew you had 22 l. in Bank notes, and two 5 l. notes were among them, you are endeavouring to make a case, not considering how it will bear, I with you would answer the truth, you have no reason arising from your own knowledge, or from your own recollection of knowing that note? - A. I did not know the note till I had the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Which number you did not know till afterwards? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You have only a minute from somebody else? - A. I have a minute from the party that gave him change.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here? - A. They are not here.</p>

               <p>Q. You know nothing of that 5 l. note being in the possession of that man? - A. No, I only know by information.</p>
               <p>Court. That the man was guilty of gross folly, there is no doubt, and in all probability he had been robbed of these notes, but as he cannot prove that he ever had this individual 5 l. note about him; if the clerks that changed the 30 l. note for him had been here, they would have been able to say this individual 5 l. note was given in exchange, and then it having been paid by these women the next day to the pawnbroker would have made it compleat, therefore, for want of identifying this note, the women must be acquitted.</p>

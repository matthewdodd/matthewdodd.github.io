                  </hi> (Policeman 45 H). On Saturday night, October 6, I was on duty on Tower Hill, and about half-past eleven was called to the "Little Tower" beershop, Tower Hill—the disturbance was then over, and there were some soldiers in the beershop—they did not come out till twelve o'clock—the prisoners were there, and another soldier, who has been in custody and has been discharged, also other people not soldiers—when they came out Ashbrook took off his belt and wanted to take off his tunic to fight—he said, "I will fight any b—man in the street"—Burke came to my assistance at twelve o'clock, and he was the first that was assaulted—he went up and said, "You had better go away; do not make a disturb<lb></lb>ance in the street"—Ashbrook said he would not go away for any b—sod of a policeman like him, and said, "I will put you away off the street before I go"—Burke told him to go away again; he said that he would not—Burke took out his rattle and sprang it for assistance, and as soon as he did so Ashbrook came up and said, "Will you fight me? Put up your arms and fight if you are a man"—he struck Burke on the breast, and then on the mouth with his fist—Burke took him in custody—Pitfield then made a rush to seize Burke, but I caught hold of him to prevent his doing it, and as soon as I did that Pitfield drew back and struck me a blow across the head with Ashbrook's belt, which knocked my helmet off, which was taken away and has not been brought back—it stunned me, and the blood flowed—I was rendered insensible for a few minutes—I received several</p>

               <p>other blows with a belt—I cannot say from whom—the other soldiers used their belts also—we were obliged to leave them and went to a surgeon—we afterwards went back and took Pitfield, got assistance a quarter of an hour afterwards, and took Ashbrook to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday night, 6th October, about twelve o'clock, I went to this beershop just at twelve o'clock to the assistance of the other constable—the prisoners were there and several other soldiers, they were just coming into the street—there were several soldiers outside, and lots of prostitutes and civilians—they were all drunk and disorderly, and inclined to kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I advised the soldiers to go away, two of them did so, and the others refused—Ashbrook called to his comrades, and said, "Come on, and we will remove the b—sods off the street"—he took off his belt and Pitfield held it—Ashbrook thought he would take off his tunic too, but his comrades held him and would not let him—he came up to me and shoved me several times—I took out my rattle and sprang it, and Ash<lb></lb>brook struck me several times with his clenched fist, and another soldier not in custody took my rattle out of my hand—several others behind me struck me with their belts—I cannot say who they were—I took hold of Ashbrook at the time, and as soon as I got liberated I went to take him in custody—I could not see what Pitfield did, but we took him ten minutes afterwards—he was with some girl on the very spot where this matter occurred—Ashbrook was taken by another constable and brought to the station—he was drunk—I saw Fox's head bleeding—Pitfield was very drunk—while they were there Leech made a complaint to me.</p>

I am a watchmaker, living near Tower Hill—on 6th October, at twelve o'clock at night, I was returning home, and saw a number of soldiers, prostitutes, and civilians congregated round the "Tower" public-house—I spoke to Fox and Burke, but do not know whether the prisoners heard what I said—the policeman asked the soldiers, at my request, to move on, as there could not be a disturbance there—Ashbrook said, "Move on? We will not move on for such b—sods as you," and began pushing about in all directions—Pitfield had a belt,</p>

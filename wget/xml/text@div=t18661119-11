                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Scott, who keeps the Old Red Cross public-house, in Upper East Smithfield—on 22nd October the prisoner took a room at our house, she said she should want it for three weeks, or perhaps a month, she only remained one night—I examined the room when she had gone, and missed two blankets off the bed, and two pair of slippers, a box was broken open and several articles taken from it, but I cannot say what; the box had been left by a gentleman for a bad debt, and I did not know what it contained—this is one of the pair of slippers; the other pair has not been found, nor the blankets—I did not see the prisoner leave—she represented herself as the wife of the chief mate of a Belgian vessel, and ordered dinner for herself and husband on the Tuesday, but we did not see her again till she was in custody on the Wednesday night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). In consequence of information I went to No. 119, Minories, and there found the prisoner—I told her she would be charged with stealing two blankets, the property of Mr. Scott, of the Old Red Cross public-house, Upper East Smithfield—she made no answer—as I was standing in the room I saw her take something from the foot of the bed and place it underneath the carpet, and I pulled out these slippers—I said, "Where did you get these from?" she made no answer—Mrs. Scott, who was in the room at the time, said, "These are my slippers"—I then said to the prisoner, "You will be further charged with stealing the slippers"—she made no remark.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. As I found the room, so I left it. The slippers I picked up and put in my bag by mistake in my hurry; the blankets I know nothing of. The landlady's niece saw me leave, and went downstairs with me, and she could clear me if she was here. I could not put the blankets in my little bag. I should have gone back again, but the house was so noisy</p>

               <p>I thought it was not a fit place for me; there were many lodgers in the house. I left some dirty linen of my own in the room.</p>

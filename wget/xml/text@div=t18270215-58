I was up last on the 15th of January - every thing was safe; I got up about eight o'clock the next morning, and found the sky-light, over the shop broken, so that a boy could get through, and let himself down - they must have entered that way, as the doors were still fast. I do not know how they could get out that way; the sky-light is above my reach. The prisoners live in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Cowley, near Hillingdon. On Tuesday morning, the 16th of January I walked into Mr. Osborn's yard, which is about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutrix's; the prisoners were there, toasting sausages, and eating them; they asked me to have some, which I did; I asked where they got them - they said they bought them for supper, but had been to the play, and were locked out, and came there to cook them.</p>

            . I am headborough of Uxbridge. I heard of this robbery between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and having been informed that these boys had been up all night, I went and took Hiller - I asked what he had done with the sausages - he said, voluntarily, that he Taylor, and Green had eaten them; I asked where he got them - he said from Mrs. Bignell's - that he and Green had got through a sky-light, took some sauges, a half-penny worth of oranges and sweet-meats, and Taylor stood in the market-place while they got them; I heard them examined before the Magistrate - no threat or promise was held out to them; the signature to this paper (looking at it) is Mr. Clarke's writing.

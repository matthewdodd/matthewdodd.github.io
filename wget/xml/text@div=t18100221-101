On the 13th of February I told him to take his things down stairs, because I wanted the shop myself; at different times, since he has been there, I have lost seven one pound notes. I had my one pound note safe in my pocket at eight o'clock in the morning; I marked the note, I put it in my pocket book, and the pocket book in my coat pocket; the prisoner was present in the shop; I told him I would wash myself; my business called me out; I threw my coat on a table in the shop, with intention to wash myself, I was called down stairs. The prisoner was going up and down with his tools. A man that was at work with me, I told him to come down stairs with me, or else, if I had lost it, I could not tell who took it. I was engaged with a customer down stairs about five minutes, and upon seeing the prisoner come down stairs, I hurried up stairs to see if all was safe in my coat; my coat, I thought, was not in the posture that I left it, and in looking in the pocket book I found the one pound bank note gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your note again - A. Yes. the officer found it on the prisoner. I made a blotch on the back part of it, and took the number of it.</p>

            (to Main) What have you to say against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Main. I left her in my House last Saturday; knowing her Family, I took her in out of Compassion, for she laid about in the House of Office, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Main. I live in <placeName id="t17460409-15-crimeloc65">Nightingale-Lane, in Angel-Court, in the Parish of Aldgate</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long had she been in your House?</p>
               <p>Main. About a Week.</p>

               <p>Q. And what did you lose?</p>
               <p>Main. A Duffil Coat, a Pair of Shoes, and one Shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had lost those Things, where did you find them?</p>
               <p>Main. Please you, my Lord, she told me the Coat and Shoes were at a Pawnbroker's in East-Smithfield for Half a Crown, and he denied them to me, and the Watchman went along me; another Pawnbroker shew'd me the Shirt, and said she had pawn'd it in my Name.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this Woman's having of them?</p>
               <p>Main. She own'd she took the Shirt and Shoes before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get them again? You lost the Coat and Shoes that were this Hoskins's.</p>

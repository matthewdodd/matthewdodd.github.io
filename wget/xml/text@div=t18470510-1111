                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Metcalf, a baker, in Marchmont-street. On the 29th of April, I saw the prisoner in my master's Shop—he came for a half-quartern cottage loaf—I served him—he gave me a half-sovereign—I gave him change—it appeared to me to be a good half-sove<lb></lb>reign—he then asked me if it was the best bread—I said I did not know, it was genuine bread, the League bread, and I said he could have his half-sove<lb></lb>reign back if he did not like it—he said he would, and I gave him the same half-sovereign back again that he gave me, and he gave me the change—he then turned to the door, and came back and said he would take the loaf, and he supposed, if they did not like it, I would change it him—I said, "Oh, yes"—he then took the loaf and put it into his handkerchief, and he put down a half-sovereign—I rung it on the counter, and did not like the sound of it—I rang a little bell for Mr. Metcalf to come, and when the prisoner saw him he walked out of the shop very quickly—he left his handkerchief just as he has tied it up—he left his half-sovereign on the counter—my master went after him, and brought him back—he told him he had given a rascally bad half-sovereign, and he ought to be ashamed of himself for taking advantage of a female in the shop—he said it was not a bad half-sovereign—my master said, "It is, look here," and he took and bent it up—the prisoner said he was a respectable man, and had a respectable character—I could not say that that was not the same half-sovereign as he gave me the first time—I felt satisfied with the first—I did not like the appearance of the second.</p>

                  </hi>. I came into the shop when the bell rang—Turney gave me a half-sovereign, and told me something—I pursued the prisoner, and overtook him about five doors from the shop—I told him he had attempted to pass a rascally bad half-sovereign—he said he bad not done so, what did I mean—I brought him back to the shop, and I told him I must give him in charge—he said he did not care, he was a respectable young man, and had a character—I said, "Your character must be proved"—he took something from his pocket, and swallowed it—I gave the bad half-sovereign to the po<lb></lb>lice-officer—when I came up with the prisoner in the street he was going away from my shop—he did not give any explanation of his leaving his half-sove<lb></lb>reign and hid handkerchief and loaf behind him—they were on the counter when I came back with him.</p>

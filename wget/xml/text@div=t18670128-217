                  </hi>. I am the surviving partner in the firm of Bell and Black, of Bow Lane, City—the prisoner has been in my service about two years—he left on the 13th of October—his duty was to keep the cash and collect the City accounts on Saturdays, and keep the day-book—he was to enter the cash in his cash-book and hand the money or cheques over to me—I never saw this cheque whilst he was in my service—I never got the money, and it is not entered in any of our books—the books are there—I have been through them, and there is no entry—I find entries by the prisoner at the time—I discovered this about ten or twelve days ago—I believe this receipt to be the prisoner's writing (<hi rend="italic">this was signed F. F.</hi>)—those are the prisoner's initials—I have the book now before me in which the cash entries are made by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you have been very unfortunate in your clerks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner is the third I have indicted, and who have robbed us to a very large amount—Holroyd and Allan have pleaded guilty—Holroyd absconded at the time I made the discovery about him, on the 15th of November I think, subsequent to the affair of this cheque—Allan absconded about the same time—the prisoner did not give himself up as soon as the charge was brought against him—I discharged him before that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280017"></xptr>
               <p>for receiving money and not entering it in the cash-book—he did not abscond—he did not give himself up—I know nothing about his making any appointment with the policeman—Holroyd was my managing clerk between four and five years—the others acted under him—the other clerks were not in the habit of receiving money and handing it over to Holroyd—I am not aware of it—they ought to have acted under his direction, but I am not aware of their handing over cash, because it was not his business to receive the cash—any cash he received it was his business to hand over to the prisoner to enter, or to enter it himself in the cash-book—Holroyd was in the habit of handing over cash to the prisoner—the prisoner was the cashier—I know Mr. John Black, my late partner's son—owing to his not having business habits, opening letters and so on, which I would not allow him to do, he quitted the office—he was not in the office during this date—I think my partner died on the 2nd of October—Mr. John Black was not in the habit of coming there between May and October—I forbade his coming—Foale collected on Saturdays—it was Holroyd's duty to give him the list of debts that he was to collect—it was not the usual course of business for him to hand the money over to Holroyd on his return—I am not aware of his doing so—I was invariably there on Saturdays—I believe the entries of the sums he received on Saturdays are in his writing, not in Holroyd's—I saw one entry the other day in Holroyd's writing, which I imagined was in Foale's, but that was not his duty—it was contrary to it—I am not aware of it in any other case—I have not examined with a view to find out, because it was not brought under my notice—Foale had sole charge of the cash, and he alone I looked to for it, and if he collected money from any person it would not be to Holroyd or any other person in the office I should apply, but to Foale—I am not aware that there are Other cases like that, there may be—I do not know of any—I was generally there on Saturday when the prisoner returned with the money he had collected—I don't know about always, if there were any sums of importance I always was—I did not come there exactly in the morning—about two o'clock or between one and two—there was a locked letter-box—I opened that—I used to take Holroyd into the inner office to receive money or orders, and he entered the money in the cash-book, and the cheques or cash, or whatever it might be, he handed over to Foale—he was the person that had charge of the cash—after he entered it I got it from him again, for the purpose of banking, and any of those I always signed my name to—if there were cheques to send to the bank sometimes one clerk was sent with them and sometimes another—all cheques were paid into our own bank—I sent Foale to the bank—Holroyd had not charge of the cash at all—I am not aware of his sending Foale to the bank—I can't swear he has not—any money that was to be banked was made out on a slip of paper, and all the remittances I got I marked off—I do not know of Holroyd ever sending Foale with cheques to be cashed—I know now that both of them have done so—I did not then—I was half my time from the office—I generally left between five and six—I left Foale and Holroyd behind; not Allan, he had no business in the office except occasionally—I did not see him for months at a time—the others stayed till seven—it was the prisoner's duty to go on and collect accounts on Saturdays—I kept Holroyd in the office to settle and explain accounts—I was at the office on Saturday, the 6th October—I did not desire him to go and get this particular cheque—that would be Holroyd's duty—I don't know what amounts he had to collect that day—I do not see any entered as collected by him that day—I can't say whether I was there when he returned—I</p>

               <p>believe it was the day of Mr. Black's funeral—I believe I sent him to Stratford that day with a cheque for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay the men—that was at one o'clock—he might be gone two hours or an hour and a half—Mr. Dean's place is in Leadenhall Street, on his way to Stratford—the workmen at Stratford are paid about two—it may have been about eleven or twelve when I gave him the cheque—my usual time for coming to town on Satur<lb></lb>days was a little before eleven—I can't tell whether he received a list from Holroyd on that day—I can't tell whether he returned before six.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you find entries by the prisoner in the cash-book on the 6th October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, moneys entered by him, but not accounts—he has entered accounts on the Monday following, but I don't see Mr. Dean's cheque—I never gave a customer's cheque to any one in my em<lb></lb>ployment to go and get cashed—I invariably banked them myself—the one instance in which I mistook Halroyd's entry for the prisoner's was on the 6th of July of a sum of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no surplus money, which could have been the produce of this cheque, has come into my hands.</p>

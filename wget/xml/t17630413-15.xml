               <p>Q. Did he know how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Doughty. He did, or he would not have bought it so cheap; he had it for 18 s. a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do West, Johnson, or you, deal in malt?</p>
               <p>Doughty. No; I am a gardner, and we all lie constantly in his house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Freeman. I am constable; I went to search the prisoner Murray's house for the sacks the 28th or 29th of March; we found several sacks marked with different marks. Johnson sent for me and desired I would get him admitted evidence concerning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130010"></xptr> the matter. He confessed to me, he had stolen this malt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hope that he should be admitted evidence?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I did. (He produced two sacks.) These two sacks I found at Murray's house. When I took West, he desired I would get him admitted evidence; but I gave him no hopes that he should be admitted. He told me, he was concerned in taking the malt, and said, he had sold Mr. Murray thirty quarters; this was before the Justice. He also shewed us, where the malt was up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lyon. Look at these two sacks here produced.</p>
               <p>Lyon. These are the same marks of the sacks that I took into my barge from the wharf in Channel-row, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the sacks?</p>

            . On the 28th of last month I had a letter sent down to me to let me know, I had lost some of my malt. My servant went up on the Sunday to see after it, and it was safe; and on the Monday we missed seven sacks. I went to the New-court in Westminster, where they were examining the prisoner Johnson. One Child a constable said, he was the man that was found with some malt upon him; he seemed to make no confession at first. Afterwards he came in and made a confession, that he was the very man that stole part of my malt, and was carrying it in the night, when the watchman stopt him; this he confessed before the Gentlemen in my hearing. Mr. Freeman the constable went to search Murray's house, but by the way went in pursuit of West; we found him asleep in a public house before we came to Murray's house. He told us, he would go with us and shew us, where he pitched the malt, and told us, he put it in Mr. Murray's brewhouse. I had a sample of the malt in my pocket, that I had lost out of my boat, and by comparing it with some that I found, it appeared to be of the very same sort. We found six sacks of mine covered up under some bricks, in a little place by Murray's brewhouse, there was a way out of the brewhouse to that place.</p>

            . On the 28th of last month I was requested by Mr. Ameck and Dunkin to go to the new Guildhall, Westminster, on account of the malt being stolen from them. I attended with them. Johnson came there, he pretended innocency respecting it. Soon after that, he came in again, and acknowledged to the stealing malt in company with Doughty and West; his confession seemed to be very intricate and dark; the Magistrates put him by. After that they sent out for West. When West came into court, he, without any promise, voluntarily said, I'll tell all I know. I have been guilty with Johnson and Doughty of stealing those different malts to the quantity of three quarters, or more, that we sold to Mr. Murray, from Mr. Graves, that they had carried away from out of the craft, for 18 s. a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. What might malt be worth at that time?</p>
               <p>Dolman. I am not in the trade, but I know at that time it went at 33 s. 34 s. and 35 s. and 6 d. a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Dolman. I am very intimate with Mr. Ameck and Dunkin, and some times see their books. West turned himself to me, and added farther, I am got in a sad hole, and (to the best of my knowledge) said, If I am not hang'd, I don't care if I am transported, I then said, you should not have stolen the malt; he said no more, than Johnson and West were concerned with him.</p>
               <p>From West. He says, I was concerned in selling three quarters of malt to Mr. Murray.</p>
               <p>Dolman. The malt that the prisoner means now is Ameck and Dunkin's malt, but the three quarters of malt now in question is Mr. Graves's malt; a distinct affair.</p>

               <p>Q. What was malt worth a quarter at that time?</p>

               <p>Dunkin. In searching Murray's houses there were thirty beds in them, one bed we found made of nothing but sacks; there were on some of them marks in the same manner as these, part of west-country sacks. (He produced some pieces, the Jury inspect them.)</p>

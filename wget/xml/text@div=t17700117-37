            . I was along with Mr. Taylor when the two men at the bar came in. This iron crow was taken out of the third person's pocket. [Producing an iron crow about sixteen inches long, with claws at one end, and the other a sharp point ]. Here is a box with tinder, flint, steel, and matches, which were taken out of his pocket. [Also produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Taylor. I tried this chisel at Sir Thomas's house, at the cabinet in the back parlour; it exactly fitted the impressions made on the cabinet, where it had been wrenched open. There was a bureau also that had been broke open; but this chisel did not fit the marks on that.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the third person?</p>
               <p>Heley. His name is Fountain.</p>
               <p>Fountain was not examined.</p>

               <p>Lister asked me to go and drink with him; he took me to his room. He had this chisel, I said it would serve me for a turn-screw; he said I might take it, it did not belong to him; we went out to drink together, and staid out pretty late. When we came home, these men were in the house, Taylor and Heley, and four or five more; they took us to Sir

               <p>I was very ill in bed; sometimes I lay in that room, and sometimes in another; two of these gentlemen came to the door and knocked; a woman got up and let them in; they asked if I could let them a lodging? I said I could not. Then they asked for a glass of gin? I said they must get in themselves, I had none. They then said, if I offered to stir they would cut me down the skull with a thing they had; they tied me to another woman, and took us away to Sir

He had sent us some beer; we were drinking together, (I and the prisoner) - nobody else was in the shop; the boy might be there. He said I had been telling some lies about him to his master that morning; I said not - he said that I had; I said</p>
               <p>"Let it be; let us sweep up the shop, and I will ask my master before I go home to night." He made no answer - I went to lay hold of the birch-broom, at the end of the shop, I turned my back to him to get it, he then came behind, and struck me on the head with a hammer, on the temple; I fell against the counter - he said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you are not killed yet; I'll give you another blow" - he was going to give me another blow, but I caught his hand, and prevented it; he did not strike me afterwards. I had taken the broom to sweep the ceiling down. I had not doubled my fist at him. I was cut on the head, and it bled immediately - I knew him by sight before; we often spoke, but I never worked with him before; I am quite certain I never offered to strike him; we never drank together. We are both Irish, and come from Galway - I never had any dispute with him. I had not been to work all day until seven o'clock in the evening: I had drank no spirits except the gin; had a share of two pots of beer at dinner. I was walking about all day - he was as sober as I was. I could get no work in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What time did you get up - A. About six o'clock; but could get no work. I met a friend about two o'clock, and drank with him; there was two pots of beer between three of us; no whisky nor spirits. I gave him no provocation; he came behind me and struck me on the head; I am sure he struck me behind - I did not pull him off a plank, nor pull the plank away; we had not finished work - I gave him no provocation whatever; I did not kick him - I gave him the fist when he wanted to give the second blow. I was knocked senseless against the counter, but when I recovered, I struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the blow in front of your head - A. No, on the side. I have known him two years, but never drank with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a scaffold in the room - A. Yes; we did not quarrel till we came on the ground.</p>

            . I am a chemist and druggist. This man came to our house about nine o'clock; I looked at his head - It was a slight cut just across the forehead, about half an inch long; I cannot say with what instrument it was done - it was not with a sharp instrument; it was more of a bruise than a cut, though it was cut through the skin; had it been done with a sharp instrument, it would be a clear wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You see the prisoner and prosecutor - would it be possible with the prosecutor's back turned from him, to have hit him in the forehead, unless he faced him - A. It is certainly much more like facing than being behind him. It was a slight wound.</p>

               <p>Q. The coffee and cocoa kept there is the property of a great many different person? - A. Yes, different merchants; the prisoner was going away to dinner when I rubbed him down; he was upon the last stair, and I was upon the landing-place leading to the street; I felt something behind the knees of his breeches; I detained him, searched him, and found upon him a handkerchief containing coffee; it was concealed under his apron; I then took him into the warehouse, he unbuttoned his breeches knees, and a quantity of loose coffee ran out; there were about three pounds and a half of it.</p>

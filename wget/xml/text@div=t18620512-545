                  </hi>. I keep a general shop at 14, Mate-street, Bethnal-green—on 7th April, the prisoner came and asked for a penny candle, and tendered a counterfeit shilling—I broke it in two, chucked it back to her on the counter, and asked her how many more she had got like that—she said, "What is the matter with it?"—I said that it was a bad one, and that I thought she had paid me a visit before on Saturday night, for we had one of the same date then—she picked up the pieces and went away, taking them with her—I followed her down the street, and at the corner of North-street, she sat down on a door-step—she had not sat there long before three young men joined her—I heard some awkward words from them; they saw I was watching them; I let them go up one street, and I went up another; I saw the prisoner leave the three men; she went up the Bethnal-green-road, and into Mrs. Howes shop—I was standing outside the window and saw her tender a shilling, and saw Mrs. Howes break it in</p>

I am a baker, at 180, Bethnal-green-road—on 7th April, the prisoner came into the shop; I was at one counter and my wife was against the scales—the prisoner asked her for a half-quartern brick—when it was weighed she put a shilling down; my wife took it, broke it in two, and threw it down—I still kept my position, and Mr. Sunman came in, put his two hands across our door, and said, "Hallo, my lady, we have got you now; you were just in my shop and gave me one"—I came round to the door, picked up the shilling, called a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge with the pieces of the shilling.</p>

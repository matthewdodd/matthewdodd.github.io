            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 10th of this month I apprehended the prisoner upon another charge. I found these three watch seals and a key in his possession; the prisoner said they were his property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. He is a thief, he is no business at all as I know of; he lived at No. 10, Short's Gardens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You apprehended him for something that an honest jury acquitted him to day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found these things in his possession a month after the time the prosecutor said he lost them from his watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of travelling the country. About three months ago I kept a clothes shop in Shire-lane. I took this place in Shorts' Gardens with intent to make it a shop. I purchased them three seals in Croydon market, and when they were found in my possession I owned them as my own property. I gave 30 s. for them in trade. As for Limbrick saying I was a thief, I never was taken up before in my life.</p>

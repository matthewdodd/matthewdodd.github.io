I was called into my shop on the 29th of October, and saw two men walking out; I followed Munro, who was one of them, and said I suspected he had a pair of shoes in his hat - I asked him to let me look at it; he said, No, I should not: I sent for an officer - he then came back to my shop, pulled a pair of shoes from his hat, and ran away; I followed, and brought him back - the officer then arrived; another pair of shoes fell from some part of his person into the street.</p>

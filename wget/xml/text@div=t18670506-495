                  </hi>. I am a brick maker, of Elizabeth Cottages, High Hill Terrace, Bow—last Friday week I was at work in a brick field at Bow—the prisoner came into the field and said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, you shall not give me a shift one night, would you?" and struck me—I tried to keep him off as well as I could—ho struck me several times, and I went down by the side of the kiln—he got hold of me by my throat and said, "Shall I give you a kick or a <hi rend="italic">dicky</hi>?"—I do not know what that meant—I pushed his hands away, and he got up and kicked me on the hip—I was nearly strangled, but I got up and took the shovel in my right hand—he said, "What are you going to do with that?"—I said, "I do not know"—he then took up a peck, laid hold of me by the left shoulder, and said, "Shall I kill the b—?"—I suppose he knocked me down with it, for when I came to myself I was on my hands and knees and saw him going away—he was not sober, but I was—I had been at work all night and all day.</p>

I am a labourer, of 31, Lefcvre Road, Bow—I was in the brick field, and saw the prisoner get over the gate, at about half-paat six in tho evening, and go up to Stevens—I did not take a deal of notice of him nt fust, but I heard him wrangling about some beer, and he knocked Stevens down—Stevens got up again, and the prisoner knocked him down again, and put his knee on his belly and his hauds on his throat, and said, "Shall I put <hi rend="italic">dicky</hi> on the b—?" which means, strangle him—he then got up and took the pick in his hand, held him with one hand, shoved him against the kiln with the other, struck him with the pick, and he fell—Stevens tried to keep all the blows off that he could, but he had no chance"—he had his shovel in his hand at one time, which he gets his living by—he was sober, but the prisoner was not—tho prisoner had been discharged from the field ou Friday, at dinner time; I do not know what for, but nothing to do with the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—on 27th April I was in the brick field at Bow, and saw the prisoner pulling Stevens about in rather too rough a manner for play—he knocked Stevens down, who got up, and the prisoner knocked him down again, put his foot on him, and said, "Shall I kill the b—?"—he repeated that twice, and when he got up he struck him with the pick and left him for dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Fairfield Road, Bow—on 26th April I was called to the Bow Police-station, and found Stevens with a contused wound over his left temple, which could be done with a blunt instrument like this pick—it was not severe in depth or in extent, but it was very much swollen, and it was a stellated wound—it was not dangerous—he was quite sensible—he was sent to the hospital and is still weak—there was a great loss of blood, but the bone was not fractured—he appeared sober.</p>

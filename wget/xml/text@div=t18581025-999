I am manager of the City Bank—the defendants, Skeen and Freeman, had an account at our house—we had frequently made advances to them on warrants; I should think, at the time this transaction occurred, we had made advances very nearly to the amount of £10, 000—the bank had often made advances to them on warrants—among other cargoes, we had made an advance on the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Laura Campbell</hi>—on 25th May last, Mr. Joshua Freeman, the nephew of the defendant, came to our house with this letter—it is in Freeman's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:"Oak<lb></lb>ley-terrace, 25th May, 1858, from Mr. Freeman to Mr. White.

                  </hi>. I am a saddler, of Long-lane, Smithfield. I have known Jackson and Goult since July—Jackson tint came to my shop on 14th July, represented himself as a black saddler, and brought two saddles with him, which I bought—on 29tb Sept. they brought a pair of tilbury tugs—I cannot say whether they came together, I know Jackson came, but whether Goult came or not I cannot say—I am referring to extracts from my books—this entry of 29th Sept. is not in my writing; but I have an indepen<lb></lb>dent recollection of that transaction—they generally came two or three times a week—I had two or three deals with them on 29th Sept.; and on one of those occasions Jackson represented that the articles they brought were saddlery fur<lb></lb>niture,. which they were disposing of in consequence of giving up the manu<lb></lb>facturing of harness, and the articles appeared to be such as they would have in that business—I think Goult was then present, but I cannot say—I had no suspicion of them, because I had dealt with them a long time for saddles; they were saddle-manufacturers—they continued bringing me articles down to 11th Oct.—on that day I purchased two harness Baddies, and a gig whip, of them—there is an entry here of it (<hi rend="italic">referring to hit book</hi>) in my writing—about the middle of Oct., the 10th or 18th, they brought me quite a different description of goods, which appeared new, and as though they came direct from a warehouse—I said, "This is quite a different sort of furniture to what you brought at first; how did you become possessed of this?"—I think they were both present then; I know Jackson was, he was the principal man<lb></lb>Jackson said, "The fact is, we are manufacturing saddles for Eldrid" (I knew that to be the fact); "we get a very tidy price for our work, but we are com<lb></lb>pelled," or "required, to take a part of it out in furniture:" and in answer to a question I put, they said that in consequence of getting a better price from Eldrid, they were able to make a sacrifice on the furniture—under those circumstances I did not hesitate to take the things of them, because I knew they worked for Eldrid—I see by my book that they came again on the 13th, either one or both of them, I cannot say which—Jackson was the principal man, and he came more than the other—I cannot tell what I bought on that occasion exactly, but I paid them 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 16th I have, in my own writing, "Goult, three pair of wooden girths," which I purchased of him—in Nov. I sent my man named Springett to Mr. Eldrid; and in consequence of what passed between Mr. Eldrid and me, on 10th Nov., I ordered four pairs of spurs, I think, of Jackson—I think they were both present; but they were brought by Goult, and I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fur them—I sent the spurs to Mr. Eldrid—on 11th Goult brought another pair of spurs—that was the last transaction.</p>

Jackson alone brought some harness—the dealings took place in my count<lb></lb>ing-house, which is at the back of the shop—every one who sells me goods comes there—they either come through the shop, or else the back-way, through the carriage manufactory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Duffield. I remember Jackson bringing two saddles to our shop, in July—he did not, on that occasion, tell me his name; but he afterwards brought goods, which were purchased of him, and he had them entered in the name of Goult—he afterwards came with Goult, and said, "I have brought my partner down with me, and if he brings a saddle down, and you pay him for it, it will be just the same as paying me for it"—on 13th Oct., I saw both Jackson and Goult in the shop; they brought some furniture, consisting of buckles, and a quantity of girths—the buckles were of the same character as these, and I am sure these are some of the brown girths; I cannot say as to the linen girths—they were together, and helped me to tie the girths in pairs—I paid them 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—they said, "We are likely to do a little business with your <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>; we are get<lb></lb>ting some furniture in barter from a man in the country"—I said if they served us as cheap as anybody else, 1 dare say Mr. Duffield would buy of them—I recollect Jackson bringing some tilbury togs on Michaelmas-day, for which I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they both came together after that, and brought</p>

               <p>saddles, and also furniture—the saddles generally had the terrets in them, but manufacturers generally send them in without furniture—an addition was put on the price of the saddles on account of the terrets—I cannot say how much I have paid them altogether; I have paid them on several occasions—I recollect one day paying them two sums, each of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 30th, I paid Jack<lb></lb>son 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on 31st, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., both sums to Jackson—I went to Mr. Eldrid on 31st, and in consequence of what took place between us, we ordered some spurs, and it was after that that the prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

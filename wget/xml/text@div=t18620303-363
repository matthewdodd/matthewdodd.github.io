                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father and brother, as rag merchants, at 1, Barrou's-place, Waterloo-road—we had two persons in our service, named Johnson and Rowlands; Johnson as foreman, and Rowlands as carman—I believe the prisoner is Johnson's brother-in-law—on 29th November, last year, I marked three or four bags, containing rags; and on the 30th I secreted myself in the warehouse, with my brother and a policeman, between 6 and 7 in the evening—while there I heard the window of a house, occupied by our foreman, open, and immediately afterwards heard some footsteps on the roof of the warehouse—I then saw some laths, which form part of the roof, removed, and two men enter the warehouse, and come down the ladder—I likewise heard a third party on the tiles at the time—I then saw the two persons who had entered the warehouse lift up some bags, and pass them through an aperture on to the roof—they were rolled along the tiles, and I heard them fall into a fore-court in front of Johnson's house—I then, with my brother and the policeman, ran out to endeavour to secure the parties—I saw a van, at the entrance of the fore-court, laden with rags; and as I ran out into the street, I saw three persons run from the van, and a fourth person turned back into the fore-court—I then ran down the street, and saw Johnson in the custody of my brother—I returned and took Rowlands into custody; and saw Baldwin, the third man, in the custody of the policeman—the fourth man, who I believe to be the prisoner, I could not distinguish, and he got away—we prosecuted the other three men, and they were convicted here at the January Session.</p>

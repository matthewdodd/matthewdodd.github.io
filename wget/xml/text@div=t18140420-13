On the 24th of February, about a quarter past eight in the evening, I was walking down the Minories with a friend; we were arm-in-arm together; the prisoner stepped on the pavement, came round to my right hand, and snatched my watch chain; I sung out immediately to my friend that he had got my watch-chain. The watch-chain broke, and on my turning round I fancy I trod on his heel, which made me stumble, and he too. My friend pursued him, and laid hold of him. I lost sight of the prisoner for the moment I stumbled. After he was taken he had not my watch-chain about him.</p>

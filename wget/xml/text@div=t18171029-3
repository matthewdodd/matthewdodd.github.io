On the 15th of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in bed, the watchman alarmed me by knocking at the door; I got up, went down, and found the cellar window, which goes under the street, open. I had been in the cellar at dusk, about six or seven o'clock. I had a candle with me when I went there - I went to shift the pipe; I locked the door when I came out. The flap had not been open for a week before. I missed nothing when I went into the cellar. I went into the street first, and then went down into the cellar from the house; I opened the cellar door, and then let the prisoner out through the house. Just as I was going to open the door, he said, "don't be alarmed, master, I will make no resistance." I knew him; he had lived about twenty months with me before. The wood-work of the wine-cellar door was cut away round the ock, and we found a large knife lying by the door - I took him to the watch-house-two small picklock keys were found upon him. When I returned from the watch-house, I found a tinder-box, a flint, a steel, and a candle, on one of the butts in the cellar; the candle was not burning; they are not mine, nor were they there the night before. Next morning I found two more skeleton keys in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In what way was the cellar window fastened - A. By a cross-bolt, and another bolt at the bottom. I saw it fastened the night before when I shut up, at half-past ten o'clock - I tried them. I had not seen the prisoner in my house for some days before. He has frequently been at my house, but not latterly; he lodged eight or ten months with me; when he lodged with me I kept my wine in that cellar.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going down the street, about two o'clock in the morning, and found Mr. Homan's cellar window open; I had been round at half-past one o'clock, and am positive it was not open then - I gave the alarm. While Mr. Homan was coming down stairs I looked into the cellar, and saw one of the butts running, and the prisoner behind one of the casks; I am certain that he is the man. When Homan came down I had sprung my rattle; the other watchman guarded the window. I went into the house, and saw the prisoner come up the cellar stairs, and took him to the watch-house. When we took him there, the constable of the night took two small keys out of his pocket. We returned to the cellar, and found the other things; the winecellar lock was cut away.</p>
               <p>ROBERT UPTON. I am the constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; he said nothing. I searched, and found two picklock keys upon him. The other witnesses have spoken correctly.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was that? - About one o'clock in the day, or some little tritle of it; the robbery was committed about ten minutes after eight o'clock at night; I had been at different places, about my business, from that time, but never took my money out of my right hand breeches pocket, no other than three guineas, which I changed at Mr. Oliver's at night; that was before this happened, then that left me ten half guineas, and three whole guineas, I left Mr. Oliver nearly about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.What part of the town is Mr. Oliver's? - At the top of Nightingale-lane, in East Smithfield, within a little way from where I was robbed; I come my way home, and came to <placeName id="t17940219-12-crimeloc58">Parrott-alley</placeName>

I came by this alley, and I see a man rather standing within the alley, and I thought I knew the man, I asked the man if his name was Appleby? he replied it was not; I asked him if he knew a man of that name, that resorted that neighbourhood? he asked me what profession he was? I told him; he readily told me that he knew a man of that name, that lived in that alley, and I was very glad of the opportunity, because the man owed me a little money; he told me if I would go down that alley with him he would shew me where the man lodged; I went down the alley, it may be within a foot or two the length of this table, when the man laid hold of me by both my arms.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he lay hold of you? - I had my hand in my breeches pocket, he laid hold of me, and pinioned me up, and the expression he made use of was, d-n you, not a word, he laid hold of both my arms.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he laid hold of both your arms, did your hand continue in your breeches pocket, or not? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your hand came out of your pocket immediately? - It did, he took both my hands behind me, and pinioned me up to the building, and then four or more women came, three I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did they come from? - They came from the end of the alley,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190036"></xptr>they were standing at the end of the alley when I spoke to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that they came into the alley after you? - They were in the street when I first talked to the man, and they came up the alley after me, the one as the man held me put her hand into my pocket, and stole all this gold out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the woman's hand in your pocket, and not the man's? - I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q.Which pocket was it? - The right hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When she had done that what became of the others? - As soon as the man saw that the woman had robbed me of my property, he fetched me a blow as hard as he could on the head, but my hat having an high crown to it, it did not hurt me, only knocked my hat off; after that they all ran away as fast as they could, and the man ran to East Smithfield, the way that I came in, and the women they ran down the alley the other way, the alley is a thoroughfare; I saw one woman run into a house, and I pursued her immediately, there was an inside door to it, but I ran against the door, and the door burst open; the house was in the same alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she get out of your sight at all? - No, I never let her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean she was not out of your sight from the time of her running away, from the time you found her in the house? - No other than when she was going into the door; I impeached her immediately with the robbery, and she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door, locked or how? - I believe it was only latched, I shoved against it and it flew open; she denied the robbery for a long time; I told her if she would tell me the parties, so that I might get my property, I should be very happy.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the person that you seized? - Lloyd, I never afterwards let her out of my sight, I kept her in my custody in that house, till the watch was set, and then I had her secured, and I called him in, his name is Frederic Wibbing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that one of the women put her hand into your pocket; was that Lloyd or the others? - One of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Lloyd before? - Yes, I had, by passing and repassing, and by living in the parish so many years. There was a light shone bright on her.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was that? - The light of a lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the other prisoner was taken? - The next morning, between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Was you present? - No, I was not, I see her at the watch-house before the hour of ten in the morning, they came to let me know she was taken, as soon as I saw her I knew her face.</p>
               <p>Q. What part did she take in the robbery? - She took my money out of my pocket, I knew her person very well, I had seen her many a time before.</p>
               <p>Q. For what length of time do you think you had known her person? - I think for three years, I frequent that neighbourhood two or three times a week at times, I have lived in the parish nine years, I have seen them both about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how Lockhart came to be taken? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any description of her person? - I did, the best that ever I could I gave to Moses Fonseca.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property about her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. On neither one nor the other of them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I am counsel for Lockhart only.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190037"></xptr>Q.You know these persons at the bar are trying for a capital offence; you are well acquainted with that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently if your evidence is believed it will doom them to suffer the law? I would have you be cautious before you swear positively what you have said to my learned friend. I take it for granted in Nightingale-lane there are a great number of loose women? - There are.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between eight and nine o'clock at night? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was done at a time that they are not less frequest than they are in day light? - I don't doubt it in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know the persons of all the women in that neighbourhood of that character? - For to say that I know every one by name I do not, I know them no otherwise than I know you, supposing I was to meet you in the street; I suppose there is five hundred, if the truth was known, in that lane.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Lloyd you had as good an opportunity of seeing as the prisoner Lockhart? - I had not a better opportunity, for I saw Lockhart's face well, and I had a good opportunity of knowing her.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my learned friend and my lord just now, that you followed her into a house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. She was taken on the spot? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. The other women got away at that time? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women think you there might be with this man that you first addressed? - There were four, and there might be more, I cannot tell; but there were not exceeding five, I could almost venture for to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you take on yourself to swear to the others as well as to these women? - I could not; there were others apprehended, but for the exchange of dress I could not swear to them, for which I am sorry.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lamps were there in the alley? - There was none in the alley, but there was at the bottom of the alley; whether there is any lamp in the alley or not I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the lamp by which you made your observation, is the lamp in the street, at the end of the alley? - It is, it shone right on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How far had you proceeded up the alley when the man laid hold of you? - It did not exceed the length of this table the long way, a very little way into the alley.</p>
               <p>Q.Then after you had got that distance this matter happened that you have stated? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an inclosed alley? - No, it is an open alley, a thoroughfare, I know nothing to the contrary; I was never down the alley in my life time; it was thoroughfare enough for them to run away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Lockhart taken? - She was taken in the same court I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure to the best of your recollection, there was no other lamp, save the lamp at the end of the alley? - I cannot say there was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what length the alley is? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman that went away from you proceed up the alley, or come back again into the street? - There was none proceeded into the street but the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Now there was no property found on Ann Lockhart? - I was not at the searching of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the searching of the prisoner Lloyd? - I believe she was searched in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found or not? - No, I recollect she was searched.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190038"></xptr>Prisoner Lloyd. Pray, sir, did I ever wrong you of any thing? - I have said to the learned counsel what I had to say. She was one of the women, she was helping to hustle me up against the wall.</p>
               <p>Court. What particulars did they do besides the one woman that took the money? - They all assisted as well as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do? let us hear if they did any thing? - There were no other expressions than d-n you not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the women take any other active part than the woman that took your money? Lloyd you pursued into a house, how far was that house from the spot where your money was taken out of your pocket? - A very small distance, it did not exceed thirty yards; I see her all the way into the door, it was a moon light night, I see her go in doors, and I followed her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman in the room at that time with her? - I saw no other, and I don't know there was any other woman in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never lost sight of her from her entrance into the house, till you found her in the room? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to swear to her, as being one of the four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any candle light in the room? - Yes, there was a candle had been a light, it was just blowed out, the snuff was alight, and I put it to the fire, it light directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known Lloyd again if you had not seen her so soon? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked by the counsel how you happened to know the persons of these women more than a great many others that are there of the same sort of women? - I never was molested by any other parties; I know them no other than by passing and repassing; there is a great number resort to that neighbourhood, but there were no other about at that time just there.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing nothing had happened to you, how should you have known these women from other women of the same description? - I should not have taken notice.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had noticed them before? - I had not noticed them no more than other women.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have given this as a reason? - There is many a one that I should know perfectly well, as well as them by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you still persist that you knew these women by sight before? - Yes, I know them by passing and repassing many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you broke this door open? - I dare say the space of time was not half a minute after I had my money taken out of my pocket, and received a blow on my head.</p>

               <p>Q. On his calling did you go there? - I went immediately to the house; says he, watchman, I have been robbed by a party, and this woman was in company with the party that robbed me; he wished me to take charge of her.</p>

Did you take charge of her then? - Yes, immediately, and took her to the watch-house; she was searched there, and nothing found, and she was taken to the magistrate and committed; afterwards when I was going the hour of quarter past three in the morning I heard a noise, and I made towards it, when I came up there was silence for about a minute or two, at last I heard Ann Lockhart's voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her voice before? - O, yes. I made up to her, and she was standing, and a man with her, before the Crown and Anchor, in Black horse yard, so I heard somebody coming down stairs of the Crown and Anchor to open the door, and there was a watchman that brought her there; where he came from I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Court. I am sure you don't know much about it? - Seeing this man stand at the door with Ann Lockhart I was rather dubious to take charge of her by myself, therefore I went to the watch-house to get assistance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had you any information from Grose that led you to suspect Lockhard? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q.Grose had given you this description before Lockhart was apprehended? - Yes, it was when Lloyd was taken to the watch-house he gave it.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got her into the watch-house did you search her? - Yes, and nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long have you been a watchman in this part? - Seven years last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Q. It is pretty well crowded with these sort of women? - Very much so sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at the time, between eight and nine, they are pretty plenty? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this Crown and Anchor from the place where the gentleman described himself to be robbed? - About four score yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any light in this alley? - There is one lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - Yes, at the bottom of the alley, that lights to the corner of Ann Lockhart's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that lamp would give a light as far as the prosecutor has said? - I was not there on the spot at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. If there is a lamp at the end of the alley, in the street, it could not give so great deal of light to an alley so long as it has been described? - That I cannot say any thing about.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched both the prisoners? - Yes, they were both searched in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Lloyd was taken directly, and nothing was found on her. How many did you see that night do you think after eleven or twelve o'clock, or thereabouts? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have been drinking at all? - He was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190040"></xptr>Court to Grose. As I collect from you, they put their hands in one pocket, then there was no further search made? - There was not. I had nine pounds in silver in my coat side pocket, but that was not taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say why they deserted you without attempting to make further search? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lockhart. Before I was taken to the watch-house I lived in this house; when I first saw this gentleman it was at this house where this woman was taken, he stopped me first, and when I saw him in the house he said this woman had robbed him, and then he light the candle, and shewed me the bed, and said it was on that bed he was robbed, and then afterwards that he had said so he first locked the door and locked me in, but afterwards he opened the door and let me out, and said I was not the woman, and then I was taken in the morning as I was going to Gravesend, but I wanted to get something first to drink.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lloyd. I came from my day's work; I am but a poor woman; I have a garret in this house, and I saw this gentleman sitting in a chair in this house; I had a coat to mend for a person; I asked him whether he came for a coat I had to mend for a young man? he told me no; he said to me he had been robbed of six guineas and a half, and he said if so be I could not find him the people that robbed him, I should suffer for all; where of I never saw the people, nor know nothing at all about it; so immediately he pulled me into the lower room, and kept me there till the watchman came to cry the hour, and then he gave charge of me; here is a young man,

             sworn:</p>
               <p>I live at Woolwich; I am a rope-maker belonging to his Majesty's yard. Last Friday when I was coming through Black Horse-yard, about half past eight, I went into Ann Grey's house-

             I mean - I made a mistake, and enquired for my coat that she had to mend.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you given her that coat? - About four or five days before, it was tore underneath the arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she usually work for you? - Yes, for these twelve years. As soon as I entered the room I saw this gentleman there, the prosecutor, in the lower room, and the woman was sitting down in the chair, and the man was standing up, they were talking concerning a robbery; I asked what was the matter? the gentleman replied he had lost six guineas, immediately there was a watchman sent for, and she was immediately taken away to the watch-house. I see her searched, and I knew no further.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you working in his Majesty's yard still, down to the present time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what department are you working, under whom? - Mr. Suckling.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go into this house? - About half past eight as high as I can judge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was

             at home then? - She was, and I told her if it was so it was a very bad thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expostulate with the watchman about his charge? - All I heard was that the watchman took charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the watchman must have seen you? - I was there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not talking of the juncture of time, but the juncture of place? - I was in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190041"></xptr>Q.Was you in the room before the watchman was called in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how was the watchman sent for? - First of all there was a boy very nigh the door, and this gentleman said, I will give you a shilling if you will fetch a watchman; the boy was just by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find the boy was just by the door? - I saw him myself, and the gentleman saw him too; the room that we were standing in looked into the alley; this boy was standing just at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out the boy? - Because this gentleman he went to the door, to give an alarm to the watchman, and he saw the boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the boy went out for the watchman? - He did; but the watchman came before the boy came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the watchman that came in? - I cannot see any man that is here, that is like him; he was a short elderly man. I went to the watch-house with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep in this house sometimes? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you attended the woman, and the prosecutor, and watchman, to the watch-house, and see her searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing taken from her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. She had been your acquaintance for ten years? - Yes. I have been in the house many times when I have had money in my pocket, and laid on the bed when I have been in liquor, and sometimes have treated her with a quartern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How came you to mention the name of Groves? - It was a mistake of mine to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for it? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you see any thing of that last witness that night? - He came in about two or three minutes before I gave charge to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see him? - He came into the house; she asked this man if he would give her something to drink? he said, no, he would not, for she was a very bad woman, and he would not give her any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention about losing six guineas before him? - I was not certain to the sum till I got to the watch house, and counted all the other money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that you put all the gold into that pocket? - I knew very well I did, but I was in a flustration that I did not know hardly what I had got about me; I believe I did make use of the words that I have lost six guineas, and when I came to recollect I had ten half guineas in that pocket and three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. The man you have never said hold of? - No, I have not, but if I was to see the man I should know him.</p>

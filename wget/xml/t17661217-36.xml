            , Esq; On the 4th of November I went to the Bedford Arms, about six in the afternoon, and between seven and eight I left it; the man that keeps the house took the number of the prisoners chair, (they are <rs id="t17661217-36-deflabel195" type="occupation">chairmen</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17661217-36-defend375 t17661217-36-deflabel195"></join>

               <p>Q. Where did you direct them to carry you?</p>
               <p>Scott. I cannot say to where, but I believe it was to go to Mr. Couts's, in the Strand; they carried me to one Dugens's, a grand punch-house, a notorious house, and a robbing house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober enough to know where you was?</p>
               <p>Scott. I was fuddled, but I know I was sober enough to know where they carried me; when I got into the house, they had punch there, and I drank some of it, and I suppose I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room with you?</p>
               <p>Scott. The prisoners were, and no body else; one of them sat close by me; I have swore three times to the men, and I know them.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at them again. (He looks at them.)</p>
               <p>Scott. Upon my conscience I cannot recollect that fellow in the red waistcoat (the man in the red waistcoat was Broaders) as one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Scott. I will not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Scott. I suppose I staid there an hour, or an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your getting into the chair to go away, or how did you go away?</p>
               <p>Scott. I do not know how I went away from that house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find yourself after that?</p>
               <p>Scott. I did not find myself at all, the watchman found me in a gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. What company had you been in at the Bedford Arms?</p>
               <p>Scott. There were not above three.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bowls had you?</p>
               <p>Scott. That does not matter; I had in my pocket ten guineas, or ten guineas and a half in gold, in a green common purse, and some silver in my pocket, and a gold watch; they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss them?</p>
               <p>Scott. When I got to my lodgings, about one o'clock at night; the watchman called a chair, and they carried me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the chair?</p>
               <p>Scott. I did not; I had lost every thing, I could not; I lost a handkerchief also; it was a remarkable one; (producing one) it was the fellow to this. I went to Sir

               <p>Council. That is no proof at all, except you can prove there was but two of that sort in the world. When you went from the Bedford Arms, I suppose you was not sober?</p>
               <p>Scott. I was about half seas over.</p>
               <p>Council. What, worse than you are now?</p>
               <p>Scott. Very like so.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the place you was carried to?</p>
               <p>Scott. I cannot say a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect how you came out of that dreadful house you talk of?</p>
               <p>Scott. Upon my honour I do not recollect; I think they would not leave me there without carrying me somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Council. People, when they are in liquor, are sometimes very obstinate.</p>
               <p>Scott. I was robbed I am sure, but do not know where.</p>

               <p>Scott. Without they are taken out of his pocket, how can they drop?</p>

               <p>Q. If a chairman is frugal in that part of the town, can he not save a great deal of money?</p>
               <p>Noaks. To be sure he may.</p>
               <p>Cassody's defence.</p>
               <p>We took up Mr. Scott at the Bedford Arms; I asked him where he was to go; he said he went any where; I turned back to Mr. Stacey, and said, he will not tell me where he is going to; Mr. Scott said again, I'll go any where; Mr. Stacey told us to carry him to his lodgings; we were going along; he knocked at the glass, and said, stop here, till I see who is here; then he went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170031"></xptr> into Mr. Gold's bagnio, and was there about a quarter of an hour; then a waiter came to the door, and asked my partner if he was paid: he said, no; the waiter wanted us to get our money; I went in, and asked Mr. Scott for my money; he said he had paid me; I said, I never saw a farthing of your money; he gave me a shilling. I went out, and in at the Red Lion, and had a pint of beer; before I had drank it, my partner called me; Mr. Scott was in the chair again; I asked him where he was to go to; he said, to Malby's bagnio; we carried him there; I rang at the bell; he went in for about eight or ten minutes; the waiter said, they would not take him in; so he came out again, and went into the chair. I asked him where I was to carry him then; he said, carry me to a girl's lodging in Charles-street; we carried him there, and rang the bell; he came out of the chair, and went into the passage: a girl came and said, her mistress was not at home; he broke one of my glasses when he came out; he then asked me if I knew of any girls; I said, no; he walked away; I asked him to pay me; he said he would not; I walked after him, and pulled off my hat; he said he would give me something to drink; this was in Russel-street, at the end of a court; there were four or five girls; I asked him again to pay me, and said, I wanted to go; I said, there is never a public-house here; we went into a public-house in King's-court; the first bowl that came he spilt; then he called for another shilling's worth; he paid for them, and came out with us. I asked him to have the chair to go to Mr. Stacey's house again, or go home to his lodgings; he said, no, I will not; go along, you are paid. I asked him again; he said, go about your business; I came away, and put my chair to rights, and carried a fare from the play to the Cave bagnio; then my partner and I went in at the Red Lion, and staid till between eleven and twelve o'clock; then we went out, and my partner, in examining the chair, found this handkerchief in it, and he put it in his pocket.</p>

            . I was called to the Round-house that night this happened; there was Mr. Scott, he was in liquor; the watchmen all took my number; I am a chairman; they said he had been robbed; I was desired to carry him safe to Mr. Couts's, a banker, in Half-moon-street, in the Strand; going down that way, he said, he was only a lodger, that was not his house, and desired I would carry him to Charles-street, where a woman of the town lodged; I told him, he had better go home, and said, the constable of the desired me to carry him safe home; he said, he would not go home upon no account, and insisted on my carrying him to Charles-street; I carried him there, and asked for a woman; I cannot recollect her name now, but the woman that came to the door said she was not at home; well then, said he, carry me to Malby's. I said, Sir, you are in liquor, you had better go home; I carried him to one or two places more; they would not take him in; then I said, I will carry you back to the Round-house again; accordingly I did; then the constable desired me to carry him to Mr. Couts's, the banker; I carried him there, and knocked at the door; the man came, and desired him to give his name; he said his name was Scott; he opened the door. O Lord! said he, I have lost my hat, my watch, my money, I have lost every thing I had; the man came and took the number of my chair; I went away; the next morning I went, and sent word up, I was come to be paid; said Mr. Scott, where is my hat, watch, and money; Sir, said I, I know nothing about any thing belonging to you; said he, are you the man that took me up at the Bedford Arms last night, between nine and ten o'clock. No, said I; he detained me about two hours; I desired him to go with me to the Round-house, there was no body there; then I took him to one of the constables of the night, and he made him sensible that I was called to him about a quarter before twelve at night, at the Round-house; he asked the constable how he came to be there, and the constable told him.</p>

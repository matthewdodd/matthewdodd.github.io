I am single, and am servant to John Weir, a cook, of 66, St. John Street Road, Clerkenwell—we let lodgings—Jackson and Jacobs came in March and occupied one room until they were taken in custody—the other prisoners came and visited them—Harris came the afternoon of the Sunday they were taken—I did not see Sykes—I was present when the arrest took place—I had plenty of time to see Sykes so as to recognise him again—the Jacobs are furriers—on the evening of the arrest the four prisoners came in a little before 11 o'clock, with a lot of luggage—I said to them "What a lot of luggage you have got"—they said "Yes, we have been going to meet our country cousins, and they are going to sleep here to-night"—Jacobs has a brother who is not in custody—they all went towards the kitchen—I said something to his brother, and he went out—I went to shut the door and was stopped by a policeman, and the four were taken in custody.</p>

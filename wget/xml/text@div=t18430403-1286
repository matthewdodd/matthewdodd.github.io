                  </hi>. I live at Mr. Stuarts', at Ratcliffe. On the 17th of March the prisoner came about seven in the evening—I recognised him—he had been with two females the week before, and passed a bad shilling—on the 17th he called for a pint of beer and threw down a shilling—I showed it to my aunt and uncle—it was bad—I kept it in my own band, and went to where the prisoner was, and shut the street door—I told him he had passed a bad shilling, and he was in company with two females before, and had passed one—he said if I would say that, I would swear a man's life away—he said he had more money to pay for it, or if I would let him go any dis<lb></lb>tance he could get some—a constable was fetched, and then he said, "I have done wrong, and I expect to suffer for it."</p>

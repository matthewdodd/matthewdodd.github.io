                  </hi>. I am the wife of Andrew Olson, a sailor, and live in Dunitan's-place, Ratcliffe. I was at Mrs. Jackson's, in Dunstan's-place, on Monday, the 2nd of October—she had been confined on the Saturday before, and the prisoner's mother attended her as nurse—at six o'clock on Monday night I saw a child's bed-gown hanging by the fire-place, and at eight o'clock the prisoner's mother came to me, and said her daughter was in Mrs. Jackson's room, in a fit—I went in, and she was in liquor—I went to undress the infant, and could not find the bed-gown—at twelve o'clock the same night I saw the prisoner sitting on the step "of No. 15, in liquor—I asked what she had done with the bed-gown—she said I was a stink<lb></lb>ing liar, the had not seen it, and I gave her in charge—Mr. Jackson's name is Joseph.</p>

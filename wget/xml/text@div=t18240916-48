            . I am a gun maker, and live in St. George's-place. On the 1st of August, a few minutes after twelve o'clock at night, I was returning home over the <placeName id="t18240916-48-crimeloc256">Chelsea Water Works bridge</placeName>

               <p>"Leave go my hand." I hallooed to know if any thing was the matter, and received no answer, but almost directly heard something smash in the water. I called the watchman; we proceeded to the spot, and found the prisoner leaning on the wall near the bridge; he said his wife was in the water, or words to that effect; we and some other persons searched in the water with a lantern, but not finding the body, we went with the prisoner to the watch-house; he was thirty or forty yards from where I was, when I heard the words which appeared to come from that place. I got up to him within a minute and a half or two minutes; he was leaning on the wall looking down to the water; it was too dark for him to endeavour to get her out; he appeared distressed, and was in liquor; he was secured directly. The woman spoke very loud, but not as if she was in distress or a passion. I heard it more than once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is this bridge - A. At the end of the Pimlico-road, over a creek. The wall is not part of the bridge, no body has any business there; a fence prevents people getting there. I hallooed to know if any thing was the matter; she gave no answer. There was quite sufficient time for her to answer before I heard the fall in the water.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in St. George's-row, and heard a man hallooing very loud as if he wanted assistance. I sprung my rattle, and ran across the bridge, and found the prisoner and Marshall there. I asked what was the matter; the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"My wife is here, and she is drowned." I got on the wall and looked down the cut, but could hardly see the water. I could neither see the body or the water moving. I desired a stranger to lay hold of the prisoner. Cousins came up and took him. He said,</p>
               <p>"There is my wife, she is drowned." He was sitting on the wall with his face towards the water; he seemed concerned, for he hallooed very much before I came to his assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had not hallooed you would not have gone there - A. Yes,</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Flask-lane. On the last day of July, I was drinking with the prisoner and his wife, at the King's Head public-house, at the foot of Chelsea water-works bridge, from half-past nine to eleven o'clock; while drinking he sung a song, all but the last verse, and that his wife sung, he seemed angry at that, and just tapped her over the cheek with the back of his hand, but did not hurt her, or seem in anger afterwards; we sat drinking till a quarter to twelve, when Rope came by, Marks asked him to go in and have half a pint of gin, and at last persuaded him to go in; his wife went in with them, but I went home. He is a labouring man, and lives at Westminster. He told me that he had a barge load of stones to look after in the cut, to see that no other barge ran against it, and knocked the stones into the water.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose service are you and the prisoner in. - A. My father, who works under Messrs. Johnson and Bruce; the bridge was in his way to the barge; he must get over the fence to get to it, and could go home that way; he is a good natured man.</p>

            . I live in St. George's row. About a quarter to 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and his wife with Painter at the public-house door; they asked me to drink, which I refused three or four times; but he and his wife with a sort of push got me into the house, and called for half a pint of gin; we staid there a quarter of an hour; there was no words between them. I parted with them at the foot of the bridge, and saw them got about ten yards up the bridge; he shook hands with me, and waited for her while she did so; she then went after him and threw her arms round his neck; I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Catch hold of my hand," but saw nothing more; as I went home. He was employed at Mr. Johnson's; works under Painter, who employs barges; he told me he should be out all night; I saw the body before the inquest; it was his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Every thing was kind and affectionate between them. - A. Quite so - she offered to pay for the gin; he said</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live at Bridge-wharf, Pimlico. On the night in question I was awoke between eleven and twelve o'clock, by a man calling out that his wife had fallen overboard; he seemed in great distress and anxiety. I went to my window, and saw several watchmen there - one of them expressed a disbelief of her being there, but the prisoner declared she had fallen in, and pointed out the place, and expressed a desire to get her out, or that they should get somebody to get her out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He expressed great anxiety to be allowed to assist in recovering her - A. Particularly so.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Elizabeth-street about half-past twelve o'clock, and heard a dreadful shrieking and crying - I could not discern what it was, and while I was listening a rattle sprung - I immediately ran to the spot, and saw the prisoner in custody; I held my lantern over the wall, but could see nothing moving; I asked the prisoner if it was his wife; he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, she is gone, she is drowned;" he repeated that several times. I found the body about a quarter to four o'clock in the morning, in the creek, close under the wall, near the spot. I think there might be about five feet of water at the time of the alarm; when I took her out, she was covered with mud - there was so much mud the body would not be likely to rise at all; there is always water there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he seem distressed and anxious to search for her - A. He was in the hands of a stranger and appeared in liquor.</p>
               <p>JURY to ROPE. Q. How high is this wall - A. From the foundation to the top it is eighteen feet; it is about eighteen inches or two feet from the ground, on the land side.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that he desired his wife when they crossed the bridge, to go on and he would meet her, when he had looked after his barge, but she said he had no barge to look after, and caught hold of his hand, that he got from her, and soon after heard her scream out, and a plunge in the water; that he called out, and somebody caught hold of him, and would not let him look for her, saying that he would be drowned.</p>

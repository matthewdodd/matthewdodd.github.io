                  </hi>. I am an oilman, in partnership with Thomas Hopkins, at 20, Greek-street—the prisoner was our porter. On 14th May I spoke to a constable about him—he left that afternoon as usual to his tea, about five o'clock—I and the constable followed him to his lodgings 4, Regent's-place—I asked him what he had done with the oil he had taken from the shop—he pointed to a jug behind him, with two pint cans draining into it, and said, "There it is"—I found a quart there, sufficient to fill the two cans—on turning up the bedstead we found a large quantity of colour called litharge, and Brunswick green, in five or six bags, and a small quantity of Prussian blue; also an empty quart can, with our name and address on it—he denied some of the things being ours—I said, "You had better say the colours are not ours;" and he said, "No, I can't say that; they are yours."</p>

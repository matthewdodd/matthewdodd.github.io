             sworn. - On the 27th of September, about half past seven in the evening, I saw the prisoner at the bar come to the stall of Mrs. Townsend, and take a basket; he carried it about forty yards, and gave it to two little boys that I had before observed with him; the manner in which he took them, for he ran smartly with them before him, gave me a suspicion; I went to inform Mrs. Townsend of it, and then I went after the prisoner and laid hold of him, the little boy that had the pears, threw the basket down and ran away; I am certain the prisoner is the person that took the basket; and I am certain he is the person that gave it to the little boy; I had seen him before; Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290017"></xptr>Townsend was there, but she was standing sideways, sorting over some damsons.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Beville. Q. Was it dark or light? - A. It was dark, there were lamps lighted.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - A. Not distinctly, I saw his back.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you had not at all lost sight of him? - A. I cannot positively say whether I had or not, but I should rather think I had not, than that I had.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was he from you at the time you went after him? - A. About 60 or 70 yards; and he was near 200 yards from Mrs. Townsend's when I took him.</p>

               <p>Q. But you did not see his face at all? - A. Yes. I saw his face before he went to Mrs. Townsend's premises, and I saw his face when he was carrying the pears to the little boys.</p>

             sworn. - I am a widow; when Mr.Gregory came up to me, I missed a basket of pears from just within the shed.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not sold the basket of pears to any body? - A. No; this is the basket that Mr.Gregory brought back, I know it to be the basket that was taken from me.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18001029-21-verdict124" type="verdictDescription">

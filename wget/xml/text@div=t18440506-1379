                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, New Montague-street, Spitalfields, and am the wife of Samuel Palmer—we lodge in the top part of the house, which is let out in tenements—it is the house of Thomason, who lives a few doors off—he has no servants in the house—there are four floors, and each floor had a sepa<lb></lb>rate lodger—on the 4th of April, at two o'clock in the morning, I was awake and smelt a very strong smell of burning—I got up, looked about, and every thing was safe in my apartment, and I retired to rest—I got up about seven, went down with my daughter, and saw a fire had been kindled in the passage under the bottom stair—a piece was burnt out of the floor about as large as my hand—there was several pieces of burnt wood on the spot where the floor was burnt—there were four or six matches which had been lighted on the stairs just over the burnt place—I showed them to Sparks the con<lb></lb>stable—the street door was not locked at night—the lodgers had doors to their rooms—the prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 4th of April, about eight o'clock, I was sweeping my shop, and saw several pieces of lucifer matches on the bottom stair—I saw a hole under the bottom stair, very black with fire—I put my hand in, and took out se<lb></lb>veral pieces of burnt wood—I sent for the landlord—the outer door used to be left on the latch at night, as the lodgers came in late—I told Sparks, the policeman, of this at night, and next morning, about two o'clock, he knocked me up—he had hold of the prisoner, who was on the second stair—he searched the prisoner, and found about twenty two pieces of kindling wood on him—they had been lighted at one end; also a box of lucifer matches, a candle, pow<lb></lb>dered resin, a box of paints, and a tobacco pipe without the bowl.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in this house. I know the prisoner by his coming to work for me about three days, six or eight months ago, as a silk weaver—he did not do the work to my satisfaction—I said if he did not do it better I should be under the necessity of turning him off—next day, when I came home, I found he had left—I did not discharge him—he came a day or two after to settle with me—I said I could not settle with him till the work was finished, as it was satin—I could not drive it off—he seemed satisfied—he came in about three weeks when it was finished, and I settled with him—he came again four or five weeks after that with my son, and sat down for half an hour, then bid me good night and went home—nothing passed between us about wages—when I settled with him he thought he was entitled to more, which I gave him—he then seemed satisfied—I did not see him again till he was apprehended.</p>

               <p>and trembled—I asked what he was doing there—he made no answer—I asked him a second time—he replied he had come to sleep there, as he had been helping there formerly, and in consequence of being out late at his work he would not get in—I knocked at Mrs. Pinnock's room door—she let us in—I searched the prisoner, and found some fire-wood, a box of matches, the shank of a pipe, some white resin ground, a penny candle, a knife, a brad-awl, and box of paint—he gave his address, No. 3, Oakley-street, Bethnal-green—I went there, but could hear nothing of him.</p>

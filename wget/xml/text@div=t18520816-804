                  </hi>. I am a turner, and live in Bartholomew-close. The prisoner has been my errand-boy about eighteen months—in consequence of something that had happened, I left five marked shillings on a window stool on 11th Aug.—I watched the prisoner—I saw him come in the room; he had to go to a sink we have in the back parlour, to draw a pail of water—he looked round, and saw the five shillings by the side of the cash-box—he set the water running—he then looked in the front shop—he then made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi>, and took part of the money—he went and turned the water off, and made a second catch at it—he then went and drew about a pint of water and made another snatch at the money—I could not see what he took each time—he then took the pail away, and closed the door—I went to the spot, and the money was all gone—I went and spoke to the policeman—the prisoner did what he had to do, and went out to go borne for the night—the policeman took him, and found on him the five shillings, and my watch which I had missed about a week before—this is it—I had named it in the shop.</p>

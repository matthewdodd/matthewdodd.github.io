            . I lived in the Old Bailey a great many years; I have left off business about four years; I live now at Whetstone. Bilby came to live with me about 1761 or 1762, in the Old Bailey.</p>

               <p>Bishop. A coach-master; I kept a great number of coaches; he was with me pretty near five years; his character was very good; then he went to a gentleman and lived with him till he died; from thence he went to live with Dr. Wilson.</p>

               <p>Bishop. Yes, I believe so; when he was out of place he came and staid with me seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago?</p>
               <p>Bishop. About a year after he was gone from me; Mr. and Mrs. Parr, with whom I was pretty intimate, asked me his character; I gave him a good character; I said he was an idle boy without looking after, but honest and sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you give him a good character or a bad character; what is his general character?</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Bowater, a tailor, of Hanover Street, who employs a large number of men—the prisoner Jelly was in his employment for about three years until the strike took place, which was, I think, seven weeks ago last Monday—Hall was in Mr. Bowater's employ three weeks or a month previous to the same date—they both left at the same time—since the strike I have frequently seen them in Hanover Street speaking together, numbers assembled there conversing with each other, and as we were taking the work in connection with other members of the establishment, we were followed by them and a number of others—when people came away from the establishment they were followed in a very strict manner by these men, who have been <hi rend="italic">picketing us;</hi> they are very clever in following—on the Friday, about eleven o'clock, Mrs. Rattenbury, the wife of John Rattenbury, an engineer, of Middleton Buildings, was working for Mr. Bowater as a tailoress—I have been to her lodgings several times, followed by other people not in custody, who I have seen working on the board with the defendants as fellow-workmen, and who I have frequently seen with them watching the premises in Hanover Street—on Tuesday, 7th May, I went to Mr. Rattenbury's lodgings and found the prisoners inside on the first landing—I went up and saw Mrs. Rattenbury at the door of the room where she was working—she said, "Mr. Price, am I to be pestered with these men in this manner?"—I said, "No, I shall go for a policeman"—I hastened down, but could not find one—the prisoners were speaking to Mrs. Rattenbury, discussing the points, and she was very agitated—on my going down for a policeman they left her very quickly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Rattenbury, an en<lb></lb>gineer, and have worked as a tailoress for ten years, but only three months for Mr. Bowater—I also worked for other houses in the trade; that is my only mode of gaining a livelihood; my husband has not earned anything for seven months, and is not able to work now, and I have two children—on 1st May I was working for Mr. Bowater—I was aware that there had been a strike—I was still willing to work for him—I had work on my premises on 1st May—on that day Jelly and three others came to my street door—I did not know him before—I answered the door, and Jelly said, "There is a tailor living in the house"—I said, "No, there is a tailoress, and that is me"—he said, "We have watched you home from Mr. Bowater's with a bundle"—I said, "Yes"—he asked me if it was a coat I had brought away—I told him no—he said, did not I think it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100079"></xptr>
               <p>would be better to give up the work until this affair was over?—I told him, no; that I could not live without money—he said, "We do not wish you to live without money; if you will come to Willis's Rooms, in Brewer Street, to-night at eight o'clock and sign your name, we will give you 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week"—(I can earn 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. sometimes by my own hand labour)—I told him I would think about it—on the following Monday Jelly and three others came again—I cannot say whether they were ail the same, but two were the same—Jelly said that my husband must not think they were going to let me do as I liked, and work for who I liked; they would see about that, and if I did insist on working for Mr. Bowater, they would mark me—my husband told me that if they threatened me or and one he would lock them up—I went down stairs and shut the door—I was afraid they would hit my husband, who was in a bad state of health, therefore I pulled him in and shut the door—he is almost in the last stage of consumption—after the door was shut, some of them said that if they knew the room' I lived in they would break the windows—they also called me a b—sh—next day the prisoners came, they were alone; when they came to my room door, which is on the first floor, I opened the door and asked them what they wanted again—Jelly said that he had come again to persuade me to give up the work—I told him I should not, as I had my husband and two children to keep—he said he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week if I would join the Union, and Mr. Hall argued with me as to the benefit of the strike, and wished me to give up the work and join them—I said, "No, I will not," and that I was satisfied with the payment I got—they said that Mr. Bowater had betrayed them, and he would betray me and if I still kept on with the work the consequence would recoil on my own head—Hall said that—Mr. Price, our foreman, then came in—he went for a policeman and they left—my work was ready to take home, but I did not take it home that morning—it was my custom to take it home when it was finished—I am paid weekly, but I should have had other work given me if I had taken that home—I did not take it home, because after their threatening manner, and saying that they would mark me, I was afraid that some of them would strike me—I was not afraid that the prisoners, when they were speaking to me, would do me any injury, because they were not so noisy, but I was afraid that some one or the prisoners might strike me if I went into the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did they point out to you that if the masters per<lb></lb>sisted, all the workmen would be at their mercy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that the consequence would fall upon me—they said that on Monday—they were most abusive on Monday—that was not said to me; it was said outside the door—I did not know the prisoners before—they were arguing with my husband, not in a very peaceable manner, to a man who is nearly dead—they did not threaten him—they threatened me by saying they would mark me, and I am afraid to go out at night for fear they should hit me, they are quite cowardly enough, when four come to abuse a poor woman—I cannot say who it was that used the indecent language—what they said they might have said in a more peaceable manner—they told me they had been willing to submit the matter to arbitration, but the masters would not—they did not tell me that Vice-Chancellor Malins had offered to be the arbitrator.</p>

               <p>me if we were going to leave off work—I told them no, and that it was no good coming any more, for my wife did not intend giving up the work, and then, in an insulting tone, he said, "Do you think we are going to allow your wife to do as you like?" and another said, "I will mark you and your wife, and the house, too, every time I come by there"—my wife came and shut the door, and then they called us b—sh—s, and said they would break the windows—my wife had finished her work that evening, but was afraid to take it home.</p>

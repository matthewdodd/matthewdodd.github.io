                  </hi> I am the wife of Andrew Robinson Wilkes. On 21st Dec. I lived at 5, Norman's-buildings, St. George's-in-the-East—I now live at 21, Lower Chapman-street—on 20th Jan. I went to bed about eleven o'clock—there are two rooms in the house, one up and one down stairs—I slept up stairs—the house was all fastened, the door locked, and the window in the lower room shut when I went to bed—after I had been in bed some time I heard a rumbling noise, and my room door pushed open—I sat up in bed, looked on the stairs, and saw the prisoner standing on the stairs opposite to me—there was a gas-light in the court, and my candle, which was on the floor by the side of the bed, was just going out, but it gave a little light—he immediately rushed on the bed—I said, "George, do not murder me"—I felt a cut about my neck, and then a continual weight that kept me down, and a stabbing, mostly in my arms—he kept on for three or four minutes—I did not struggle, I had no power—after a little time I rallied and sat up in bed, and saw him go down stairs—I got up and pulled the bedstead against the door, for fear he should come up again, and then I opened the window and called out "Murder!" and "Police!"—the light went out just as I got out of bed—a neighbour named Sadler came, and I told him to send my son—my son answered me and came in at the lower window—a person from the outside could pull down the window and get into the room—I had been the prisoner the morning before, between nine and ten—he came to see about my daughter—I knew very well they were acquainted—he had called several times before that about my daughter, and I told him I did not know where she was—he called again between eleven and twelve—I said my daughter was not there, and I knew nothing about her—I had sent her out of the way—I told him not to come tormenting me, I had trouble enough—he went away, and as he went from the door he said, "You may tell her to say her prayers, for when I meet with her I will murder her," or "kill her," or something similar to that—he had said before that my daughter had got his address—I asked him if that was not the case—he said, "Yes'—I said, "Then she had better write to you without your coming <hi rend="italic">magging</hi> me"—I said it was somewhere in the Hackney-road, and he said, "Yes, that was the address"—my husband's name is Andrew Robinson Wilkes.</p>

                  </hi> When this occurred I lived in Norman's-buildings. On the morning of 21st Jan., shortly after on o'clock, I heard cries of "Murder!"—I paid little attention, thinking they proceeded from the house of a quarrelsome neighbour—the cries continued, and I opened the window—I ultimately went to my mother's house—the lower room window was open, the street-door was fastened—I entered at the window, and when I was in the lower room I heard my mother calling from above that George had been there and murdered her—I went up, the bedstead or something was placed against the door—I forced it and it and entered the room—it was dark, and I could not see my mother—I let a policeman in, and by his light discovered that my mother was bleeding—her clothes, the bedclothes, and floor were very bloody—I have seen the prisoner once or twice before—I knew there was some acquaintance between my sister and him, by the name of George—I did not know him by any other name—I fetched Dr. Broadwater.</p>

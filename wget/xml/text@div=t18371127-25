                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Tindals-buildings, Gray's Inn-lane. The prisoner lodged in a furnished room of mine for nine months, with a man who passed as her husband—his name is Barrett—I missed these articles from her room—they both took the room together—he said at Hatton Garden that he was not her husband, and she said they were not married—when I missed the articles, the prisoner said she could not give them to me—I had her taken, and she gave up the tickets at the office—she owes me 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. rent, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you give me leave, when short of money, to pawn articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—she never asked my leave, nor ever told me she had pawned them—she never pawned them before, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. King, a pawnbroker, in High Holborn. I produce two blankets and a sheet, one pawned on the 31st of August, and the other on the 23rd of October—the one on the 23rd of Oc<lb></lb>tober was pawned by the prisoner—I do not know who pawned the other, it is so long ago—the duplicates produced correspond with the articles, and are all in my handwriting.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The woman who lodged in the house pawned them with her own clothes, I sent her with them—the prosecutrix gave me a severe beating, and tore the clothes off my back, because I did not pay my rent.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She knew they were in pledge, the very first article which was pawned four months ago—it is all spite, because I have not paid the rent. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I went up to her room for the week's rent, and there was nothing on the bed but an old rag—I asked where the bed-clothes were?—she said she had them in pawn—I said, "How came you to pawn them <hi rend="italic">?</hi>—she said she did it from distress—the man was always in work, but they were so fond of drink, and the witness who is coming is one of the party.</p>

                  </hi>. I rent a room of the prosecutrix. She happened to come into my room one day and said to the prisoner, "Mrs. Barrett, if you are in distress, take and pawn the blanket off your bed, and you will feel it more than I shall"—to the best of my opinion, that was two or three months ago—I</p>

               <p>cannot tell whether it was hot or cold weather at the time—I did not keep that in my memory, but I heard her make mention of those words—the prisoner was crying in my room about her distress, and Mrs. Corcoran said, "I cannot relieve you, but if you think proper to. pawn the blanket on your bed you may."</p>

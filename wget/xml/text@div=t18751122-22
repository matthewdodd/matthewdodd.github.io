                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Crown and Cushion in London Wall—on 23rd October, about 10.30 a.m. I was serving in the bar; the two prisoners came in—Lee asked for two of gin cold and a glass of mild and bitter, and he tendered a sovereign in payment—I went into the bar parlour to get change, and while doing so Robinson said "I have change"—I brought the sovereign back to Lee, and waited for Robinson to pay me—he had his hands in his pockets—Lee then gave me a coin, and I gave him. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—there was 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more to give them—I kept that in my hand, but they did not wait to receive it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had given Lee back the sovereign—I saw that it was a sovereign—I got the change off a table where we used to keep the silver—I had hardly got inside the bar-parlour when Robinson called out and I went back and handed the sovereign to Lee; hardly a minute elapsed between my giving the sovereign to him and his handing some<lb></lb>thing back to me over the counter—I had never seen him before—I next saw him at the Old Bailey—I had to go to identify them there—they were in a yard marching round with others, and I picked them out at once.</p>

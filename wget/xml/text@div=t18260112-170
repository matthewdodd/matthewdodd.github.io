            . I am an emery paper maker. I was going down Princes-street about half-past five o'clock, on the 6th of January; the gas had been lighted; I saw three men near Mr. Imray's window; they crossed over to the opposite side of the way, under the gas light; when I came up to Mr. Imray's window I saw it was open - when I got near the bottom of the street I turned round to watch, and saw them all three go to the window again - they then seperated and left the prisoner Wright at the window, and the other two walked up and down on the opposite side of the way; I went to the watch-house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120063"></xptr>fetched the two night officers; we returned in about three minutes, and saw Henley, with his back towards the window; when we got near him he crossed to the opposite side of the way, under the gas light; I informed Barr, the officer, that he was one of the three I had seen, and he took him; we then went down the street, and met Almond coming in at the other end of the street, and I saw a young man waiting lower down; I informed him he was one of them, and he took him; as we were proceeding to the watch-house I crossed over, and pulled the shutters, to show them the window was open; the prisoner Wright instantly jumped out and was taken by the officer to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About half-past five o'clock; I think I could not see the prisoner's face if he was near me, except by the gas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose there had been no artificial light in the street, was there light enough for you to see the countenance of a man? A. No, I could not.</p>

               <p>COURT to JAMES IMRAY. Q. Was this window fastened? A. I think not; it was shut close down - the shutters had not been shut: my partner does not reside there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sweep. On the night of 13th June, I went to a public-house—a number of persons were there, and the prisoners—theycom-aepced by being angry as I went in, and they were going to ill-use a man, and two of them struck him—I said it was a shame for two to strike one man—lie moment I said that, I was knocked down and kicked about the face by the two prisoners and many others—I got up, and made a blow at Keefe, but the moment I struck him I was knocked down—there were so many of them, I could not tell by whom—I came out—there were a great many outside, and before I could get my foot outside, they took me by the collar, dragged me out, threw me down, and struck me, and Keefe hit me on the head with a large stone—it produced blood—I was not sensible—I was carried to the Hospital—Welch was in the mob with Keefe when I had this blow.</p>

I saw Ward coming out of the Globe—the prisoners and two other men rushed at him—I went immediately to his assistance, and pulled both the prisoners off—they were then on him, and kicking him—the prisoners were rescued from me—some of the mob had hold of my arms, and I saw Keefe take this stone (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his jacket-pocket, and throw it at Ward, who immediately fell—Welch was amongst the mob, standing close by Keefe's side—the moment Keefe threw the stone, he and Welch ran away—Ward laid for twenty minutes in the road, before we knew whether he was dead or alive.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Princes-yard.

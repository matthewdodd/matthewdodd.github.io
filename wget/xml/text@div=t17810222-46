             came to my house and said he had been robbed; in consequence of that I found the person he represented had robbed him, which is the prisoner. I found her at the Castle in Swallow-street; she made to the door to go off as soon as I entered the house; Keeling was with me. I brought her back into the tap-room; she attempted to secrete a nutmeg grater which she took out of her pocket. In trying to get it out of her hand it came open, and some guineas fell about the room; nine guineas were picked up. I searched her pocket and took out two half crown pieces, then I brought her to a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did Keeling charge the prisoner with any thing? - Yes; he charged her to her face with robbing him; he said he had lost fifty guineas but he did not believe this woman had them all. She denied the charge, and said she had had ten guineas from Mr. Balfour, a publican, in Clarges-street, May-Fair.</p>

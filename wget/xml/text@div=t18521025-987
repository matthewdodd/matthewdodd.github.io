                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Stedman, 3, Regis-street, Edinburgh, a rope maker. I have a sister named Isabella Graham—she left Scotland about three years ago, and returned in June, 1851—she lived at my house where I then lived—the prisoner used to visit her at my house—he paid his addresses to her—on 25th Aug. of that year I was present at their marriage, in my house, at Edinburgh—they were married by the Rev. William Reid, minister of the United Presbyterian congregation, in the Lothian-road—I knew him before, and used to attend at his church—I was present at the marriage—I did not sign anything—I saw the marriage lines signed—I saw a paper signed—it was a regular marriage.</p>

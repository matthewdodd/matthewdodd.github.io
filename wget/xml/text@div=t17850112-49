               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you will be pleased to attend for a very few minutes, while I state to you the nature of this offence which is imputed to the prisoner at the bar, and which it is now your duty to try: you must be well satisfied, from the indictment, that this is a case well worthy of your serious attention; because, on the one hand, the interests of a commercial country are at stake, and on the other, the life of the prisoner. Gentlemen, it was some years ago found necessary, in order to protect the mercantile part of the country, to make it a capital offence to steal from the Post-office any letter or pacquet which came there by the post; the offence with which the prisoner stands charged, is that of having stolen a letter, and which letter happened to contain in it a share of a lottery ticket, which was the principal medium whereby this letter was traced. It will be proved to you, that on the 8th of March last, a Mr.

Gentlemen, the number of the ticket was 28152, of the lottery for the year 1783, subscribed by Hazard, Burne and Co. of the Royal Exchange, importing that the bearer should be intitled to such a share of that ticket, as should belong thereto. Mr. Child having occasion, as I have mentioned, to transmit those parts of the ticket to Mr. Holmer, in London, he wrote a letter, and gave it to

Mr. Child not having received any answer from his correspondents, and conceiving this to be a matter of some consequence, furnished them with a description of what was contained in the letter; the consequence was, they went to the lottery-office of Messrs. Hazard and Co. apprehending that perhaps this lottery ticket might be the means of tracing this matter, and they there found, that the half ticket had been paid, but the quarter had not. Gentlemen, on the 29th of November last, this quarter of a ticket was presented to Hazard and Co. and a claim made for it, it having been drawn a prize of twenty pounds; Hazard and Co. having before been cautioned, demurred against the payment, and desired the person who brought it, who will turn out afterwards, if my instructions are right, to be the prisoner at the bar, to come the next day: he went away complaining, as is usual, that they did not pay him his money, but on the next day he did not come back. In the course of their conversation with him, they asked him his name; his answer was, that his name was Clark, and he said he had received it of a person of the name of

The manner in which this sort of fraud is usually committed is this; at the Post-office there are fourteen or fifteen departments, subordinate to which there are fifteen different letter-carriers; mistakes being often<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120059"></xptr> made in sorting the letters, the letter-carriers go again to the resorting, and that makes them so accurate as they are, you will easily suppose that a man very seldom or never secrets a letter within his own walk, because the suspicion would fall on himself, but letters pass through his hands which are not in his department, and which he ought to lay aside: in this situation the letters are, and you will see how easy it is for a man to get possession of a triple letter, which catches the eye, and particularly the eye of a man accustomed to those sort of letters: Gentlemen, you will see how these circumstances occur, you will understand that this letter was not in the prisoner's walk. These are the outlines of the proof that we have to lay before you, if they are satisfactory, and prove to your minds, that the prisoner is the person that took this letter, you will do the public justice on the one hand, and find him guilty of this offence: but most certainly, on the other hand, it is infinitely better that the public should suffer in ten thousand instances, rather than any individual should suffer in one instance, which is not fairly and justly proved upon him.</p>

               <p>My maiden name was Sterry, I am assistant to the post-master of Neath, I perfectly well remember receiving a letter from that young woman on the 8th of March, I put it into the box at the hour of one, and sent it off, there is a letter bill, and the letter was charged, but I cannot recollect what it was charged; this is my writing, that letter bill accompanies all the letters in the London bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is the postage of a single letter from Neath to London? - It was then four pence.</p>
               <p>It does not appear from your letter bill, how many double, how many treble, and how many single? - No.</p>
               <p>It cannot be traced? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you been long in the department of the assistant of the post-master? - Some years; we frequently make mistakes, we put some double that ought to be treble, and some treble that ought to be double.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to state that as a matter clearly within your recollection, that on the 8th of March you received a letter from this young woman? - Yes, I received two, one for London, and the other for Cornwall.</p>
               <p>How many letters do you think you might have received in the course of that week from different persons? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>In the course of a month? - A great many; that was on a Monday the 8th of March.</p>
               <p>Did you receive a letter from her on the Wednesday? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you or not? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Did you receive a letter from her on the Friday preceding it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Any other day in the course of that week? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>But these two letters you recollect; do you recollect no other letters on other days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is there so singular in this, Mrs. Gibbon, that should induce you to remember her? - I very seldom take the letters at the door, because I very seldom go to the door, I happened that day to take the letters from this girl, and Mr. Child came soon after, and asked me if I remembered it.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>I am in the inland office, I was there when the bag from Neath arrived after the 8th of March; on the 11th, I cannot tell the exact time I opened the Neath bag, it came sealed and tied, according to the common course of business; the letters it contained were answerable to the bill, this bill was in the bag, which is called the letter bill.</p>
               <p>Did the letters correspond with that bill? - They did, the number of letters corresponded, and the charge was proper, to the best of my judgment, or I should have made a memorandum on the bill; these letters are put down by the side of me, and a messenger takes them to the stamper, and they are taken and sorted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I dare say you, like others, sometimes make a mistake? - I may, probably, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Does not it happen to you sometimes to mischarge letters? - If I make a mistake it is probably in over-charging.</p>
               <p>But we who receive letters can tell you it happens the other way, they are not always over-charged; is not it a practice in the office to have something like a rivalship in charging letters? - There are such things done.</p>
               <p>That proves to a demonstration, that now and then there are mistakes made? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>After you have looked over the letters, they are taken away by some other person? - Yes, by the messengers or stampers.</p>
               <p>How many persons have access to them, and may, if they choose it, look at them? - We are all publickly at the table.</p>
               <p>So that several persons, if they choose it, may resort to the letters as they lay on the table? - It is very uncommon.</p>
               <p>Then they may secret a letter? - I do not think they could.</p>
               <p>You mean not unobserved? - I think it is impossible.</p>
               <p>How many persons are there who might, without suspicion, come and stand there? - It is very uncustomary for people to stand together at the Post-office, they are never suffered to do that, the Comptroller never suffers three or four to stand together.</p>
               <p>No, but he suffers any number to come by turns to the place where you sit? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120063"></xptr> They may come and speak to me no doubt.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - Ever since I have been in the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Was he on the 11th of March employed in the Post-office? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character? - I always heard he bore a good character.</p>

               <p>Where do you live? - In Alhallows-lane, Thames-street.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - About five years.</p>
               <p>Where did you live in the Borough? - High-street.</p>
               <p>Did you receive from Mr. Child any letter in March last, containing two shares of lottery tickets? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards receive an account of such a letter having been sent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you do any thing in consequence of that? - I went directly to Mr. Hazard's, and told them the number, and stopped payment; I am not sure whether I went myself or sent my clerk, but one of them was not paid, one was; I went to Mr. Hazard's about the first of April.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Mr. Child is a correspondent of your's, I think? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have frequently received letters from him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they always directed to your house in Thames-street? - No.</p>
               <p>They have been directed in various ways? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know your letter-carrier that brings letters to your house? - I believe he is in court; there have been several in that distance of time.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner? - Never but once, that was at the publick office.</p>
               <p>Who takes in letters for you at your house? - They are brought into the compting-house, my clerk takes them in, but never opens them without my order; I have a partner now, I had not then.</p>
               <p>Your house was a firm? - It was Holmer and Co. I had a partner in the Borough.</p>
               <p>They did not direct to your house in Thames-street, to Holmer and Co.? - Many people did; I had no partner at that time.</p>

               <p>Have the different letter-carriers access to the rooms? - They are constantly coming in to the inland office to receive such letters as are sorted to the different seats.</p>
               <p>Describe the process that is used in sorting the letters? - The letters for this town are divided into fifteen divisions, the gentlemen who are appointed sorters, sort the letters to each of these divisions, and to the best of their judgment they sort the letters to the particular walks that appertain to those seats, but it frequently happens, either<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120064"></xptr> through want of knowledge of the street, or knowledge of the business, that they sort a letter that should be for one street into the other, and when that is done, it of course goes in common with other letters to the letter-carrier's office, there they find the mistake, and they are subdivided again to their different quarters, and if there are any mis-sorted letters, they rectify the mistake among themselves, and deliver it over to the letter-carrier who should have care of that letter; the prisoner was in the Post-office, he was one of the letter-carriers at what we call Murrell's seat, and had the charge of course to sort the letters, when they get into the letter-carriers office, for the different divisions of letters in that seat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. I think you say, Sir, sometimes the letters are sorted wrong? - Very frequently.</p>
               <p>You cannot say that it would have fallen to this man's lot to sort this letter and send it to Thames-street? - It is impossible for me to say that it fell into this man's hands, in the nature of things it may have come into this man's hands.</p>
               <p>How many letter-carriers are there? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You have known this man some time? - Ever since he has been in the office, thirteen or fourteen years, and till this unhappy affair happened, he had an exceeding good character, and I had always esteemed him as a very honest, upright man.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing that happened after this transaction, that the prisoner was superanuated? - He was, he received eleven shillings a week in consequence of an affair that happened prior to this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. At this time he had access to the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And it might come into this man's hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In common with how many more? - Sixty or seventy.</p>
               <p>To all of whom this letter might as well have come as to him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Can you say that all the letters you received from the Post-office on that day were delivered according to their directions? - If I was on duty they were, but I cannot be sure that I was upon duty; it does not happen once in several months that I am not on duty, but I cannot particularly say I was on my duty on that day, but I think I was: there is a book in which there are some figures of my making that day.</p>
               <p>What do they import? - They were charges from Murrell's seat to us, they import, that I was present at the office that day, and if so, I can say all the letters were delivered according to their directions on that day, to the best of my judgment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it appears from your entry, that on that day there were letters to the postage of eight-pence handed over from Murrell's seat to your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are five persons, these charges might have fell into the hands of these five? - They must by the regular couse of business come into my hands.</p>
               <p>You say, to the best of your judgment, you delivered all the letters that were delivered to you? - Yes.</p>

            , Southwold, Cornwall, at the time he was in the office, in my own writing: I saw the prisoner on the Friday following, he came into our office with one Mr. Wroughton, one of the letter-carriers, to clear himself, and said he had not been in our office for two years; I went over to the Post-office, and told the gentlemen of the Post-office that was the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you positive then, or did you say you believed so? - Yes, I said positively that is the man.</p>
               <p>Take great care to the answer you make to this question; are you positively sure the prisoner was the man that came to you and offered that share of a ticket to you for payment? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>How many shares was this particular ticket divided into? - One half and two quarters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been in the office? - Upwards of six years.</p>
               <p>How many persons were in the office at this time? - Upon my word I cannot tell, the office was pretty full, ten or a dozen people.</p>
               <p>All of them transacting business relative to the lottery, and most, if not all, strangers: now do you recollect the transactions about which all of them, or any of them came? - No, Sir, I cannot.</p>

               <p>Who is the person you have since advertised for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you been able to find him? - I have not, he has been advertised a very many days without success.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the person who brought the share the reason why you could not pay it? - I told him there was a stop. He might be in the office about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw no more of him from the Monday to the Friday, and then he came voluntarily to you? - He did, he told us that Mr. Wroughton knew his place of abode, and that he might be found when he was wanted; there were four or five persons belonging to the office at the time, two of them are here.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner was not apprehended till the 6th? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do not you know for three days after that Friday, he was still at large? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you fix, as precisely as you can, the time of the evening when the person you suppose to be the prisoner, came in? - It was half past five, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Have you always said so? - I have always said, between five and six.</p>
               <p>The payment of this note has been stopped upwards of eight months? - From the 1st of April, when Mr. Holmer first gave information.</p>
               <p>How many hands it might have passed through, you can as little judge as the Jury? - It is impossible.</p>

               <p>"Stolen, apply to Messrs. Holmer and Co. Steel-yard, Thames-street." He presented this share for payment, and it was stopped;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120066"></xptr> he was desired to call again on the morrow; he did not call.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him how he came by it? - No, I did not attend to that part of it, I was busy elsewhere.</p>
               <p>You know the life of the prisoner is at stake, be very certain to what you say. - I am perfectly clear with respect to his person, I saw him on the Friday, he came with Mr. Wroughton to Mr. Hazard's office, to clear himself; he said he not been in the office for two years.</p>
               <p>At that time when he came and said that, did you entertain any doubt whether he was the person that had been there on the Monday before? - Not the least, I told him at that time I was sure he was the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. How long have you been a clerk in this office? - During the drawing of the lottery.</p>
               <p>You see a great many faces then? - A great number, there were a great many in then.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - Between five and six, as near as I can recollect, it was about half an hour past five, I have always said the same.</p>
               <p>You say in your book there was a mark, stolen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When this man came in and claimed the prize this ticket was intitled to, you did not stop him nor apprehend him, although the word stolen was written opposite to that number? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor send for a constable? - No, he went away, we did nothing further in it till the prisoner voluntarily applied to the office, and said he was not the man; we told the man that brings our letters about it, and from our description he judged it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>You had no doubt when this man came to the office on Friday? - None at all with regard to his person.</p>
               <p>You had heard from Mr. Wroughton that he believed it to be Mr. Mills? - There was something said, from the description he believed he knew him.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came to the office, what passed? - I left him in the office, I did not see him after.</p>

               <p>Was it candle-light on the Monday? - Yes, it is candle-light all day with us.</p>

               <p>Did he receive the money? - No: I know he is the man, I am sure he is the man; I took particular notice of him from a circumstance, from his having a blemish on his right eye; I described him so to Mr. Wroughton, I am sure he is the same man, perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did it not occur to some of you, that it was your duty to stop this man? - I do not know, it is very difficult to stop a man we have no reason to suspect; we knew it had been stolen, I did not then suppose we had a right to stop the person; we stopped the thing; I did not see him on the Friday, nor ever since till now in Court: I will shew you the entry, it is simply, stolen; I wrote a note the next morning to Mr. Holmer, which note I have in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Why did not you give information to the Post-office of what had happened? - That same day I told several persons belonging to to the Office, that such a report had been made; the prisoner was not an officer at the Post-office at that time; I communicated it to several of the letter-carriers.</p>

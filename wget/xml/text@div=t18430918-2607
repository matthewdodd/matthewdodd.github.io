                  </hi>. I am a servant, and live in High-street, Maryle<lb></lb>bone. On the 24th of August, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I met Langley, and went with her to her room, where I saw another female, which, to the best of my belief, was Jones—she went out as we went in—we were not together above ten minutes, and about an hour after I left her I missed a silver guard-chain from my trowsers' pocket—I was then at the Green Man, in Oxford-street—I saw a policeman, took him Sack to the house, and gave Langley in charge; but not finding the chain, I did not press the charge at the station—I had her apprehended again on the Tuesday—the chain produced is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in High-street, Bloomsbury; I have known Jones as a customer about two years. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 24th of August, the prisoners came to me—I had not seen Langley before—Jones put this guard-chain into my scale, and asked me to weigh it—I said it was two ounces—she took it out and said, "Will you buy it?"—I said it was of no use to me—she said it was very cheap, and asked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and if it was day-time she could pawn it for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Is it your own?"—she said, "No, it belongs to this young woman," and Langley said it was hers—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a piece of pork to Langley for it.</p>

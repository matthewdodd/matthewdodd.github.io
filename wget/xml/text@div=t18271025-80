I took off my own ring, and seeing there were more stamps on it than on that, I took it into a jeweller's shop - she was gone then, with the money and umbrella, which I had given her, conceiving them to be half the value of the ring; she took them, but did not seem satisfied with them. I thought she might go into Petticoat-lane to sell the umbrella - I went and met her in about twenty minutes, without the umbrella; a man was walking before her - I asked what she had done with the umbrella - she called me every name she could think of; the man spoke to her in some language which I could not understand, and then told her to give me back my umbrella, but I said I wanted her; she was going to run away - I caught hold of her, and she bit a piece out of my finger; she gave me 3s. 6d., and asked me to let her go - I refused; she then gave me another shilling. Two men came up, and took her to the watch-house. She was quite a stranger to me; she said it was a lady's gold ring, and worth full 2l. I would not have parted with my money if I had not thought it was gold.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Ellwood, as wine merchants—we have carried on business in Gresham-street about fourteen years—in May, 1850, the prisoner came into our employment, as town traveller—it was his duty to pay money to Mr. Ellwood, or myself on the day he received it, or on the following morning—he travelled for us exclusively, among publicans and licensed victuallers—his salary at first was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and his expenses—if he went into a public house he would have to spend money, it is customary to take a bottle of wine afterwards with the landlord when he received an account—the expenses were paid by us; sometimes I paid him, but, generally speaking, Mr. Ellwood—I have seen Mr. Ellwood pay it—he, from time to time, demanded his expenses, and received them—there were separate books kept of the trade he did, they are here—there is a journal and ledger—he had collecting books of this kind (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for each customer, and when he received money it was his duty to enter it here, and pay it to the firm—on 2nd April last he did not pay me 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., received of James Abbott, or at any other time; nor did he pay me, on 3rd July, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Alfred Grace, or at any subsequent time; nor 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Henry Flint, on 28th Aug.—he remained in our service during 1853, and down to Aug., 1855, when he left without giving us any notice—in the middle of 1853, or thereabouts, a discovery was made of defalcations of the prisoner to the amount of 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I found that many accounts of highly respectable persons were very much over due, and asked the prisoner several times to account for their not being paid—whenever I applied to him for money, he invariably absented himself—I said to him, "You must have taken some of these moneys; but if you will go through the ledger with me, and not keep one item back, I will forgive you"—he did so, and the result was 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd de<lb></lb>ficient—that sum was treated by us as a debt owing by him—he gave us no notice when he left—we did not dismiss him—after he left, we made inquiries and discovered these three sums—in 1863 we made a fresh arrangement with the prisoner as to his salary, and paid him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month, including his expenses—I do not remember the month, but it was directly after this transaction of the 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he agreed to serve us on those terms, and to pay his own expenses.</p>

               <p>expenses book, which is here; that was also kept by the prisoner, and pur<lb></lb>ported to represent the expenses he had been put to—there was also a book kept by my partner, which the prisoner knew nothing of, nor did I know that it was in existence myself till some time ago; it was merely the profit of each transaction, not the profit and loss—there is also the order book—I am not aware of any other book applicable to this branch of our business—Mr. Ellwood kept the journal and ledger—the ledger is made up from the journal, there is no separate cash book, the cash account would appear in the book of our general business—in making the fresh arrangement with the prisoner that he was to have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month and his expenses, we considered that the expenses depended on the amount of business done, they would have relation to the work he would have to do—his carriage and all out of door expenses were paid by us—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his expenses book—after the disclosure of the 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the new arrangement took place; Mr. Ellwood can tell you about that—the prisoner was to have 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the beginning, and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the month—the books will show how far back that has been paid—he continued on those terms till Aug., when he left without leave—I wrote to him to come back to business, because I ascertained that there were further defalcations; he did not come on the day I appointed, but came I cannot recollect whether it was the day after, it was a subse<lb></lb>quent day—I was then acquainted with the defalcations—that was in Aug or the beginning of Sept.—I did not desire him to come back and go on with his work, he requested me to take him back, but I said that after a second time I could not think of it—my son had not joined us in the mean<lb></lb>while, he joined us about two years since, not as partner, but as our clerk—he had been on one or two occasions with the prisoner to assist him, and had introduced him to the customers, twelve months ago—I afterwards sent my son round to the customers to ascertain matters—he would have to take orders—after Aug. the prisoner sent twice to us to demand an account—I cannot tell you when that was, it was not in Sept.—to the best of my belief it was three months afterwards—he sent for a debtor and creditor account, and I told the party that there was no account, as it all lay on one side—it was a cousin of his—I said, "We have no secrete to keep from you, we are very busy, but if you will come in some other day, Mr. Ellwood will make out the account; it is not usual for a person to come in and get an account of a year's standing, in a minute"—he afterwards called again—I not know whether he called twice or three times—Mr. Rumble was the person who called—my partner at last copied down on a piece of paper the amount which we had made, it was not an account—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the account which was furnished by my partner; I cannot tell you when it was given, I cannot charge my memory, there is no entry made in any book, or anything of that sort—Mr. Ellwood gave that account with my full sanction, we had no reason for keeping it back—it was given to Josiah Rumble, he called certainly on two occasions—I do not recollect his saying anything about a letter, he said that he came from Mr. Keymer, and did not intend to justify him in anything he had done, but wanted to know how we stood—I did not tell him that we had been advised by our solicitor not to render an account; I did not mention our solicitor at all—I did not say, "You do not want to prove a partnership?"—I swear I never men<lb></lb>tioned the word "partnership" to Mr. Rumble—this is a copy of the account, the heading of this document is "profits," and then the years follow—the aggregate is 3,407<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the six years, 1850-1-2-3-4 and 5—there is an item of bad debts 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that reduces it to 3,036<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the prosecutors in this case. I am in partnership with Mr. Chambers—the prisoner was in our service—he came about May, 1850, as clerk and traveller—it was his duty to receive monies from the customers, and to pay them in either to Mr. Chambers or myself—he had no power to withhold the payment in any way; he ought to pay the first time he came in after the collection—it might be the same day, if he came in, or the next morning—he has never accounted to me for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Flint, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Abbott, or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Grace—it was his</p>

               <p>duty to account for them at once—he never gave any account of those sums to me at any time—he left our service in Aug. last—he absented himself about the time we discovered that he had received these monies.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>about that—someof the entries are in my writing, and some in Mr. Cham<lb></lb>bers's—the expenses he had incurred were down in a book at that time—that book is here—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the expense book—it if in the pri<lb></lb>soners writing—the amount was taken from that—the last entry in this book is on May 29, 1851—the expenses are not entered separately in the cash book after that time—here is an entry, on 26th Dec., 1851, that indicates the expenses that were paid—I did not say that the expenses were entered from 1850 to 1853, I said not separately—the whole amount of his salary is entered together at the end of the year—the entry on 26th Dec., 1851, is 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is under the date of 26th Dec., 1851—his wages and expenses were included in that amount, I have not got the particulars of how they were paid, it was all put down in one lump at the end of the year—it stands in our books in this way, "Charges, to Henry Chambers," salary, so much—and underneath that is "Ditto, G. S. Keymer, to 31st Dec., 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that applies to the salary as well—Henry Chambers is a clerk, and is also the son of my partner—salaries are put under "Charges," because we post them to "Charges"—we have no account called "Salary," they are both posted to charges—this "190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is my writing, I do not know when those figures were put in—they are not written on an erasure, there is no erasure there—the folio referred to in the ledger is No. 154—this sum of 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid at various times between May and Dec.—I have no check now as to when it was paid, the amounts are on slips of paper, and when it is entered there we consider that they are done with, and the papers are destroyed; they are only little slips, and memorandums—I kept them till Dec., and then entered the total—none of those are left, but I have some since—they were memorandums of cash that he had asked for, and had—I cannot point out any single occasion when he had cash before that date, but he asked for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—I do not know that he saw me make this entry, I made it at the time—I mean to say that it was made at the same time that the name, "Keymer," was put down; on the same day that this "Henry Chambers" was put down, at least, I think so; but the "Henry Chambers" appears to be in different ink to the other—I do not know how near to that time they were entered—I swear they were entered long before a year afterwards, and long before six months afterwards—I swear, positively, that this entry was written within twelve months of the time it bears date, and, I have no doubt that it was entered near the time—I believe the other entries were made at the same time, at least four are all entered together in the same writing—the entries are all in my writing, except one or two at the top.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say in your account, "Cash drawn, 1,563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," can you show me any entries in that book to make the amount of cash paid to him, during the whole time he was in your employment a larger sum than 922<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I took it from the books at the time, it may not be exactly correct, but that is the figure—in 1850 to 1851 here is 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; April to Dec., 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Jan. to Dec., 325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and then there are seven items, amounting, in the whole, to 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but I can give it better by this little red book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which I kept the entries—here is "Jan. 24th, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; then Feb. 23rd, March 22nd, April 16th, and May 10th to July 21st, 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Aug. 4th, cash 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 16th, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (the 16th is after the 17th); Sept 6th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—from Aug. to Nov. 3rd I make it 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and there is an entry of small sums, amounting to 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., down to Dec.—I do not see any more money that year that I paid him to make it 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., instead of 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as you put it—I should think there was more, but it might be entered directly here without going into the red book—he might have had more—I do not mean that I deliberately left, anything out, if I have, it has not been done with any intention one way or the other—it is not an irregularity—though I kept this book to enter the amounts in, they might not appear—I have not taken the trouble to examine the books—the particulars were not all entered at one time, they were all copied out and made one entry, but they were entered at different dates, as he had the money—I swear that they were all entered on the same day as they were paid—they were not extracts from the little memo<lb></lb>randum book that I have spoken of, they were entered at the time—some<lb></lb>times he gave me memorandums, and sometimes I wrote the slips of paper myself—I made up the books from nothing, I entered the money at the time it was paid—he asked for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and entered it—some of the slips of paper were before, and some afterwards—there were none of this year at the time these were in existence—I told the Jury that some<lb></lb>times I wrote them, and sometimes he wrote them; that did not allude to these entries, but to previous ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be good enough to refer to the year 1854; my figures altogether, down to Aug., when the prisoner left, are 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; can you make it any more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, which I have inserted, or it would be 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the red book does not contain all the payments—there was a trifle over in 1854—this is for three months—I also paid him, on 17th April, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 6th May, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(that is not included in the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was afterwards—I am sure of that)—15th May, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 12th June, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 31st Dec., 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that made the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month for the remainder of the year—the 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was entered about that time, I swear that—it was entered from memorandums—I put it all in a mass, 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amounts were entered on a strip of paper, which is not now in existence—I mean to pledge my oath that Mr. Keymer received 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash from us at various times—he did not have it regularly, he had, perhaps, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 6., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not got my papers to show that—I mean to say that those small sums amounted exactly to 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I summed them up about that time, and destroyed the paper—I did not know that I should be asked for it—I have no memorandums in my red book to show those payments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just refer me to any sum of money which you paid him after that</p>

               <p>arrears after the entry of 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never heard of a claim for salary till to-day—Mr. Keymer has asked me sometimes, "How does my salary stand? and I have said, "You are paid up to the end of March or Feb.," whichever it may be, and he has said, "I do not know, because I trust you, your word is sufficient"—I have some more of the memorandums (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have from time to time paid the prisoner his alary in the regular way, and since he left I have never received from him any claim for salary.</p>

I produce the draft of an agreement which I prepared for the prisoner, whereby it appears that he is to enter into the service of the prosecutors as clerk, on his obtaining a respectable person to become security for his duty, and faithfully accounting for the moneys he receives—I delivered it to him—he had it for a couple months, and it was never executed in consequence of a difficulty as to the security—I asked him several times whether he approved of it, and he said, "Yes," but that the party who he had men<lb></lb>tioned as security had mentioned the matter to his wife, and she objected to it, and that he would give another name, but no other security was obtained—a fair copy was given to him—I had communicated with Mr. Chambers about two days before the letter about the action for slander—I mean that he had applied to me with reference to this prosecution.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cottage-court, Orchard-street, Westminster. On the 1st of June I met the prisoner at the top of York-street, with another woman—I had seen her before—she asked how it was I had not been to Knightsbridge lately—I said I had not time—they followed me to the middle of York-street—she there crossed the road, and struck me a violent blow on the forehead with a key, or something—I was covered with blood, and could not discern what it was—as I was being taken to the doctor's, she flew at me, and tore part of my dress off—I never had an angry word with her, or gave her the slightest offence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had nothing; I was taken to the station directly, and nothing found on me; I struck her with my fist; she asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and struck me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not ask her for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I never raised my hand to her.</p>

I saw a crowd and saw the prisoner with a key in her hand—they took the prosecutrix to a surgeon's—she followed and tore her gown—I said, "Oh, you wretch, cannot you throw the key away, and strike with your hand?"—she said, "Oh, it is an old grudge"—the key was bloody when she swung it in her hand afterwards.</p>

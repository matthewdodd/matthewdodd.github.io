                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at 3, Tranquil-vale, Blackheath—I keep a boot and shoe shop—on 15th April the prisoners came in between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Martin said, "I have come for a pair of boots for myself"—I got her a pair—she was not provided with money to pay for them, but the other gave me two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces as a deposit—she said that she would send in an hour or an hour and a half, or come for them, and I never saw anything of them until they were brought to me by the policeman in the evening at half-past—he showed me a pair of boots, which I recognised as mine—I had fitted them on to Martin, but she refused to have them—the policeman then asked me if I knew the two young women—I said, "Certainly I do; they were here this afternoon"—they both denied having been in the shop, but I am sure they were.</p>

I was called into a public-house on the 15th, and requested to take White in custody for trying to obtain jean and money by fraud—that had nothing to do with this charge—my attention was called to something under her cloak—I asked her what she had got—she said, "A pair of boots," and produced these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her where she got them from—she said, "I do not know"—I said, "You must know where you found them"—she said they belonged to her sister—I said, "Where did your sister get them from?"—she said that she thought she got them somewhere near the Arsenal gate, Woolwich—I took her to the station, and directly I got there Martin called to see her—I said to White, "Is this your sister?"—she said, "Yes"—I then asked her if they were her boots—she said "Yes; and I can take them where boot them from"—I said, "Where is that?"—she said, "At Black heat-bridge"—I said, "Do you know the shop, or where it is?" and she said, "Somewhere near Billing's, the watchmaker's"—I took both the prisoners to Blackheath-bridge—I went to three shops, and the third shop I enquired at was Mrs. Price's—I produced the boots, and Mrs. Price identified them as her property, and also the prisoners as having been in her shop at 4 o'clock that afternoon.</p>

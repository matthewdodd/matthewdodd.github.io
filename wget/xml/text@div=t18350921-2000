                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Haynes, who is in the New Prison. in January I saw the prisoner at our house, on Uxbridge<lb></lb>moor—my husband went out with him about half-past eight or nine o'clock—he returned with my husband in about two hours—they had the carcase of a sheep with them—I was not in bed—I had a light, and saw the carcase of the sheep—It had no head on, nor nay feet, nor any entrails or skin—they both said the sheep came from over Mr. Austin's cut bridge, in a field behind Austin's mill—they did not say whose sheep it was—Mr. Roadnight's name was not mentioned that I heard—the carcase was left at our house all night—Swift came in the next night with my hus<lb></lb>band, and some of the mutton was dressed for supper—Swift had some of it away afterwards, both raw and cooked, as far as it went—I cannot say how much he had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Hillingdon. In January last, I had some fat wether sheep, which I kept in a field at the back of Austin's Mill, belonging to Mr. Williamson—I had from twenty in thirty—at the latter end of January, the head and four feet of a sheep were brought to me by my shepherd Brind—I had the skin of a sheep brought to me five or six weeks afterwards by Line a fellmonger—It had a mark of my sheep on it—when the head was brought to me, part of the car was left on it, and I found the corresponding part of the car on the skin.</p>

In January last my master had some sheep hehind Austin's mill—he had between twenty and thirty fat wether sheep—I went to count them one morning, and missed one—I searehed and found the head and feet in the ditch, at the bottom of the field—they had spilt the car in cntting the head off, and left part of it on—I afterwards saw the skin pro<lb></lb>duced, and the part of the car corresponded with what was left on the head—I observed a mark on the shoulder of the skin, the same as master's sheep had—It was a roddle mark—I am satisfied it is the skin of the sheep master lost.</p>

               <p>JOHN NEIGHBOUR. I live at Beaconsfield, Bucks. On the 3d of September I had a bay gelding; I desired my brother William to put it into a paddock; I missed it on Sunday morning, the 4th, and found it again on Friday the 9th, in Smithfield, in possession of Rance; I saw the prisoner on the Monday following in custody; I did not hear him say any thing except before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The last time you saw it safe was on the 3d of September? A. Yes, I did not see it at all in the paddock. I had had it six years, or six years and a half, and was quite familiar with it; it was impossible to alter it so that I should not know it; I think it is blind in the near eye, but that is not visible; I was bringing it up here, but it became lame, and left it at Southwell. I first went before the Alderman on the 10th of September; the prisoner appeared there, but whether in custody or not, I cannot say; he was remanded, and sent into custody; Rance was first taken up.</p>

            . I keep the Crown inn at Bayswater. I bought this horse of the prisoner for eight sovereigns, on the 8th of September - Thursday, I think - I am certain he is the man; he said he came from town, and some butchers who were with him knew him very well, or I should not have bought it; he said he had been down the road. My man was taken into custody about it, and after he was taken, I went in search of the prisoner, and found a companion of his, named Manning; he came next day himself to the Alderman; Manning was in custody in one of the city compters for a night and a day - he was with the prisoner when he sold me the gelding; I had sent Rance to sell the horse, and he was detained.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you was taken up? A. I came forward; the officer said he should not take me, but my man; I went home, and attended before the Alderman next day, according to his directions, and before I went into the Alderman's presence I saw the prisoner, and asked if he knew any thing about the horse he had sold me, as it was proved to be stolen; he said it was no such thing, for he was confident he knew where it came from; I said, "That I have nothing to do with - you are here;" "Ah! (said he) I shall soon relieve it!" - he said he had the horse from some gentleman, naming him, but what name I do not recollect - no such person came forward to prove he had sold it to him - this passed before he went before the Alderman - he was detained, and has been so ever since - I asked him where the man who he bought it of lived - he said he should tell that when he came into Court - I understood him to mean, when he went before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person's name Brown? A. I think it was, and he told the Alderman where Brown was to be found; he did not tell me where he was to be found before we went into the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you live - at Bayswater, or Bagnigge-wells? A. At Bayswater; I bought the horse, at my door there - the prisoner was at the door with Manning, and three or four others - I did not then ask him who he bought it of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not afterwards learn that he had it from Brown, with whom he had had dealings before? A. Yes, and he said he sold for Brown, on commission; that he could find Brown, from references to him in Smithfield, and he would go before the Alderman, and state it all right; and he came to the Alderman by himself.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say how long he had been in the habit of selling for Brown? A. No, he said he had been in the habit of doing so - I think I gave more than the worth of the horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to give more than its value? A. When I bought it I did not know what had happened to it - I did not ride him two hundred yards before he fell with me; I bought it between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; he had two broken knees - he fell, and threw me off; I do not deal in horses; I buy one for my own use, and if it does not suit, I sell or change again. I keep three or four teams; I sent two cart horses to be sold with this - I had had them three or four months - I bought them in Smithfield - one was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270075"></xptr>grey horse, and the other a chesnut mare. I asked the prisoner his name when I bought the horse of him; he said Adams, and that he lived in St. George's-fields, by the Shepherd and Shepherdess public-house; Manning, and two or three others, who were with him, knew him extremely well. I was not in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Alderman, were you not ordered round into the place where persons charged with felony are placed? A. Yes, with the man - I remained there about an hour. I left word at the prisoner's lodgings, in St. George's-fields; I did not find his lodgings, but I left word at different houses where he used to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not leave word at his lodgings? A. Why, at places - he might lodge there.</p>

            . I am a pork-butcher. I was in Adams' company when he sold this horse to Davis - I had not been with him a quarter of an hour before he sold it - he was riding the horse - I did not ask him where it came from - I had known him some years - I and two friends had been out for a ride, and overtook him, or he overtook us - he was coming towards town - a friend of mine asked him if the horse was for sale - he said Yes, and asked 10 l. for it I believe, and when we got to Davis's, at Bayswater, we stopped and had some porter - Davis heard him talking about selling the horse, and asked him the price - he said 10 l. - Davis bought it for 8 l. - Adams walked home after selling it - he said he lived by the Elephant and Castle - that is all the address he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Davis take his address? A. I cannot say - I believe he told Davis he lived by the Elephant and Castle - Abbott, a friend of mine, who is now in Court, found him out for Davis afterwards - he was not present when the horse was sold - he was gone as far as the turnpike when the money was paid - I always knew the prisoner to be a respectable man, and had no idea of the horse being stolen - he said he was selling it for some person, and was to take eight sovereigns home, or not sell him - he mentioned no person's name then, nor where he lived - I have known him slightly for seven or eight years, but had not seen him for a year before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Abbott was present? A. Not to see the money paid - he knew the prisoner as well as I did - the Elephant and Castle is near St. George's-fields - we were not half an hour at Davis's - it was about five o'clock in the afternoon - Davis rode it up and down to try it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He rode him up and down several times? A. Yes, he trotted him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many people are there at the Windmill? A. Only one hostler - I also asked a porter who attends in the yard - I mentioned the man's name and description - I went there two or three market-days.</p>

            . I live in Charles-street, Hackney-road. On the 3d of September the prisoner lodged with me - I then lived at No. 9, Devonshire-street, Stones-end, Borough, which used to be called St. George's-fields, and is within a stone's throw of the Elephant and Castle - he was taken into custody on Monday, the 12th of September - he was unwell for eight, ten, or twelve days before that - he is troubled at times with a swimming in his head, brought on by his blood flowing to the head - he kept at home, being ill - he was at home on the evening of the 3d of September - I am an Excise officer, and came home about ten o'clock that evening (Saturday) - I said to Mrs. Green, "Is all in?" - she said "Yes, they are all in; Adams is gone to bed very ill." I asked that question, because I always lock the door, and wanted to know whether Adams or his wife were out - I locked the door, took the key with me, as I always do, and went to bed - I got up next morning about eight o'clock, opened the parlour shutters, unlocked the street door, and about nine, or between nine and ten, the prisoner came down with a child in his arms - I said "Well, Adams, how are you this morning?" - he said "I am a little better than I was, but am very ill;" and he looked very ill - he went out, and came in in about half an hour with something for dinner - it was then between nine and ten o'clock on Sunday morning, the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a man named Brown, who was in the habit of calling? A. A man named Brown called on Wednesday morning, the 7th of September - I never saw him before to my knowledge - he came between seven and eight o'clock - Adams was at home in bed - he got up and came down to him - I opened my window, and heard Brown say, "Adams, I have brought you a horse to sell, as you sell on commission - he and the prisoner went away down the street together - the prisoner was in his shirt sleeves - Brown was on the horse - on the 10th, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, he called again on horseback - I heard nothing pass between them that morning - the prisoner got up, came down, and went with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you take notice whether he was on the same horse as he rode the first morning? A. No, for the horse was covered with a horse-cloth both times - I could only see the head.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has your house a number? A. No, eight and ten are on each side of me, but mine is fresh painted, and has no number - the prisoner has lived there ever since the end of February, or beginning of March - his health was very bad at the time - he was ill on Sunday - this was Wednesday - he was generally sickly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Brown say to you? A. He said did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270076"></xptr>Adams live there - I said Yes - I opened my bed-room door, tapped at his door, and said, "Adams, you are wanted;" I did not know the man's name - Adams went down, dressed in his shirt sleeves, and went away with him without a coat, and was gone twenty minutes or half an hour, and had no coat on when he came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say "You are ill, and should not go out without your coat?" A. I did not speak to him - I was in my room, and saw him through the window - my wife was in bed, and I was not dressed - I had never seen Brown before - I heard him say, "I have brought you a horse to sell for me by commission - the horse was entirely covered as far as the chest, buckled all round as far as the neck, and had a saddle on the top of the cloth - it was girthed round the cloth - I have seen sickly horses so - nothing but its rump was to be seen - I paid no attention to the colour - I believe Adams sold horses on commission - I know of nobody else bringing him horses to sell - I have no stables, nor has he - I only knew him while he lodged with me - I understood he left a butcher's shop to come to me - he certainly knew the name of the street he lived in - I should think he could give the name of the street instantly, if he was asked - the horse, also, had a cloth on when Brown came a second time - he knocked at the door - I was in bed, looked out of the window, and said "Who did you want?" he said Adams - I knocked at the bedroom door, and said "Adams, somebody at the door wants you;" I did not tell him who it was - I saw him outside talking to the man - he had no coat on then - he went away with Brown without his coat that morning also - I never knew him go out without his coat but on those two mornings, except on a warm morning - I never saw him with horses.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Brown dressed that day? A. In a fustian frock coat and top boots - it was a frock coat, not a jacket - he is about five feet eight inches high.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured coat was it? A. It was cloth, not fustian.</p>
               <p>Q. You said this instant it was a fustian frock coat - now was it fustian or not? A. It was a brown cloth frock coat, not fustian - if I said so it was a mistake - I dare say I did say so. He looked more like a gentleman's groom; the buttons were covered with cloth - his boot-tops were a kind of yellow colour; he looked like a horse dealer - he had no whip, but an ash stick: I did not notice whether he had spurs; he had a white handkerchief; his coat was buttoned up - I could not see his waistcoat. He might have stood talking to Adams the first morning for six or seven minutes; I was looking out of the bed-room window - Mrs. Green got up before they went away both mornings, and saw them - she looked through the curtains both mornings. When Adams was taken his wife told me he was charged with felony - he sent for me, and when I got there the evidence was going on; this was on the 12th of September; the horse was proved to have been stolen on the 3d, and when I got home I said to my wife, "Do you remember last Saturday night at what time Adams came home?"</p>
               <p>Q. This man's health was but middling - was he in the habit of riding ten or twelve miles into the country? A. Not that I know of. Brown was dressed the same both days - I could tell if he had a different coat on; I believe he is the only man I ever saw come to my house on horseback. I have no other lodgers, and no servant - I do not know how he got his bread - he always paid his rent.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What was his illness? A. A swimming in his head. The early part of September was very warm weather - my business takes me from home in the day time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you move to Charles-street? A. On the 29th of September. I lived in Devonshire-street four years. I think he brought home a sheep's head to make broth for dinner on Sunday - his child is about six months old; they have no other child: they live in the back room second floor - I sleep in the first floor front room. I attended the two last examinations at Guildhall; they were before Alderman Magnay: I heard on the first examination when the horse was said to have been stolen. I told the Alderman he was in bed at my house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that to Mr. Alderman Magnay? A. To the best of my knowledge I did not say a word at the first examination; I only heard Neighbour and one Amor examined at the first examination - Davis, Rance, and Pike were examined at the second examination, which I think was seven or eight days after the first. I told the Alderman I could prove he was in my house all that night; he said that might do in another Court - I offered to swear it - my wife was not there; they would not hear me. The prisoner said he had a man to prove he was at home in bed - the Alderman said he could not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Alderman so? A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to be examined? A. I do not know that I spoke, but the prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state that you told

            . I am the last witness's wife. Adams lodged with us in Devonshire-street - he had the back room first floor, with his wife and baby; he lodged with us six months; he said he had left a butcher's-shop when he first came. I understood from him that he sold horses. He slept at home on the night of the 3d of September - he complained of an overflowing of blood in the head, which he was subject to - he had been in and out that day, and went to bed about eight o'clock, or a little after. We were generally all in bed by ten or eleven o'clock, except Mr. Green - he went out next morning between eight and nine o'clock, to the butcher's, and brought in, I think, a sheep's head for broth. A person called on him on the Wednesday morning, before I was up; my husband spoke to him out of window; I did not hear the person's name - I merely saw him through the blind, on horseback. I got out of bed - I noticed that he had a black hat and brown coat on, and there was a cloth over the horse. Adams and him went away together; I saw Adams cross the road; I think he had got his coat on, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270077"></xptr>will not be sure. The same man called again on Saturday, on horseback - I was getting up, and saw him, and thought he was the same man, from having the same dress on - I think his buttons were the same colour as his coat - he and Adams went away together.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you heard any part of your husband's evidence here to-day? A. No - Adams frequently complained of this overflowing. I did not know of his having stables. I understood he sold horses, and he had money which he got by letting his shop, as Mrs. Adams told me. I have not seen Brown before nor since - he came about the same time both mornings - they stood at the door talking a few minutes, and then went down the opposite street; to the best of my recollection Adams' coat was not on - I am certain he had none on either time. I have frequently seen him take his child out without his coat, and go as far as the Wellington public-house without it - that is about a stone's throw; he was out with Brown about half an hour at both times. I am certain he was not out an hour the second time - he generally came home at nine, ten, or eleven o'clock at night. I have very ill-health, and did not go before the Magistrate - I could have gone in a coach - I was up but did not go out at the time he was examined. - I had no doctor then. I have been attended by a physician for three years. I knew he was before the Magistrate, but was not asked to go. I knew he was charged with the robbery on the 3d, and was remanded, but I did not go; my husband said Adams was taken up, and could I call to mind the Saturday and Saturday week - I said I could. Three or four respectable men have called on him at my house - sometimes in a one-horse chaise. I did not notice whether Brown had a whip, he had a brown cloth coat - not fustian. I did not observe his boots or handkerchief. - I merely looked through the curtains.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDRREWS. Q. You were not well when he was examined? A. No. I was not asked to go before the Magistrate - he had been bled a week or a fortnight before, for the weakness in his head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When any body in your house went out, how did they get in? A. I had a key as well as my husband - I always let him in. I let him in on Sunday, when he brought the sheep's head in - I think he had the liver also. I do not know whether he had any vegetables - I do not know where my husband was when he brought in the sheep's-head - he might be in the kitchen, which is on a level with the stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS GREEN. Q. Have we taken it down correct, that the prisoner was in bed, when Brown called at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, you called him, and he came down? A. Yes; he might be two or three minutes before he came down. Brown knocked at the door - my wife is very nervous, and it frightened her - he must have got off his horse to knock.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Wellington-street, Newington-causeway. I have lived there eight years, and have known the prisoner eleven years; his character was honest as far as I knew - he let his shop at Vauxhall, where he was a butcher, and got his living with the money he let his shop for, I suppose.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been intimate with him for eleven years? A. Yes; in fact he is my brother-in-law: Green's is within half a stone's throw of my house - my wife took the apartment for him - it is No. 9, Devonshire-street; I saw Brown bring the horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you had any conversation with any body, while this cause has been going on? A. None whatever; I saw Brown bring him the horse - it was on a Wednesday, and I think the 7th; about eight o'clock in the morning, as near as I can judge; I had got home from Newgate market: I did not know Brown's name at the time; when I first saw him he was on foot, leading the horse down for Adams; he had just been there and was coming down to the Wellington, which is opposite my house; I was rather busy, having just come from market, and did not speak to them at first.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Adams? A. About eleven o'clock; I saw him and Brown shewing the horse to a neighbour of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them about eight o'clock in the morning, did you see them go into the Wellington? A. I believe they went in.</p>
               <p>Q. When he passed you about eight in the morning was there any thing remarkable about him? A. Nothing at all - he had been poorly with a pain in his head. I saw Brown again on the Saturday, when he called on the prisoner, and brought a second horse with a cloth on, and it was a better horse. I cannot say what colour the cloth was; I think it is called a rug; the first horse had no cloth on; the second was a different shaped horse, and of more value; I could not see the colour of it on account of the cloth; the first was a bright bayhorse; there was no star or mark on its sides - if there had been I must have seen it; he did not take it into the Wellington - he took it to a neighbour of mine named Mills, and put it into his shed; he is down at Hounslow - this was the first horse; I have stables - he did not come to my house at all; Mills bid him money for the horse - seven pound or guineas; Brown and Adams were both there; Adams told him, in my presence, that it did not belong to him but to Brown. I saw Mills yesterday - I believe the prisoner's name was on the list for trial yesterday, and I was here, also on Saturday and Friday; I did not tell Mills I had been attending here, for, in fact, I had no opportunity; he is at Hounslow - he keeps a go-cart; I saw him after I went home last night; I told him that the trial had not come on; I did not ask him to come.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Brown a long whip in his hand? A. I saw no whip - I think he had an ash stick. Green lives half a stone's throw from me; I saw Brown at his door before he went to the Wellington, holding the horse by the bridle; I saw my brother and him on Saturday morning, and saw money pass between them; I observed nothing remarkable in the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What coloured coat had your brother-in-law on the second day? A. A blue coat, as he generally wears - it was a body coat - he wore the same coat on the first day; it was not a great coat, but a blue body coat; I am sure he had his coat on both days - it had yellow buttons - I cannot be mistaken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were Adams and Mills trying to make a bargain? A. I dare say a quarter of an hour - it was not at the public-house that I saw him and Mills; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270078"></xptr>am sure the first horse had no body clothing, the second had; I never saw Brown but these two times; I have looked about for him when I have been at Smithfield; I should know him if I saw him; I have not been at the Windmill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your brother-in-law represent that there was hardly a market day but he was there? A. I never heard it - I never heard him say he was to be found there.</p>
               <p>JOHN NEIGHBOUR re-examined. Q. Did you attend the examination before Mr. Alderman Magnay? A. Yes; the first examination was before Mr. Alderman Thorpe - the prisoner was not there then; Green was at the two last examinations; the prisoner said he had witnesses to call; I do not know whether he stated what they were to prove; the Alderman said that should be inquired into at another place; I did not observe Green attempt to speak; I was at all the examinations, and attended to all that passed.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

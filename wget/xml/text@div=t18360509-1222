                  </hi>. I live with John Thomas Clark. On the 19th of April, I saw the prisoner running away with this saw, in the field next to where the men bad been at work with it—I ran after him—my brother secured him with it—I took another boy who was discharged—I had given the saw out to my brother—he is not here—I had only given it to him ten minutes before, and he was gone on an errand at the time—I had seen it lying on the premises after he was gone; he had not returned till I was in pursuit, and could not have given it to the prisoner—the foot<lb></lb>path is not within a quarter of a mile of where the saw was—the Fleet ditch was between us—I called to him to stop, and he threw the saw down in the field.</p>

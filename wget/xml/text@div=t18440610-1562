                  </hi>. I live in Harlington-place, Church-street, Maryle<lb></lb>bone. I work for Mr. John Pink, a builder—he has a house there which is being pulled down—I was working there—on the morning of the 31st of May I missed part of an old smoke-jack, which had been taken down, and was lying in front of the building—I found part of it lying at the back of the building—I found the prisoners together on Mr. Farrar's building, on the same premises—I asked what they had done with the brass part of the old smoke-jack—they both replied they knew nothing about it—I laid hold of Gates's collar—he said, "I have not got the old brass, the other boy has got it up stairs"—Weeks was up stairs then—Kent came and asked what I had lost—the prisoners were standing close by and could hear—Kent said he had picked it up in the back premises of Mr. Farrar's warehouse, and said, "This is it"—I did not say before the Magistrate that Gates had gone up stairs and brought it down—I put my mark to what I stated, this is it—it was read over to me—(<hi rend="italic">The deposition being read, stated</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">Gates went up stairs and fetched me apiece of brass, which was a part of the old smoke-jack.</hi>")</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Farrar, and live in Church-street, St. Giles's. I came on these premises about half-past eight in the morning, and saw the prisoners there—Weeks was in the act of hammering up part of an old piece of smoke-jack—when they saw me Gates tried to make his escape out of the place—I asked Weeks how he came by it, and picked it up and looked at it—he said "He found it near the sewer," which they were digging out—it was a kind of box—I would not give 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I gave it him again, but said, "Do not break it up, if you want the brass of it unscrew it"—I then went away—I afterwards found the iron part of the box in the warehouse—the prisoners were at work at Mr. Farrar's place, but not for him—Weeks had been at work for six or seven weeks, and was a very honest lad—Gates afterwards came to me, and asked what I had done with the piece of iron—I said I had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it into the rubbish—Townsend afterwards came, and I gave him information, and gave him the iron part of the box, which I found in the wash-house.</p>

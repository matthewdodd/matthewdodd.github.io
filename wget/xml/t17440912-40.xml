            . The Prisoner came to lodge with me August the 14th, and desired leave to go into my room to work a border for a cap; and while my little girl was gone of an errand, she took twelve guineas out of my box with a false key. They were separately wrapped up in a piece of brown paper; I missed them September the 3d, and saw them there a week before - I suspected the Prisoner because there was nobody else in the room, and when she came to lodge with me she was very poor and mean, and could not pay for washing or lodging. On Saturday the 1st of September she brought in a parcel of goods, I have an inventory of them; there was a pair of callimanco shoes, 4 s. 6 d. a pair of breeded shoes, 8 s. a pair of stays a guinea and a half, a hood and cloak in the nature of a capuchin with a lace round it, two pair of muffatees, half a guinea, there was a silk gown and some shifts, but I don't know the value of them: she gave a woman sixpence to bring them into the house. She dressed herself up and went that Saturday to Ranelagh-House with a gentleman. I asked her how she came by the money. She said she had a guinea and a half of that gentleman. She continued in the house, she did not run away.</p>

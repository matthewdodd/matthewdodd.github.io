I became acquainted with the prisoner at Sligo, in Ireland, in 1853—I knew him for about ten or twelve months before I married him—he was living in Sligo during the whole of that time—he was practising as a doctor, and lecturing—he was passing by the name of Dr. Tucker. He married me at the parish church of St. John, Sligo, on 5th March, 1853, by a clergyman in the usual way—he represented himself to me as a single man—he lived with me for almost three years after he</p>

               <p>SAMUEL REMINGTON. I was chief mate of the ship Cornwall on her voyage to China, the prisoner was <rs id="t18170702-60-viclabel344" type="occupation">quarter-master</rs>

            . I sailed on board the Cornwall as quarter-master, the prisoner was also quarter-master. I recollect while the vessel was at Whampoo-reach, a party of us had leave to go to Canton, Brown, Glanville, Fitzpatrick, and the prisoner were of the party; we returned from Canton towards the ship, between five or six o'clock in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020027"></xptr>evening of the 24th of October, there were eight of us; I had the command of the boat. Brown said, Fitzpatrick had not pulled an oar since we left Canton, and that he had better lay it in; Fitzpatrick said he could not pull on account of the chest which was in his way. - Glanville offered to change places with him, they got up to change, Fitzpatrick was going farther aft in the boat, next the prisoner; the prisoner said he would heave him overboard if he did not pull. Fitzpatrick was twenty-one years of age, and rather slender. Fitzpatrick said he could not, and was in the act of sitting down on the seat, when the prisoner took him by his back and trowsers, and shoved him over-it was between seven and eight o'clock; we were about half way down the reach, towards the ship-the river is about a quarter of a mile broad there, and six or seven feet deep-the tide was very strong, and going down. When the prisoner had thrown him over, he said, "there you are." I was upon the bow-oar, I jumped aft, and took his place; the prisoner wished to jump overboard to make away with himself; we stopped to look for the body. It was dark. We saw no more of him. We laid there eight or ten minutes, calling out, but could hear nothing; the river was very deep with mud about the place; we then made for the ship, and got there about half-past nine o'clock. The prisoner was secured. In seven days after the body was brought alongside. I knew it was his body, by the dress, and the hair on his upper lip; his face was muddy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. If a man had been thrown in there, and got on his legs, he would be unable to stand. The body was not brought on deck. It was his body.</p>

            . I was in the boat, Brown said, the deceased, did not pull his oar, I made the same remark; the deceased and I were going to change places, my back was towards him. I heard the prisoner say, if he did not pull better, he would heave him overboard; the deceased said, thank God, he could not do it, or he dare not; the prisoner said, "Can't I." I was turning round to take my seat, and the prisoner threw him overboard. We stopped the boat, but never saw him again. I afterwards saw a body brought to the ship, his clothes appeared the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. We were all friends. I got into his place and rowed very well-there was no chest to hinder me. There was no chaplain on board. The body that I saw afterwards was dressed like the deceased.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did not the prisoner express great anxiety and distress immediately, that the body did not rise -

            He did; he was very much agitated, and wished to throw himself over, and was held down to prevent it; he said, several times, that he had been the cause of a man's death, and wished we would let him jump overboard also. The deceased could not swim.</p>

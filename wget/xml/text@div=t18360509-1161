                  </hi>. I am a truss-maker, and live in Holles-street, Clare-market, I work for Mr. Hughes. On the 27th of April I slept in the top-room of the house—I put my clothes on a bench, with my watch in my pocket, and went to bed about half-past two o'clock in the morning, having been out with a few friends—I am sure I had my watch with me—I left it in my fob—I put my trowsers on my father's bench—the prisoner lodged in the house, and slept on the second floor, I believe—when I awoke I found my watch was gone—I went to the pawnbroker's and they gave me information—I went out at one door of the shop, and the prisoner came out at the other, with my watch in her hand—this is it—I had occasion to go down stairs in the night into the yard, and left the room door open—when I came up I locked the door, but in the mean time my clothes had been taken out of the room, and left on the stairs, and my watch gone—but I did not know it.</p>

               <p>It is, you had better go with me to the person who gave it to me"—Mrs. Hill said she picked it up on the stairs—I understand the prosecutor had come home very intoxicated, and made a great noise in the house, and at seven o'clock his clothes were lying on the two-pair landing.</p>

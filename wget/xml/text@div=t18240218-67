The prisoner came into my service in the beginning of January; she gave me a reference, but I did not go after it. On the 27th of January, I missed a sovereign, and accused her of it - she paused a moment or two. I asked if she had found any money - she said she had. I asked how much - she asked how much I had lost. I said it did not matter, how much had she found - she said she had found four sovereigns on my drawers in the bed-room. I asked if that was all she had found - she said it was. I said I would take her to the watch-house - she seemed irritated, and said, if I would not, she would go down into the kitchen and get them me. I sent for an officer, who went into the kitchen - came up, and asked her where the sovereigns were - she said she would go and get them; he went into the yard with her, and brought them.</p>

            . I am a headborough, and live next door to Beeton. On the night of the 27th of January, he sent for me, and told me in the prisoner's presence that she had said she had found the sovereigns on his bed-room drawer. I said, she must have some key to get them. I was going to search her, but she said she had no pockets. I searched her box, but found nothing there. I asked her where the money was - she said down in the kitchen. I went down and found 17 s. 1 1/2 d. in her work-box. I came up and asked where the gold was - she said, if I would go with her she would shew me where it was concealed. I took a light; she went into the yard with me, and between the prosecutor's fence and my own, in the garden, over his dust-hole, I found four sovereigns wrapped up in a piece of rag - I took her to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge at the watch-house. Beeton charged her with robbing him of five sovereigns, and said he had no doubt but she had taken more. I made her no promises, but told her she was not bound to say anything. I questioned her; she said, the first she had taken was a sovereign from her master's drawer; that on the second time she took two, and the third time five. I asked her if her master did not keep his drawer locked - she said he did. I asked how she got possession of the money - she said she took the housekeeper's keys, which hung in the parlour. She mentioned a number of articles which she said she had bought with the money she had taken; and finding she mentioned having spent more than the amount she said she had taken, I said she must have taken more; she then admitted that she had taken a sovereign from a bag in the parlour, and had left 1 l. 12 s. at the butcher's for safety, when she went to the play. I find that her friends are very respectable.</p>

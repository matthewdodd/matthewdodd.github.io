                  </hi>. I live at 9 1/2, Crown Street, Soho, and sell ginger beer—on Saturday, in the first week in January, between one and two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner and Burke came in for same ginger beer—three other men shortly afterwards came in for ginger beer; they all left without paying me, and I followed them to Chapel Court, which is from 200 to 300 yards, but had not the chance of asking them for my money, for they began snowballing me—Burke knocked me down and kicked me on the left eye, he filled my mouth with snow, and I could not cry out—Powell and Burke turned my pockets out and took about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of halfpence; the other three were standing a little lower down—I got up and the prisoner knocked me down again with his fist, saying, "You b—, that is what I owe you"—it caught me on the right eye—Burke said, "We will fill the b—'s mouth with snow, so that he shall not halloa"—when I got up I could scarcely see at all out of either eye—they then left, and Burke said that they would fetch my wife—my wife came, and she and Burke helped me home—I have been since under the care of a medical man, and am still suffering, but am getting better.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother at 6, Chapel Place, Crown Street, Soho, and am single—I saw Mr. Ellis on the Saturday even<lb></lb>ing between six and seven o'clock, he was then under the influence of liquor, and again at half-past ten in the same state—between twelve and one o'clock I was awoke by a noise—I got out of bed, opened the street door, and saw Ellis and his wife, and a policeman, and Burke—Ellis was leaning against the wall and staggering—his wife said, "Come along; I thought this would happen some time or other"—both Mrs. Ellis and the policeman went away—I closed my door, knowing that when he is in liquor his temper is rather hasty—I saw nothing of the altercation, and saw no blows on either side.</p>

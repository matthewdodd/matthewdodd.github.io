                  </hi>. I am a seaman, living in Edward-street, Limet-house<lb></lb>fields. On the 18th of July, I went with the prisoner to a house—I paid her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a lodging, and went home with her—she asked for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave her, and gave her another shilling for beer, which she fetched, and gave me the change—I pulled off my clothes, and put them on the table—I had these things and money in a silk handkerchief—I put them in my hat, and put them on the table—she took the hat and put it under the bed, and took the silk handkerchief out, and went out—I went out, but could not catch her—I had no clothes on.</p>

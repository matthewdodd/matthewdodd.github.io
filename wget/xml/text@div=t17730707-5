               <p>Q. You must explain what you mean by his doing so and so to you?</p>
               <p>Ellison. He offered to lie with me; I said he should not; I struggled with him and got away from him, and he ran after me and took me by the throat, and stopped my breath, and offered rudeness to me again; then he said, d - n you, give me a shilling, and I gave him one; then he said d - n you, give me another, and I gave him another.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any stick or weapon in his hand?</p>
               <p>Ellison. No; then he went away. I am sure he is the man; I saw him again the same day, and knew him as soon as I saw him; it frightened me very much.</p>
               <p>Upon her cross examination, she said he had a dark blue or black coat on; that she thought he was a corporal, because she had seen him before in his regimentals; that after she was robbed she met the serjeant, and serjeant major, and said she had been robbed, and described the man; that the serjeant said he believed he knew him, and that the serjeant pursued and took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did anybody come up to you - A. Yes. I had sold almost all my pies at different times in the day, and there came three or four boys past. There was a constable standing by three or four boys came up, and said, do you toss. I said, no. I had not made pies long; distress had drove me to it. I said, I do not toss. The constable standing by said, that is right, mistress, do not toss. Then some other boys came up, and said, do you toss. I said, what is tossing. He said, I will hold an halfpenny so, and you cry head or tail. I begged them to go. One of them said, I should cry. I cried, head. Then I said, go along. Some boys came up, and knocked my tin up; they gave me a push; I went against the pump, or else I must have gone right back.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boys were there - A. Seven or eight. One of them knocked the tin up; I tried to save the money, and I tried to save myself, and in my falling I got upon my hands and my knees. My hands was very much trod upon; they bled very much. They tore my apron off my sides. I cried out for mercy. I did not think anything of the money. The people came round me; they were very kind, and picked up some of the halfpence that laid under feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how much had you taken from you - A. I think, about ten shillings, the best part of it in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners there - A. I saw Dorset there. I did not see Manners there. I saw Dorset pick up some of the silver. I was close to him all the time he did it. Dorset was one of them that knocked my tin up, and that tried to push me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dorset say anything - A. I cannot say he did. When the people came around me, the boys were gone. Some boy shewed me where the constable lived, and told me the boy's name. This happened on Saturday; on the Tuesday following, I saw Dorset again; I knew him.</p>

            . I am an headborough. On the 26th of December, the prosecutrix came to me; she seemed to have been used very ill, and from the information she gave me, I apprehended Dorset. I asked him how he came to rob the poor woman. He answered, b - r her, we only made a scramble.</p>

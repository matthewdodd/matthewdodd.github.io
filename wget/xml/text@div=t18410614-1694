                  </hi>. I know the prisoner. I met him on Saturday night, the 5th of June, in Aylesbuiy-street—he had the time-piece in the bib of his apron—he said it was his mother's, and cost three guineas, and he was going to Goswell-street with it—he asked me to go with him, which I did—he went to a pawnbroker's with it, but it being past eleven o'clock at night, they would not take it in—he asked me to carry it, and he went to Mrs. Smith's, and asked her to let him have 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, and she would not—he then told me where he got it—he went and got half-a-crown on it, at Mrs. Johnson's.</p>

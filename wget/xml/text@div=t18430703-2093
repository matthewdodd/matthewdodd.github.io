                  </hi>. I am employed by the Trustees of the Cannon-street roads as toll collector at St. George's gate. On Friday, the 16th of June, at three o'clock in the morning, I awoke and saw the prisoner in the toll-house—about six I got up, made some fresh tickets, and gave them to the boys that go round the gates for the purpose of cheeking—the boys have to account for the number of tickets they receive from me, and keep an account—I made those tickets from slips that are in my possession, which I keep in the cupboard—the prisoner came again in the evening at six o'clock—the slips were then safe—at least I could see that the key was in the cupboard—there were no slips taken away before—he asked me for a drink of water—I was having a discussion with a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man outside—I let the prisoner have a drink of water—he went through the toll house into the yard to get it—there was no one else in there—the key was then in the cupboard, in which there were thousands of slips kept to cut up into tickets—I did not miss any after he was gone—I could not miss them, there being so many.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came up to me at the James-street bar (the James-street boy was there), he said, "Do you want to buy any tickets?"—we said, "No"—he gave West one of the tickets—we took that down to Mr. Hawkins, and told him—I returned to the James-street bar—the prisoner was there—we had been told to keep him in talk—I asked how much he wanted for the tickets—he said he would sell us seven tickets for sixpence—he showed them to me in his pocket—I suppose there were one hundred and thirty-five slips—he said he would take one shilling for the lot—there was seven different numbers—if I had taken them they would have enabled me to pass carriages, and I should not have been obliged to account for the money received—he said he had bought them yesterday, and they very nearly cost him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw them taken from him afterwards—he shook his fist at me as he was going away, and said, "If you tell, I will kill you," or "smash you," I cannot tell which—I had never seen him before to my recollection.</p>

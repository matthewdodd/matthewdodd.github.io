               <p>Mr. Sheridan, Prisoner's Counsel. Did this paper consist of pamphlets that were saleable? - I looked upon them as waste paper.</p>
               <p>Did you see by them that they were pamphlets that were unbound, but in the state they came from the press? - I certainly looked upon them as waste paper.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see news papers with a stamp, sold for waste paper? - I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>You know of no connection between the prisoner and the man that sold them, but what he told you? - No.</p>

               <p>A short time; I will state the leading circumstances, which will throw light on the transaction, though they may not be immediate evidence; on Thursday my overseer, Mr. Rogers, sent me word that something alarming had happened; I thought the house was on fire, at least; and in the morning, when I got up, I called him down, and asked him the facts; and in consequence of what the overseer said to me, I went to Bow-street, to ask Sir Sampson Wright or some of the magistrates, what I should do; they said I could do nothing, but wait till I was robbed again, and watch the people, or discharge the man; and extort from him what had been stolen; It has been stated by the counsel, that I sent for the prisoner and Pinchin; but the prisoner stated his suspicions against Pinchin; who declared he never had stole any thing; he said he sold the sweepings to a house in Fleet-lane; and was very willing to go there and make any enquiry; I had hardly been out of my private office ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280023"></xptr>minutes before my clerk came over and gave me information against the prisoner; and directed my overseer to Atkinson's; while they were gone to Atkinson's, the prisoner was in my dwelling house; when they came back, they produced the paper, which is now in Court; that was

               <p>Is there any pretence in the trade, for such perquisites? - I have been a printer for twenty years; I never heard of such a thing; but I should think the very appearance of them would prove it; I have stated them considerably under the value at thirty shillings and eighteen shillings.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheridan. Did you know that property belonged to Mr. Woodfall? - Certainly, because it was on his premises.</p>
               <p>Did you know it to be the property of the prisoner? - I do not know; he claimed it as his property, by the order of the overseer, to sell as waste paper; it was concealed as waste paper; and tied up with brown paper round it; I never saw the contents till it was brought back again; the person bought it in the lump, without ever undoing it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know the prisoner, from Mr. Woodfall, to have any authority to sell any paper? - No further than what he said he had from Mr. Rogers.</p>

               <p>I have nothing further to say, than this, when I came into the service I had sixteen shillings a week; I had eighteen shillings before as a book binder; Mr. Rogers told me he supposed I should make it worth my while after I had been some time; I did not make away with one single article of property; had I made away with any thing; I am confident I never made away with one single part; the place was never locked; if it was locked the windows might be taken down at any time, that any person might get in; and I never sold this, nor was it by my consent; I was intrusted with great sums of money, at various times, in Mr. Woodfall's service; never a day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280024"></xptr>without thirty or forty pounds; and never any one could take any notice of it, only the clerk, to give it me to pay; and several times one hundred pounds and one hundred and twenty pounds; therefore I appeal to you my lord, and the gentlemen of the jury; I hope it will never be thought that I made any ill use of what is here pretended; I declare to God that I know no more of what is there before you, than any one here present; had I had any dishonest intention I might have done it to hundreds of pounds; neither Mr. or Mrs. Atkinson can say, I either bought or sold this property.</p>

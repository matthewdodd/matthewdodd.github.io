So that in a little time she had cost him near a hundred Pounds. Yet, after all this, she ungratefully, and like a wicked jade as she was, had endeavoured to ruin him. He had lost Goods out of his Warehouse at several times, to the Amount of about 300 l. But little! Ah very little did he think that Mrs. Adair, that Sylvia, that the Countess Spinello was the Thief! He sometimes found Letters directed to her from Dublin, in which great Things were promised her by her Relations in Ireland. These he then thought she had carelesly mislaid, and they so established his good Opinion of her, that he lent her 91 l.

In this he had Thanks return'd him, and Promises of Recompence made for the Care he had taken of Mrs. Penelope. It concluded with Advice to meet Mr. Sheldon, (who would be in London in the following Week) at Mr. Johnson's a Woollen-Draper in Covent-Garden. He took his Sylvia with him, and went thither. Mr. Johnson received her with a great Shew of Respect, and spoke much in the Favour of her Brother, and said that he was sorry they did not come a day sooner, for Mr. Sheldon had been there, but was then gone back for Worcester. Being thus disappointed, he returned home with his Lady. But yet, he was far from entertaining even the least Suspicion of her Dishonesty, till one Day, to his great Astonishment, he was informed that she had sold some of his Goods to Mr. Camm. Upon which he apprehended her, and she own'd, that beside what she had offered to Camm, she had sold several Parcels to

             a Dealer in Irish Linnen, at the Two-Neck'd Swan in Lad-Lane, and that he gave her but 15 d. a piece for the best Sort, which were worth a Crown. Mr. Camm depos'd, that on the 6th of Nov. last, the Prisoner came to him in a Coach, and offered a Parcel of Silk Lacing to Sale. She said she had taken it for an old Debt that was owing her at Coventry, and that she was recommended to him by Mrs. King, a Porteress at an Inn in White - Chappel. He told her, he was willing to buy the Goods, if he could be satisfy'd that they were her Property. She reply'd, she would leave them with him till 10 of the Clock next Morning, and then he should either buy them or return them. She left them accordingly, and went into the Coach, but presently came out again, and told him she had bethought herself, and would take them with her. No, says he, as I have a mind to buy the Goods, I am willing to look them over first; and since 'twas your Proposal that I should keep them till to-morrow Morning, I shall not part with them before. She went away in a Huff, and he sent a Servant to Mr. King, who was not at home; but her Husband told the Messenger, that he believed the Lady was one of his Sisters, neither true nor trusty. In the Evening Madam Adair came again, with Gilbert an Attorney, at Numb.5. in Garden-Court, and demanded the Goods. Mrs. King was again sent for; she came, and said, she admired the Gentlewoman should make use of her Name to Mr. Camm, when she never sent her, nor ever saw her but once, accidentally at a Friend's House. This gave this Deponent a greater Suspicion of Miss Penny than he had before; and therefore he positively refused to part with the Goods, till he had made farther Enquiry. The Countess and her Attorney, went away very angry, and left a great many Menaces behind them. Next day, this Deponent's Servant found out Mr. Pritchard, who came and own'd the Goods. Mr. Winnock deposed, that having heard that Pritchard had been robbed, and Baylis in Lad-Lane offering to sell him such Goods, he informed Pritchard of it, who came and found them to be his own.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner, in her Defence, did not deny that she had the Goods, but said that she bought them all of Pritchard, except some odd Parcels which he gave her. The Court bid her produce her Bills of Parcels and Receipts. She said she had none, for she commonly bought for time, and conditionally to pay the Money, or return the Goods if not sold; and for that Reason, she always gave him a Note of Hand under his Bills, and whenever she paid him any part of her Money, he indors'd it off. These Bills she called upon him to expose in Court. He told her, he would produce what Bills he had about him, and so took some Papers out of his Pocket, but they appeared to be but of little Signification as to the Point in hand, being only Accounts of the Expences she had put him to for Childbed-Linnen, a Midwife, Nurses, Chickens, Caudles, Possets, and divers other Necessaries. She farther said then, when she was gone from his House, she had often ordered a Porter to him for Goods in her Name, which he always sent, - if his Wife did not happen to be in the way. That he would afterwards have persuaded her to have confess'd a Bond and Judgement to him for the Goods; which she urged as an Argument, that she had bought them fairly: That he had often confess'd that he was sorry he had troubled her, for she had never wrong'd him, and he only did it to secure his Credit with Mr. Birch; for if that was lost, he should be ruin'd. She then called several Witnesses to prove these Assertions. Thompson the Porter deposed, that he often went for Mrs. Adair to Prichard for Goods, but had Orders not to let Prichard's Wife see him, because she knew who he belong'd to. That Prichard himself did several times deliver Parcels to him for her. And one time, it being rainy, Pritchard bid him take Care, and not let the Parcel be wet, for it was Silk Lacing. Another time, when he brought a Parcel from thence to Mrs. Adair, she opened it before him, and he saw it was Silk, and did believe it was the same Parcel as was then produced in Court, which Mr. Camm had before depos'd, was offered to him by the Prisoner. An Attorney depos'd, that in July last, Prichard came to him to draw a Warrant of Attorney, to confess a Bond and Judgment from the said Mrs. Adair to him (Prichard) for Money and Goods, and that Prichard told him, part of it was Cloaths which he bought for her in Henrietta-Street.</p>

That one time in particular, he came at Nine in the Morning, and gave her six Pieces of Silk Lacing and Breed, and afterwards went with her to Vaux-Hall, &amp;c. Another time he came and brought Coffee, staid and drank part of it with her, and then told her she must pay for it; she gave him 2d. and he laugh'd, and gave her a Parcel seal'd up in a Paper-Bag; which being open'd, she (this Evidence) saw that it was Yellow Lacing.</p>

I neither can nor would swear against you for the World. Mr. Dugdale deposed, that being at the Tavern with Prichard, after Mrs. Adair was in Custody, Prichard told him, He could never swear against her. What do ye mean, (says this Witness) have you not swore against her already? Is she not committed upon your Oath? No, (says Prichard) I neither have, nor will, nor can swear against her; - it was an Imposition of the Justice's Clerk; and I'll see if the Bill can't be brought in Ignoramus. Prichard then called some Witnesses to invalidate the Evidence of her Porter Thompson, who plies in S. Paul's Church-yard. Smith deposed, that but last Night he heard Thompson say, that he thought the Prisoner was as great a Thief, a Bite, and a Cheat, as any England; and he was afraid she'd never have the Punishment she deserved.

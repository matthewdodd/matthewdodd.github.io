                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in York-road, Lambeth. The prisoner was in my employ about two months ago—on the 30th of August he took thirty-four loaves out for Mr. Marlow—he returned me no money—on the 31st he took the same number again, and returned no money—on the 1st of September he took the same again—I booked the bread—on the 5th of September he told me that Mr. Marlow never had bad the bread, but he had sold it.</p>

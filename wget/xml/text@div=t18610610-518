I am a Barrister in the Temple, and a fellow of Jesus College, Cam Bridge—on Saturday night, 11th May, I was with Mr. Lewers, about 11 o'clock—as we were walking from the Trafalgar to the station, past the College railings, I having hold of Mr. Lewers' arm, I saw two men meet us, and presently I heard Mr. Lewers call out, "He has got my watch"—I turned sharp round, and gave chase—I never lost sight of the man for a moment—I am certain the prisoner is one of the two men that met us—I cannot say what Became of the other—I cannot say that I saw the pull—I was present when the locket was found upon him at the station—the process<lb></lb>sion to the station was accompanied by another person, whom we fancied was an accomplice.</p>

On Saturday night, 11th May, about twenty minutes to 11 o'clock, I was on duty at Greenwich, and heard the prosecutor cry out, "He has got my watch"—I immediately turned round and saw three gentlemen running after the prisoner—I ran and caught him by the collar—I asked the prosecutor what he had been doing, and he said he would give him in charge for stealing his watch—I took him to the</p>

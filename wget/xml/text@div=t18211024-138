The prisoner entered my service about two years since; she at first had twelve guineas a year, but Mrs. Lewis afterwards rose it to 13 l. She had considerable property entrusted to her care.

In consequence of what happened on Sunday morning last, I sent for a constable and had her taken in custody. All the boxes which she called hers were searched. I think there were two. The articles stated in the indictment were found some in each trunk. Mrs. Lewis, Mrs. White, and another <rs id="t18211024-138-deflabel811" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What property was she entrusted with - A. All our wearing apparel and the children's, and articles of plate. The lodgings were left in her care while we went to Paris. I charged another servant with robbing me, they both slept together; her boxes were searched before the prisoner's; the officer opened them with keys which they both produced. While the officers was searching the other woman, the prisoner went down to the privy, we did not suspect her till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she told that she might go about her business if she said nothing about the money you had in your hands - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say I wish much to go out of such a master's house - A. No. About two years after she came into my service she gave me 20 l. to put in the Saving Bank. She never said she put the property into her box for safety.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q. At whose suggestion did you charge the other servant with the robbery - A. I accused her because she was only a short time with us, and we had great confidence in the prisoner. She gave up her keys very reluctantly, our suspicion arose from her going to the privy. She at first gave me her money to take care of, I explained to her about the Saving Bank, and put it there for her. I refused to hold it.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I was present at the search of the prisoner's boxes. One was at Kentish-town and the other at George-street, both boxes were opened with keys. I there found several articles of mine; a silk shawl, some lace, a child's coral necklace, a garnet ring of mine, a child's frock and trowsers, and two or three napkins. Her box was not the place for the childrens' clothes - I had not given her the things. She left the room at the time of the search, she knew the charge against the other servant, and was in and out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240063"></xptr>the room during the search of the other servant's boxes. The first search took place on Saturday night, at Kentish-town, and she was taken in custody on that day; and on Monday the search was made at George-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the last search was made she was in custody - A. Yes, she gave her keys to the officer. The ring, frock, trowsers, and silk shawl were found at that time. The lace and necklace were found the first time. There were drawers for the children's things. She had complained of missing the necklace before she went to Kentish-town.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q. How many children had you at Kentish-town - A. Four. She had enquired about the necklace. The lace was given her to sew on a child's cap, she said nine or ten weeks ago, that some one had taken it out of the drawer, and laid it to the landlady's daughter.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was sent for on Saturday night, and on Sunday I took her in custody on suspicion of stealing sovereigns from her master's pocket. I asked her on Sunday morning for her keys; she very reluctantly gave me the key of a drawer which contained the keys of her boxes. I went to Kentish-town, and found the keys in the drawer where she said they were. I found four keys there. I searched her boxes in Mr. and Mrs. Lewis's presence, and found a piece of lace, a necklace, and a ring; and in another box I found eight sovereigns and a tobacco box, a 5 l. note, a guinea, a garnet ring, two pair of stockings, a frock, another necklace, a pair of gloves, three napkins, a lace cap, and a shawl. Her boxes were locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was her fellow-servant there - A. Yes. She gave me the key reluctantly, and said it was the key of a drawer which contained four other keys.</p>

               <p>MRS. LEWIS re-examined. Q. Was it not her duty to send the things to the washerwoman - A. Yes; she was not present when the garnet ring was found.</p>
               <p>MR. LEWIS. The garnet ring was missing two years ago. I asked her about it and she said it must have fallen down a crevice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mistress gave me the lace to trim a child's cap, it was taken out of the drawer by some means; I had lost 3 s. 6 d. before that. Mrs. White's servant said she would examine Miss White's drawer, and see if she could find it. The shawl I washed before I went into the country. We knew nothing about going away till Sunday night, and went on Monday, and in packing up, my things got mixed with the childrens. The coral, necklace was my own years before I knew Mrs. Lewis, and the ring and broach were given me by a friend who is dead, two pair of silk stockings are mine, and a pair of pink gloves my mistress gave me. On Saturday night my master asked if I had seen the sovereigns; I said No, he said he had lost two and knew them by a mark. I shewed him my eight, he was satisfied they were not his. After the constable came I never left the room.</p>
               <p>MRS. LEWIS. The garnet ring was made for me, I had it two years. I never gave her the shawl or any thing.</p>

So it is; I will take it back and change it where I took it last night"—I gave it her back, and she went out—I put on my hat and followed her—she went through several streets till she came to Mr. Edwards', another linen-draper—I saw her go into the shop—I went to the private door to give information—I afterwards went into the shop and saw the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in the hand of the young man—I looked at it—it was the same that had been offered to me—the mark I had made was on it—I went for a constable, and gave the prisoner in charge—I gave the crown-piece to the constable.</p>

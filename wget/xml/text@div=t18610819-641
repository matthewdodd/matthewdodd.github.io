                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick William Bunyer, who keeps the Old Bell hotel, Holborn-hill—the prisoner came into his service on 30th March—I was present when he was hired, but not the whole time—I heard him say that he came from the Steyne Hotel, Worthing—he was hired as under waiter at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and slept and boarded in the house—he left on Saturday the 27th; he was to have left on the following Tuesday—Mr. Bunyer counted the plate on the night of the 26th and took it up into our bedroom; I brought it down next morning at quarter-past 6 in a round basket, and laid it on the table in the bar-parlour—the stairs leading to our bedroom are in the bar—that is the only way to our bedroom—until I come down and open the bar-door nobody can reach the bedroom—the prisoner then came in and took the plate-basket, which it was his duty and habit to do—I went to attend to getting some breakfasts ready, and the prisoner put the plate in the drawer where it is always kept—the plate we missed was wrapped up in plate-cloths in the basket, as it was silver, and not generally used—I saw nobody come in before the prisoner took the basket—afterwards, about 7 o'clock, the house-maid came into the bar-parlour, and the prisoner asked her what sitting-room company there would be—there is a cupboard in which the cruets used by sitting-room company are kept—I saw him go up stairs either once or twice; not the stairs down which I came, but the stairs leading to the sitting-room where the cupboard was—I did not see him go to the kitchen-door, but he had to attend on some customers in the coffee-room—he went out at nearly half-past 6—I did not see him with anything, but after that I saw him with a coat, or some coats, on his arm at the kitchen-door; that was between half-past 6 and 7—he had on the same coat that he wore when he came to me first; the same that he wore generally—he absconded at 7 o'clock, and I did not see him again till he was brought by the policeman—I had heard him ask the kitchen maid where a tailor lived, and some time after he left, some coats were missed from the coffee-room—I then went up stairs to the closet and found the key on the floor; it was generally placed in the cupboard—the lock goes hard, and there is great difficulty in opening it—I came down again and missed from the bar twelve silver table-spoons and twelve forks, wrapped in separate cloths, two pair of silver sugar-tongs, and two coats, value altogether 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>there would not have to go into the kitchen; it is on the other side of the way—there is no other door except through the kitchen or from my bed-room—the only outlet from the bar is through the kitchen, because we have not a public bar—the prisoner went about his work as usual—the cook and the housemaid were in the kitchen besides me—Mr. Bunyer's aunt, at Worthing, made inquiries about the prisoner—I did not go into his bed-room after he left; I never go in—his things had disappeared before he left; I know that from the servants—we had no sitting-room company that day—there was no other waiter or chambermaid going in and out—he did not, to my knowledge, leave Worthing before his time; we had a very good character with him from there—the porter was not in and out, no one went to the drawer but myself—I may have opened it to take a tea-spoon out, but I should not then have missed the plate, because it was at the back of the drawer and five butter-boats and other articles in front of it—I saw the butter-boats, and concluded that the other things were there.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Old Bell, Holborn-hill—on the night of 26th April, or early on the 27th, I counted the plate and carried it up into my bedroom, which was locked all night; that part of the house is entirely away from customers or servants—the prisoner came to me as under-waiter; he told me he came from the Steyne Hotel, Worthing, and referred me there—he left my house on the morning of the 27th without telling me that he was going, but he was to have left on the following Tuesday—I did not see him again till 1st or 2d July—you go down a gate-way, and the coffee-room is on the right and the bar and parlour are on the left.</p>

Q.</hi> What time did you come down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not much before 9 o'clock—I counted the plate at 1 o'clock in the morning—on the day previous to the prisoner leaving he come to me about 12 o'clock in the day and asked me if I could allow him to go to Aldershot, as he wished to get a situation—I said, "Yes"—he asked for some money, and I gave him half a sovereign—he was entitled to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if he stopped till the next Tuesday—I afterwards got a letter from him from Lewes, in Sussex, wishing me to send him money to come up and explain his conduct, or for me to go down there, as he heard there was a charge against him, and that his friends had discarded him and would not see him again till he had cleared it up—I wrote to him on 1st June, saying that I would not waste my money in going after him—it was after that that he came up to London.</p>

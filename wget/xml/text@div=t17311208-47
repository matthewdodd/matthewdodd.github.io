               <p>Andries Millern .</p>
               <p>Accepted 12 July, 1731.</p>
               <p>Payable at Messrs. Knight and Jackson. Pet. Victorin.</p>
               <p>I examin'd the Acceptance very narrowly, suspected it to be counterfeit, and laid it before the Committee. They order'd me to take up the Prisoner. He had other Bills in the Hands of other Officers of the Bank, and had been with us several times within two Months, to have Bills discounted, which were all honourably paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knight. I am Banker to Mr. Victorin. I have seen him write often, and don't believe this Acceptance to be his Hand, for it is not at all like it. I have paid several Bills on him drawn from Stockholm , but remember none drawn by Andries Millern. I never heard that he had such a Correspondent, or even that there was any such Person in being. I have a Bill drawn by Mr. Kireman at Stockholm , on Mr. Victorin, for 200 l. 'Tis endors'd with the Prisoner's Name, and accepted by Mr. Victorin himself. For the Word Accepted, he writes Accep with a d at top; for Payable, Pay with le at top; for Messieurs, Mess with rs at top; and signs Pet. for Peter. All these Particulars agree with the Acceptance on the Bill before the Court, but the Unlikeness is in the Hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Here the Prisoner's Council urged, That it was very unlikely that a Man should himself go to the Bank with Bills to the value of 1000 l. and among 'em one in which the Hand of a Merchant so well known was forged in so gross and bungling a manner, if he himself had known that it was a Forgery; and, That as this Bill came from Holland with other good Bills, and some Lottery-Tickets, they wou'd call a Witness to prove that the Acceptance was wrote in Holland, and the Bill so wrote on inclos'd with others in a Letter. Then they call'd the Witnesses in the Prisoner's Behalf: The first of whom being a Dutch Jow, two Persons, one for the King, and the other for the Prosecutor, were sworn to interpret truly betwixt the Witness and the Court.</p>

            . Yes, but it was not accepted when I put it in the Letter; there was none accepted but the Bill for 450 l.</p>
               <p>Council. Consider a little. If the 450 l. Bill was accepted on the 13th of July, and that and the 200 l. Bill, which was unaccepted, were inclos'd both at one time in one Letter, which Letter was writ the 20th of July, and then put in the Amsterdam Post-Office for London; how could that 200 l. Bill be accepted here on the same Day as the other for 450 l. and 7 Days before the Date of the Letter?</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. The Letter was dated the 20th of July, N. S. which is the 9th with us, and it was received here the 13th, as you may see by the Post-Mark upon it. Is there any thing strange in this?</p>
               <p>Council for the King. No, but there is in supposing that Mr. Victorin should accept a Bill here on the 13th of July, and that this Bill should be afterwards sent to Holland, and put into the Amsterdam Post-Office on the 9th of July.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. We have no need of your Supposition; we say the Date of the Acceptance is N. S. as well as the Date of the Letter.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. Then you can prove that Mr. Victorin went over to Holland to accept this Bill.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. There is no need of that neither. We allow that the Acceptance is forged, and it might be as well forged in one Style as another: We know not who did it, nor does it concern us, if the Defendant is innocent.</p>
               <p>Council for the King. When he went to Mr. Victorin, to get the 200 l. Bill accepted, it would have becom'd his Innocence to have ask'd that Gentleman, how a Bill of his for 450 l. came to be accepted in Holland.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. And so he would without Doubt, if he had had any Suspicion of a Forgery. We shall call one more Witness, 'tis Mr. Hindmarsh, who belongs to the Post-Office. Sir, look on that Letter; do you know it?</p>

Yes, here's the Post-Mark, July 13, and these Figures, 216, are of my making, 'tis the Charge of Postage; a single Letter from Holland is 10 d. an Ounce is 314, when we think they are under an Ounce, we sometimes tax 'em at Discretion; for we cannot be certain of what is in 'em, and we don't tax Bills of Exchange.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to John Biddulph, Martin &amp; Sons, of 68, Lombard Street—on 29th April a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. purporting to be drawn by George Hutt, a customer of our bank, in favour of Mr. Clark, or order, was brought by a person who turned out to be Thomas King—we of course required Clark's endorsement before paying it, and I wrote "Not endorsed" upon it and returned it to King—he went away with it and brought it back endorsed, and r. Martin directed him to go and fetch the man who had given it to him—he brought in the prisoner and I asked him if he was Mr. Clark, he said "Yes" I asked him what the cheque was for, he said "for hoops"—he was asked to write his signature over again and he wrote this second signature in my presence—I then handed him the five sovereigns—this was on Friday—on the following Monday I went to Mr. Hutt's yard and saw the prisoner there, I said to him "You brought this cheque and you had the money"—he said no, he never had it in his hand—I said "You had the five sovereigns"—he said "No"—I took King to Mr. Hutt's yard and told him to look about him; he nodded to the prisoner and said "That is him"—I asked him to tell me where he got the blank cheque, he refused and I gave him into custody.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050026"></xptr>
               <p>I said "There is 68 on the door, Mr. Martin's"—he said "I have got a a cheque I want to get cashed, I never was in a banking-house before and I don't like to get it cashed, will you go in for me?"—I said "I don't mind," and I took it in and it was returned to me to be endorsed—I took it back to the prisoner who said "I can put Mr. Clark's name on it,"—I said "That won't do, you had better take it away and get Mr. Clark's endorsement"—he brought it back in twenty minutes endorsed, and I took it into the bank and gave it to Mr. Howard and while he was looking at it Mr. Barton came across the bank and said "Are you sure this is Mr. Clark's name?"—I said "I do not know, it belongs to a young man outside"—he said "You had better fetch him in"—I fetched the prisoner in and he wrote his name on the back a second time—I went to Mr. Hutt's yard on the Monday and pointed the prisoner out from among others as the man—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I went in with him after the cheque had been changed, to change a sovereign and I also saw him there.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arabin. Was it dark. - A. Yes, they said they wanted Mr. Whitebread.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there more voices than one. - A. Only one answered. I asked what their names was, they said their name was Brown, as I understood them. I told the boy to unbolt the door, and there were three men came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the appearance of these men. - A. The first man had a black face, and a rough brown coat on; a tall man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Was that a black face, or a mask, or how. - A. I cannot say; they took hold of my arm, and my arm was all black. The first man was a tall man, the second man was a man with a light coloured coat on. I cannot recollect the third, I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any one else. - A. Yes, there was one outside the door, there was four in all; the man that was of the outside, he took the door and pulled it to, and when they came in the first man said your life or your money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing at the same time. - A. No, not to me; the second man had fire arms of the same sort as the first. The tall man asked me for my keys, I went into the parlour and took them out of the buffet, he pushed me up stairs before him, and I shewed him where the money was in the secretary; he said that was not all; he took the keys out of the secretary, and made me go to a dressing glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any money out. - A. Yes, out of the secretary he took two ten pound notes and gold, I cannot say rightly the sum of the gold, it was all loose.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you suppose, was there fifteen or twenty guineas. - A. There were more than that; they asked me to shew them the key of the dressing glass, and I did, there was nothing in the drawer; they looked in a closet in the bed room, they did not take any thing from there; then they came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that took the money. - A. The tall man that first came in the dark coloured coat, they went down stairs and went into the parlour, they asked me for my plate, I told them I had none; they looked round the parlour, then they went out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the fact so that there was no plate in the house. - A. There was plate in the house, I told them that there were none.</p>
               <p>Q. They were satisfied that you told them so, had you any considerable quantity of plate in the house. - A. No, we had silver tea spoons, table spoons, and sugar tongs, and things of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the two prisoners at the bar, and see what is your opinion as to their persons only, say as to your belief. - A. I cannot swear to them, they were so disguised, they are about the size of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tall man much of the size of one of the prisoners. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man in the light coloured coat like the least of them. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a coat of the same colour he wears now. - A. Yes, the same colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same make. - A. I did not take notice of the make.</p>
               <p>Harvey. I should have thought that she would know my voice, by seeing me before. - A. Nobody spoke but the first man, he spoke very gruff.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you heard him speak since he was taken up. - A. Yes, but he did not speak the same as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140022"></xptr> he spoke then; he said, Come along, in a very gruff way.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect a knock being given at the door. - A. Yes, I went to the door, I asked who is there, they said they wanted Mr. Whitebread; my mistress asked who was there, they said their name was Brown. I opened the door, and one tall man came in first, the next was a man with a white mask on; the tall man had a black face and a large rough brown coat on. There was a third man came in, I cannot say how he was dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of clothes had the second man on. A. A white coat like that he has on now (witness pointing to Harvey), the second man presented a blunderbuss to my mistress, she run into the parlour and got the keys out of the buffet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told her to go and get the keys. - A. Fordham, the tall man; he took hold of her arms and shoved her up stairs, and another followed her, and one looked inside the stairs and went a little way up. I cannot say how far he went up, he staid there till just as they were coming down, and then he come down before them; when the three men came into the house I had the latch of the door in my hand, they pulled the latch of the door out of my hand, and somebody on the outside pulled it too. When they came down stairs they took the candle and went into the parlour and asked for the plate; my mistress answered I have got no plate; they looked into two or three of the other cupboards, and they found nothing there; they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoners at the bar and see what is your belief respecting them. - A. The tall man is very much like the man that first came into the house, and I think the other is very much like the man that had the white mask on his face and the white coat.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not know that he has been there for this last half year. - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you to see him so frequent when he was at work, did the barge come near to your house. - A. It came past our house, I have seen him in the public house frequently.</p>

Harvey and Vardon asked Fordham and me if we would go and join them, and help get into the house, there was money in the house, and the money was to be got very easily; after a long while we agreed to go with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out. - A. I believe a little before six o'clock in the evening, from the Red lion in Black lion yard, in Whitechapel; we walked towards Stamford hill, and just as we came upon the hill, going across the field to Clapton, by the river Lea, we there made a stop, and agreed who was to go into the house.

I went with Fordham as far as the Peacock, Bethnall green, to his lodgings, he went into his lodgings, and I went on to my lodging; he saying when we parted he should come to my lodgings to-morrow; he accordingly came to my lodgings the next day, on Sunday the day before I was taken up. I then received a pistol from him, and likewise some balls he had run and gave me.</p>

            ; examined by Mr. Gurney. You are a police officer of Hatton Garden office. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 22nd of December, did you with Chapman go in pursuit of Roberts. - A. I did; he was taken by Chapman in my absence, I saw him after Chapman had taken him. In consequence of information that he gave me, I went to a small cook's shop in Hackey Road, where I was informed Harvey lodged; when I entered the house I left Chapman outside of the house, I saw two men in the back room; the prisoner with a handkerchief tied round one of his eyes; the other I believe was the master of the house, he called himself so; I asked the landlord if Harvey lodged there, the man made answer no. I then asked Harvey if his name was not Harvey, he said no; at that time he was reading something, I cannot say whether it was a newspaper or not. I then directed my brother officer to come into the house and take care of him, I had great suspicion that that man was him. I went up stairs to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you go to up stairs. - A. I think the two pair, I am not positive; in a room in a bag I found this mask, I then called out to my brother officer that all was right, to be sure and take care of the man below. I then came down and took Harvey into custody and he acknowledged that his name was Harvey. I told the landlord in Harvey's presence that it was wrong to deny Harvey's lodging there, he admitted it was wrong, and he said he should not have lodged there if he had known such a thing had been, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then ask 
               <persName id="t18070114-12-person249">Harvey</persName>
             any questions concerning of that room. - A. Yes he admitted that he slept there and that this mask was not his, it belonged to another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who that person was. - A. He did not, the landlord said he was a little smith that lodged there. We then took Harvey in a coach to the Peacock on Bethnal Green; I went to the room described where Fordham lodged; when I entered the room I found Fordham laying in the bed, with his hat, shoes, and coat off; all the rest of his things were on.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. It was in the afternoon, it was day light. He lifted up his head and looked in an alarming way; seeing him so restless as that, I pulled out a pistol and said Jack be quiet; he was putting his arm out as if he was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140024"></xptr> to take his coat. I told him if he offered to resist I would blow his brains out. I then called to Chapman to take hold of the coat and to search- it, he searched it, and a pistol was found in one of the pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you handcuff him. - A. Yes, he was handcuffed. I searched the room and found a pair of bullet moulds. While I was in the act of searching about the room and Chapman too, he made a sudden spring, and he, I imagine, meant to run down stairs. He tumbled down stairs and went to the bottom, we caught him and secured him, and we returned up stairs again. This coat was laying in one corner of the room, it has got country dirt on it.</p>

            (to Trott) Did you go to these two lodgings of Fordham and Harvey in pursuance of information given by Roberts. - A. I did, else had it not been for that I should not have known where to find them. I found two papers of powder black, I take it to be lamp black; in the hurry and confusion we were in it was all spilt.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know such a thing as pearl black. - A. I know lamp black, I believe this is lamp black, the inside of that mask shows there has been some blacking in it.</p>

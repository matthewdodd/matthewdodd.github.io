               <p>Q. Could any body have seen it that passed by accidentally? - A. No, it was covered over.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the coals kept? - A. Behind the house, in a place very much exposed to the weather, and there was a great deal of snow among the coals; I got up in the morning and went to the top of the house, where I had the command of the yard, in order to watch; at nine o'clock the men went to breakfast, the prisoner remained in the shop till the last; about five minutes after the rest of the men were gone, I saw him come out of the shop, and go to the place where the copper was concealed; I saw him stoop down and take up something, but his back being turned towards me, I could not see what it was; he then went into the shop again, and I heard a noise, apparently like the found of the same copper, there was no other copper kept near the premises, I had other sheet-copper, but not in that part of the house; I saw him come out of the shop and come up the yard, and go out at the street-door, I desired one of the witnesses to watch him; there was afterwards found, upon the anvil where he had been working, coals and snow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he had been doing with it? - A. It was not rolled up in a compass small enough to put under his coat, and he had been beating it to flat it; I know the found of copper well, and I am sure it was the same.</p>

             sworn. - I am a brazier and ironmonger, I live with my brother: On Monday evening, previous to the discovery, the housekeeper sent one of our lads for some coals, and he brought a piece of copper to me; one of the gentlemen in Court went with me to weigh the copper, it weighed four pounds, it was then marked with my name, and a private mark, and put under the coals, where he had found it; the next morning, by my brother's desire, I concealed myself in the adjacent coal-hole about a quarter before six, and continued there till a quarter after nine, when I saw the prisoner take the same piece of copper from under the coals.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the copper so far hid that it could not have been seen? - A. Yes, it was covered with coals and snow; I saw him carry it into the smith's shop, he knocked it up, and put it under his coat.</p>
               <p>JOHN LAVERS sworn. - I was at the prosecutor's house when the boy brought in some coals, and a piece of copper; we sent for Mr.

             down, he marked the copper, I marked it after him, and we sent him to conceal it where it was; when the prosecutor came home, we went to examine it, and returned it into the same place, and covered it with snow and coals; the prosecutor requested me to stay at his house that night, being a stranger to the prisoner, that I might follow him in the morning to discover where he disposed of this copper: about a quarter after nine the next morning, I saw the prisoner come up the yard, I followed him; he went through three alleys, and at the bottom of Upper Well-alley he went into an iron-shop; I crossed the way, and went into a house with a servant of mine, to watch his return; a few minutes after, the man came out of the house, it is a Jew that keeps the house; he crossed the way, two doors below where I was, to a baker's shop, I suppose to get change, to pay for this copper; he returned to the house, and in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner came out; I walked to the farther end of the passage that be might not suspect I was watching him; I saw no more of the prisoner, but returned to the prosecutor to inform him of what I had observed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the copper here? - A. No; the search-warrant was about five minutes too late, the man had made off with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man went out of the yard you did not see him take the copper at all? - A. No; what I waited to serve my friend for was, to get an opportunity of taking the receiver as well as the thief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that every person who worked for the prosecutor were in the habit of going backwards and forwards to the place where the copper was concealed, and declaring his innocence of the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Sewell and Co. There are four partners; Mr. George Drake Sewell is one; we carry on business as haberdashers and warehousemen in two or three houses connected, in Compton-street, Soho. The prisoner was in our service as principal clerk. On the 18th of Dec, I delivered to him this check—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is my signature—when I gave him that check I knew that Mr. Sewell had some rent to pay to Mr. Gardiner his landlord—I did not know them exact amount at that time—the prisoner told me that he had an appoint<lb></lb>ment with Mr. Gardiner at eleven o'clock to settle the rent—he presented the check to me, and I signed it—I put the name of the house to it—he had the check from me for the purpose of paying the rent—I do not know that I told him what to do with it—he said it was for the purpose of pay<lb></lb>ing Mr. Gardiner's rent—it was in blank as to the sum—it is the common printed form of check—no date was filled in—it was crossed "and Co." when he gave it to me, and the number was filled in—we draw our checks by numbers—on his presenting it to me I signed it, and gave it to him again—I have no recollection of saying anything to him, or he to me—the amount of rent had not been ascertained between the parties—the check was for the special purpose of paying the rent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said by either of you that appropriated the check for that purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that Mr. Sewell had not arrived, and asked whether I would give him a check on the house, and he would exchange it for his private account when he returned—(Mr. Sewell keeps a private account, and the rent was due on his private account)—that passed at the time he presented the check to me, and on that I signed it, and gave it him back again—I have no recollection of anything more passing.</p>

In conse<lb></lb>quence of information I obtained on Saturday, the 28th of Dec, I gaye the prisoner into the custody of Cronin, the policeman—I found him at the corner of Rathbone-place, Oxfords street—he appeared surprised when I gave him into custody, and said ought to have sent to him before I gave him into custody—I told him I bad done so—I had sent to his house two or three times—I was then aware that Trowsan had been sent to him on the 26th—he asked me if Mr. Sewell was at home—I said he was—he said he should wish to see him—I accompanied him with the officer to the house of business in Compton-street—Mr. Sewell was not there when we arriveds but some time afterwards he came in, and, in my presence, he said, "On, Bateman, what have you been doing? you have filled up that blank check, not got the money"—he said he had, as he bad a right so to do, having 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary due to him—Mr. Sewell appealed to me, to know if that. correct—I said I thought not; I believed not more than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 167. I will due to him—Mr. Sewell asked him what he had done with the money—he said he had spent it all, he had not a shilling; and said to Mr. Sewell, "I hope you will forgive me; I will give you all my furniture which cost me 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you will forgive roe"—I have since looked through the books, to ascertain what is due to him—I have the books here—they are in the handwriting of a clerk named Anderson, who has left our employ.</p>

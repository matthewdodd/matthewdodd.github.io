I missed these things, and have never seen them since; I inquired why her husband did not come; she said he was in the country - in about a fortnight afterwards she left her shop of work, and I heard from another lodger that she had not been in my house for two nights; I went up stairs and looked for the key of her door, but could not find it - I looked through the key-hole, and missed the clothes off the bed; I had the door opened, and there was nothing in the room but an old shift of my daughter's, which she had to mend - I know these articles had been in the room, and the prisoner only, had the key of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went out one morning, and when I returned in the evening I found the door had been broken open; I missed the things - her daughter admitted that she had broken open the door and taken the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Lower Sloane-street, Chelsea. The prisoner was my foreman—he was twelve months in my ser vice—it was his duty to take the bread out to his customers, which was daily counted out to him, to deliver what bread they required, return what he had left, and pay me for what he sold—my wife generally gave out the bread—on the 1st of Aug. my wife called me up stairs—I saw the prisoner about twenty-two yards from my premises, standing by the truck—I ordered my brother, who was then coming across from serving a customer, to fetch the truck; and, in consequence of something Mrs. Evans told me, I went to the prisoner, and asked what bread he had in his truck—he said twenty-two quarterns—I said, "John, your countenance betrays you; we will count it"—he turned ghastly pale, and trembled from head to foot—I opened the truck, and counted the bread on the top of the truck in his presence—! found fifty-two two<lb></lb>pound loaves, and five four-pounds—that made nine quarterns more than he ought to have had—I said, "John, you are a pretty scoundrel to rob me iu this whole-sale manner, and now the mystery is unravelled"—he made no reply, but sneaked away—I could not stop him, as the bread was on the truck, and I was fearful of its being stolen—I then went round to my customers, and found four two-pound loaves at one place, which he had left there at his second delivery, which made twenty-two half-quarterns—I gave information to the police, but he was not taken for seven weeks—he had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, four quartern loaves, and half a quartern of flour—he is married—no bread or wages was due to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—it was my custom to deliver the bread to the prisoner. On the 1st of Aug. I delivered to him twenty-two quartern loaves in 2lbs. and 4lbs.—that was the quantity he called out to me—"Twenty-two quarterns, ma'am?"—I said, "Yes, that is correct"—I saw them put into the truck, and afterwards retired into a parlour adjoining the shop—he went down stairs as usual to put down his shirt sleeves—I saw him come up again, and distinctly take four 2lb. loaves from the shelf, and place them in the basket—I called him backhand said, "John, your bread is not booked right;" with that, he said, "Yes, ma'am, twenty-two"—I said, "I am well aware that is booked, but not what you took off the shelf; I dis<lb></lb>tinctly saw you take four 2lb. loaves off the shelf"—he said, "No, ma'am, you make a mistake, thac is what I left on the counter"—I said, "No, you left no bread on the counter, I am sure"—he said, "You make a mistake, you are dreaming"—I instantly called to my husband, and saw the truck searched, thirty-one quarterns was found in it—that was a difference of eleven</p>

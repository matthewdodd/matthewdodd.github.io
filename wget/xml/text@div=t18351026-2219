                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Bailey and Co., St. Paul's Church-yard, linen-drapers.

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Bailey and his partner. About five minutes before one o'clock, I came in from the City—my attention was attracted to the prisoner, she having a cloak on, and from the manner she conducted herself—I saw her in a few minutes shove some prints from the counter, at the same time the young man came round, and said, "Mr. Folkes, that person has stolen some prints"—I sent the man for an officer, with directions to tell him to wait outside the door, and when I tapped a woman on the shoulder to take her into custody—the officer did so—I went with the officer to his house, and saw the basket opened—it contained four or five prints—they were all the prosecutor's.</p>

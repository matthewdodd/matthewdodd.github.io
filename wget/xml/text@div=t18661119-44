                  </hi>. I live in Coburg Street, Drummond Street, and am a hammerman or smith's labourer—on 9th October last I was at Shaw's house—I first went to the Wrekin, in Broad Court, kept by Shaw's father, and from there to the prisoner Shaw's, in Windmill Street, Haymarket—the boy Wilmot asked me would I look after him; I refused at first, but at last he and I went together to the prisoner Shaw's about nine or half-past—we had a drop of something at the bar, and then went upstairs—I did not see Shaw there that I know of—I have often been there before <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>, and Wilmot with me—there is always a ring formed in the room, it is never down, the wall of the room forms one side of it, and the rest is formed by stakes and a rope—Young came up into the room about a quarter of an hour after us, I had Donelly with me—Morris and Daw were there, they were on the other side—I know nothing about those that came up—I took my man into the ring and acted as his second, and Donelly also—Morris and Daw acted as seconds for Young—the men put gloves on; they were new gloves fastened with elastic; one of my elastics broke, and I tied it on with a piece of tape, so that it could not come off—they were stripped as usual to their buff—they had their shirts off, and were naked to the waist—I don't know whether there was a timekeeper—I did not see Flynn there—only what I have heard—I was so excited looking after my boy—it did not matter about having him up to time that is a matter of form—I did not hear any one call "Time"—there were 100 people there—I was in the ring looking after my boy, to see that he was not hurt—Flynn was not in the ring—I can't answer whether he was the referee, I never chose him—I saw Good there—the people occupied seats on both sides of the ring—they fought a succession of rounds, sparring—it continued about an hour, or over an hour I should think—they hit each other of course, I don't know whether as hard as they could, that they know better themselves—they hit as hard as they liked with the gloves—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190074"></xptr>
               <p>I have tutored gentlemen to spar, and when they have got. the gloves on they have got rather rash in their excitement, they can't help it—I don't know what they were fighting for, I never heard—at the last round Wilmot fell either by a shove or a blow from Young, he fell on his posterior and struck his head against a post that runs up in the centre of the ring—the hit was somewhere in the face—I picked him up, he felt rather queer and a little giddy—I gave in for him—I dressed him and gave him a drop of brandy and took him to the hospital in a cab—Good gave him a half-sovereign in his corner—I don't know what it was for, it was before the fight.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you give lessons in this noble science? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at times—I charge half a crown or three shillings, and sometimes a sovereign, whatever a gentleman might give me—I have many a time knocked one of my pupils down, and they have knocked me down—this was a permanent ring, where lessons are given—anybody going there may learn to spar—they have gloves for the purpose—gloves are always put on in learning, it is fighting to use the naked fists—the encounters between teacher and pupil sometimes last half or three-quarters of an hour—I have had two or three hours of it at a time with pupils—it is customary for persons to come in and look on while lessons are being given—I have sometimes known accidents happen in giving lessons, you cannot help it—I broke a gentleman's jaw myself in sparring—I never meant to do it, but he was rather rash, and I thought to stop him somehow, I put the jaw right out—I knew Young—I did not know Wilmot, I had seen him once or twice, that was all, they were good friends.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEASLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it given just before the fight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never knew a death to happen in these sparrings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not generally a timekeeper on these occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, this was not a prize<lb></lb>fight—there was no timekeeper that I am aware of—the thing comes to an end by giving in for them—my boy was winning fast, and I wanted the other lad's father to give in for him, but he would not, and the consequence was, my boy met with this misfortune—you would not allow a man to wait for a quarter of an hour before coming up; if your man was not fit to stand up and spar you would give in for him—they go on till one of them gives in, it don't want any timekeeping—they get bruised about the arms of course—if you keep tapping the head it will weaken and confuse them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEASLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anytime allowed between each round? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was according to your own judgment—if a man is hit in the nose with the gloves it will make his nose bleed—the gloves will not give black eyes unless you have a very hard pair, but these were a new pair—I did not take my man on my knee at every round—I sat him on another man's lap, because I had to fan him and attend to him—at a prize<lb></lb>fight there is a regular fixed time, but not in these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes a round; is it that the men keep on fighting till one is knocked down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, till one slips down, then he is picked up, and if he has a mind to have any more they go on again—they get knocked down at times.</p>

               <p>at Shaw's, in Windmill Street—I had been at the Wrekin first—I had a card, which I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for—I bought it of one of my customers—it is a <hi rend="italic">facsimile</hi> to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I got to the Wrekin I was given to understand that it would not take place there, and I was sent to Shaw's son's, in Windmill Street—I produced my ticket, and was admitted by a person standing in the passage, who took all the tickets—that was not Shaw himself—I saw him in the bar that night, and I saw him when he came up into the room and put an end to it by turning the gas off—I did not see him in the room during the sparring—the room was fitted up for sparring—I saw Young and Wilmot set to with the gloves—it continued little under an hour—at the end of that time they seemed to be so tired and fatigued that they could not strike many blows—they could not come up—I did not observe whether there was a time-keeper—I heard two or three people calling out "Time," half-a-dozen—I cannot say that I heard any of the prisoners—the men were tardy in coming up—I believe they should come up as soon as they got up again, but I am not acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> of these things—the seconds took them up and gave them a glass of water, and put them on their knees every time—at the last round they came up, and all in a stumble together, and had a hugging match—they were too exhausted to strike one another forcible blows—they were trying to throw each other, and the deceased slipped away, or was thrown away from the prisoner Young—he was not struck down by the blow—he got up, and wanted to come up again, but they would not allow him—the spectators kept on crying out "Time"—I do not know whether Evans gave in for him, but Shaw came in and put an end to it, and turned off the gas—I should say there, were about 100 persons there—there were seats—I do not know whether some were more expense than others—I was never there before—I saw Good there—I heard him tell the deceased not to wrestle, not to allow him to be hugged—that was at the beginning of the contest—when I left the deceased appeared to be in a fainting state—he was breathing heavily, as if he had fainted from exhaustion and fatigue.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector C</hi>). On the 14th October I went to Flynn's house—I charged him with being concerned with others in aid<lb></lb>ing and abetting and causing the death of a man named Wilmot, at the Queen's Head public-house, Queen's Head Court, Great Windmill Street, kept by the prisoner Shaw—he said, "It is a bad job for all of us; I was there keeping time for them; you do not want to take me out of my business to-night, I have a house full of people"—I said, "No"—I made an appointment, and he met me the following morning—I received this card from the prisoner Shaw on the 10th, the night after the occurrence.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon on the 9th October at Charing Cross Hospital, when the deceased Edward Wilmot was brought there, a little before twelve—he was quite insensible—we put him to bed, and did everything we could for him, but he died about half-past five the next morning—he was never sensible the whole time—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found the right arm, the chest, and the face very extensively bruised all over, and the head was extensively bruised—on taking off the scalp I found several bruises, one larger than the rest just over the right ear—there was a large collection of blood, and a rupture of one of the arteries that goes to the membrane of the brain—that rupture coincided exactly with the larger bruise that I found externally on the right side of the head, about two inches above the right ear—that would cause pressure of blood on the brain and consequent death—I think the external appearances were exactly such as I should expect to find from blows by the fist with gloves on—they were large bruises—if he had lived a little longer the arm and face would have been completely black—the flesh was cut from the lips by the teeth—the brain was very healthy, and there was nothing at all the matter with the man that I saw—the appearances before death and those afterwards perfectly coincided—I attribute the collection of blood to the bruises—a blow or fall would cause such injury—it must have been a severe one—I should think the blow with the gloves would do it—I have seen some of them very hard—I saw some produced at the inquest.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I produce some gloves which. I received from the prisoner Shaw the day after—I asked for them, and he ordered them to be fetched down by his servant, and said, "These were the gloves used on the occasion"—the elastic to one is broken.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AIRY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I think these gloves on a man's hand might produce such a bruise as would occasion the extravasation of blood I found in the skull.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GOUGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you open the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, only the head—I thought, from the symptoms I saw during life, that death was caused by some injury in the head, and on opening the head and finding the injury I proceeded no further—the effusion of blood might be accounted for by apoplexy, but this was a young man only twenty-two, and you never find it in a young man, and there was the external bruises exactly corresponding with the internal injuries, and there was no disease apparent—there is a disease called aneurism—if it had arisen from that I could have detected it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Good. Q.</hi> How long was it after he was first brought to the hospital that he received any attention from a medical man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think within two minutes—nothing could have saved him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you think a person sparring with such gloves as these in the way that has been described would be dangerous to human life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so, decidedly—I think the man might be knocked so thoroughly silly by a blow about the face that he might die from it, especially if he were liable to any disease—a man might die from the blow of a cricket ball much sooner than by such blows as these—death would not be a likely result—I should think a very unlikely result—I should fancy that danger in sparring with gloves would be where a person is able to strike a straight blow—when they get weak the danger would be weakened, because I do not see how the gloves could do any injury except from a direct blow.</p>

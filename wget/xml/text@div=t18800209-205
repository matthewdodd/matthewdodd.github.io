                  </hi>. I live in West Street, Bromley, and am cashier at the head office of the Union Bank, Princes Street—at about 1.30 on 7th January the prisoner and another man came into the bank—the prisoner presented this bill for payment (<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 28, 1879, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">at two months after date, to the order of Edward Raby, Esq. Accepted. Payable at the Union Bank of London. Fruhling and Goschen. Endorsed, E. Raby</hi>)—we have no customers named Fruhling and Goschen—I had no authority to pay it—I communicated with the chief cashier, and he sent me to Fruhling and Goschen—subsequently a constable was called in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a fellow-clerk in the bank named Nathaniel G. Dodworth—I believe the prisoner came two days before to the bank with Parrot—on 7th January they came two days before to the bank with Lewis at the Mansion House withdrew the case against Parrot, and he was discharged—when the prisoner handed me the bill I said. "What a moment and I shall be able to attend to your bill"—I was attending to some gentle<lb></lb>man who had presented a cheque—the chief cashier asked him into the private parlour, and they waited about an hour while we were making inquiries—then a constable was brought in, and they were given in custody—I have seen a good many bills—this bill is drawn in a usual form for a Foreign merchant—it would be my business before paying it to see that it had a foreign bill stamp on, and had it been genuine I should have returned</p>

               <p>it for a stamp—I have frequently seen them presented without a stamp, and have returned them—I cannot say whether it is in foreign writing or not—there is a certain difference between English and foreign writing—it is not a thing I could speak positively to.</p>

Alexander H. Goschen. I am a member of the firm of Fruhling and Goschen, bankers and merchants, of 12, Austin Friars—the signature to this bill is not ours, nor was it written with our authority—the drawers are correspondents of ours—they do not as a rule draw on us for large amounts.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I was called to the Union Bank on 7th January, where I saw the prisoner—I said, "This bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a forged bill"—he said, "I got it over a net; I had a big net with a man named Schlotte; I bet him four monkeys to one about Bagman for the Cambridge, and I afterwards had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to draw of Schlotte. I saw him one day at the Criterion and ho gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he afterwards sent me this bill and another bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," which he produced, "as payment for the other 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He sent them with this letter," handing it to me—I said, "Have you the envelope in which the letter came?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you acknowledge the receipt of it?" and he said "No"—I asked him where Schlotte could be found, and he said he did not know—he said "I called at the bank the day before yesterday and asked if Fruhling and Goschen kept an account there, and I was told they did not"—I took him to the Old Jewry police office and told him he would be charged with uttering this bill knowing it to be forged—I understand by "monkey" 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if he had lost he would have had to give the other man 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was addressed to Edward Baby, Esq.</hi>, 2, <hi rend="italic">York Terraes, London, from E.

               <p>prisoner to cash the bill because he owed him some money; but previously he had been to his solicitor, and he advised him to present it—I don't think he said in company with Raby—he said he went the day before yesterday to the bank to ask if Fruhling and Co. kept an account there—he did not say that Raby put his name on the bill—one of the prisoners said that Mrs. Parrot had been to Fruhling and Goschen's to make inquiries, as she could speak German.</p>
               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">LUNAU</hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Kleinwort and Co., of Fenchurch Street—this bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be an acceptance of my employers, is a forgery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw those notes sold in the streets—I have often been on the racecourse—I don't suppose a betting man would take a Bank of Engraving note for a moment—I notice they generally look at what they take—an entry in the book has evidently been altered from Schlotte, and another name written over it.</p>

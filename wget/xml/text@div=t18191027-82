I gave him in charge; there was no lock on my chest - I was present, and heard him say that he had seen a black man take them. At last I offered him a 1 l. note to say where they were. He then said he had taken the things and pledged them.</p>

            . On Saturday evening, the 4th of October, the prisoner came to Mr. Hart's shop, who is a salesman. He said he was in distress, and sold me the duplicates of the property - I let him have 3 s. on them then, and was to give him 7 s. more when I had seen the things - they were in pledge for 23 s. I redeemed them - he never came for the 7 s.</p>

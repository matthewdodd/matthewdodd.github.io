                  </hi>. I keep the Neville Arms. On 18th July I saw the prisoner in my house, between 4 and 5 o'clock—a neighbour came into the skittle ground, and asked me to go into the bar, which I did, and I gave some caution to my wife—soon after that I went to a bowl, and found a six<lb></lb>pence there—I doubled it, and my wife put it on a shelf—when the prisoner left my bar, he went to No. 9, opposite, not more than fifty yards off—I saw him again in about twenty minutes—he came for a pint of beer—I served him—he gave me a sixpence—I put it on the counter, and had four penny pieces to give him in change, but I saw the sixpence was bad, and I told him it was no use to come with that money there—I doubled up the sixpence by the tester, and told him to pay me for my beer in good money—he paid two penny pieces—I told him about the other sixpence, and told him to make it good—he said he could not—I waited some considerable time to see whether he could pay me, or get some one to pay me—I would not let him go till he paid—after a delay of half an hour, or three quarters of an hour, when I found he could not, I sent for a constable—the second sixpence was picked up in front of the bar, by a person who saw it dropped—it was given me by Dixon—I handed it to the constable—I also gave him the one that had been bent before, and which was on the shelf—the prisoner had not been in my house before, to my knowledge—he did not say how he became possessed of the sixpences.</p>

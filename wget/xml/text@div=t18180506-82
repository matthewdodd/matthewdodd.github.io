On the 15th of April I had been to receive my pension, and met the prisoner, Dyer, at the corner of Essex-street. I went to a house in <placeName id="t18180506-82-crimeloc459">Sugarloaf-court</placeName>

The other prisoner came into the room, knocked me down, and took my money out of my breeches pocket-the female prisoner assisted him. They tore my handkerchief off, and pushed me out of doors. I gave information at the watch-house - We were all taken there. Next morning, as we were going before the magistrate, Le Keux told me to say I did not know who robbed me, and he would get my handkerchief and return the money. He came into the room out of a loft. I had been drinking.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 16th of April, I was fetched to Sugarloaf-court, and saw the prosecutor lying down with his head against the door of the house - He said he had been robbed. I broke the door open, and found the prisoner, Le Keux in the loft-Dyer was in the top room. I asked her how much money she had? she said half a crown - I found that and 5s. more on her.</p>

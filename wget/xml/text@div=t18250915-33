The prisoner was in our service about three months - this kerseymere is our property; I know it by the colour, the selvidge, and the quality. On the 1st of August I gave directions to William Maton to measure eight or ten yards of cloth, and send it for the prisoner to cut: when it came down there was about two yards or two yards and a quarter, missing; but I was not then at home. On the 12th of August there were two yards more missing from a piece which Maton had measured by my orders the day before: I then called the prisoner and asked him about it, and he confessed that he had taken the cloth out in his hat, and said it was the first he had taken: this piece of cloth was found in his drawer in his room. He is married and has three children - he had a good character.</p>

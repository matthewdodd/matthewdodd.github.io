                  </hi>. I am going on for sixteen years old—I was a chair-caner, and have been out of work for about a month. I know the shop of Mr. Laman, a pork-butcher—I do not know what street it is in—I have heard people say it is his shop—I was standing at the window, seeing them stick pigs, on a Wednesday, two or three weeks ago, about five o'clock in the evening—I saw Hagan in the shop—he took a bit of pork, which stood on a board at the window, and put it behind him—Burns was standing behind him, with a bag, and put it into the bag—Hagan then took up a piece of beef, and put it behind him to Burns, who put it into the bag—Burns went out first, and Hagan after him—I went in and told the mistress, and went after them with her—I saw them within five minutes' walk of the shop—</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 10th of February, Carlile gave me information—I was in the shop serving two customers—I saw two men come in, and handle the meat which laid on the show-board, they went out for a few minutes—I then missed the 3lbs. of pork, and was looking for it, Carlile came in at the same instant, and I missed the beef—I went out directly, and followed them by Carlile's direction—I came up to two men in the next street—one had a bag in his band with the meat in it—I took him, and brought him back to the shop, and gave him to the police<lb></lb>man, but I do not know which that was—he was kept in custody—I sent him to the station by Winter, my servant—the policeman was there, and took him into the shop—I know the prisoners to be the men I saw it Hatton-garden—I had seen the beef and pork five or ten minutes before.</p>

               <p>By what? - There is a small hole upon the knee of the breeches, which I remember before I lost them; here are two or three of the buttons come off.</p>
               <p>Court. You have found out that now; but suppose you had met with them at an old clothes shop, how would you have known them to be yours? - I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040024"></xptr> the coat by the buttons of the coat, I am sure of the shirt, it is marked R. S. and some plaits of the neck out; I know the buckles, there is a stone out of each of the knee-buckles.</p>
               <p>What do you know the stock-buckle by? - Because it is the fellow of the knee-buckles.</p>
               <p>Are not they common stone buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had this man been in your room the day you lost your things? - In the morning he had, he used to sleep along with me, I missed my things in the evening; he did not come to his bed that night; I went after him the next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Feltham, On the 15th of October, I left home to go to Kingston, about nine o'clock in the morning—I had these notes and cash in a bag, in my pocket, and got into a cart, which the prisoner Newman was driving—we got to Coxen's beer shop—I saw Hatch there, and Mr. Coxen, and Newman—I sat down to drink till about three o'clock in the afternoon, with the prisoners—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for drink, out of my bag, and put the bag into my left-hand breeches pocket again—I was sitting on the settle—I stopped there till about three o'clock, as Coxen owed me a sovereign—there were several sitting on the same set<lb></lb>tle, and it was thrown over for the purpose, as I suppose, of taking my money—Newman was on the settle—Coxen and Hatch stood behind—I got up again—I kept my hand in my pocket all the time, and my money</p>

               <p>was safe—directly I could recover myself, I went out to the privacy—I had had a little beer, but I knew what I was doing—when I bad been out fire or ten minutes, Newman and Hatche followed me—Hatch came close to me, hustled me, and took the money out of my pocket—I asked him what he had got out—Newman directly said to me, "Have you got the blunt all right, old boy?" I said, "No, you have got it"—Hatch was there—as soon as Newman spoke, Hatch went in at the back door, to Mr. Coken's—New<lb></lb>man and I went in at the front—I told them in the room that they had taken my money—it was pretty full—I said Newman and Hatch had they were all searched in the room, and no money found—they could not have got away, for Coxen stood at one door, and Thomas Benn at another—this was a little after three o'clock—I have known Newman ten or twelve years, and Hatch, I believe, worked for Mr. Coxen.</p>

I went to Coxen's on the 10th of October—I saw his wife only—I went again on the 17th, and saw Coxen in the evening at his house, after I hed been to Coln<lb></lb>brook fair to look for him, but could not find him—his wife said he was there—I told him I called to make inquiries about littlewood's losing the sovereigns—I said I supposed the <hi rend="italic">gilt</hi> was disposed of, but if he could re<lb></lb>turned the notes, they would be of great service to him, and he could ill af<lb></lb>ford to lose it—Coxen then said, <hi rend="italic">"Them</hi> that took it has not got it"—I said, very likely not, but if the soft, (meaning the notes,) could be returned, it might be done in any way, and he not know where it came from—Coxen said, "<hi rend="italic">they</hi> are gone to the ashes"—I think he added, "No doubt; don't you think they are?"</p>

             was breaking the glass, and the prisoner standing by the side of her; I went out and took Mary Vallance by the shoulder, and told her what I saw her do; and I having nobody in the shop let her go; I took her afterwards to Marlborough-street, and she was committed for a misdemeanor, for breaking the window; and, about six in the evening, there had been a piece of paper put over about half the square that had sell out, it was fastened by some large pieces of stuffs, and I went into the back shop and put down some things; I had not been gone three minutes, when I saw the prisoner with her hand in the window taking out the lace, I was then at the further end of the front shop; as I was returning from the back shop, I saw the candlestick that stood behind the sheet of paper reel as if it was going to fall; there were eighty-one yards and a half of lace gone; I did not see the lace in her hand, but I saw her hand in the window, and they were gone when I went to the window to look.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes; there was a vacancy where the candles were put in not filled up; and I could very plainly see her arm in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. But how are you sure it was her arm? - A. From the appearance of her clothes and dress; I had seen her so many times before, I am just as clear as if I had seen her face that it was her; I went to the window but she was gone, before I could scarcely move she was clearly gone; I went about half an hour after to give information at Marlborough-street and she was there talking to

               <p>Q. What was the value of the lace? - A. Fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw these women, in the morning, how long had you an opportunity of observing the prisoner? - A. I heard a noise, I went to the door immediately, and they were walking up the street, and I looked after them some time, I did not see their faces; the second time I observed her for ten minutes, but did not see her face then.</p>

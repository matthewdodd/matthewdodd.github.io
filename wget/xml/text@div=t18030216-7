               <p>WILLIAM GRIFFITHS sworn. - I am a journey man baker; I met the prisoner on Tuesday morning, the 1st of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock, in Bruton-street, near Berkeley-square; I took particular notice of him; I stopped the corner of Conduit-street ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I saw the prisoner coming with four loaves under his arm; I followed him from Marlborough-street into Poland-street; I came up to him, and said, baker, whose bread is that you have got there? he said, it belonged to Mr. Cook, of Covent-garden, that he lived with him; I told him, I knew that was false; for I knew he was out of place; he began to abuse me, and I said, I would follow him till I saw where he left the bread; I followed him to Crown-court, he then stopped, and began crying, and said, he had taken them out of a baker's basket in Grosvenor-square; he said, he knew the basket, and would take them back again, if I would let him; I told him, there was a great deal of bread lost in that quarter, and I would not. I gave him into the care of Jackson, an officer of Marlborough-street; I left three loaves with Jackson, and took one up to Mr. Harrison's. The prisoner had described a barrow that he took them out of with two baskets without handles, and I knew it to be Mr. Harrison's. I marked the bottom of the loaf with a cross with a knife.</p>

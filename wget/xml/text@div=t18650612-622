                  </hi>. I am an inspector of meat in Newgate-market—on the morning of 8th April, my attention was called to a hamper, with a pig in it, by Mr. Forsbrey—it was dressed as for market—I saw it was four quarters of a pig, and a head, less the milk-bag, the kidneys and the flare—these were absent—they are ordinarily sent up with the animal—they indicate very clearly whether the animal is in health or not, especially a sow pig, dying from inflammation—the meat was in a very high state of inflammation, clearly showing that the animal had died, and must have laid dead some time previous to being dressed—it was totally unfit for human food—on 1st May, I went to Leicester and saw the prisoner—I cautioned him to be careful as to what he said, as I had come down to make inquiries about a pig he had sent to London—he then said, "Well, I shall not say anything about it"—later in the day, I saw him, in company with Sergeant Newell, of Leicester, and showed him the note I had from the hamper, and the label—he said, "The note is in my writing. The label was written by my direction. I bought the pig of a Mr. Wheatley, a neighbour of mine, for 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I have got myself into trouble and must get out of it"—I produced this paper and label—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> Sir, please to show this to the inspector, before offered to sale—James Loseby, Leicester—Robert Davis"</p>

The prisoner was occasionally employed in No. 1 warehouse, for about a twelvemonth—between four and five o'clock in the evening of the 29th of October I saw him going out of the west-gate—I stopped him—I said, "I think you carry something in your hat"—he said, "No"—he took his hat off—I said, "I must see," and in the hat I found 5lbs. weight of sugar—I asked where he got it from—he said, "No. 1 warehouse"—I said, "Do you mean the Crescent-warehouse?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "From a cask or bag?"—he said, "The bag was open, and I took it, I hope you will take it no farther?"—I said, "I have suspected you some time."</p>

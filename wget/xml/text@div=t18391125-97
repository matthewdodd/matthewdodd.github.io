                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live in London-street, Ratcliffe. I have known the prisoner about two years—I have occasionally employed him for steering the craft up and down the canal—I was at the Rose and Crown public-house on the 29th of September—the prisoner came in with another man afterwards—while I was passing to go out, the other man held me, while the prisoner took my money out <hi rend="italic">of</hi> my pocket—he took four shillings and one sixpence—I called the landlord—I held him—in five or six minutes the man who were with him got away—they threat<lb></lb>ened to <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my head for interfering with them—I accused the prisoner of robbing me—the landlord came—I kept the prisoner—the landlord searched him—he said he had no money, and none was found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Rose and Crown public-house at Cambridge-heath, Hackney. I was in the tap-room, and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor near the door coming out—the prisoner and his companions stopped him, and made a sort of hustle—as soon as the prosecutor got away, he called out to the landlord, and told him he had been robbed—While he was telling the landlord I saw the prisoner take something from his mouth, and give it to the other man—I told my master, who sent me for a police<lb></lb>man—when I came back the other man was gone.</p>

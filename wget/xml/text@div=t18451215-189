I left the tap at a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after eleven o'clock—the parlour window was closed, but had no fastening to it—I left by the street-door, which I closed after me, and left the premises safe—there were forty or fifty cheroots left in a box—I left 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., worth of cop<lb></lb>per in the till—I returned about a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning, and found the premises apparently safe—I entered at the front door, as usual—the parlour window appeared as I had left it—I found a door open leading from the tap into the brewhouse—that door was shut the night before, and bolted inside—there is a yard which a person could get to from the adjoining premises, and from that to the parlour window, and then to the tap—I missed the copper money in the morning—the policeman afterwards produced some—there was a halfpenny among it which I have not a doubt about—it has been punched on one side five or six times and become hollow, and is round on the other—I had offered it several times, and it was refused—this is it—the policeman produced twenty or thirty cheroots, which were of the same quality as those lost—this apron I wore the day previous up to eleven o'clock at night on the 20th—I left it behind.</p>

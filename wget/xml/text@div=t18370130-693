                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Walker, of St. Andrew's road, Newington—he is my uncle, and keeps a chandler's shop. On the 21st of January, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came for a pennyworth of tobacco—he offered me a shilling—I gave him 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the tobacco—I did not observe the shilling at that time, but I went into the parlour to put it into the slip of the bureau, where we generally put our silver, and I discovered it was slippery—I examined it further, and found it was bad—I put it into my pocket, where there was no other money, and gave it my uncle when he came, about two hours after—on the 24th, the prisoner came again, about seven o'clock, for a penny candle—he gave me a shil<lb></lb>ling—I did not give him change, but went into the room and called my uncle, and gave him the shilling—he kept it in his hand—I had tried whether it was a good one, and found it was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the uncle of John Wallis. He called me into the shop about seven o'clock on Tuesday, the 24th of January—I found the prisoner there—my nephew had given me a bad shilling—I said, "This is a bad shilling"—the prisoner said, "I don't know"—I said, "You know it is bad; how did you obtain it?"—he said, "I got it from a person that I bad been carrying a parcel for over London Bridge"—I said, "You are the person that brought the counterfeit shilling last Saturday evening, and my lad gave you 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change"—I closed the door, and sent for a policeman—I asked where he lived—he said, "In Wellington-place"—I said, "It is a very nice place," because I had one or two before who came from that place to utter money—on the Saturday previous my nephew had given me a bad shilling—I laid it on the counter, and then I took it into the par<lb></lb>lour, and put it under a China ornament, I gave it to the policeman, with the other one—the second never passed from my hand till I gave it to the policeman.</p>

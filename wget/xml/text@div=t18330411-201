On the evening of the 22nd of February I was sitting in my parlour between six and seven o'clock; I heard a knock at the door; I got up, opened the door, and saw the two prisoners - they both asked if Mr. Lower was at home - I said, No, he was not - Williams then asked what time I expected him - I said it was rather uncertain, as he never came home at one hour - he said, "He is a tailor" - I said, Yes - he said he wanted to be measured for a suit of clothes - I asked him if Mr. Lower knew he was coming - he said No- he then said, "If you will give me pen, ink, and paper, I will write the direction down" - I went into the back parlour to get pen, ink, and paper - they both came into the room - they had at first knocked at my front parlour door, which opens very near to the street door - the street door was shut - they came in some how - I do not know how, but I saw a latch-key afterwards found on Williams - I do not know of any other means they had of getting in but by that key - when they got into the back parlour I had got the pen in my hand, and Williams struck me on the head with a crow-bar, and then Rogers put all his fingers into my mouth, to stop my breath; and said if I made any noise he would murder me with the crow-bar - there were two knocks at the street door the prisoners left me in the back parlour, and went out - they opened the street door, and I heard them say, Go in to the old woman, for she has been murdered" - they said that to Reuben Wheeler, who had given the two knocks at the door - I came out, and cried, "Murder; it is them that came to murder me; there they are; there they go" - Wheeler ran after them, and Williams was brought back by the Police - I said, "You are the man who came to murder me" - my mouth was all pouring out with blood, and my head, where I had received the blow; the blood from my mouth was occasioned by Rogers forcing his fingers into my mouth, to try to strangle me - it was done by main force; it gave me great pain, and I could not eat any thing but what was cold for some time, my mouth was so sore - I feel the effects of the blow on my head to this day; I went to a surgeon, and

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Grafton your first husband's name? A. Yes: I never married a soldier - I never knew one; I never married any one but Grafton and Lower - I married Lower here in the City, near Cheapside; I forget the name of the church - it is ten or eleven years ago; I cannot tell what street it was in, nor the parish, nor the name of the clergyman - I could tell if I was at home; I have no certificate - I was married as a widow; I married Grafton at St. Martin's church; I cannot tell how long it is ago - I lived with him three or four years; I married Lower five, or six, or seven years ago - my maiden name was Vaughan; my father's name was Vaughan, but he died while I was young - I do not know my own age; I do not know when I married Lower - I had no friends with me at the marriage.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now let me caution you, it is a very serious thing, the lives of the prisoners are in question; upon the solemn oath you have taken, were you ever married to Lower? A. I said I was; I do not wish to swear I was- I do not swear that I was; I have been known by the name of Lower eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was any body present when you received the blows? A. No one but myself. I was sworn to tell the truth, but when I said I was married to Lower, I did not understand the question; I never was married to Reading - I do not know the name; I was never married to any person except Grafton - I never lived with any man except Grafton and Lower.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon the solemn you have taken) and you may go to Newgate if you tell lies), did you ever live with any man except Lower and Grafton? A. Not live with him, I cohabited with him; his name was Harper, he was porter to a wine-merchant - I do not know whether he is alive or not; I lived with him about nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you were not married to Harper? Yes, I was married to him; I cannot swear that he is dead.</p>

               <p>when the Queen was going to the House—whilst I was standing there, I felt something in my pocket—I turned my head, and saw the policeman holding the prisoner—my handkerchief was half out of my pocket—this now produced is it—the prisoner asked me to forgive him.</p>

I was in Parliament-street about half-past two o'clock yesterday, as the Queen was going down—I saw the prosecutor standing there looking—I saw the prisoner close behind him—suspecting him, I watched, and saw him gently drawing the hand<lb></lb>kerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—I laid hold of his hand, and the handkerchief at the same time—a small portion of the handkerchief was in his pocket then, but in twisting away it got out—he had the greatest portion of it out—I took him into custody, and in searching him at the station, I found these other two handkerchiefs on him—they are both marked—he said he had been out of work a long time, and hoped the gen<lb></lb>tleman would not press the charge against him—I had great difficulty in getting the prosecutor here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>, I did not take the handkerchief, or intend to take it; I was standing by the gentleman, looking at the procession; there were five or six besides me round him; I have held some very good situa<lb></lb>tions, but have been out of work a long time.</p>

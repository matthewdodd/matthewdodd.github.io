            . I am servant to Sir H. Lushington. On Monday the 30th of July, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the door, which leads to the passage from the area, was opened by some person, I had latched it ten minutes before, and went to sit in a room with my fellow servants and heard it open. I immediately ran into the area - a person said a man had just ran up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120083"></xptr>steps with some things under his arm - we ran after him, I caught sight of him twice with the things - I will not swear to the prisoner. I still followed and got to Berkley-mews; he dropped the things - I picked them up, and still followed - the prisoner was taken in Adam-street, West, he had the same kind of coat on, and appeared the same man. The things were Sir H. Lushington's property.</p>

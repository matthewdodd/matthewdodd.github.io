I have known the prisoner many years; she and her husband were in my employ in February last. She had access to the warehouse, and to the sitting-room, which the family used. On Friday, the 7th of February, I received a dividend at the Bank, of 61 l. 10 s., it consisted of six 10 l. notes, a sovereign, and a half sovereign. Mr. Bazing is my son-in-law; I paid him the next morning four of the same 10 l. notes, I received at the Bank; twenty-one sovereigns, and a half sovereign. I have no doubt that I paid him four of the same notes I received at the Bank.</p>

            . I am a timber-merchant, and live at Pangbourn, Berks. At the time in question, I was living with my father-in-law, the last witness, and about the 7th of February, I received from him, four 10 l. notes, and 21 l. 10 s. in gold - I recollect that the notes were new. I immediately took the money down stairs, and asked my wife for her purse; she said it was in her reticule - I took the purse out of the reticule, put the notes in it, and returned it to the reticule, and saw no more of it - I kept the gold myself. On the 1st of March, in consequence of what my wife said, I went to Bow-street, got a search warrant, and went to my father-in-law's house at Hampstead, and saw the prisoner on her return from dinner. I was not present when the officer searched her; but I afterwards went with him to her house, in Horse and Groom-yard - we there found a box, which was locked; we took the box to my father-in-law's, and the prisoner produced a key, which opened it, and in it we found my wife's purse, containing two 10 l. notes, and a 5 l. note, which the officer took into his possession.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 8th of February, I saw him put the 10 l. notes into my purse; I had no occasion to look at them for a fortnight after, when I changed one of the 10 l. notes and received 7 l. in change. I gave my brother change on the 27th, for a 5 l. note, which I also put into my purse, and put that into my reticule, and laid the reticule on the piano-forte, in the sitting-room, at my father's house, and on the 28th, I missed my reticule, and its contents; there was a quarter of a hundred of needles also in it.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 1st of March, I accompanied Mr. Bazing to Mr. Paxon's, and saw the prisoner in the counting-house, sitting at work - I searched her, and found in her pocket, a 5 l. note, put into a small piece of leopard skin. I then went to her own house, where I found a box, which I brought to Mr. Paxon's, and asked her for the key of it - she said she had something to say to me; I had neither promised or threatened her; she gave me the key, and said she found the purse on the ground, that the purse was in that box - I opened the box, and found two 10 l. notes, a 5 l. note, and a paper of needles, inside the purse. She said she had paid a butcher's bill with part of the money. While she was untying her pockets, I thought she was a long time about it; she threw her pockets on the sofa, and some gold was afterwards found on the sofa.</p>
               <p>MRS. BAZING. The purse is mine; the needles are No. 7, which is the size I lost. I went out with my brother on the 27th, after seeing it safe, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and took my reticule with me, and brought it back. I had no occasion to open it while I was out.</p>

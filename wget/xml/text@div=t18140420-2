            . I live at the King's Arms, Duke-street, Grosvener-square. On the 15th of March, the prisoner came to our house; a girl and another woman was with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure as to the person of the prisoner - A. Yes, I am quite sure. They came to get something to drink, I believe it was gin; I do not recollect which of them asked for it. One of them asked for it; my brother gave them a glass of gin. Mr. Johnson, the officer, came in at the time. I believe they all drank; the prisoner paid me for the liquor. Before the shilling was paid me Johnson came in. I took the shilling and gave it to my brother, Bird; he and Johnson marked the shilling. I am sure the shilling I received of the prisoner I gave to my brother, Bird.</p>

I examined the shilling; I desired them to change the shilling, but Johnson being present he desired me to keep it; I did. I marked the shilling before I parted with it. Johnson desired me to assist him in taking them into a room that he might search them; which I did. I kept the shilling in my hand which my sister gave me, and the woman gave my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200004"></xptr>sister. I saw them all searched. Mrs. Williams was first searched; at the time she was searched I heard something drop from her daughter; on hearing something drop Johnson, the officer, in my presence turned and picked up a paper parcel containing bad shillings; Johnson picked it up by the daughter's leg: the mother was about five feet distance from the girl. Johnson returned to the mother again, and searched her, and found a quantity of bad coin; how much I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know when you parted with the shilling that you received of your sister - A. I parted with it the same evening to Johnson, the officer. I marked it before I parted with it.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the woman at the bar - A. I do; I have known her about a week before she was taken in custody. On the 15th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner, her daughter, and another woman, in St. Giles's; I followed them up Tottenham-court-road, and proceeded into Duke-street, Grosvener-square; I observed in my journey something in their hands. I saw them do a thing that I can describe before they came to Mr. Bird's house. I saw them take some money out of a paper and teare the paper, and chuck it in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you sufficiently discover that it was money - A. I saw it was something white; I was not near enough to discover it was money.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did that pass that you supposed to be money - A. From the prisoner. I saw them all go into Mr. Bird's house; I followed them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Miss Holman - A. I desired her to deal with them if they were so disposed. When I went in I heard the prisoner ask for something to drink, and saw her tender a shilling for the gin; Mr. Bird refused the shilling; the prisoner said, sir, it cannot be a bad one, take it to the light and look.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the gin came to - A. No.</p>




               <p>Mr. Bird. The glass of gin and a glass of mixed spirits came to sixpence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I told Mr. Bird when he came into the light in the tap-room to keep the shilling, and I would go out and bring the prisoners into the taproom and search them. I brought the prisoners into the tap-room and searched them. In the first place I produce the shilling I received of Mr. Bird; he marked it, and I marked it; this is the shilling. I proceeded to search the prisoner at the bar, but hearing something fall from the girl I left the mother and picked the parcel up, which laid close by the girl's feet; the paper parcel contained four bad shillings. These are the four bad shillings; they have been in my custody ever since. At the time the parcel fell from the girl the prisoner was as far from the girl as I am from Mr. Shelton. I then proceeded on to search the mother; in the prisoner's pocket among some halfpence I found fifteen bad shillings, and two bad sixpences, two shillings good, one shilling and ten pennyworth of halfpence, and two good sixpences. I then went to search the girl; she requested to warm her hands; upon my going to the table I found a shilling close by.</p>
               <p>Q. to Miss Holman. Is that the shilling that you gave to your brother - A. I cannot say; I gave but one shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bird. That is the shilling that I received of my sister; I marked it, and the officer marked it.</p>
               <p>MR. NICOLL. I am one of the moniers of his Majesty's Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. I now put into your hand the shilling uttered by the prisoner to Miss Holman - A. It is a counterfeit; it is quite fresh finished.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Shew the fifteen counterfeit shillings to Mr. Nicoll.</p>
               <p>(Johnson handed them to Mr. Nicoll.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. The fifteen shillings and the two sixpences are all counterfeits; they are of the same manufactory, and these that dropped from the girl are counterfeits, and of the same sort.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the delivery of some Irish linen at your shop - A. Yes. On the 12th of January we received a box of Irish linen on the partnership's account; it remained until the night of the 24th undisturbed, on the morning of the 25th, the night that the fire happened at Messrs. Corbyn and Company's premises. On account of the alarm we moved some of our effects to Mr.

            , a few doors off. I do not recollect the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which of the two houses the Irish linen was taken to - A. Our stock of Irish linen was taken to the two houses, but this piece of Irish liner that was lost was taken to Mr. Harris's; the pieces of linen were marked from number 1 to 20, and the cost price was marked on them; besides the cost price, is O and W, which is the mark that we use for half-a-crown; the O for two shillings, and W for sixpence; the name of the manufacturer was on the outside, as it is to all linens, generally on the outside of the piece of cloth. After the linens were removed to Mr. Harris's, I picked them up in the parlour myself. I have every reason to believe the bulk of these linens were removed to Mr. Harris's. They were marked off, but not removed away, consequently they were the more easy to be got at. The whole box had been marked that day. They were taken that night, on the alarm of fire, to Mr. Harris's, and brought back in the morning, before our shop was open. It was the same morning they were brought away about half past seven. My young men brought them back. I did not superintend the bringing them back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the prisoners - A. The woman prisoner lived servant to Mr. Harris. I know her person. She was in the room when the goods were piled up.</p>

I never did suspect when they were brought; I never counted them again. They were counted when delivered, but not counted when brought back. I found it out on the 7th of March. I had information. I accompanied Mr. Harris and a constable, now in court, and Mr. Ingram, to a house in Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road, where

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. - In consequence of information which I received I went, on the 25th of April, about nine o'clock in the morning, with a search-warrant, to No. 16, Little Chesterfield-street, with Edwards, Kirby, Lloyd, and Mr. Powell, the assistant solicitor of the Mint - Kirby went first into the back yard, while Edwards, Lloyd, and I went up to the first floor back room; we opened the door, went in, and found the two prisoners sitting at breakfast; I heard something fall from the man, and perceived some half-crowns on the mantel-piece - we laid hold of him, handcuffed him, and sent for Mr. Powell - when the man arose from his chair I saw some money in his chair; Mr. Powell came, and we all looked at the prisoners' hands; Harvey's hands were rather dirty, and the tips of her fingers were yellow, as if with the paste which they rub base money with; Warner's hands were clean. We sent them to the office, by some of the officers, and when the officers returned I took this cork off the shelf - it has some paste on it. I perceived this board on a shelf over the door - it is marked in places with the size of a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence. I found a file, which appears to have been filing metal - also some sand-paper, which is used to rub the sharp edges off the money; I found a small phial with aquafortis in it, and this jar of paste; I tried the paste on copper, and it produces the colour of silver. I found this shovel in the room, and showed it to Prideaux; I found some pieces of paper cut, large and small, to wrap half-crowns and shillings in.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Limbrick on the 25th of April - on coming into the room I seized Warner, and immediately heard something fall on the floor; I could not ascertain from where it fell; I observed nothing drop from the person, but what I heard fall appeared to fall from his person, and I saw it close to his chair - I took it up - it was two counterfeit shillings, wrapped up in paper, separately; I examined them - they appeared to be fit for circulation; they appeared to have been blacked over, and had the appearance of good shillings - they were not exactly smooth. I examined the chair he had been sitting in, and found in it one half-crown, wrapped in paper, and another loose; I now produce them in the state they were in - they were on the chair when he got up. I saw a great many pieces of paper of this description on the table, near to where he sat, and by the side of the fire-place, close to the chair in which he sat, I observed an old handkerchief, and in that handkerchief, in a bag, I found, wrapped in separate papers, ten shillings in one paper, separately wrapped up, and five shillings and four shillings, all in separate parcels - I produce them in the state they were in. I also found another paper, containing three counterfeit sovereigns; I found a brown bag, containing three hundred counterfeit shillings, which were bright, and not ready for circulation. I also found a cotton stocking, containing a quantity of sparable nails and sand paper, which was broken into very small pieces - there was the appearance of a great deal of metal, of a yellow nature, among the nails - on our way to the watch-house the male prisoner said it was all up, that it was laid on well, and had we been a little later he should have been out; that we came at a very bad time, for he was very short blunted, as he had laid it all out yesterday; I searched Harvey, and found a good half-crown on her - I observed her hands - the internal parts seemed blackish, and the finger ends yellow; the paste found will produce that effect; I have tried it several times on a halfpenny, and it produces a yellow colour on the finger.</p>
               <p>Here the witness rubbed some of the paste on a halfpenny, which produced the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WARNER. Q. Did I not tell you I was short of money, and beg of you to take care of some duplicates which were in my coat pocket? A. Yes, and that you should have been at Drummond's bank in about an hour.</p>

            . I accompanied the other officers, and saw Warner on the left-hand side of the table and Harvey on the other, at breakfast. I found a half-crown, finished, another not quite finished, and twelve just as they came from the die, close to Warner, on the table; I found some pith or marrow and a tooth-brush, which is used to rub them over at the last process - the tooth-brush is black and greasy.

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin at the Mint. I have seen the various articles the officers have produced - here are two half-crowns which have been fitted for circulation, by being rubbed down, then resilvered, greased, and blacked, to give them the appearance of having been in circulation before; the rubbing down, is to remove from the surface of the coin the sharpness which it receives from the die - it is coloured by nitrate of silver and salt, which forms a paste - this paste is now dry. [The witness here moistened the paste with some water, and rubbed a small portion of it on a half-penny.] This operation, performed by the fingers, corrodes them, and produces a deep-yellow stain on the fingers, which remains some time, more or less, according to the quantity - here is some grease, which is applied to the coin after it is re-silvered; it is of a glutinous nature; it is spinal marrow; this makes it appear to have been worn, and kept in a greasy pocket. Here is a phial with nitrous acid, which is used in colouring; here are two half-crowns and two shillings, which have been prepared in the manner I have described. There are a great many more here. All the coin produced is composed of brass; the file has metal in the teeth of it, in which metal there appears to be silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WARNER. Q. How many shillings did you find in the bag? A. I never counted them; there were above two hundred. I have seen a bag of sparables and small pieces of sand-paper - this might be used for the purpose of friction; there are particles of metal among<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310029"></xptr>them, which have been rubbed off by friction.

I am a gardener and fruiterer, and hired her for the summer - I took this lodging, and had been there six days, and on the morning the officers came I cleared the top of the cupboard, and found a handkerchief and a bag, with a great deal of counterfeit coin in it; I asked the woman who it belonged to - she said she did not know; I said, "I shall call the landlady up, and ask who it does belong to;" she said, "Stop and get your breakfast first;" I did so, and the officers came - I never moved; they seized me by the hand - there were four or five half-crowns laid on the table. The officer touched the table-cloth with his coat, and the half-crown fell down.</p>

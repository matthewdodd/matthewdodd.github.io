                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in Bell-yard, Gracechurch-street. I only know the prisoner by his using my house a very few weeks—I had repeatedly forbidden him to come—on Friday evening, the 23rd of December, I had occasion to go down in the cellar—I saw the prisoner going from the tap-room to the bar several times—I had two hams hanging on an iron bar—as I went down into the cellar, both hams were there—when I got down I took a stick and poked out a large plug which we have for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183701020034"></xptr>
               <p>pouring gin down—I watched up this hole for half a minute, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner go to the tap-room door, and the door was closed—he took that op-portunity of taking the ham off the iron-bar—I called out immediately to make an alarm, but my sister-in-law and wife were in the kitchen—and before I got up the ham, and hook, and prisoner were gone—I have never seen it since—I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was in the house from twelve, till the time you said you lost it? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. You might be—you might be playing at cards—I do not know whether you was standing at the bar at the time I was in the cellar—you might have been standing there for a shilling I owed you—you had asked me for it in the morning—I had forbidden you the house, beacause I saw very bad and suspicious characters in company with you—the officers told me they were suspicious characters—you asked for the shilling in the morning, I told you to take another opportunity of asking for it—I could see through the hole—I swear to you by your dress and features—I could see your white stockings and shoes, and you had trowsers on—I saw your face distinctly—it was of no use to make a disturbance then, as your acquaintances there might have told you of it—I went about twenty feet from the cellar stairs, the ham was hanging by the cellar door, but then the cellar staircase runs some distance—I told no one of it but my wife and sister-in-law that night—I told Joseph next morning—if you had taken any thing off the counter I could not have seen it—I swear there was no one there but yourself; not a single soul opened the tap-room door to go our—there was a gaslight inside the partition; which is glass, immediately where the hams hung—my ceiling is about nine feet high, and the bar on which the hams hung is at least a foot from the ceiling, and on that hung a hook, and then a long piece of string, and then the length of the ham—you came to my house the next day—I accused no one but you, you asked me why I suspected you—I might say I saw you through the crack in the floor at the minute, I saw you through the hole—I did not say, "If he is not the person, you can take him on suspicion"—when you came there, my wife sent to Mincing-lane for me, I returned with the officer, and you and the man that was with you the night before, (who went out a few minutes before you) were there—I said to the officer, "Here is a man that I swear stole my ham off my iron-bar"—the other was out of the house prior to your taking it—he might take it of you at the door—I said it was from half-past ten to eleven o'clock—I might say the first time that I was sure it was you, because you had shoes and white stockings on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. This passage is public, and there are coachmen, and cads, and conductors—your servant swore he saw me go out, and I had nothing in my hand, and the next time you took good care you did not let your ser<lb></lb>vant come again. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, he was not wanted—it was impossible for any one else to see him take it, unless they were watching him over the door—the three lower panes are wood—there was no step to stand on in the passage, but a coffee-mill, by which he could have raised himself up—I have done so myself to takedown a joint of meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I think it quite impossible for him to go into his cellar and knock this bung out to look through—Why should he sus<lb></lb>pect the ham was gone any more than any other property?—it appears to me he missed the ham on the Saturday—it is quite as possible any other person might take it as me—I was in the house full an hour after he lost it, and his servant stated he saw me and three others go out, and neither of us had any ham.</p>

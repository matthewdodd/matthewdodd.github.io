I am a horse-dealer, and keep the Blue Anchor, at Whetstone, which is about 200 yards from my stable—on Saturday, 25th October, I had a dark brown gelding, about fifteen hands high, locked in the stable with this padlock, which I saw broken at half-past 7, and the gelding was then gone—I saw it again between 11 and 12 that night—a man very much like the prisoner had a pint of beer at my house about 6 o'clock, and remained about twenty minutes.</p>

I live at 6, Wigford-place, City-road, and am a cigar manufacturer—on 25th October, about a quarter past 7, I was driving down Barnet-hill, about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's house, and saw a man on horseback coming towards me—he attempted to pass me on the near side, but the horse shied at my lamps, threw him off, and ran away down the hill—I pulled up to give him the benefit of my lamps, and he got up and ran after the horse—my lamps showed a good light—the man was dressed in a frock coat and dark clothes; he had no hat or cap—I am sure the prisoner is the man—it was a dark-brown hone about fifteen hands high—the man had not the appearance of a groom.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, of Hadley—on Saturday evening 25th October, about 10 minutes to 8, I met the prisoner on a dark-brown horse—I am sure he is the man—he asked me if I could tell him where he could buy a hat or a cap—he had nothing on his head—I told him he could not buy one there; he must go back to Barnet—that was about two miles from the prosecutor's house—the horse had a hemp halter on; a bit of rope—it was a misty night, but there was a light from the gas at a confectioner's shop—the prisoner said, "Cannot I get one at Hadley?"—I said, "No"—he still kept on the road, and turned out of the north road towards Hadley Church; going further from the prosecutor's house—I next saw him, a fort<lb></lb>night afterwards, at the police-station, and knew him at once—I am sure he is the man—on Monday, 3d November, I went to a field at Whetstone, and saw four or five horses, out of which I picked out the horse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How far is it from Barnet-hill to Hadley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three quarters of a mile; it depends upon whereabouts you go in Hadley—you did not meet me on the hill—it was a very misty night—I am positive it was you—the gas in the confectioner's shop was close to the counter—the</p>

               <p>shop it on the left-hand side, and you were on the left-hand side of the road with the horse—what made me take so much notice of the horse was, that there was nothing on his head but a halter and a leather rein tied to it—I have mentioned the leather rein before—I cannot tell the height of a man when he is on horseback—directly I got to Barnet, I heard that a horse had been stolen—the policeman asked me if I had met a man; and I described you—I identified you when you were standing in the Court, at Barnet—Mr. Goodwin's brother and the sergeant went with me to the field to select the horse—the sergeant and I stopped on the road and had some refresh<lb></lb>ment—when I met you on the horse I was so close to you that I could have touched you, and that made me take notice—I looked to see whether it was a horse or a mare—it made a little bit of a pull up when you spoke to me—I cannot say whether it had a white streak down its face, or broken knees, or whether it was broken-winded—I did not run round to see whether it was piebald on the other side—there were no more dark-brown horses in the field—no one told me the colour of the horse.</p>

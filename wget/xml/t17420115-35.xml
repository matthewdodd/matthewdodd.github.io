               <p>It was farther urg'd by the Councel on the same Side, that although the Articles with which the Defendant stood charg'd might seem to be but inconsiderable, yet that where some Things were conceal'd, there was great Reason to apprehend that others had been conceal'd; and that a Man who would be guilty of Perjury in one Instance would in others: That it appeared from the Face of the Indictment that the Prisoner stood charg'd with 4 Instances of Perjury; and that if one of them should be prov'd, that would be sufficient to convict the Defendant. That although he had taken a general Oath to reveal all his Effects according to Act of Parliament, yet notwithstanding that he was actually possess'd of a Copper of which he made no mention at all in his Account deliver'd to the Commissioners; likewise 2 Stove Grates, and a Shop Book, which would appear to be very material; and besides these he had conceal'd a large quantity of Brasiery Goods:</p>
               <p>That Crimes of this Sort ought not to be aggravated, being exceeding heinous in their own Nature, for if People would take those Libertien to forswear themselves, there would be an End<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174201150016"></xptr> of Justice, and there could be no Security of Men's Lives or Properties, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THOMAS DUTTON. I rent a house in Queenhithe, in the parish of St. Michael. The prisoner is quite a stranger to me. I was sitting in my counting-house, at the back of the warehouse-there were three reams of paper put about two yards from the door to be taken away by a cart, with other goods. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner took them up, and ran out of the door with them; I pursued him, and lost sight of him only while he turned the corner - He saw me, and dropped the paper - I saw him drop it; I still pursued - He ran as hard as he could; he was stopped in my presence - He was never out of my sight except while turning the corner; I gave him in charge, and sent Bowyer for the paper - He brought it to me-it is the same that the prisoner dropped; it is worth 4l. 10s., it cost me more.</p>

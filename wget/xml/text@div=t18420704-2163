               <p>Olave's, Southwark—Hickey was an inmate there, and employed as a nurse—in consequence of information, I went to Leary's house in Fair-street, with Mr. Rosier, on Saturday week last—there I found three sheets, a shift, and a pair of stockings, the property of the Union—the marks were cut out of the sheets, the shifts and stockings were marked—Hickey was appre<lb></lb>hended in the workhouse—the prisoners are sisters—Leary said the sheets which Mr. Rosier refused to take were given to her by her sister when they were together in my room at the time, and Leary said to her sister, "You gave them to me"—Hickey said, "I know I did"—Hickey being a nurse, would have access to these articles.</p>

On the 18th of June, Leary came to my place with this sheet—observing the marks of the Union on it, I detained it, and gave notice to the matter of the workhouse—I told the prisoner it was the property of the Union, and she had no right to it—on the 27th, she came again, and offered this pillow<lb></lb>case, which had got the mark faintly on it—the mark has been cut out and here is an impression remaining—I detained the pillow-case—I afterwards went to her house and found the other articles in her box—she said the sheets had been given to her by her sister, and her sister said, "I gave them to her."</p>

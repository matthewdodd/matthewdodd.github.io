                  </hi>. I am shopman to William Carr, of Beckford-row, Walworth-road. On the 21st of Nov. I had a firkin of butter, which I placed facing the shop, on a sort of bank on the road, just by the pave<lb></lb>ment—it was to have been sent off by a cart—I saw it safe at six o'clock in the evening—about half-past six I received information from the lad Wood ford, and missed it—it was between six and seven o'clock—I saw a cart opposite, with a firkin of butter in it—I do not know whose cart it was—I tried to get up at the back of the cart, and received a blow either by a stick or whip—I could see the person who struck me—it was not the prisoner—I was shaken off from the cart—it was a very foggy night—I did not see more than one person in the cart—the butter was worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Lyon, of No. 23, Beckford-row. On the evening of the 21st of Nov. I was standing at my master's door—it was very foggy—I had noticed the prisoner near my master's shop, which is next door but one to the prosecutor's—I was watching my master's goods—there were two bales, which had come from the City that afternoon—I saw the prisoner come up, and shake the top bale, and go away—I told my master, who came out, and the things were taken into the shop—in about two minutes I saw the prisoner walk up to the side of a cart, which was driven by another man—the prisoner looked round, and something was said between them which I could not hear—the prisoner said something to the man in the cart—I could not hear what it was—I think it was the prisoner that spoke—the man in the cart drove to the opposite side of the way—the fog was so great I could not see him then—in about a minute or two afterwards I saw the prisoner look round, and he took up one of the firkins of butter belonging to Mr. Carr, which laid</p>

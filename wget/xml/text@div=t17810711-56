               <p>I am Mr. Pinchbeck's daughter. On the 9th of June last, the two prisoners came into the shop: they asked for a glass to a watch: they were there, altogether, about half an hour. When they were going away, I missed a case of rings: I reckon there were about twenty-eight in it. I am certain there were twenty-seven; but am pretty sure there were twenty-eight: they were various sorts of rings.</p>

               <p>How long had you seen them before you missed them? - About a quarter of an hour. Upon missing them, I went immediately round the counter, and told my father to stop that man and boy, for while they had been in the shop, there had been a case of rings stolen. The boy, Stone, was got out; and the man, Harvey, was on the threshold of the door.</p>

               <p>Did you find the rings upon them? - No.</p>

               <p>Was any person at the door, besides, at the time? - Yes;

               <p>I was at Mr. Pinchbeck's door, on Saturday, the 9th of June last. I know both the prisoners, as being in the shop at that time. I saw this boy, Stone, coming out of the shop. He had something in his bosom; and as I had nothing to suspect, I never thought any thing, but walked backwards and forwards; as I shew the quality the exhibition-room. He took something out of his bosom. There were three more boys on the outside, looking at the trinkets in the window. To one of these boys, the prisoner, Stone, gave something. That boy put it into his bosom; and then Stone pointed to him to go along Pall-Mall. The boy and the man were taken immediately. I told Mrs. Hebb and Mr. Hebb, that the boy had come out, and given it to those three at the door.</p>

               <p>The boy came out of the house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Here are all the rings but one, a very remarkable one, which is gone. These are my property.</p>

               <p>To Mrs. Hebb. Are those the rings you had adjusted? - They are</p>

               <p>To Mr. Pinchbeck. How did you come by these rings again? - This happened on Saturday evening. I went down on Sunday morning, about half an hour after seven. A young girl was sitting, with something in her hand. She smiled, and said, Sir, I believe here are your rings. She said, as she was walking along the kitchen, she saw a man look once or twice, and then heard something thrown into the kitchen, with some other things. She gave them to me.</p>

               <p>Is she here? - No. I had a letter that was thrown down with them.</p>

               <p>To Mrs. Hebb. Did the prisoners appear to be acquainted? - Quite so: they conversed together as if they were acquainted.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pinchbeck. On the second examination before the magistrate, the boy acknowledged he had taken the rings, and given them to the boy at the door.</p>

               <p>Was the account the boy gave taken down in writing? - I think it was.</p>

               <p>Court. The justices ought to take the depositions down in writing, and they ought to be returned into court; for, when they are not, we cannot receive a verbal account of a confession taken in writing.</p>

               <p>I was in the parlour. Herbert came in, and said he wanted a glass fitted into his watch. The man called my wife out of the parlour. She tried to fit it. My father went out, and tried. The glasses are badly sorted. Our man was sent out, to get a glass fitted in. As soon as I came into the shop, my wife said, Good God! there is a case of rings gone out of the shew-glass. The little boy was then standing outside the window, looking at some buckles, and a soldier's boy with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110145"></xptr> him. I took him by the collar, and shoved him into the shop. Then I felt down his cloaths, and said I must search them. The old man said, Me take a case of rings! me take a case of rings! I said I would search him. I bolted the door, and searched him and the boy; but we found nothing on them.</p>

               <p>HARVEY's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>STONE's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I never saw this man in my life before that day. This man went into the shop. I went to the door, to look at the buckles. That gentleman searched me, and found nothing on me. A man at the justice's held a stick up to my head, and said I should be double-ironed, if I did not tell him what I knew of that man. I never was in a prison before, and that frightened me. Mr. Pinchbeck said he would not hurt me, if I would tell him who that person was. I was frightened, and did not know what to say.</p>

               <p>Jury to Macdonald. You say you saw the boy, Stone, give something out from his bosom? - Yes; it looked to me to be the case that has been produced.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pinchbeck. This is not the same case, but it is just such a one.</p>

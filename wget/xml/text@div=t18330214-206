            . I live at Birmingham. I bought this picture of the prisoner, with some others, about a year and a half ago - I gave him a sum of money for the lot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What are you? A. I am a clerk - I know this picture by the mark of Wilson on the back of it; it had not been out of my possession - I had kept it in a cupboard; I could not hang it up - I kept it till about a month ago, and then sent it up to town.</p>

            . This is my own private property; it was not the subject of sale - it was at my house when the prisoner worked for me; I never gave it him - he stated to me that he had sent it to Birmingham; I know it by the size of it - by the subject - by the stock marks, one of which has been attempted to be obliterated, and by the name of Wilson, which was on it at my house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it framed? A. I really cannot tell; I have fifteen hundred or two thousand pictures - some of them are taken out of frames to sell; this was at a house of mine in Warwick-street - the prisoner was employed there as well as at Bond-street; the prisoner said his wife had sent this by mistake to Birmingham, with some furniture.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can prove that I have had it for five years, and I have only been in Mr. Phillips' employ for four years.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Ann-street, Waterloo-road; my husband died in July last - he sold this painting to the prisoner, between four and five years ago; I have no doubt of its being the same - the canvas on the back corresponds; but I think this looks rather cleaner.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the subject of your picture? A. Three ships and a small boat, and the middle ship was rather sinking in the water; I am now in the service of Mr. May - there was some chalk on the back; I do not know that it had a scratch on it - I would not venture to swear this is the picture, but it is exactly like it; I did not go before the Magistrate - I was asked to come here last Friday.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS re-examined. Q. Is not the prisoner a very clever fellow? A. Yes he is; I did not know he was capable of copying pictures, till the other day one was shown to me.</p>

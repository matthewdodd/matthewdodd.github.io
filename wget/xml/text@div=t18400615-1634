                  </hi>I live at Cambridge Heath, Bethnal Green—I have the house to myself, and am a green-grocer—I went out with my wife and some friends on Sunday the 31st of May, about three o'clock in the day—I fastened the door, locked it, and put the key in my pocket—there are two doors to the back, and they were both fastened—I do not know that any windows were open—there is only the shop and parlour down stairs, and the windows in them were fastened—I had some bottles of ginger-beer in the house when I went out—I returned home about half-past eight o'clock, and saw several persons about the front of the house—I broke the door open—I did not wait to see if I could open it with the key—I went up stairs to the back bed-room door—I tried it with the key, but I could not get the key in the lock, in consequence of something being in the centre of it—my brother-in-law was with me, and he broke that door in with his foot—I did not perceive that any thing bad been disturbed in the house—the top part of the back parlour window was down, which I suppose was up when I went out, but I cannot say—I did not miss any ginger-beer—it would have been impossible to miss one or two bottles—next day I missed three-pennyworth of halfpence from under a tea-caddy on the shelf in the parlour adjoining the shop—the shop and parlour are all one room, only there is a partition across.</p>

                  </hi>I live in Suffolk-place, opposite the prosecutor's—I am a retired builder. On Sunday afternoon, the 31st of May, I looked out of my window, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner trying to get in at the prosecutor's door—he seemed as if he was unlocking it—the door opened and he went in—(I knew that the prose<lb></lb>cutor and his wife were out)—I came out and told Mr. Welsh to look for a policeman—the prisoner shut the door after him when he went in—he came out in about a quarter of an hour—he had a bottle of ginger-beer in his hand—he went through Cambridge Heath Gate, towards the bridge.</p>

I was on duty in Hack<lb></lb>ney-road on the 31st of May—Mr. Welsh pointed out the prisoner to me—I stopped him, and told him I wanted him—he began to feel in his pocket, and I thought be had got something there which he wanted to throw into the canal, which was close by—I asked what he had got in his pocket—he said a bottle of ginger-beer—I asked where he got it—he told me he had bought it over the bridge—I then searched him, and took from him a bottle of ginger-beer, which I now produce, two double pick-lock keys, two single ones, and a screw-driver—I took him to the station-house and searched him again, and found on him six halfpence wrapped up in a piece of brown paper—they were given up to him by order of the In<lb></lb>specter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweeper. On the 23rd of Aug. I laid down in Mr. Beard's yard, in Coppice-lane, Church-street, Deptford, and went to sleep. I awoke and missed half-a-crown, a shilling, and three half-pence, which were safe in my pocket when I first laid down—I went to the pump, where the workmen were, and said, "Who has got my money? you had better deliver it up, or I shall fetch a policeman"—I went out for a police<lb></lb>man, and the prisoner went out of the yard—we then had suspicion of him, as he went away from the pump.</p>

                  </hi>. I employed the prisoner and others to empty a privy on 23rd of Aug.—when the prosecutor awoke he said he had lost his money, and charged all the men who were there with it, me among the rest—I told him to get a policeman, and have us all searched—when he came back the pri<lb></lb>soner had left the yard, to get a flower, and we suspected he had got the money—I followed him, after the job was over, with another young man—I turned back and stopped in a summer-house for about an hour—the prisoner then came back, went down the yard, and took the money from under a piece of wood—he was looking about—I saw he had a half-crown and three half-pence—I said, "I wanted to find out the thief; I have been blamed for it myself"—he gave me the half-crown and three halfpence—I said, "Shelly lost more than this"—he said, "So help me God, this is all I took out of his pocket"—he asked me to have a drop of rum, and not say anything about it—I gave information to the police—he absconded, but was taken a few days after—I gave the money to Shelly—the prisoner bore a very good character.</p>

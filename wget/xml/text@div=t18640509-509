                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of the London Hospital—I have seen John Bryan this morning—he is in a very dangerous state, and never will be able to get out of bed again—I was present in the hospital when his depositions were taken by Mr. Partridge, the Magistrate, in the prisoner's presence—I have seen the same man this morning—the prisoner was asked whether he would like to ask any questions—there was an interpreter present, but I did not understand the language in which the prisoner was asked whether he would cross-examine. (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>

                  </hi>. On 7th February, I was in Cannon Street-road, St. George's, at a little after 12 o'clock, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner sparring together—I was on the opposite side of the way—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I saw him make a stroke at Bryan, towards his shoulder, but did not see whether he had anything in his hand—Bryan fell—I went across the road, and he said, "I am stabbed"—he got up, and the prisoner passed back among some more of his companions—I went with Bryan to the doctor.</p>

I am a seaman, and live at Perseverance-place, St. George's—on 7th February, about half-past 12 in the morning, I was passing the corner of Cannon-street—there was a crowd, and I saw the prisoner two yards from Bryan—I said, "What is the matter with you Bryan?"—he said, "I am stabbed"—I said, "Who has stabbed you?"—he had just time, with the loss of blood, to go and <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> the prisoner, and say," This is the man that stabbed me"—he said that in English—the prisoner tried to get away, but a policeman came, and took him by his collar—I saw that Bryan was stabbed in the shoulder—there was a crowd of twenty or thirty Germans there.</p>

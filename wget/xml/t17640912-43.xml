The prisoner came to my house, on the 13th of July, recommended by a publican for a bed for a night; he came at ten at night: I let him a bed, and he lay in it two nights; the third night, I lighted him to bed, and pulled the door to after me; he took the key withinside, and locked himself in. The next morning, I found he had torn the sheets to pieces, to make a rope to let himself down from the window; they were on the outside: I went and broke open the door, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment: the sash at which he got out, was left open, which was before fastened down within side: he was taken at Newington-butts the last of August. I found none of my things again but the jacket, which he had on his back: the justice ordered it to be taken off when he went to goal. He would confess nothing: (the jacket produced): I have wore it many a hundred leagues at sea.</p>

             came to my house, and said, he had dodg'd the prisoner from Dock-head to Newington, and he was sitting on a bench, at the Elephant and Castle; he desired I would go and assist in taking him. I went, and he was then gone towards the Dog and Duck: I went and stopped him: Butler asked him where he had that jacket? he said, he bought it for half a crown. Butler said, it was his landlord's: we brought him back to the Elephant and Castle: Mr. Sharp came there, and owned it.</p>

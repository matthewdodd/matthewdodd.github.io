               <p>Justice Gifford. The Prisoner, by the Name of Trevor, charged John Edlin, and another, who was then in Newgate, with robbing him on the Highway between Coney and St. Albans. I thought that Edlin had an honester Look than the Prisoner, and that I had seen the Prisoner before, but I could not recollect who he was. I sent to enquire after the Prisoner's Character, and was told that he was an honest Man, and then I committed Edlin to Newgate. After this the Prisoner came to me again, and told me, that I had made a Mistake in committing Edlin on the Information of Trevor, it should have been on the Information of Waller, says he, for my Name is Waller, and therefore must beg you to alter it. O, is it you Mr. Waller? says I; I thought I had seen your Face before. Had I known your Name when you made this Information, I had turned you out of Doors, as I did Five Years ago, when you swore against two Street Robbers; but since it is so, I shall take a Note of it. And then I made a Memorandum on the side of the Information, That at the time this Information was taken, the Informant said his Name was Trevor (not Waller.) The Information was afterwards sent down to the Assizes at Hertford, where Edlin was to be try'd.</p>

The Justice was cautions of sending Edlin to Newgate, 'till enquiry was made of the Prisoner's Character. Upon this the Prisoner took me, and one of Edlin's Friends with him, to the Crown in Aldersgate-street; says I, to the Man of the House, Do you know this Man? pointing to the Prisoner, but not naming him, I know no harm of him, says the Man, but I have liv'd here but 10 Weeks. From thence the Prisoner took us to a Man in a little Court in the Old-Baily. I ask'd him the same Question, and he told me, He had known the Prisoner these 12 Years, and knew no harm of him. We return'd to the Justice's, I witness'd the Information, and saw the Prisoner set his Mark to it. I took a Memorandum of the Name in the Information, and the Day of the Month, and went to Hertford Affizes. The Prisoner preferr'd the Bill before the Grand Jury there, by the Name of Waller.

             order'd me to enquire into his Character. I enquir'd of a Gentleman at Thetford ; Waller, says he, Why, he's the vilest Fellow living; He makes a Trade of swearing away Mens Lives for the Sake of the Reward, granted for convicting Robbers. This Gentleman gave me Direction to write to a Gentleman, for a Description and Character of the Prisoner. I wrote, and receiv'd an Answer at Bury. The Answer describ'd him exactly, and by good Fortune it came just time enough to prevent the Execution of the 2 Men. The Prisoner pretended in his Evidence against these 2 Men, That he call'd at the George at New-Market, and that one of them came and begg'd of him; that he gave him 6d. then, and afterwards treated him in the Road, they both travelling the same Way; but at Botsom's-Hill, this Man was so ungrateful as to assault him, and the other Man coming up at the same time, they robb'd him of 3 Jacobus's, 9 Guineas, and a Peice of Mecklin-Lace, for he pretended to be a Holland Trader, and then they strip'd him, and bound him, and there be lay till he was reliev'd by a Passenger.

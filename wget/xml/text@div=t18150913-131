I was coming along, between one and two in the afternoon of the 28th of August, I met the prisoner three doors from our shop, with this portmanteau on his shoulder; I knew it had been Mr. Dixon's, but was in doubt, whether it had been purchased, as I had been from home. I followed him, and he perceived I was following him, and he went up a court which leads to Mr. Smith's the attorney's office; I went into Mr. Sewell's shop, a seedsman opposite of Mr. Smith's, and presently I saw the prisoner come down the court and look about him; I pointed him out to Mr. Sewell and requested him to watch if he carried the portmanteau away, whilst I ran home to enquire whether it had been bought; I found it had not been bought, but was just missed. I went and got the prisoner and the portmanteau and brought them both back to our shop.</p>

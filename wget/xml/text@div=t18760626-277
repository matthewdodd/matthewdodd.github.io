On 31st May, I was orderly at the office, and about 12 o'clock I went to the paymaster's office, and after delivering my message he told me to sit down while he made out a cheque for Major Murdoch, he gave it to me and I returned to my battery about 12.45; there was a half-holiday and the sergeant had left, and I could not deliver it. I had leave that afternoon and had to conceal it until it until I could deliver it next day; being in liquor I do not know what happened, but next morning I found the cheque with the endorsement on it in the name of Brand; If I had not been taken up I should have returned the cheque to the pay serjeant; if I had not been in liquor it would not have happened.</p>

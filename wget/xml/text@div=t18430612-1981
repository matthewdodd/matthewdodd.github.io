                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Charles Rayner, of Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell. On the 2nd of June, I sent Macklin with a truck to Mr. Hewitt, to order two chests of tea—he came back with only one. <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MACKLIN</hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service—I went to Mr. Hewitt on the 2nd of June, for an order—I got the order, and went to the London Docks—I put a chest of tea into a covered truck—I saw the prisoner at the Docks, with a low cart and a grey horse—he bad some chests of tea in the cart—he took three from the Docks—he said. "Where are you going?"—I said, "Near Nicholson's wharf"—I said, "Will you give me a pull behind your cart?"—he said, "No, I go too fast for you, if I see you at Nicholson's wharf, I will give you a pull up Fish-street-hill"—I went to Nicholson's wharf, and met the prisoner there with the cart—I asked him where I should go for my tea—he pointed out where I was to go, and said, "Do not leave your truck in the middle of the road, or the police will take it away, but if you back it against my cart, I will take great care of it"—I believed he was</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Lynn and Gibson, fishmongers, near Nicholson's wharf. On the 2nd of June I was in the shop, and heard a something coming on the pavement"—I looked out, and law the prisoner lift up a square green chest of tea, and put it on the copse of his cart by itself—not among any other chests—soon after I heard of the loss of this chest—I saw Macklin crying—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the custody of king—I went to the station, and the prisoner denied all knowledge of Macklin—I turned round to him, and said, "Did you not pick up a box of tea that fell to the ground?"—"Yes," said he, "I did, it fell from my cart"—I said I did not see any vacancy where a chest of tea could fall from the body of his cart—that is the fact, the cart was not filled high up.</p>

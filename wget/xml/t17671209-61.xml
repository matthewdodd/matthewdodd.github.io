               <p>Mr. Clark acknowledged before Mr. Read he received it of Mr. Wright, who came to his house with a woman, and had left it there; Clark took it, and pasted the papers together; he has been divers times to the prosecutor, and asked forgiveness on his knees, after he had arrested him, and said he would make him any satisfaction; he offered him five pounds.</p>

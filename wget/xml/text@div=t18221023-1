            . I am an attorney, and live in Chancery-lane, and was attorney in this cause, and attended the trial. I have a notice of set off, which was produced in the cause - there is a set off, for a bill of Beckenham's; the document was left at my office by a person whom I did not see; it was acted upon on the trial of the cause - the prisoner was present on the trial, also Mr. Isaacson, his attorney. I have the Judge's order. dated the 10th of May, 1822, for the defendant to deliver to the attorney - for the plaintiff's particulars of the set off, within four days - (read.) In pursuance of this order particulars were delivered to me, and the set off brought in in the usual manner, and the writing is the hand-writing of Isaacson's clerk. (The set off was here read.) The prisoner attended the trial himself. I demanded 16 l. 4 s. 6 d., for the plaintiff, and gave evidence of that demand, and the defendant gave evidence of his demand in the set off, and produced a cheque in Court endorsed, to shew that Beckenham's bill -</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT PELL, (for the prisoner.) Q. Who produced it - A. You did Sir; at the time the counsel was opening his defence on the ground of that cheque - he turned round to Brookes and Isaacson, who sat behind him, and the prisoner delivered the cheque into Mr. Sergeant

               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Was any bill of Seager's given in evidence by the defendant - A. I rather think we produced Seager's bill - it was produced to prove that it was given in discharge of Beckenham's bill of 17 l. 9 s. in discharge of the set off. Brookes produced the cheque to shew that Seager's bill was not given in discharge of Beckenham's bill; but that he had discounted it, and the endorsement at the back of it was to shew the manner in which he had discounted the bill. At that time a cause was pending in the King's Bench, between the same parties. I have the writ, declaration, and issue here. The cause of action stated in the declaration is that it was for a bill drawn by Beckenham, on the 22d of October, 1821, accepted by

            , at two months, for 17 l. 9 s. 6 d. Mr. Isaacson was attorney in this cause also. This appears to be the bill included in the set off in the Common Pleas. The cause in the Common Pleas had been tried on the 12th of January, and two days after I took out a summons before Mr. Justice Best, for the plaintiff to attend next day at two o'clock, to shew cause why the cheque proved on the trial should not he deposited with the clerk of the nisi prius for the defendant and his witnesses to inspect the same. (Summons read.) Isaacson and I attended the return of the summons. I am not certain whether Brookes was there. The cheque was not produced, and his Lordship made an order that the cheque be delivered to Mr. Isaacson, the plaintift's attorney, and that I should be at liberty to take a copy of it, and that Isaacson should produce it at chambers at twenty-four hours notice, to such persons as I wished to inspect it. Isaacson undertook to produce it on the trial of the cause. In pursuance of that order I received at my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230004"></xptr>house a copy of the cheque, with a letter at the bottom, in the hand-writing of Turner, Isaacson's clerk - it is the same hand-writing as the proceedings in the cause. After this I took out two other summonses; one dated the 26th of June, for Isaacson to attend chambers at eleven o'clock on Friday, to shew cause why he should not produce the cheque mentioned in the order of the 15th - nobody attended that order, and I took out further summonses for Isaacson and the plaintiff to attend, for the same purpose on the 29th; this was a peremptory summons. There was no Judge till the 3d of July, when Isaacson attended before Mr. Justice Best, who heard us both, and then ordered that on Friday next the cheque should be produced to me at chambers. On the Friday following, Isaacson, Brookes, myself, my clerk, and my brother attended. I told his Lordship in their presence that I had received the copy of the cheque in pursuance of his Lordship's former order; but had not been able to see the original - that I had given the names of four persons to attend chambers, to inspect it. Brookes was in hearing all the time. The Judge turned round to Isaacson, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the original cheque;" Isaacson stated that it was before counsel - the Judge immediately said,</p>
               <p>"Well, then you can fetch it in a few minutes;" he hesitated, and then stated to the Judge, that he had delivered it back to Brookes - the Judge turned to Brookes with the copy of the cheque in his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is this a copy of the cheque;" Brookes replied</p>
               <p>"It is." The Judge said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the original;" he paused a moment. The Judge repeated his question - he then said he either was or felt himself in a very serious situation - that he had taken very able advice, and had been advised to destroy the cheque, and had destroyed it. The Judge said, no honourable man could have given such advice, and we left the Judge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. You have been an attorney many years - A. Thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any words with Mr. Brookes - A. Never, till on this occasion. I never had anything to do with him till this came into my office.</p>
               <p>Q. Since that has there not been circumstances under which you thought Mr. Brookes had used words which irritated you; you thinking you did not deserve them - A. Yes. I have expressed a determination to bring him to public trial. I was examined as a witness for Clarke, against Brookes in the Common Pleas.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Brookes considered your evidence as not true - A. I do not know. I have been threatened, and stopped in the street, and had mobs raised about me. I have been intimidated in all manner of ways. On the 14th I commenced proceedings to get the cheque, and then he charged me with perjury, conspiracy, fraud, and every thing. He threatened me in the public street, to charge me with perjury.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated that Brookes handed over the cheque to his counsel in Court - did you mean to state positively that you saw him deliver it into my hand - A. I am positive, it was handed up to the Judge, and afterwards came into the hands of Clarke's counsel - Clarke saw it; we both saw it. It was afterwards handed to somebody. I never saw the original cheque after I left the Court. No application was made to the Judge to direct it to be impounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the action brought by Brookes against Clarke, on the bill of Griffiths still pending - A. It is. I should state that he told the Judge he meant to decline that action. The record has been withdrawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember immediately after the trial, which was on the 12th of June, which party served the other with a summons - A. I did. The first summons was on the 14th.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this summons, which is ours - A. This is dated the 13th. I do not believe it was served. I believe the first summons served on me, was on the 17th, 18th, and 19th. They were in the cause in the King's Bench. I only speak from the papers, and I have but three summonses here - (looking at a paper) - this is my clerk's writing, signed in my name, and by my authority. I believe no summons was served on me before the 17th. The paper which I say is my clerk's writing is dated the 15th of June. I was attending the Judge on the subject of the summons, and this was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the paper dated the 15th, which came out of your office, entitled</p>
               <p>"Brookes against Clarke" - A. Yes. It is the names of the three clerks referred to in my evidence on the cause. He has previously desired this to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, before this paper was delivered by you at the Judge's chambers, had not Brookes asked for the names of these very persons, and had you not declined to give them - A. I had. I think this was about the 14th or 15th, after I had taken out the summons to produce the cheque. The request was made to me immediately after the trial. He sent a letter to me for the names - I did not answer the letter. Some conversation took place before Mr. Justice Best, that he had not got the names; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here they are."</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether at the Judge's chambers, you did not decline giving the names - A. I did not. I think it was on the 14th. I did not deny having said Brookes had made admissions before three of my clerks, or anything like it. He asked for my clerks' names, and I gave them to him, and the Judge commended me for it. This was on the 14th or 15th, when I was before the Judge, in consequence of an order in the other cause. I think the summons was taken out on the 14th, and I attended on the 15th, and then this declaration about the clerks took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was called on the trial to prove Clarke's handwriting - A. Turner. (Looking at a letter) I believe this is the copy of the letter sent me, for the names of the three persons. I have the copy of an affidavit made by Brookes - I think it was sent to me on the 14th or 15th. The draft of an affidavit was delivered to me before I gave him the name - one of the names is my clerk and son. I cannot say whether he was present at the trial - I think he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not examined to prove some notice - A.(Looks at a brief.) I think he was examined to prove the service of a notice - he was not examined to prove the acknowledgement. When we were before the Judge about the cheque, the Judge said he should order it into the hands of Isaacson, and if he did not produce it from time to time, the Court would know how to deal with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the amount of your costs in the causes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230005"></xptr>in which Clarke and Brookes have been engaged - A. I should think upwards of 100 l. up to the middle of June; but my bill is not made out. 50 l. was paid in by Bicknell, on the 17th of June, and afterwards 90 l. I should think I have a claim for 100 l. now.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Have you the money in Court ready to deliver up if the Court order it - A. I have. It came to me from my client, and I thought it my duty to have it here.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave evidence of a conversation you had with the prisoner on the trial - A. I did, this account was produced as coming from his office - it is a debtor and creditor's account between him and Clarke. I produced it on the part of Clarke; (read.) It appears by this account that Brookes makes himself a debtor of 13 l. 5 s. 6 d., and that was the verdict. I stated in my evidence that the conversation I had with Brookes was in the presence of three of my clerks. I was not served with the summons dated the 13th. I was attending the Judge on the 15th, and on that occasion the names of my clerks were verbally requested.</p>

            . I am an agent. I sell goods by commission. I was acquainted with Salmon, a Bow-street officer, and recollect his having purchased a horse of me in December, 1821 - he paid me part in money, and a 15 l. bill. I knew Clarke, and applied to him to get it discounted. I accompanied him to the prisoner's office, in Board-court, Bow-street - I stood outside, and gave Clarke the bill to take to him to get discounted. (A bill was here shewn the witness.) This is the bill; it is drawn by me on Salmon, at two months date, dated the 16th of December. He came out to me - the bill was at last discounted. Clarke handed over to me the proceeds of the bill that instant, at his own house. I never left him till he gave me a cheque for 10 l. on Hodsoll's, also three sovereigns, and 15 s. - 25 s. was allowed for discount. During the time I was with him, he had no opportunity of writing anything on the cheque. I cannot say whether, when the cheque was given to me, there were any figures or name at the back of it. He lives in Bow-street, three or four hundred yards from Brookes's house. He had no opportunity while I was with him of making any writing on it. I do not know whether there was any writing on it. The cheque was paid by Messrs. Hodsoll.</p>

            , written under them. I told him it was nothing like Clarke's handwriting; that was my opinion on it, and said I would call my wife, who had seen Clarke's hand-writing, to take her opinion on it - she came and said in his presence it was nothing like Clarke's hand-writing, from what she had seen of it. I went several times to Mr. Justice Best's chambers, but did not see the cheque there, or at all after he produced it at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. When you took it in your hand you said you thought it was not the handwriting of Clarke - A. The cheque was not; it was drawn by Brookes, on Messrs. Hodsoll's, for 10 l.; the endorsement was very different to Clarke's writing. I said I was satisfied it was not his writing, but would call my wife to hear her opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunities have you of seeing Clarke's writing - A. I had several clubs at his house when he lived in Stanhope-street. I always found his writing a loose straggling hand. He seldom wrote his Christian name at full length - he generally wrote it Wm. I have seen him write William in full on bills. His hand was a very bad one. The endorsement I saw was William at full length under the figures.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, what is your belief as to that - A. This has a great resemblance to Clarke's writing - it is at full length. I should take it to be Clarke's writing; I think it something like it. (Looking at another paper,) This is quite the contrary - I should not take it to be anything like his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Clarke has some defect in his arm - A. He was thrown out of a gig three or four years ago; whether he has recovered I do not know.</p>

            . I was examined as a witness in the case of Clarke and Brookes, in the Common Pleas. I was afterwards arrested on the 7th of August for debt, and on the 8th of August I saw the prisoner in Cold Bath-fields prison, (the sheriff's officer had taken my word.) After being in conversation about five minutes, Brookes came down to me from the Governor's house, in company with Clarke. I walked to the end of the garden with him, and he said,</p>
               <p>"My life is at stake," or</p>
               <p>"My life is in danger; will you swear that is Clarke's hand at the back of the cheque?" I said I had never seen the cheque, and it was impossible for me to say whether it was, I only saw it as it was handed by the counsel to the Judge, at the trial of the cause - he said</p>
               <p>"Of course Clarke has told you what I have directed him." I told him I understood from the papers that the cheque had been destroyed, that I had seen Clarke's writing repeatedly, but if I had seen it, and knew it to be his hand writing, I should have said so. About this time Isaacson and one Bates came in, and Mr. Brookes and Isaacson went up to the other side of the Governor's garden, and stopped about five or ten minutes; Brookes then came back to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Any communication you will make to Mr. Isaacson will be the same as making it to me, for really my mind is so agitated I do not know what I am talking of;" (this was between the first and second examination.) I said I wished to do him no injury, and should not have attended if he had not sent for me. I went outside, and soon after Isaacson came.</p>

I accompanied him to Cold Bath-fields one day, where the prisoner was confined. It was in the summer time, after the prisoner's examinations - I saw him in the garden. I neither held out any promise or threat to him - the conversation was not addressed to me. I heard it from beginning to end. Clarke was requested by the prisoner not to attend at Bow-street - Clarke said he would not, provided money was deposited to pay his expences; Brookes agreed to this. I did not hear Brookes say anything particular before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Begin the conversation; what first passed - A. Clarke said,</p>
               <p>"This is Mr. Bicknall from Stretton's," and that he wished me to come with them for the purpose they had been talking about the last time they met. Brookes said the expences should be paid. Brookes then gave me a 100 l. Bank note, 25 l. more in Bank notes, and a bill for 25 l. at a short date - it was paid into my hands, and an undertaking was given. I paid 50 l. of the money back to Mr. Hills's brother, and the 100 l. I gave Clarke himself - I gave up the undertaking also. This was ten days or a fortnight ago.</p>

            . On the 16th of October, I left a copy of this notice at Mr. Hanson's office; he is Mr. Brookes's solicitor. On the 17th, I served a copy on the prisoner in Newgate. I was present at the last attendance on the summons. Mr. Justice Best asked for the cheque, the prisoner hesitated a little while, and said he had not got the cheque; but had taken legal advice, and destroyed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Isaacson was present, and had the same opportunity of hearing this as you had - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The notice was here read, for the production of the original cheque.</p>
               <p>The copy of the cheque was here put in, and read.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in an exceeding long Defence, stated he had discounted various bills for the prosecutor, Clarke, several of which were dishonoured, and among others he discounted Griffith's; and about a fortnight before that became due, Clarke called with Seager's bill, for 15 l. 10 s., and being told by Turner, the clerk, that the prosecutor was engaged, sent the bill up with a note, desiring 3 l., and stating that the rest would do on the 14th. The prisoner sent down four sovereigns, and on the 17th the prosecutor called and stated that Griffith's bill would not be paid, and asked him to take another, for which the prisoner agreed to do if he approved of it, and between four and five o'clock on the same day Clarke called, and in the back office gave him Salmon's bill, for Griffith's, and then asked for the residue of Seager's bill, and the prisoner gave him 15 s.; he charged 15 s. discount, which with the four sovereigns made cash, 5 l. 10 s., and a cheque for 10 l., and in coming into the front office, the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18221023-1-person72">drew</persName>
             the cheque, endorsed the particulars on it, and handed it to Clarke to sign, which he immediately did; and it was done to show which bill was paid for Griffith's. - The prisoner then made several severe comments on the character of Mr. Hill; stating that he had been advised to do anything to get out of his hands, which was the reason he proposed to compromise the matter, and that he would rather forfeit every farthing he had, than stand at the bar of this Court. - He then stated the case he had to prove, which will appear from the following evidence.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner two or three years. I have been intimate with him during that time. I have known him I suppose seven years. I was attorney in the case of Clarke against Brookes, and am also his attorney in the case against Clarke, who is now in the King's Bench, for trial. My offices were at his house in Broad-court. He occasionally discounts bills for persons. I know Clarke. I was present at Brookes's trial. I recollect a cheque produced, drawn by Brookes, on his bankers, with the endorsement in question on it. I think it was Turner, who swore to the hand-writing of the name of Clarke - Turner is a clerk to me, as well as Brookes. Clarke was present at the trial. I do not think any questions were put to any witness tending to prove the name

             was a forgery; it formed part of Brookes's case. If any such questions had been put to any witness, I believe I must have heard it. The cheque was handed publicly about the Court - I think after it was done with, it was handed at the end of the trial by Mr. Hill to Brookes. I believe Hill made no objection to the cheque. (Looks at the summons dated the 13th of June,) This was obtained by Brookes - I did not serve it, or attend any Judge on this summons. I attended the summons on the 15th, at the time Hill produced this paper. Hill attended in consequence of a summons, and produced the paper with the witnesses's names. I understood from him, that he attended in consequence of the summons. I believe Turner had taken the draft of an affidavit to Hill before that. I attended Mr. Justice Best's chambers on one or two occasions, and was there when application was made to Mr. Brookes to produce the cheque. I stood close to the Judge's table, and heard all that passed - Hill applied for the cheque, and it was produced, and the Judge ordered a copy of it to be delivered to Hill, and that he should have an opportunity of inspecting the original. Mr. Hill afterwards took out a summons for it to be produced before three or four persons - we did not attend the first summons for some days, and then Mr. Hill made an appointment, and we attended. Brookes then refused to produce the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230007"></xptr>cheque; he said he was advised not to produce it, and that he did not intend to go on with the action, and should not produce it - if anything more had been said, I must have heard it. I do not recollect that he said anything else. I do not recollect that he said he had destroyed it. Since the prisoner's committal I have had frequent conversations with Clarke on this business. I am acquainted with Brookes's writing. (Looking at the letter written to Sir

               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You are an attorney - A. Yes. My office was in Broad-court, in Brookes's house. He has been my clerk since the 10th of October, 1821. I live in Holborn, and have an office there now. I have lived there since October, 1821. My name is now off Brookes's door; it was put on last April or May; I carried on business till then without any name. I took my name off a fortnight ago. There was no motion pending in Court about me and Brookes when the name was put on the door. He and Turner, his brother-in-law, were my clerks at the time. I swear they were my clerks. I did some business for Clarke, the prosecutor, in the case of Sutherland; I never saw Clarke on the business, it was done by Brookes, my managing clerk. I was present at the trial in the Common Pleas; an account was produced, (looking at it,) it is in Turner's writing. I was not present when it was made; it was produced in evidence, on behalf of the plaintiff. One Astley was called as a witness, and one Mann - I do not recollect that they proved admissions on the part of Brookes - I will not swear they did not, but I do not recollect it. (Looking at a letter,) This is Turner's writing. I dare say it was sent from my office; it is done by my authority, in consequence of the Judge's order. (The letter inclosing a copy of the cheque, was here read.) I was a witness on the trial. After the trial was over, the cheque remained in Brookes's possession - he produced it before the Judge; he did not deliver it to me afterwards. Mr. Justice Best directed it to be delivered into my hands, to be produced at the trial of the cause in the King's Bench, and at chambers. I requested Brookes to deliver it to me; he refused. I do not know whether it is really destroyed or not. I do not recollect hearing Mr. Justice Best say he believed no honourable man would advise the destruction of the cheque. I did not hear Brookes say he felt himself in difficulty. I took out a summons on the 12th, for Mr. Hill to give up the names of the three clerks. There is no endorsement of service at the back of the summons.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. You are under recognizance to attend here - A. Yes. Brookes was my managing clerk - I did not live in the house, and it was necessary for him to transact business with many clients, whom I did not see.</p>

Brookes came to his desk, took out his cheque book, and wrote a cheque for 10 l. - I saw the cheque. He gave the cheque to Clarke, and said,</p>
               <p>"Clarke, you had better endorse this cheque;" (looking at the duplicate of the cheque,) that is the hand-writing of Mr. Brookes. I saw him tear the cheque off to give to Clarke - I saw him also write something in the margin of the cheque at the time. I do not know whether this was before he tore off the cheque, but it was at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he said,</p>
               <p>"Clarke, you had better endorse the cheque" - A. I am; I have not the least doubt of it, and he did endorse it - Arthur was present during the whole transaction, and after it was over, said something to him about brandy. Clarke went away with the cheque. I know that Griffith's bill was dishonoured.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this account, do you know whose writing it is - A. Yes; I wrote it. (This was the account produced on the part of the prosecution.) Clarke came to me with one Mann, for a settlement of the account, between him and Brookes, it was in February last, and at Clarke's desire. I wrote this account by his dictation - Brookes said it was not correct when I took it up stairs to him. I returned with it to Clarke, and told him Brookes said it was not correct, but if he would look in in two or three days he would make a settlement with him. I laid the paper on the desk, and Clarke took it away with him. I think it was the day after the trial that I took a letter from Brookes to Mr. Hill - (looks at it,) this is it, (read.) (This letter was dated the 13th of June, requesting the names of the three clerks, as before stated.) Mr. Hill did not give the names up in consequence of this letter; in consequence of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230008"></xptr>which, I took out a summons the same afternoon, and served a copy of the summons myself that evening. I believe it was to attend next day, but I did not attend the summons myself. A copy of an affidavit was served on Hill that day or the day after. He attended the summons.

            ,) The body of this letter is certainly not in Brookes's writing. (Looking at two letters,) I have no doubt but these are both Clarke's writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have been employed by the prisoner, in what capacity - A. I am clerk to Isaacson. Mr. Brookes managed the business. I never knew that the prisoner was an attorney, nor ever heard that he passed as one. Clarke has employed him repeatedly since I have been in the office; but whether he employed him as an attorney or not, I do not know. I have lived there two years. Isaacson has an office in Holborn now, but had not in December last. The account produced is in my hand-writing; but I wrote it by Clarke's desire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not bring it down stairs, and deliver it yourself as a settled account to Mann - A. I did not. I was examined at Westminster Hall; the original cheque was produced there. I think I swore that I believed it was Clarke's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have swore to day you saw Clarke write the endorsement - A. Yes, I did. I was not asked at Westminster Hall, if I saw him write it. I attended the first and third examinations at Bow-street - I was not summoned to attend the second, and did not go, as there was nobody to attend to the business. If I had been wanted I could have been fetched in a moment. I was in and out most all day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep out of the way - A. No. The copy of the cheque was produced at the first examination. I said I had no recollection of making the copy; but it was very similar to my hand-writing. I at first said I did not know whose writing it was, and that I did not recollect writing it. The examination was between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I did not know where Brookes was - I wanted to see him particularly. The servant said he was gone with Salmon to Bow-street. I went into the office and found him in custody, and was so completely astonished I scarcely know what I said, for I had not been in the place above ten minutes before I was examined.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. You were taken under circumstances of great surprise at Bow-street - A. Yes. I had not the slightest reason to expect I should find him in custody, and it agitated me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. By whom were you paid your wages - A. Sometimes by Brookes, and sometimes by Isaacson. I was paid weekly, and Brookes was paid weekly.</p>
               <p>HENRY ARTHUR. I am a broker of the City. On the 17th of December, I lived at Mr. Brookes's house, in Broad-court. I had lived there about four years. I had the privelege of all the house, and slept in the top room, and had the use of the iron-chest in the front office. I have seen Clarke. I saw him in Brookes's house, some days before Christmas day, it was about five o'clock in the evening. Mr. Turner was sitting in the front office. I was putting some Spanish bonds in the iron-case, and Brookes came from the back office, followed by Clarke. The desk is divided by a railing - the iron-chest is outside the rail. Turner sat opposite Mr. Brookes, within the rail. Brookes sat down within the rail, on a stool - Clarke stood at the corner of a desk by Brookes, within the rail, and about the length of the desk, which came about a yard from him. Brookes was writing - I could not see what he was writing. While he was writing, I heard him tell Clarke to sign the back of the cheque; Clarke leant over as if he was signing - I did not see a pen in his hand, as his back was turned to me. As he was going away, I told him to let me have a gallon of brandy as good as that he had let Mr. Brookes have - he said he could not warrant what he had, but he expected some from Sir

               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You saw Clarke and Brookes come out of the front office - A. I did. I saw no cheque-book. I am certain Brookes told Clarke to sign the back of the cheque, not the back of the bill. I attended at Westminster Hall to prove this.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What way of life are you in - A. An artist; employed by people. Mr. Bish employs me now. I have not done much lately, as my health is bad. I live in Upper John-street, Fitzroy-square. I have occasionally lived at a house kept by the prisoner's mother, in Lower Newman-street. I never received anything from her for any service. The last work I carried home was to Mr. Power, a music-seller, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>MR. HOWARD. I am an attorney. (Looking at the two signatures, W. Clarke, referred to in Ward's evidence.) I have frequently seen Clarke write, and believe both these to be his writing, certainly. He has been a client of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the back of this bill - A. I believe that to be his writing. I think I should take that bill as his endorsement. (This was the bill for which the cheque was given.)</p>

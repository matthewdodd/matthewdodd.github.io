                  </hi>. I live in Westbrook-cottages, South Kennington. Between one and two o'clock in the morning, on the 25th of June, I was going past Keonington-common—the prisoner came up and caught hold of my right arm—she said, "My dear," or something—I said, "Go away woman'—she kept hovering alongside of me, and eventually I found the button off my trowsers, my trowsers torn down, and the money in my purse was taken, ojtf of my trowsers pocket, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my waistcoat pocket—I missed that first—I caught her hand, and took a half-crown and two shillings out of her hand—that did not belong to the purse—she said, "Don't take any notice, you have got your money back"—I said, "Stop, you are not got till I find my other money"—I then felt and found one of the rings of my purse gone, and all the money taken out—there had been three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and five shillings in it—I called the police—the prisoner fell down, and was taken.</p>

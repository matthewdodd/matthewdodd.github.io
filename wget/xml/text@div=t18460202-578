                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 106.) On Saturday evening, Jan. 3, about half-past five o'clock, I saw Bell in New-street-square, with a heavy roll of lead on his shoulder—I stopped him, and asked him where he was going to take it—he said, "I am going to take it there," point<lb></lb>ing to No. 29, Newstreet-square—I asked where there—he said, "To Mr. Bell"—I asked where he brought it from—he said it was right enough, and for our satisfaction he would take us to his master's—another officer joined me, and we went to No. 12, Chichester-rents, where the prosecutor's shop is—before we got quite up to the shop Bell remarked, "Here is our shop," and when we got to the shop he pointed to Tiswell and said, "There is my master"—he called him up to him, and said he had been stopped by two po<lb></lb>licemen—I said we had stopped him, as we were aware there was a great quantity of lead stolen, and that we had now come round to ascertain whether or no his statement was correct—Tiswell remarked that it was right enough; that it was sent down to Mr. Bell's to be worked up on Monday morning—I asked if he was that party's master—he said he was—I asked him if he had entrusted him with the lead—he said he had—he then asked us back to a small room at the further end of the shop—when we were got into that, I remarked that if it was right we did not want anything more, but that it ap<lb></lb>peared to me to be a private house where the lead was going to, and asked for what purpose the lead was taken there—after hesitating a little while, he remarked to me that he declined to answer that question—I do not think there was a blind to the shop window—when we were coming away I said</p>

               <p>they might probably hear more about it—the name of "Stone" was on a pane of glass in the window, and Tiswell said, "There is my name"—I asked how long he had been in business there—he said, "About nine years"—we let Bell go, and followed him—he took the lead to No. 29, New-street-square—in consequence of information we went to that house the same evening, and in the front room on the first floor, we found the same lead—we brought it away—we took Tiswell into custody about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock the same night—he asked for what I was wanting him—I remarked, for dis<lb></lb>posing of property which was not his own, and I believe I remarked "lead" to him—as we were proceeding to the station he remarked that Mr. Mas<lb></lb>kell, in looking over the papers or the books (I am not sure which) would see it was not so bad as he thought it to be—when we got to the station he was questioned by the station-sergeant, who had a pen in his hand, but I do not believe he wrote down the questions he put to the prisoner—he asked him how he came to represent himself to be master of the place—he replied, "To save" or "screen the man."</p>

I was on duty in New-street, and saw a man carrying a quantity of lead to the house No. 29, New-street square—soon afterwards I saw Bell going in a direction towards the same house—I stopped him, and asked where he got the lead from which he was carrying, and told him I had seen another lot go into the same house—he said, "Don't be in a hurry, it is all right; I brought it from my master's, in Chichester-rents"—we left the lead in custody, and went to Tiswell's—when we got within a yard or two of the door Bell said, "Here master, these policemen stopped me with this lead"—Tiswell said, "It is all right, walk this way"—he was asked for what purpose the lead was gone to Bell's—he said, "I don't think I have a right to answer that question"—when we got against the door he said, "There is my name, wont that do? my name is Stone"—the question was put how long he had been in business—he said, "Nine years"—we went back, and saw Bell take the lead into No. 29, New-street-square—Bell lives there—we searched the house, and found the lead in the room—I have compared it with the prosecutor's lead, and it cor<lb></lb>responds.</p>

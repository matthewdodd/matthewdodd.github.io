               <p>Q. What did you observe of that shilling after she went out of the shop. - A. I observed that it was a bad one. I have got it in my pocket now, I have had it ever since. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the shilling is it. - A. It is. She came again on the 13th of the same month for some mutton; the bit of mutton came to thirteen pence; she gave me two shillings, and she wanted more meat to make it up two shillings; I then looked at the two shillings and told her they were both bad. I asked her whether she had any more to change them, she said no; I told her to stop a bit and I would fetch my husband; in the mean time I was gone to fetch my husband she went out of the shop and left the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went for your husband had you told her that she had been there before. - A. Yes; I told her she was the same person that was there the week before; she said she was never in the shop before to her knowledge. Then I went out of the shop to my husband; I gave the two shillings into my husband's hands. When I returned she was gone out of the shop. My husband went after her; he brought her back, he told her if she did not tell him where the two shillings were got from, he would take her up; she said she got them at the pawnbroker's. We asked her at what pawnbrokers, she said she did not know. My husband sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What constable came. - A. Mr. Kennedy; he searched her, and found nothing then.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the post at the corner of Playhouse-yard, after my wife gave me the two shillings; she had left the meat and the money in my shop. This woman saw me come across the road; she made up to Playhouse-yard; she made a run, I insisted upon her coming back; I overtook her, she refused; I got her back and got her searched by Kennedy at the public house, Worship-street; Mr. Kennedy pulled off her bonnet, and in pulling it off a shilling dropped into her bosom; I saw it and told Mr. Kennedy of it. He searched down her bosom and found it; that shilling Mr. Kennedy has got. The two shillings that the prisoner passed the second time Armstrong has got. I am sure they are the same shillings that my wife gave me, I marked them with my steel. When I took her back to the house I wanted to get out of her where she had them from; she was quite pert, I got no intelligence from her; first of all she said she had them from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020005"></xptr>a pawnbroker's, but she would not inform me their names.

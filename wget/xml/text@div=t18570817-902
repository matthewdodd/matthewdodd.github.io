On 16th July I was on duty at Sydenham, at a little before 8 o'clock in the evening, and met the prisoner—he said, "What shall I do with this, policeman?" having a piece of lead pipe—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "In Longton Grove"—I told him that he had no business with it, he had better take it to the station—I followed him there, and then he said that he got it near a well in a field belonging to Mr. Sewell—I went there, and found that some pipe had been broken off recently—the well was dry—there were some unfinished build<lb></lb>ings there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Everett-street, Russell-square—he keeps an oil and Italian warehouse. The prisoner was his errand-boy for about a fortnight—on the 17th of May I had some money in a little tin box, in a roll of pictures, in a drawer at the top of the house—the drawer had no handle to it—I saw it secure about seven o'clock in the morning, and missed it about half past six o'clock in the evening, when I came home—I have never found the money since—my father accused the prisoner of it in the evening, in my presence—he would hardly sayy any thing, whether he had taken it or not—my father sent me round to the prisoner's mother—I lost one sovereign and a half out of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was in the box.</p>

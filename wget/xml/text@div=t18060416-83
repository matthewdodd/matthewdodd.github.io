               <p>Q. Your apprentice gave you an alarm. - A. Yes, on Wednesday evening the 12th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not before seven. - A. It was before seven, I should suppose in the last quarter, I think it was in the last quarter before seven; as we came in it was seven o'clock, when I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been in pursuit of the man it was seven o'clock when you returned. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from the pursuit was not you gone more than a quarter of an hour. - A. No, I am confident of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard your apprentice call out Stop thief. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of light was there at that time of night. - A. It must be considerably after six, else we should have no occasion to have put lights in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been lighted. - A. They had not been trimmed for a great while, I suppose they had been burning nearly half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out was there any day light. - A. No; when I went out the first person that I saw was a woman, that directed me to pursue after the prisoner; when I got up to them they were threatening to knock my boy down for pursuing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them. - A. At the corner of Leg Alley, just about eight houses from the corner of Hart-street in James-street, there is a public house between my house and Hart-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to the prisoners they were threatening to knock your boy down. - A. Yes, when I came up I asked the boy which was the man that cut the glass, he shewed me him, I went up and took Lancey directly; directly I took him he threw something from him, but what I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you bring Lancey back to. - A. I brought him back to my own house; as I was coming back the boy pointed out Britten to me, I was so angry I did not look after Britten much, for I had been robbed four times in a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man the boy pointed out to you was the prisoner Britten. - A. He was much the same size man, but he had a great coat on then.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought Lancey back. - A. Yes, and placed him in my parlour, and sent my apprentice for the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your shop. - A. When the officers came, we went before the magistrate, and when I came back I put up the shutters before I went to the office, I had not examined any thing of my loss.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went with the officer to the office. A. Yes, the magistrate particularly asked me whether I had missed any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoner. - A. No, I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came back and examined your window. - A. Yes, I found half a pane of glass cut, and pushed in; one pair of velvet shoes were missing, and six pair of boots were huddled togher.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there room enough for a man's hand to be put in. - A. Before the officer and my boy I put my two fists in, and there was room enough for two more; I missed one pair of shoes, and about six pair of boots were huddled together and drawed up to the breach in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of your window while you and your apprentice were pursuing the thief. - A. Two young women and Mrs. Tapper.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not miss the shoes immediately. - A. My wife was alarmed with the boy calling out Stop thief as well as me, she went and stood at the door with these two young women till I came back, she went to the door as soon as me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent. - A. I was not absent four minutes.</p>


               <p>Q. You brought the man back again in four minutes after you left the house, did you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not found the shoes again. - A. No.</p>

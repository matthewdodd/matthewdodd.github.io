                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, we are patten-makers, and live in Brook-street, Lambeth. The prisoner was in our employ as commission-agent, and to receive orders—we paid him as he obtained the orders—he was to receive money on our account—it was his duty to bring back the whole money to me, and to receive the commission—on the 25th of January I packed up some clogs to go to. Mr. Pearce, in the Walworth-road—the prisoner was to take them, and to receive 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he should have brought that to me when he returned, but he.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable</hi> £ 51.) I took the prisoner an the 5th of February, in Mint-street, Borough. I told him I wanted him for abscond<lb></lb>ing with his master's money—he said, "I know I took the money, but it was for want of bread—my master can't make a felony of it, it is a breach of trust."</p>

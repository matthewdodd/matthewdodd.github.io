On the afternoon of the 24th of June, I saw the prisoner in the shop - he came in and asked to see a waistcoat; one of the men directed him up stairs, and I went up and saw him putting on a pair of trousers; I asked if he was looking out anything else, the man said, Yes, a waistcoat; I said, "Go down and I will attend to him" - I said to the prisoner, "Do these suit you?" he said, "I should like a better pair;" I said, "What price will you give?" he said, 20s.; I said, "Try these on," he said, "I think they will do;" I said, "And you will take this waistcoat;" he said, yes; he took them down stairs, and he said, "I am going a little further to pay for a pair of boots;" I said, very well; I put my foot against the door, and said, "Excuse me, I cannot let you go, I suspect you have something about you belonging to us;" he said, "Pray forgive me, will you?" I said, "Take off your hat;" he took off his hat, I found in it a pair of trousers - I had not sold them to him; I sent for an officer who came, and he said, "Are these yours?" I said, yes; he said, "Do you know them?" I said, "Yes; there is a ticket on them; the officer looked at them, and the ticket was gone; the officer looked in his mouth, and saw a piece of paper which I suppose to be part of the ticket torn off - the trousers had a ticket on them in the shop, but it was missing from those found in his hat - he had not bought them - Mr. William Bousfield is in partnership with his brother John Bousfield.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

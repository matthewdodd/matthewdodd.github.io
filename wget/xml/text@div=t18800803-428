                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at the Gun Boat, kept by Michael Cooke—on the 12th July, between 1.30 and 2.a.m., I was awoke by a noise in my room and saw a man there—he opened a drawer and turned the things over—I watched him four or five minutes—there was a little lamp on the mantelpiece—I saw him sideways—he saw me looking at him and went out of the room—I got out of bed, lit the candle and followed him—he was then on the landing—this was on the third stair—when he found me coming out to him he escaped by the back room window—the prisoner is the man, I have no doubt about him—I have seen him three or four times before—he had no boots on—Mr. Ebbs's house is next door, and there is a verandah at our back bed room window—when the prisoner got out of the window I saw his full front face—he turned to look at me, and I held the candle to him—I had seen that window closed at 12 o'clock, but not fastened—I did not see him open it, but it was open when he went through it—I missed a gold broach value 18*. from the dressing-table which he had been rummaging—it belonged to the landlord's daughter—on 19th July I took my baby to a doctor at Shadwell and ran against the prisoner on the doctor's step—he turned round three times and looked at me, but I never spoke—on 24th July I met him again, followed him, and gave him in custody.</p>

I live at 106, St. George's Street, and am night watch<lb></lb>man at a lodging-house next door to the Gun Boat—on 12th July, between 12.30 and 1 o'clock the prisoner came to me and asked for a night's lodging, but he had not any money—I went to the manager, but when I came back I could not find the prisoner—I searched all over the house for him; upstairs and down, and in every spare bed down to the coal-cellar and in the closet—I searched for him I should think about half a dozen times during the night, and about 5.30 a.m. I found him in a bed which he had no right to be in—I asked him what right he had to be there, and that I had been looking for him all night—he said, "It is not very likely you would find me because I did not come here till 3 o'clock"—it would not have been possible for him to come in at the door without my knowing it—it would be easy for a person to get out of window on to the wall and on the leads of the Gun Boat—he had been a regular lodger for three months, I do not think he missed a night—that was 12 months ago, and then he broke off to one or two nights a week—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man applied on this night—the room where this occurred is called the third room, but it is on the first floor—the ground floor is used as a kitchen—the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

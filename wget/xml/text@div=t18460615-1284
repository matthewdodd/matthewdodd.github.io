I produce a copy of the marriage-register at the parish church of St. Giles, Camberwell—I compared it with the original reg'ster—(<hi rend="italic">this was again read, as in the last case</hi>)—the prisoner was married to Josephine Langhorn—she was well known to me—she was my sister-in-law—I think I saw her last in 1842, when she came to England—I am well acquainted with her handwriting—the members of my family and myself have constantly corresponded with her—I have a letter which her mother received on the 15th of April—the date, according to the American post-mark is the 29th of March—this letter is her writing—I had a great many letters, but I destroyed them before I heard of this—the prisoner states that they were separated by mutual consent—I believe it to be a great falsehood—I have no reason to believe she has been separated from him by mutual consent.</p>

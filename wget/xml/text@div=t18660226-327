                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of the Blackfriars-road—on 29th January, about 8.15, I was in Church-row, Newington Butts, and saw a little boy run across the road—a horse and trap was coming along at the same time, driven by the prisoner—when the child was three or four yards in front of the horse, somebody called out to him—he was turning round to see if a party was coming after him—the horse knocked him down, and the wheel passed over him—the dog<lb></lb>cart was going about ten miles an hour—it went on a hundred yards or a little more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 30, Frederick-place, Newington-butts—on Monday night, 24th January, about a quarter past 8 o'clock, I was outside the Peacock, and saw the little boy run across the road—Mr. Smith came with a dog<lb></lb>cart and three <hi rend="italic">gents</hi> in it, and a servant—I saw the cart five or six yards from the boy—somebody called out "Heigh," but he did not stop—he ran over the boy, and went 200 or 300 yards before I caught him—I brought him back—I did not take hold of the horse—when I told him to stop, he stopped and turned round—I followed by the side of the horse's head, but did not take hold of the reins—I went to the station—he abused me for running after the trap—I told him he had run over a boy, and he turned back, and came to the Plough and Harrow, which is twenty or twenty-five yards from the Peacock, and the police took him in custody—I should think he was intoxicated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the L division of police—on 29th January, Mr. Jones, the prisoner's solicitor, called on me to go with him to Kennington-lane police-station to examine the prisoner, and see if I could give him a certificate to get him out on bail—we went to the station at 11 o'clock to examine the prisoner—he was represented to have bleeding piles, which I could not satisfy myself of, and therefore could not give him a certificate to get him out—I was asked to pay particular attention to whether he had been drinking or not—I examined him, and found he had been drinking—he spoke thick, his pupils were dilated, he smelt of drink, and had a flushed countenance and a full pulse; all indicating that he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not all those be symptoms of great excite<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—a man's pulse would be greatly accelerated by excitement, but it would not be of that full character—I saw that he had piles, but not bleeding piles—if a man has piles, it is very imprudent to drink—any doctor would tell him to abstain from drink—I had never seen him before—if he was in a state of excitement his eyes would not be dilated—I have been accustomed to all degrees of drunken men, and am quite satisfied he had been drinking—I cannot say what drink he smelt of, you cannot tell after some hours—if a man has been drinking recently you may tell what he has taken by the smell, but in two hours and a half you get a peculiar aether, coming from the lungs only—if he had been drinking porter at half-past 7, I should not have smelt it—I should not know whether it was whisky or porter, but a quarter of an hour afterwards I might tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say whether he was drunk, so as to be incapable of managing a vehicle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he might be in that state that he could drive, but not with that care he would if he was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—on Monday night, the 29th January, a boy about eight years old was brought there in a state of extreme shock from injuries to the head—there was a fracture on the right side of his head, and a bruise on the left side—he was in a sinking condition, and died in about three-quarters of an hour—there was a mark of dirt on the right side of his face, and the skin was just knocked off—I was present when a post<lb></lb>mortem examination was made—the fracture of the head was found to extend to the base of the skull, and on the left side there was another small fracture—there was a pint of coagulated blood in the stomach that had been swallowed, and which was the cause of death—I see a great number of cases of running over—I cannot say whether he had been run over, but it is an accident that running over might produce—knocking down would not do it, unless he fell from a considerable height.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the fracture on the right side cause the rupture of any vessels of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from which blood had oozed at the</p>

               <p>back of the throat, and had been swallowed—if the right side of the head is fractured, the shock may produce a slight fracture on the left side, but not the description of fracture which this was—this was a small vertical fracture of about an inch on the left side—it did not correspond, it was not in the same segment as the fracture on the right side—supposing the boy had been thrown violently down by the shoulder of a horse or a dog<lb></lb>cart, and thrown on the right side of his head, it might produce the fracture of the skull on the right side which I saw, but not one which would extend so far into the base of the brain—I cannot say that it might not do so, but in the cases I have seen, there has been a contracting force to oppose it—if he was thrown on the road, there would be nothing above his head, and it would rebound—what I say is, that the worst fracture of the two required pressure on both sides of the head—I do not think the injury could have been caused by his being struck by the shaft, thrown violently on the road, and turned over and over, but I do not say that it might not.</p>

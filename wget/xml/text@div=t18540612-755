                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old; I live in Arthur-street, Old Kent-road. I am in the employ of the London and Brighton Railway Company—at the commencement of May I was sent with the prisoner with a load of oysters from the Bricklayers' Arms station to the King's Cross station—they were in forty bags, which were tied up; the prisoner was driving the van; it was an open van—I was sitting on the tail of the van—as we were going along Cheapside, the prisoner called me up to untie a knot in his whip—when I got to him, he told me to take some oysters out of the bags, and to take the ropes out of the bag under the seat, and put the oysters in, and put the ropes on the top of them—he told me not to take them out just then, but when we got further along—he did not say what they were to be taken out for, nor for whom; he said he wanted them; I went back to the tail of the wagon, and when we got past the Post-office he told me I might begin—there was a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> coming along, and he told me to wait till that went by—I think this must have been between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning—before he said the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was coming by, I had taken some of the oysters—he said that about more than one <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he said so two or three times—I took out forty or fifty oysters altogether—I put them in the bag, as I was told—by the time I got them out, I had got by Bagnigge-wells brewery, and then he told me to wait till I got by the police station—after we got past, he said, "That will do; we are nearly there; put the ropes in again"—I put the ropes in the bag, on the top of the oysters—we went on to King's-cross station, and the prisoner unloaded the bags—the bag with the ropes and the oysters in was fastened underneath the seat—he told me to give the horse some water, and the railway porter stopped me, and took me back to where the prisoner was—one of the officers asked me who took the oysters out; I said, "I did," but that the prisoner told me to do it—that was said in the presence of the prisoner, and he said, "It is no such thing"—he said he never told me—I was taken to the station—I had two of the oysters in my pocket, which had fallen out of the bag; I put them in when I was going into the yard, putting the ropes in—Bailey got on the van outside the Bricklayers' Arms—he was riding by the side of the prisoner, and heard all that took place—he told me to stop when the driver did not tell me—I do not know what is become of him—the prisoner some<lb></lb>times told me to stop, and sometimes Bailey did.</p>

               <p>there the next Monday—I gave my evidence twice before the Magistrate—I have had the evidence read over to me once or twice since—I will swear it has not been read twelve times—I have no paper in my pocket now on which evidence is written—I had no paper—I have not had the evidence in my own hands—I have had it read to me by Mr. Fisher—I believe he is a police officer at the Great Northern.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us again what happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was going along Cheapside, and the prisoner told me to untie his whip, and while doing so, he told me to take the bag from under his seat, and take the oysters out of three or four bags, and take the ropes out, and put the oysters in, and put the ropes on the top, and after I passed the Post-office, he told me I might begin, and after that he told me to stop once or twice whilst the <hi rend="italic">busses</hi> passed—when we got past the police station, he said, "That will do, put the ropes in, we are nearly there"—after we had unloaded, he told me to take the horses to give them some water, and one of the porters brought me back, and took me to where the prisoner was—I said I took the oysters by the prisoner's direction—he told me to take these oysters and put them in the bag, which hung under his seat—he saw me put the oysters in—I could not pull the ropes out, nor nothing, without his knowing it—it ad been a coal bag or a coke bag—some part of it was nailed to the seat, and part was tied—it was generally used to put ropes in, and brushes and chains—it was like a boot of a coach, there was a place you could put your hand in.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of Mr. Penleaze, who lives in the road going to Hackney; our house is the corner of a field leading up to Hackney, almost opposite the Nag's-head in the <placeName id="t17760911-23-crimeloc120">Hackney road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17760911-23-crimeloc120" type="placeName" value="Hackney road"></interp>

I examine every night that the doors and windows are fast before I go to bed; every window had its proper fastening, and all was secured that night: between two and three in the morning, I heard the door upon the left hand of mine, the first bed-chamber-door, open, and then shut again; I thought at hearing that door open, that the servant was come to fetch my son's shirt and stockings, which always lie there ready for him; I had hardly thought so, before I heard an attempt at the door where I lay: as I did not suppose any body belonging to me would attempt to open my door without speaking, I waked Mr. Penleaze, and said, For God's sake, for God's sake, here are rogues; Mr. Penleaze jumped up in his bed and asked fiercely, who is there? no answer was made; but before an answer could be made, the door, with a part of the wainscot, came down, and some men came in; four I saw very clear, for when I found they were rogues, I had no thoughts of losing my life, till they all came upon the bed and presented their pistols and cutlasses; I thought the first thing should be to take notice of their faces, and therefore I looked stedfastly at them all; two came upon the foot of the bed, one on Mr. Penleaze's side and one on mine; two pistols were presented at my head, and two at Mr. Penleaze's, by the people that came up the foot of the bed; a third man went up to Mr. Penleaze's head, and the other to the head on my side of the bed. We never lie with our curtains drawn, as Mr. Penleaze is asthmatical; I saw a very great light in the room, which I knew it was not possible for a dark lanthorn to give, for one of them had a dark lanthorn; the light<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110017"></xptr> seemed to me to come from the landing place at the door, from whence I judged somebody held a candle there to direct them into the room; the window shutters were shut, but there are large holes at the top of the middle window shutter, small holes at the others.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to have discerned the face of a man? - No; by the light of the window I could not have discerned them; the clock struck three presently after. The prisoner I really believe to be one, for I saw his face, he was at the head of the bed on Mr. Penleaze's side.</p>
               <p>Was there no crape or mask upon the prisoner? - Not upon him, I don't know that there was; I did not see any thing of that sort when I saw his face upon the bed, for I believe he was the man that put his hand over Mr. Penleaze's side and tucked the cloaths between Mr. Penleaze and me.</p>
               <p>You believe he is the man? - I have no doubt of it; I remembered his face when I saw him again, that he was endeavouring to help the others to cover us up in the bed.</p>
               <p>He had no disguise or mask upon his face? - I did not see any thing upon it, the look of his whole face I remember; now I see it at the bar again, it brings it fresh to my mind, I remember it perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner you saw in that particular situation? - I have no doubt of it, we were covered up not more than half a minute, before I put my hand and disengaged the cloaths from my face for a little air, and as I looked about with part of my face uncovered, I missed the man that stood at the head of the bed on Mr. Penleaze's side, and I saw but three in the room; I do suppose he went out as soon as we were covered, and with him took a tankard that was at the head of Mr. Penleaze's bed with balm tea; he emptied the balm tea into a wash-hands bason that stood next to that, for there we found the balm tea in the morning. They were each armed with a pistol , there were six pistols at a time on my bed, one in the hand of each man at the head of the bed, and two in the hands of the men that came upon the foot of the bed and lay upon us and helped to cover us down: before they began to cover us up, when they rushed into the room, they said, Your money, your money; when they came upon the bed they said, Tell us where your money is; we came for your money, we will not meddle with any thing else, tell us where your money is. I screamed very much, being terrified with the pistols and cutlasses which shone much; I kept up in the bed, begging for God's sake they would not hurt us, and they should have what money we had; they said, We will not hurt you, lie down in your bed: I lay down a little, I put the cloaths off me again, and begged for God's sake that they would hear what I was going to say; they asked what it was, I said, there was but little money in the house, Mr. Penleaze too said so, and begged they would use us well; they said they would, but as I did not lie down immediately, one of them struck at me with a cutlass, which missed my head and cut in at the head of the bed; I was frightened at the appearance of the cutlass; when I saw it come with great vehemence and a very loud voice, I said, I will lie down, I will lie down immediately, and drew the cloaths over my own head immediately.</p>
               <p>Was this blow from the person on your side the bed, or him on Mr. Penleaze's side? - I cannot be certain, it seemed to me to come from one of the men that came up at the foot of the bed when we were both covered up; they asked Mr. Penleaze again where the money was, and he directed them into the room where it lay, and the other things of value that we had in the house; I was astonished to hear Mr. Penleaze direct them to the room where almost every thing was kept that we had that was valuable; I immediately directed them to another room; I put the cloaths off my head that they might hear me speak the clearer, and that I might have a little breath. Mr. Penleaze said to them first, there is but a little money in the house indeed, a little silver you will find upon the marble slab in the next room; the plate and other things of value were in a closet in that same room; I said to Mr. Penleaze, there is a little more money in the house, there is some gold, I believe, if you will please to go into the next room, gentlemen, and open the drawers in the chest of drawers, and look about the middle drawer, perhaps you may find it there; this I did to gain time, for then the clock had struck three, for I was in hopes, it being cowslip time, that people going out early in the morning might see them, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110018"></xptr> they might be prevented from doing any kind of mischief; then two of them left the room, and there only remained one standing on my side at the head of the bed; they came back again, after looking in the drawers as I suppose, and said, There was no money there, and I did not give them an immediate answer, still hoping to gain a little time; they said, Whereabouts is the money? said I, Don't you find it there? they said No, there was none there; then said I, I really cannot tell you where it is; I really could not, for I did not know where Mr. Penleaze kept his money; they asked Mr. Penleaze, Where did you say the money lay? did not you say upon a little slab in the other room; what slab do you mean? said he, in the room upon the right hand, but my son lies up another pair of stairs, and he has the money he received yesterday, I have not accounted with him for it; they said, what room is he in? Mr. Penleaze said, in the room fronting the stairs, and he will give you the money. I was frightened for my son's life, though I seemed to have but little fear for my own; he is fond of shooting, he always lies with a couple of guns in his room; I begged of them for God's sake not to hurt my son; they said they would not.</p>
               <p>What did you lose? - [Repeats the things mentioned in the indictment.]</p>
               <p>What might be the amount of your loss? - I am no judge; Mr. Penleaze says, he thinks about 500 l.</p>
               <p>Did you lose all the things mentioned in the indictment? - Yes, and a great many other things that we have forgot.</p>
               <p>Now, are you certain as to the identity of the prisoner at the bar? - I have no doubt of it, but I have still some farther proof to give; another circumstance, which makes me think this is the man: when he was taken up, a coat was produced, which he had said was upon the back of one of the men in our house; I was at Mr. Wilmot's office when he was examined there, and this came out upon his examination; he was present and owned the coat to be his, he was ordered to put the coat on; he had given it to Bates's brother for Bates.</p>
               <p>Who is Bates, for whom the coat was? - One of the prisoners that was tried and convicted for this fact; when he was first taken, he was carried to Wilmot's office, the coat was then produced, and he put it on; he was ordered again upon the public examination day to put the coat on; he spoke very sharp and rude to the justice, and said, I shall not put it on, I have put it on once already, have I not? he spoke in such a tone of voice as when I heard, I said, that is the man that said in our chamber, D - n you, why don't you keep her covered? which he said just in the same manner.</p>
               <p>So that from the sound of the voice it confirmed you in your opinion that that person was at the head of the bed on Mr. Penleaze's side? - Yes; three had great coats on close like watchmen's coats; they were of a drab colour all of them; I never saw the prisoner's face, but at that one time when he was covering us up.</p>
               <p>Please, to describe how the house was broke open? - A pane of glass was broke in the back parlour window next the fields; the back steps which lead into the garden are high; the upper part of them are wide, and almost even with the back parlour window at which they entered; they broke a pane next the steps; then they turned the screw that fastens the window, then opened the window bar and split the wood in which the bar was fastened; the bar fell down with the wood with it, and then the window shutters opened.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that window was fastened over night? - I am sure; for I never go to bed without seeing it; I never trust to any body to fasten the windows, but I examine them myself.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was this that this burglary happened? - The Sunday morning between the hours of two and three.</p>
               <p>Between the Saturday and Sunday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of the person of the prisoners before this time? - No, not of any of them before that night.</p>
               <p>I apprehend when the four men first broke into your bed-room that you was very much terrified? - I was, but I had no fear of death; I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>But you was very much terrified? - I was terrified.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110019"></xptr>Very much? - Not so much as many people would have been; I did not think about death till the cutlass was struck at me.</p>
               <p>You said on a former occasion that you was very much terrified? - With the cutlass and pistol.</p>
               <p>Which had the dark lantern? - I saw a great light in the passage; I cannot say, I cannot tell who had the dark lantern in their hand.</p>
               <p>You know when a person holds a dark lantern in his hand, the light is projected from the person that has the lantern? - I saw the room very light, as light as if a candle had been in the passage.</p>
               <p>I make no doubt you saw a light which appeared a great light to you who were in bed, but the dark lantern being before the prisoners, and the other lights behind the prisoners, both of these lights darting their rays upon you, and from the persons of the men, it would be impossible for you to discern their persons? - What become of the dark lantern I cannot tell when they were upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Then there was no other light than what was in the passage; therefore it was impossible for you to see the faces of the persons? - It gave a strong light that I could discover their faces very clear, for their faces were even with mine, as near as my hand is to my face, for I believe the space of two minutes; I saw their faces clear, and a strong light came into the room; it is a small one; the door opens at the foot of the bed, at which they came in; there is a good light comes in through the holes of the window shutters, at that time at three o'clock, but not strong enough to see their persons; the landing place is at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>The light came in at the foot you say, could you distinguish a person on the right hand and the left by that? - Yes; very clear.</p>
               <p>COURT. At what period of time can you exactly say that you had an opportunity of looking at and observing the prisoner's face? - I do not suppose I had more than half a minute; it was only during the time of pushing the cloaths down and drawing them over us; it was such a countenance as I knew the moment I saw him, and the more I see him, the more clear I am that he is the person.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You never saw him before in your life? - No, but should know every face I saw in the room.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, when he was examined at justice Wilmot's office, he was directed to put a coat on? - He was.</p>
               <p>You took notice in your evidence that they had great coats on? - Three of them had, what they had under their great coats I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>This is a close-bodied coat; then why did you desire him to have a close-bodied coat put on? - Not for my satisfaction; that will come out by-and-by; that was for the justice's, satisfaction, for some other witness which will be enquired into by-and-by.</p>
               <p>You had no recollection of his voice at the first time? - No; there was too great a confusion; at first they all said, your money, your money: but that sharp rough manner of speaking immediately brought it to my mind, that is the same voice that said, D - n you, why don't you cover her up?</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was examined the first time at justice Wilmot's office, not with standing the coat was put upon him, I believe you did not swear to him at that time? - I could not swear to his coat.</p>
               <p>Nor to his face? - The answer I gave to Mr. Wilmot was, that I knew the man, but I would say nothing to him till next examination day; he was examined in the little room, but not in the public office; I think one cannot be too cautious when a life is in the case, and therefore I don't love to hurry.</p>
               <p>At that examination did not you make a declaration of this nature, that you believed he did not rob you, but you apprehended he knew who did? - If you had that information, you are very much misinformed.</p>
               <p>In some such words? - In no such words; for I really believe he did rob us.</p>
               <p>Did you ask any persons whether the prisoner was in that robbery or not? - When I first gave an account to Mr. Wilmot's men, and described their persons, they said, Grant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110020"></xptr> and such a one, and such a one were the four that were in the room: they endeavoured to take this Grant from the description I gave of him.</p>
               <p>Did not you express a doubt whether he was one of the persons? - I did not, because I was quite certain in myself, therefore I could have no doubt.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Penleaze: I lived with him at this time; three men came out of my mistress's room; I was on the stairs, about the middle of the stairs; the first man I saw had a candle in his hand, about half the length of a kitchen candle, without a candlestick; they came up stairs towards me; I went back to my own room, which was a pair of stairs higher, and shut the door, but did not fasten it; they came up to the top of the stairs; they did not stop; they turned about, and went down again.</p>
               <p>How many were there of them? - Two men came up stairs then.</p>
               <p>Did they not go into any of the rooms? - No; they went back into my mistress's room, and enquired of her where the money was; I came down upon the stairs again, and heard them say, It was money they wanted, and money they must have: the same two persons came up stairs after that, and went into the young gentleman's room.</p>
               <p>Was your young master's room the next room to the stair-case? - No; fronting the stairs.</p>
               <p>Where was your room? - The first door on the stairs, just at the edge on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Did you go back again into your room? - Yes; and shut my door too, but not fastened; one held the candle, while the other picked the young gentleman's pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you see this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see out of your room into his? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your young master awake at this time? - They had taken the young gentleman into my mistress's room.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I did not see him; he was not in his bed or his room; they searched his pockets that lay upon his bed; he was out of his own room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. PENLEAZE. My son slept very sound; there was a good deal of searching from room to room passed before he heard any noise; he first heard me beg of them not to hurt us; he heard my voice; and between sleeping and waking, thought I was in fits, and that they had sent for a surgeon and apothecary to me; he came down stairs to see what was the matter with me; two men met him on the stairs; one clapped his hands upon his eyes, the other led him into my room; as soon as I saw them seize my son on the stairs, I screamed out to a violent degree; I thought they were going to hurt him, but they did not; they only led him into my room.</p>

            . What did they do in his room? - Opened a little cabinet and a chest; they went out of the room into a room adjoining mine; I did not see them open the chest; but they did, by the noise I heard; they came out of that room to a chest facing my door; which they opened; one said to the other, Come along, there is nothing there; they went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you escape? - Yes; I was in my own room, the door of which was upon a-jar.</p>
               <p>Was you able, in the situation you was in, to know these two men that came up stairs? - Yes, I think I was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those two? - I cannot take upon me to say that; it was much such a sized man I saw in the house; a person like the prisoner, who had a dark blue coat on.</p>
               <p>Had he a great coat on? - No; one at the study door had a great coat on; neither of the men that came up stairs had great coats on; but one that stood at the study door after that had.</p>
               <p>What sort of a great coat was it, a drab colour? - Yes; there was one with a very gruff voice, that stood at the bottom of the stairs, called out Jem, Jem, Jem.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long were those men in the house? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You saw them come out of your mistress's room, and I think you said you stood with the door a-jar about twenty minutes on the stairs? - No, they went up stairs; they came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110021"></xptr> by my room door four times before they went away; when they came up stairs, I went into my own room, and let them pass by my door.</p>
               <p>But you saw them come up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw but three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you saw them all come out of your mistress's room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of those three that came out of your mistress's room, two had no great coats on? - One had, the other two had not.</p>
               <p>You had a full view of them for a long time by means of this candle? - I had, at different times.</p>
               <p>But with all this view you cannot be certain to the person of the prisoner? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Upon a former occasion you mentioned the space of twenty minutes? - Undoubtedly I might formerly, but it was not mentioned now.</p>
               <p>I believe you said so before? - Yes; but it was not mentioned now.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. How long had you an opportunity of making these observations? - For twenty minutes.</p>

            , who is under sentence of death, is my brother-in-law: I met the prisoner on the 29th of June in Red Lion Square; I should have seen him if he had not called; he found that, and turned round; the first word he said, was, how does the prisoner Bates do? I told him he was had enough; he said it was a sad thing, he was sorry for them, for he knew them both to be innocent men; he meant Green as well as Bates, they were both cast at the same time: I told him I thought he was one of them; he said, He was not, but he knew them that were; I asked him the men's names; he told me the names of four of them; I had got a petition in my hand; I was going to the Recorder's house; I was within 150 yards of the Recorder's house; the petition was in the behalf of Bates, signed by the overseers and churchwardens, and a vast number of the principal in habitants of St. Leonard, Shoreditch: I told him, not being used to such things as that, I was rather ashamed, and asked him to carry the petition for me; he said he would with all his heart; he gave me his bundle, and went with the petition; he had given me half a crown just before to give to Bates: while he was gone with the petition, we consulted whether we should take him or not; there were two of Bates's own brothers with me; we agreed not to take him then, but to get great with him, to try if we could learn any thing of the other men that he had mentioned: when he came back, I asked him if he would take us to any alehouse and give us something to drink; he said he would: he took us to the Black Lion going into Red Lion Square; we staid there near an hour; all the while I was there, I was continually talking about Mr. Penleaze's robbery; I told him Mrs. Penleaze said she saw four in the room; he said, Did she say she saw four? I said, yes; he said, I know she saw but three in her room: I told him there must be more than three; that there must be somebody about the house to keep sentry; for I told him I had heard his brother say that there were seven of them, and that they shared thirty-eight guineas a man; but I thought there must be more than that number; he said, No, there was not; I asked him what sort of men those four men were: after he had mentioned their names, he said, O they have been taken up, but were acquitted; that one of them was very much of a gentleman, and a man of worth, that had three or four hundred pounds worth of plate in his house: I asked him about the others; he said, one was a tall raw-boned powerful man, and he used to be out at times in Grub-street; he said, that tall powerful man rescued him away from one Mr. Church, where Grant used to live; for he was taken three months ago for this, and this man rescued him. It came up in discourse, that the prisoner Bates was almost naked; he said, if this coat I have upon my back will be of any service to him, I will give it him; I thanked him: he said, if I would go a little farther with him to another house, he would give it me; he paid the reckoning, and we came away; then he took us into Spread-eagle Court, Gray's Inn Lane, to the King's Road.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110022"></xptr>Who was that house kept by? - One Mr. Wood *; when we came there, he wanted to treat us again; I told him we had had sufficient; he did not seem very willing to pull off the coat just then; I told him if it suited him, we would call again for it; which he assented to, and we came away: we went again to Wood's house on Sunday the 7th of July,

             went with me; we sat there a little while, and then he came out of a back room in Mr. Wood's house; he asked us to go into the back room: I talked about the robbery of Mr. Penleaze's, and the large quantity of plate Mr. Penleaze had lost; he said, what did it signify? they shared thirty-eight guineas a man; he did not say we but they shared; I said the last time I saw you, you promised to give Bates a coat; he said, yes, I did, there it is across the back of a chair; he took it off the back of the chair, and gave it the other man, and said, That coat was in Justice Penleaze's house at the time of the robbery; I will not be sure whether he did not say it was upon the back of one of the men; I looked at him very hard when he said those words, and said, why sure? he said, By G - d it is true, but there he was not; he said over and over that he himself was not there; I persuaded the man he gave the coat to, to put it on under his great coat; there was a Jew there that I supposed by the description to be one of them; I said, it is very odd, I am going to carry this coat which you say was on a man's back that committed the robbery, to a man that is innocent of the robbery, though he is convicted for it; he said, Yes, it was given to me, and I give it away again.</p>
               <p>* See the Trial of Wood, Number 616, p. 351.</p>
               <p>HAWKINS. I saw a coat a good deal like that in the house, upon the back of one of those that came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Is that a dark blue? - Yes, or something a good deal like this colour.</p>
               <p>BATTEAUX. This is the coat the prisoner had on when we met him in Red Lion Square.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Why did you not take me up sooner? - It was about three weeks after I had the coat before he was apprehended; the reason was we went three or four times after him, but we knew we dare not touch him in Wood's house; we wanted to get him out of the house, at last we caught him at the end of the alley: Mr. Wilmot's men had been three times after him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was you intimately acquainted with the prisoner? - I saw him before I met him in Red Lion Square, at the time of the hard frost; I knew him very well some time ago, when he used to follow his business.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Why he did not take me in Holborn when he met me there with his brothers in company with him, the last execution day but one? - There were three of them together; we were afraid to attack them, the Jew was with him: Mr. Sherwood's men were after him.</p>
               <p>Did you give information to them that you had seen him that day? - I told Mrs. Penleaze we had seen him; she said she wanted him taken; we were no thief catchers; I was somewhat afraid.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>If you had chose to have taken him on an execution day, there was plenty of assistance at hand? - It was almost night; it was about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>If this man should be convicted, whether you don't think that your brother will receive a pardon? - I could not conceive that; but if this man had turned evidence it might, for this man could have told the men that did commit the burglary.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether he did not say to me in Red Lion Square, that he was glad I was not taken at first, for Mrs. Penleaze would have sworn to me on account of my black hair? - I told him very possibly she might have sworn to him if he had been taken, on account of his hair.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether he did not swear at Justice Wilmot's that I used to wear my hair down to my nose almost, which I never did? - I said his hair was in quite a different form; that he used to wear it hung over his forehead; but when I met him in Red Lion Square, his hair was almost cropt, he looked like quite another man.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Should you ever have thought of making any complaint against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110023"></xptr> the Prisoner if he had not declared in the conversation to you that your brother was innocent? - I had a notion at first that this man was concerned in it, for I know he had not followed his employment.</p>
               <p>Was it not for the sake of your brother that you concerned yourself in it? - I had a notion at first that he was one; but when he spoke about the coat, what I mentioned then, I thought he was one of them.</p>
               <p>You had a consultation among yourselves in behalf of your brother? - We wanted to find out the man who did commit the robbery; for I believe it will be found that my brother is innocent.</p>

He gave us half a crown for my brother, afterwards he said he would give my brother the coat he had on, if we would go a little way with him; he took us to a house and gave us a dram a-piece, and took no notice about the coat. Batteaux said, it does not signify pulling it off now, we will come another time; he said, we should have it come when we would: we came there eight days after, he came in out of a side room to us, he asked us how we did, and drank with us, out of the pint of beer we had called for; he took us to the side room, my brother-in-law and I went into the private room, we sat there an hour or more; Batteaux asked him there about the names he had mentioned, he mentioned the four names over and over: Batteaux mentioned what was taken away, he said, what is it? they shared but 38 guineas a man; they, he did not say we, he always said that he was not in it. After that Batteaux asked him for the coat, he said, there it is; it hung across a chair back by me; I was going to tie it up, a Jew that was with him said, put it on, it will sit you; they perswaded me, and I put it on under this great coat, I had only a waistcoat on then. As we were coming home he said,</p>
               <p>'Now, that coat</p>
               <p>'was in Mr. Penleaze's house; one of the men</p>
               <p>'that did the robbery, had that coat upon his</p>
               <p>'back that night:' Batteaux looked at him then very hard and said, Sure, what an odd thing this is? now you say this coat was on the man's back that committed the robbery; now we are going to give it to a poor fellow that is cast, though he is innocent; he said,</p>
               <p>'it is odd, but by G - d it is true;' after that he said,</p>
               <p>'it was given to him, and now</p>
               <p>'he gave it away again.'</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>At this time you was going to the Recorder, with your brother Bates and Batteaux, in order to obtain mercy for your brother if you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you thought yourself much obliged to the prisoner for expressing kindness towards your brother? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He gave a half crown for him and promised the coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And told you the names of all the people he had heard were concerned in this robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Declaring at the same time that he himself was perfectly innocent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you had no reason to apprehend that he had been guilty of any offence at Mr. Penleaze's but this conversation? - That was all.</p>
               <p>As he told you he was innocent, and mentioned to you the names of four men which he apprehended had been guilty of this robbery, why were they not taken up? - We gave information of them all to Mr. Wilmot's runners, but they were not taken up.</p>
               <p>Do not you apprehend if the prisoner should be convicted, it will be of use to your brother? - I don't know that it will, and I will not say any thing he did not say to me.</p>
               <p>Did not you think, after you had had a consultation about this business, that going to Justice Wilmot's office would be of use to your brother? - I thought, if we took one of the right people up, we might get an evidence, and the truth might come out.</p>
               <p>And that would be an advantage to your brother? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I keep a public house, the sign of the Boot in Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the prisoner lying at your house any time? - Yes; upon the Saturday night the prisoner and two or three more young men were drinking at my house; when the time came that we should go to bed, the prisoner asked me if I could let him sleep there that night, I told him I did not know as my husband was a-bed: a gentlewoman that lodged at my house at that time said, she had some knowledge of him, and I had no occasion to be afraid of letting him sleep there, for he used her house when she kept a public house herself: this person saying that she knew him, I let him sleep there that night,; about three days after, I believe it was on the Wednesday following, the prisoner came to my house again, and asked me,</p>
               <p>'if I did not recollect his lying</p>
               <p>'there on the Saturday night?' I told him I did; I asked him why he asked me that? he said,</p>
               <p>'the reason was known to himself,' he then said,</p>
               <p>'the reason he had for asking me</p>
               <p>'was, that he would be glad if I would let</p>
               <p>'him make a memorandum of the day of the</p>
               <p>'month he slept at my house;' I told him he might, but I wanted to know why he did it; he said,</p>
               <p>'an affair had happened that he did</p>
               <p>'expect to be brought into trouble for, and</p>
               <p>'if he was, that he should subpoena me to</p>
               <p>'come and speak the truth;' I had a subpoena, and that is the reason I came here; I saw him make the memorandum upon the wainscot in my kitchen in chalk, I stood by while it was done; the memorandum was nothing, but</p>
               <p>'the 20th of April.'</p>
               <p>Was this memorandum put in such a place as it was not likely to be rubbed out? - It was put very high, where it was not likely to be rubbed out.</p>
               <p>JURY. Who wrote that memorandum, the prisoner? - No; a young man that was with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Though the memorandum you say is</p>
               <p>'the 20th of April,' will you swear that he lay in your house upon Saturday the 20th of April? - Yes; he really lay in my house that night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you see him go to bed? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see him get up? - He could not get up without my knowing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What hour did he go to bed? - As near as I can recollect about twelve; he lay at the very top of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you put him to bed? - No, I saw him go up stairs; I was the next person that went up stairs and a gentlewoman that lodged in my house: I fastened the street door and went up directly after; we fasten the street door and take the key up to bed with us every night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could he have got out of this house at any other place but the door? - No; we have another pair of stairs that come down by my room door where I sleep, and at the bottom of that stairs we have another door that we always bolt of a night, the last thing we do; it would be impossible for any body to come down stairs when the door was bolted of my side; nobody can come down stairs till we are up in the morning. My husband generally rises at five or six, and he generally unbolts the door before he goes out; I bolted the door that night after the prisoner went up stairs, because my husband was a-bed before me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who opened the street door in the morning? - My husband.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the prisoner the next morning? - He went out before I was up; I never get up myself till eight o'clock or half after; my husband did not know of his sleeping there.</p>
               <p>JURY. At what time are the stair foot and street doors opened? - Never before five or six o'clock at the outside.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is your husband here? - No; he did not see the man go to bed and knows nothing of it, but what I told him myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. He did not let him out in the morning? - No, he did not see him go out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110026"></xptr>JURY. Did any body else see him go to bed? - He goes through the room where this gentlewoman lives to go up stairs; I don't know whether she is here.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many stories does your house consist of? - Four stories.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he pay you for his lodging? - He paid me six-pence before he went to bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Your husband must know of his going out? - We have two men and their wives that lodge in the house at this time, when the door is open they can go in and out; if he had known any thing of it he would have come.</p>


               <p>JURY. Could the prisoner come down stairs without going through this woman's room that you speak of? - There was a bed room next to that where she slept of a night, she went to bed in another room; she has two rooms; he must go through the room she lived in in the day time; she had another room she slept in; every body must go through that room that goes up or down, either night or day.</p>
               <p>JURY. Is there not a possibility of his getting out at the windows? - It is four stories high, I don't know how.</p>
               <p>Is it usual for you to let strangers have free access and passage into your house that you have so little acquaintance with? - We very seldom have any strangers lie in our house, but it happened to be so that night from the recommendation of the gentlewoman that lodged in my house.</p>
               <p>Had she been in company with him that evening? - She saw him in the house.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. If that woman had not known him, you would not have suffered him to lie at your house? - No.</p>
               <p>And you are sure that the stair-foot door was not open till five? - Not before, probably not till six.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Your husband keeps this public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you many lodgers? - Two men and their wives at the present time.</p>
               <p>And this man you know nothing of, only by the recommendation of this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is your custom to lock up this stair-case of a night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So if any of your lodgers want to go down they cannot? - They never trouble me, they must knock at my door.</p>
               <p>You have never been disturbed? - I have now and then, to let the women go down to their husbands to let them in.</p>
               <p>Had you any servant? - Yes, two; but they don't live with me now.</p>
               <p>And they are locked in too? - Yes?</p>
               <p>Every body was locked up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let them have ever so great an occasion to go down they cannot get out? - No.</p>
               <p>Was either of your servants present when this 20th of April was wrote down? - No, only the young man.</p>
               <p>Y ou keep a very regular family? - We are always a-bed by eleven o'clock or so.</p>
               <p>You don't sweep and clean the tap room? - The servants do.</p>
               <p>And they never rubbed off this chalk? - It was set up high in the kitchen, they could not reach it.</p>
               <p>They might touch it with a broom? - No, they never did.</p>
               <p>What did this man stand upon to write this? - Upon a chair.</p>
               <p>And it was wrote the 20th? - The 20th of April.</p>
               <p>Did it not surprize you, that this man should come and desire you to take notice of this 20th of April? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were the words he made use of? - He said,</p>
               <p>'There was an affair had happened,</p>
               <p>'that he did expect he likely might be troubled</p>
               <p>'for.'</p>
               <p>What did you understand by that? - I did not know, nor did he inform me.</p>
               <p>You did not understand what the little affair might be, nor what being in trouble might be? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he lay alone that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Upon my oath he did.</p>
               <p>There was nobody else in the room? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never say somebody did lie with him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him say that before the justice? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not you examined before the justice? - Never.</p>
               <p>What did you never give this account before a magistrate? - No, I never was sent for;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110027"></xptr> I never was before the justice about it; I heard of it since he has been in trouble; but within this two or three days I had this subpoena.</p>
               <p>Where do you lie in this house? - In the first floor.</p>
               <p>Does any other person lie in the first floor? - Only myself and my sister; my servants lie up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Where was the key of the door that night? - In my room, which it always is of a night.</p>
               <p>And you always lock all your lodgers up? - Yes, when we go to bed we always do; they come up one pair of stairs, and go through a room on the other side; that stair foot door as we call it, comes down close to my room door; the door is upon the first floor, that is bolted.</p>
               <p>He could come down to that door? - Yes, but could come no farther.</p>
               <p>He might then open the dining room window? - No, he could not; when we go up one pair of stairs, there is a door opens, behind that door, as close as possible to the stair-foot door that goes up to the rest of the rooms; when that door is bolted, they cannot get down to the dining room landing place.</p>
               <p>If they have any extraordinary occasion to come down after this door is shut, they must apply to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the woman that desired you to let this man lie there that night? - Mrs. Norton.</p>
               <p>Mrs. PENLEAZE. The prisoner said before the justice, that he lay at this house, the Boot in Grub-street, on the 20th of April with

               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I saw him at the Boot in Grub-street on the 20th of last April; he was going up to bed; I knew the prisoner before by his coming to my house for a pint of beer; he bid me good night, that was all that passed; he called me mother Norton, I said, Jem, how do you do? and so we parted; I took Mrs. Rosaman's club room and bed chamber, while a house was preparing for me in Golden-lane; I keep a cloaths shop there.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular acquaintance with him? - No; Mrs. Rosaman asked me if I knew him? I said I did, and I thought she might let him lie there for his honesty.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the morning? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What was it o'clock when he went to bed at night? - It had struck twelve, I believe.</p>

               <p>Did he sleep alone that night? - I did not go up to see his bed.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether all the beds were full or not? - I did not go to see.</p>
               <p>Who went to bed first, you or Mrs. Rosaman? - She went to bed before me; I saw her fasten the door.</p>
               <p>Which do you mean, the street door? - All the doors were fastened; there is a staircase door that fastens; there is only a space between where the club pot is put, and if Mr. Rosaman has any occasion to let his lodgers out, he puts his hand out of his own door, and lets them out; my husband has laid out several times, because I could not let him in, and did not care to disturb Mr. Rosaman.</p>
               <p>So you have more tenderness for Mr. Rosaman than your husband? - I did not care to disturb him as I was a lodger.</p>

               <p>COURT. You say Mrs. Rosaman went to bed first? - She did; I finished a cap I had in the club room, which is the room the lodgers go through to go to bed; the bed-chamber is even with this club room.</p>
               <p>That club room is beyond the staircase door? - They both come into the club room.</p>
               <p>You could not go down without applying to Mr. Rosaman? - I could go down into the kitchen, but I could not get out; they who lodged above me could not come down.</p>
               <p>You could get down out of your apartment into the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why could not the prisoner do the same? - There is another staircase goes into the garret, and there is a staircase door to that; that is the door that is fastened.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say you understand figures; did the figures that you speak of in this chalk, that you did understand, stand before the words, or were the words before the figures? - I cannot tell; I think the figures were before the words, but I cannot remember.</p>

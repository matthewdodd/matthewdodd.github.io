                  </hi>. On the 4th of November I was coming from the corn market—on arriving at London-bridge I saw a cart with two seeks filled with something—I knew I had given no orders for any thing to go out in it—it was the prisoner's cart—I employ him occasionally to do cartage—I suspected something wrong, and went down the steps, intending to go into my warehouse, but when I got there the cart had drawn away—I went in, and looked into my book, where every thing ought to be set down, and saw there was nothing down—I called Smart, to know if I had been wanted while I had been away—about five hours afterwards I made inquiry of my clerk about the cart—I saw the prisoner in the evening, and gave him in charge for stealing two sacks of oats—here is a sample the policeman gave me—I had not authorized the prisoner to take any oats for me that day, or authorized any body to send any out—Mr. Green, my clerk, had authority to do so—he is not here—he was at the Mansion House, but was not examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the prosecutor's employ—the prisoner was occasionally employed to cart goods—he came on Friday, the 4th of No<lb></lb>vember, for a quarter of oats, which he wanted me to let him have at a very low price—I told him I could not to do it then, and he went away—that</p>

To go to his room, he had to pass through another. The drawers, in which the things mentioned in the indictment were, stood on the left-hand side, within the door. The prisoner was taken on the 22d of July, and I found my hat upon him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came in about ten o'clock at night, on the 21st of July. He had the key of the outer door; for we kept the room he went through locked always. I thought he was going to bed; but he came down again in about ten minutes, gave me the key, and said he was going out again. He did not return<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120048"></xptr> again. I went up between eleven and twelve o'clock, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of my drawers. I had seen every thing in the drawers, in the afternoon, between four and five o'clock. I locked the room-door then, and kept the key. The next morning, my husband had intelligence where the prisoner was. He got a constable, and took him. I went to him: he said, he was very sorry for what he had done, and hoped I would excuse him. I asked him where my aprons and handkerchiefs were. He said, he could not tell me where they were; they might be shook out of the bundle, for what he knew: he did not know what he took. There are two aprons and two handkerchiefs missed, that are not found.</p>

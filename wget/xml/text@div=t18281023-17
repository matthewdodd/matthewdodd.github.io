On the 10th of October I missed eighteen calf-skins and 4 horse-hides, from my passage, which leads to my shop; I have seen the prisoner once or twice at my shop within the last six weeks - he came to buy some leather; I supposed he was a shoemaker. Mr. Hall, a currier, sent for me on the 14th, and produced part of a skin which I considered to be mine - it was the butt-end of a calf-skin, the head and the King's stamp was taken off; it was not in a fit state for a shoemaker, it would be quite useless to him, as it was not finished - I found part of a skin corresponding in quality and colour with it, on my premises, but not to match it in the cut, as I had sold part of it - this was cut in the way I cut mine; I have not any part which tallies with the cut, but it tallies in quality - while I was talking to Hall, the prisoner came and asked him about the leather; I asked how he got that piece of leather, he said he bought it in Strutton-ground for 9d. - that he should know the man if he saw him again, but could not tell his name; I then went to Queen-square, met an officer, and told him - he had said he lodged in Strutton-ground; I went there and found it was false - I found him in the street afterwards, and gave him in charge; he took us to his lodgings in Old Pye-street - he said they were his lodgings, and there I found these pieces of leather; they are pieces of horse-skins - there was no mark on them, but they corresponded with others which I have in my possession; they are fit for a shoemaker to use for stiffeners - I believe them to be part of this hide; it tallies exactly with a piece which is on my premises - it dovetails on both sides; I am perfectly satisfied that they are part of the same in quality, and they tally in the cut; the prisoner said he had bought this piece at 1s. a pound, at Mr. Pounds, of Wardour-street, Soho - I know he is a currier; this piece must have been taken within nine days - no one skin is worth 5l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you could not swear to it? A. I could not swear to satisfy any one but myself till I found this piece, which matches - there were some pieces which were not mine.</p>

            . I am a currier and leather-seller, and live in Broadway, Westminster. I have known the prisoner six or seven years as a shoemaker; on the 14th of October he brought this piece of calf-skin, and asked me to curry it for a pair of shoes for himself - I asked where he got it; he said he had bought it for 9d.; I asked where - he said in the street; I said I suspected it was stolen, and should neither curry it, nor give it him back till I had sent for Foulkes, who I heard had lost some - I asked his address - he said No. 15, Strutton-ground; it is worth 2s. 6d. or 3s. - curriers can speak very well to the quality of skins; here are two pieces of horse-skin, which tally - I believe them to be part of the same hide, and am satisfied of it; I have been in the trade all my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at the office that you doubted whether they corresponded? A. I did on the first appearance, but after minutely examining the other side I was as well satisfied as if I cut it myself.</p>

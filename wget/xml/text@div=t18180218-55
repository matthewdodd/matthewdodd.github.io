               <p>WILLIAM WHALEY. I generally live in Ireland. On the 10th of January I lived at Mrs. Eulielia O'Hara's house - She is a widow; the house is in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. I took the prisoner into my service out of compassion, and employed him to brush my clothes; when I go bed I always empty my pockets, and leave my clothes for my servant to brush in the morning, the prisoner had access to my room in the morning. I missed four 10l. Irish bank notes, with my name, "

            , Prince of Wales Hotel, Sackville-street;" on them. I also missed a 1l. Bank of England note. In consequence of suspicion that fell on the prisoner, I got a search-warrant, and Stone went with me to execute it at the prisoner's lodgings: we found him there in bed, apparently asleep, about eight o'clock in the morning. Stone locked the door and told the prisoner what we came for - He found an antique ring, which I had worn for thirty years, in a box near his bed. He took up a coat which the prisoner said was his, after examining it, he expressed his surprise at not finding a pocket in it, and threw it on the bed; I asked the prisoner if there was no pocket in it, he said there was not; on lifting it up I found a small side-pocket-Stone took it and found a brooch which belonged to me. He then examined the room, and took down two very large chests and a trunk, which stood before the fire-place. He searched the grate, which was full of old hats and shoes, under them he found three of my Irish notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not missed the ring or the brooch, they were taken from my shaving-case - I had not seen them for a month before. The prisoner and I never had any dispute.</p>
               <p>JAMES STONE. I am a constable of St. Ann's, Westminster. On the 17th of January I went with Mr. Whaley to execute the warrant; on going into the prisoner's lodgings we found him in bed, I told him what I came for, and searched a box by his bed-side - He said the things in it were his, but the box was not. I found the ring and a pocket-handkerchief, at the bottom of it. I then asked him whose coat that was that laid on the chair, he said it was his; I examined it but could find no pocket in it - He said there was none; Mr. Whaley took it up, found a small pocket at the side, I took it, and found a brooch at the bottom of it. There were two chests and a trunk on the top of them, which stood before the fire-place, and hid it; I moved them, and got to the fire-place, which was full of old hats and shoes; I pulled them out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180024"></xptr>and nearly at the bottom I found three 10l. Irish bank notes, rolled together. I produce them.</p>
               <p>MR. WHALEY. They are my notes. I lost the brooch, ring, and handkerchief all out of my shaving-case. The ring is worth thirty guineas; they are mine.</p>

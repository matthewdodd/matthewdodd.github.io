                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe manufacturer, at Elephant-buildings, Newington-butts—on Saturday evening, 28th June, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop and asked me to change a cheque for five guineas, as he was purchasing a pair of boots in the other shop, that he wanted change, and they refused to give it him, and would I do it—I have two or three shops together there—he said, "You know me"—I said, "Not that I am aware of"—he then said, "My name is Horrooks; don't you remember I used to live opposite your other house in the Wal<lb></lb>worth-road?"—I said, "Yes"—I did remember him, although he was only a lad when I had seen him before—he said, "This is a cheque I have taken to-day; the bank is shut up, and it will greatly oblige me if you will change it for me"—I said if it would oblige him, I would do it—he said, "You had batter take the 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for the boots out of it"—I said that would only confuse the accounts, I would give him the full change, and perhaps he would just step into the other shop and pay for the boots—I first got him to put his name and address on the back of the cheque—this is it—on the fol<lb></lb>lowing Monday I took the cheque to the bank.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Union Bank, Temple-bar Branch—this cheque was presented to me—it is one of our forms—the filling up is a forgery—we never had a customer of the name of Withers; it is entirely a fictitious cheque—the blank form was issued with 100 cheques in February, 1858, to Mr. G. S. Kemmis, who had an account at our bank—he has been dead two years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, at 24, Brunswick-street, St. John-street-road—two or three months ago the prisoner called on me with a young gentleman—he asked me to go and take a drop of something to drink with him—I did so—after we had had the drink, he asked me if I knew where he could get a lodging, saying that he had got a fortnight's holiday—I said I knew a public-house where I always took a friend of mine from the country, very comfortable people, Mrs. Moore's—he said, "Oh, I know Mrs. Moore very well"—he went there and ran up a score of about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in my name—he said he would get some money on the Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, and come round and pay me in the evening, if I would let him have anything he wanted—I agreed, and paid his bill, but he did not come for a fortnight afterwards—he then came with a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and wanted me to give him the difference out of it—I said I had not money enough to do so—we went to Mr. Wright's, a publican, but he would not change it—we then went to Mr. Langridge's, where he bought a waistcoat, changed the cheque, and paid me my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

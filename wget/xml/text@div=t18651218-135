                  </hi>. I am a clergyman, and incumbent of the parish church, Leytonstone—on the evening of the 3d December I went to the vestry there—I missed a clock, which I had seen safe on the previous Sunday evening—it was the property of the churchwardens, Thomas Fowell Buxton and others—the vestry is part of the church—I ascertained that at the west window of the church the glass was broken, one of the stanchions moved, and a space left large enough for any person to come in—there were footmarks about the ground—I examined the vestry door, which leads into the church; they had got in that way—this is the clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—two tassels were taken from the reading-desk, and two mats from the vestry—on the previous Sunday I had seen the tassels in their proper place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were those things removed altogether from the church? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the tassels and mat were left at Mr. McGill's door on the Thursday evening afterwards—the vestry door opens into the church-yard and into the church, too, and there is another door from the vestry to the church, that was left open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Dicker and Scarlet, of 20, Hereford-street, Commercial-road, pawnbroker—on Tuesday morning, 5th December, about half-past 9, the prisoners came in—Hearne was car<lb></lb>rying this clock—he said it was his, and he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—they were both together—I asked him how he got it—he said he won it at a raffle—I asked him where—he said, "In Anthony-street"—I rather think the other prisoner mentioned the name of the public-house—I said, "Where are the keys?"—he said he did not know it wanted any—I then left them in the shop with the foreman, and went round to Anthony-street to make inquiries—on coming back I met a constable, brought him to the shop, and gave the prisoners into custody.</p>

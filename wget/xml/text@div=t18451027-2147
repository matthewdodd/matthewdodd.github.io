                  </hi>. I am incumbent of the parish of Mortlake—the prisoner was in my service as cook for a year. On the 25th of Sept., in consequence of what I heard, I went to the house of Thomas Neale, a labourer, living near me—I found a box in the possession of Mrs. Neale—I directed her not to part with it—on the 1st of Oct., I went again, took possession of the box, and took it down with me to Brighton—my family had gone down to Brighton on Thursday the 20th of Aug.—the prisoner went the day before, Wednesday, the 19th—when I got down to Brighton, I went to the Lord Nelson public house, kept by Mr. Cotterell—I found the prisoner staying there—I pro<lb></lb>duced the box to her—it was precisely in the same state as when I took it from Neale's—I told her I was exceedingly sorry to suspect that she should take any of our articles, but as I did suspect her, I desired her to open that box before I paid her her wages, which were due to her—she protested that the box contained nothing whatever of mine, only articles belonging to herself, preparatory to her own house-keeping—I said, "Never mind, I must see the inside of the box, because it was taken to Mrs. Neale's under certain very suspicious circumstances"—the box was sewed up in a bag and sacking, and also corded quite securely—I gave her my pen-knife and told her to uncut the sacking and open it—she again protested that it contained nothing of ours—she took the cover off, and I saw it was my own box, a square packing-case, about a foot or fifteen inches square, without a wooden lid to it—I said, "That is my box"—she said, "The box is yours"—this now produced is the box and bag and the articles in it—the first articles found, which were at the top, were some pieces of sheeting which had been cut up, and which I claim—this is part of the sheet which has been cut—here is the remains of a mark—the lower mark, R., is very distinct indeed—the up<lb></lb>per mark is not so distinct—it has evidently been erased—I believe this upper mark has been F. C. R. or F. S. R.—I will not be quite certain which—if it was F. C. R. it belonged to my father, whose property I am now in possession of—the R. is most distinctly mine, and I recognised it immediately—here is ano<lb></lb>ther part of the same sheet with no mark on it—this is another part of the same sheet hemmed in one part and cut in another—this other is part of. the same sheet, cut up and hemmed, and this other is part of the same—it is a sheet cut up—the next articles found some towels—here is one marked F. R. 12, very distinctly—she said she bought the towels and the sheeting at Shoreditch, and she could bring her mother to prove it—there were two or three other towels, one of which Mrs. Reeves recognised, but I did not put them into the indictment, because</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270167"></xptr>
               <p>the mark had been cut out—here are some old table-napkins which Mrs. Reeves can identify better than I can, but from their general appearance I should say they were mine—here is my mark, F. J. H. R.—it is an old napkin, burnt and in holes—here is a table-cloth, a common one certainly, probably a nursery table-cloth—it is marked F. J. H. R. indistinctly, but still sufficient for me to speak to—this is a good table-cloth, a superior one—I cannot trace the mark in this, but I can swear to it—she took it hastily out of the box and said, "That if yours, but how it came there I don't know"—these silk socks are mine—there is no mark, but I can swear to them from having worn them frequently—they are the same kind I wear of an evening—she acknowledged they were mine, but said she thought perhaps they might have been put into the box by mistake for her own—here are some pieces of carpeting, the remains of the drawing-room carpet which had been fitted to another room—I can swear to them from the pattern—they were kept in a room up stairs with other things—I immediately gave the prisoner into custody, and told her "I shall now proceed to exa-mine the other box which you left with the other servants' boxes in the store-room, of which you took the key"—she had put a box in the store-room at East Sheen, as my house was occupied by another gentleman—I then went to East Sheen and found the other box—it was locked—there was no key in it—I put a cord round it to prevent its being opened, and took it down to Brighton, locked as it was—it was opened before the po<lb></lb>lice at Brighton, and in the prisoner's presence—she was at first asked for the key—she said she had not got the key, but she had lent it to a sister of Mrs. Reeves, at Brighton—we then had the box broken open—no application was made to Mrs. Reeves's sister for the key—she was at Brighton, but not staying at our house—it was done all in a moment, just before we went in before the Justice—I did not find the key afterwards—on the box being broken open these two books of mine, and some other articles, which are not in the indictment, were found—I mention that to show these were not the only things stolen from me, and to show that I am not prosecuting a person for nothing—I have lost a number of things which I could certainly claim, but I wish to make the indictment as small as I can—I can swear to this book—my name is in it from my own plate, and this other I can swear to from having been in my family—I believe the articles are valued at the lowest minimum of value I could possibly put in the indictment.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand that this pro<lb></lb>secution gives you great pain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It does so; I prosecute very unwil<lb></lb>lingly indeed—I have none of the things here which are not included in the indictment—I do not know that the prisoner is a superior person for her station—she was a clever woman, and a very good servant for some time—she was engaged as cook, not as cook and housekeeper—the house-linen is in charge of the housemaid—Mrs. Reeves takes a proper part in the domestic concerns—the house-linen was in the prisoner's charge for a short time, a month or six weeks, in the interval of one servant leaving and another coming—our stock of house-linen was not more than necessary for the use of a large family, and of a quality fit for a person of my station—I should say this sheet was of as much value as any good sheet—I do not know that Mrs. Reeves quarrelled with the prisoner at all, except that Mrs. Reeves had heard, and so had I, from the other servants, of her habits of drunkenness, and therefore we did not place so much con<lb></lb>fidence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270168"></xptr>
               <p>in her as we had formerly done—I had heard of that for three or four months—it was before that she was placed in charge of the house-linen—I do not know how long before, it might have been five or six months ago—this sheet has been worn—the value of the articles is not the point in question—it has been mended, and here is a hole—I do not know the value of the sheet—it may be worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or half-a-crown—I gave a value to the officer to put in the indictment, but it is a mere nominal value; I forget what it was—I do not choose to answer any of those questions which do not affect the charge at all—this table-cloth is damask—I see there are holes in it, and it has been darned—I have, perhaps, va<lb></lb>lued it at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is an old one—I can see through it in half-a-dozen places—this other table-cloth is diaper—it is full of holes—there are holes in the socks—I may have left them off, but I never gave them away—I have valued them at half-a-crown—these napkins I have valued at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece, this towel at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and these three yards of carpet 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the carpet has not been cut up and distributed to the poor people in the village—a servant whom I can produce saw the pri<lb></lb>soner selling some of that carpet to a man who came into the yard to buy grease of her—that is not in the indictment, it only shows what a pilferer I had in my house—I gave none of the carpet away—I will not swear none has been given away, but I think not—I know this piece of sacking—I have seen it in the lumber-room—it came with other things, but I do not put any value on it—the prisoner gave warning to leave to Mrs. Reeves, at Brighton, while I was at Mortlake—the notice to leave came from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, though from four to five months before you had been told she was drunken, you kept her the whole of that time, and parted with her on her giving you notice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were told she was drunken, but we were very unwilling to believe it; but the circumstance of her going away was not connected with her drunkenness—we had not discharged thirty-four servants in the twelve months the prisoner lived with us—there was one servant who came, a very respectable woman, who, I believe, went away in consequence of the prisoner's drunken habits—I do not know how many servants we turned away in the twelve months—perhaps three or four changes have taken place within the last year, not more; not half a dozen—I do not see what that has to do with the case—one of these volumes, "The Heiress of Bruges" I missed the day before I left Sheen—the other was in the use of the children; it is one of Hannah More's tracts—they are odd volumes—they were found at the top of the box—that box contained articles of the prisoner's—the articles have been restored to her, but the box was kept, and is now at my house—we were not ordered to bring it here—I did not take it before the Magistrate—it was an old leathern trunk—it belonged to me—I had lent it to her to put her things in, pre<lb></lb>vious to our going to Brighton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that the key of that box was left behind her when she went to Brighton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath, I believe she took the key with her, and she said she had lent the key to Mrs. Reeves's sister—I never sent the key to her by Taylor—I knew nothing about the key—I never sent the key of that box to her by Taylor—the prisoner went to Brighton on the 20th of Aug., and on the 21st we followed—I had no key of any box that I sent to her by Taylor at any time—the box was locked, and from the time of my finding it in the store-room I never saw the key of it, nor have I to this moment, and I should not know the key if I was to see it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270169"></xptr>
               <p>now—the box I found at Neale's was not an old candle-box—it was a box sent to me, containing a lamp—I do not know whether it was used as an old candle-box—I certainly should not have prosecuted her for taking the box alone—there was no confusion in the packing, no more than ordinary when a large family moves—I do not know that these napkins had been sent down into the kitchen to be used as dusters—the prisoner had not lent me a box—she may have lent one to some of my family, or some of the servants—both the boxes were in the store-room before either was sent to Mrs. Neale's—it was about six weeks after she had been at Brighton that I fetched the box from Sheen—I knew she was at the Lord Nelson—she left word she was staying there—there was no secret about that, because we were to hear from her again—I was at Sheen when she left, and her wages were not paid till I returned—they were paid on the 10th of Oct., the day after she was admitted to bail—I did not oppose her being admitted to bail—I particularly wished it, and requested she might not be kept in custody—I did not want to put her to more pain than was necessary—I gave her in charge on the 25th of Sept.—it was on Saturday, the 27th, that I saw the first box at Mrs. Neale's—I went with Finlayson, the policeman, and saw it—I told them not to part with it till either myself or a proper authority should come for it—that was the first time I saw it—I had known of its being there very soon after I got to Brighton—I knew it about a month previous to the 25th of Sept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you look after it a month previously, instead of waiting till she had given notice to quit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did not wish to be<lb></lb>lieve there was anything in that box belonging to us, and therefore we determined, as she was still in our service, to let the thing remain till we got back to Sheen, and then satisfy ourselves as to its contents—we knew from the report of the other servants that she bad sent the box to Neale's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you known of her drunken habits, and of the box being at Neale's, before she gave you notice to quit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard from my wife of the box being at Mr. Neale's about a month or five weeks before, and of her drunken habits a long time before—I saw the box twice at Neale's, once when I first went, and again when I removed it—I did not take it away the first time, because I was not going to Brigh<lb></lb>ton immediately—I was going to stay three or four days at Sheen—I did not remove it till the very day I went to Brighton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send any key of any box by Ann Taylor to the prisoner, saying you had locked the box, and desiring her to give the key to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—was it likely I should lock a servant's box for her?—the misunderstanding between the prisoner and Mrs. Reeves took place on the 25th of Sept., the day before she left—when I first gave charge of her, I made no charge of anything contained in the second box I made the charge before Major Willard—she was sent in custody to Surrey—a Surrey sergeant came down and took her into custody from there—the Magistrate did not remark that he thought my conduct was very strange; but Mr. Bennett, an attorney employed to protect her, took mitting every opportunity of insulting me in a very unbecoming manner—the Magistrate said, "It is a painful thing, but you are very right, and don't be afraid of being abused by this person"—Mr. Penryn, one of the com<lb></lb>mitting Magistrates, is a friend of mine—I was staying at his house at the time I took the box—I went with Mr. Penryn's warrant with the officer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270170"></xptr>
               <p>from Sheen to apprehend her—Major Willard sent me for the warrant—he told me I could get one—it was necessary for me to go and make a deposition, and then I came with the officer and the box—Major Willard did not send me for the warrant, but he said, "If you want this thing gone into, you must go before a Surrey Magistrate and get a warrant"—I went and got Mr. Penryn's warrant, and returned to Brighton to take her into custody—Major Willard and Major Allen backed the warrant, and we went to the police station and waited for her—I had nothing to do with it then—it was out of my hands altogether—I do not know that it was the pri<lb></lb>soner's duty to keep an inventory of the things that were worn out, as they got worn out—I do not think it was by any means her duty to throw them aside as they were worn out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was she intrusted with a discretion to discard things which the might deem no longer fit for use? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—our family went to Brighton on the 19th or 20th of Aug.—the prisoner went the day before I did—she went in the morning, the governesses and the children in the afternoon, and I went next day—while there, I heard of the box having been left at Mrs. Neale's, but I said nothing to the prisoner about it, until about a month after we had been at Brighton—I was speaking to her about something in her bills which I was not satisfied with, and she gave me warning to go that day month—I then said I had also something to say to her, and I spoke to her about her habits of drinking, which had reached my ears very much from all her fellow-servants and others—this she denied in the most strenuous way—I then said, "I understand that you sent a box to Mrs. Neale's cottage the day before we left for Brighton; and I wish to know why you did so, and what that box contains?"—she looked rather confused, and said, it contained a collection of things, towards her own housekeeping, but nothing whatever of mine, the could assure me, over and over again—she said, "There are towels, now, ma'am, you might think are yours, but when I was in such a place, I was on board wages, and was obliged to buy things of my own; but there is nothing of yours, I can assure you"—I said, "I do not understand, then, why you did not leave it openly in the store-room with the other ser<lb></lb>vants' boxes," for which she gave the most extraordinary foolish reason, that it was a very unpleasant thing to leave boxes in a store-room with the other servants' boxes, when in the spring another girl's boxes had been looked into—I said, "I do not know what you mean, Ann, but it is very unpleasant for masters and mistresses to be robbed; and if we find it out we shall follow it up"—she said, "Certainly"—I said, "I think it right to tell you, when I go back to Sheen, I shall examine the contents of that box which has given rise to suspicion among your fellow-servants; and as I have lost so much linen lately I shall look into all the servants' boxes, what is due to one servant is due to another"—she said I might, for there was nothing of mine in it—the result of our interview almost was that she would stay, for she explained everything away so, and I said I did not wish to part with her if she did not drink, and I said she had better go down to her fellow-servants and speak with them—in the meantime I had several things to convince me it was true—next morning she came and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270171"></xptr>
               <p>told me she should not stay—I said, "Very well"—she said she should go because she saw I did believe all this, or something about it, and she should leave me—she went down and came up again in about half an hour, and said she should go that very day—I said, "To-day?"—the said, yes, she felt so unhappy in her mind, she should go that very day—I said then of course I should not give her a character—she went that day—Mr. Reeves was then absent at Sheen, and I desired her to come next week and have her wages paid—I did not ask her where she was going to stay at Brighton, but I knew from the servants—I knew she had friends at Brighton, and that she was going to some of them—her wages were twenty guineas a year—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles</hi>)—here is but one here that I can see a mark upon—this has been cut out—I can hardly tell whether these pieces form part of the same sheet, but I miss three pairs of these sheets—there were fourteen pairs when the list was made, and there are now but eleven pairs of sheets of this quality, servants' linen sheets—here I can see the letter "R" quite plainly—it has been rubbed evidently, but I can see it—it is done with marking-ink—the ink washes out very much, and it is rubbed, too, evidently—anybody can see that—this is quite plain, "F. R. 12" on this towel—I can hardly say whether we have missed towels, for we have bought many lately, and the list is not correctly made out—indeed I did not miss the sheets until I made out the list again yes<lb></lb>terday, at least the housemaid did—I intrusted the prisoner with the key of the linen closet at one time, when we were changing housemaids, till the new one came—I can swear to this table-cloth—the mark may have washed out, but I am perfectly certain it is ours—this other is an old common nursery one—it is mine—the prisoner at once admitted it was mine—the marks may have worn out, for they are very old—I have never missed them, for I trusted her with the key—this carpet is ours—there were some old dinner napkins, and a great many other things, but we only put aside such as we could identify—I thought everything that had been put by was marked, because there was a selection made—I cannot give a notion what these things are worth—I suppose if this sheet were whole it would be worth from 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never expressed a wish that the fact of the box being at Neale's should not be talked about by the servant.</p>

Q.</hi> Select from these articles those you can swear to, and put aside those you cannot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This piece of sheet, and this towel I can swear to, and these table-cloths—I swear to this table-cloth—it is exactly like ours—I do not see a mark on it—it is an old one—probably it would have been cut up for fish napkins or something of that sort—it is worn out for use in the dining-room probably—the sheet is certainly not worn out—I have not seen any holes or darns in it—I do not know whether some of the servants' sheets may not have holes in them—I hardly know how many servants were discharged while the prisoner was there—we had three or four housemaids, and two or three girls came on jobs for nursery-maids, and did not answer—we had a new footman while she was there, and my maid was changed—there were certainly not twenty changes—there may have been nine, ten, or twelve, but not regular servants—three new housemaids and a laundrymaid came—my own maid married and went away—the footman was new, and two or three nursery-girls—the prisoner was not cook and housekeeper—she was a sort of housekeeper—she kept the key of the store-room, and was the upper servant—her own sister was</p>

               <p>One of the servants who left—she persuaded me to take her as kitchen-girl, and she was turned away—I do not know whether this old dinner napkin is marked—I do not think it is, and I do not wish to swear to it—the others are all marked, I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray did you ask the prisoner to stay with you, after she had given you notice to leave? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—she explained away her conduct, and got herself into good humour again—she said she should leave, because I suspected her dishonesty about her bills—I had complained of there being much more sugar used than was necessary, and of her saying there was some had up in the nursery, when there was not—5lbs. was gone in a very short time, and I said I should keep it henceforth, which affronted her, and she gave me warning—I do not think she kept an inventory during the time she had charge of the linen—I was ill shortly after she came—I looked very little to the linen—I paid the weekly bills, and always ex<lb></lb>amined them—she ordered in things occasionally, not entirely what she thought necessary, subject to me—I certainly exercised a discretion on the subject—I took the management of the household affairs to a degree—she ordered in sugar, and what was necessary for consumption in the house—I never sent any napkins down stairs to be used as dusters—nothing of the kind, and I should very much have disapproved of her doing so—I was not examined before the Grand Jury—I was at the court at Brighton, but was not examined.</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many regularly hired servants were discharged or left you during the time the prisoner was with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps seven or eight—one was a nurse, who was sent to me—I did not like her, and gave her a month's wages, and sent her away—the prisoner's sister staid three months—she took her in while I was ill—I never even saw her—some of the nursery-maids staid six weeks, and some two months, and the laundry-maid left to go and live with her brother.</p>

                  </hi>. Iam kitchen-maid to Mr. Reeves—the day before we went to Brighton, the prisoner told me to take a box over to Mrs. Neale's cottage, and she would take care of it till she came from Brighton—it was a box covered with canvas, and fastened up—I took it over, and gave it to Mrs. Neale—I saw a box brought down to Brighton by Mr. Reeves sometime after—it appeared to be the same box that I carried to Neale's—the day before the prisoner left, when she came down from Mrs. Reeves, she said I was not to go up-stairs and say anything about that box, she did not want it named.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you recollect that before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have been nine months in the service—there have not been many servants changed since I have been there—not more than five or sir—the nurse-maid, ladies-maid, three house-maids, and one kitchen-maid, and there have been two nurses for the children—I did not know the box that I took to Mrs. Neale's—there was not a good deal of confusion in the packing, before we went to Brighton—I do not know that any of the pri<lb></lb>soner's things were put up along with the house things—I had nothing to do with the packing—I received the key of a box from Mr. Reeves the day before I went to Brighton—I went on the Thursday, the day after the prisoner went—it was the day I went I received the key from Mr. Reeves—he told me I was to take it to Brighton, and to ask Ann Craft if it belonged to her, for he found it in her room—I asked the prisoner if it belonged to</p>

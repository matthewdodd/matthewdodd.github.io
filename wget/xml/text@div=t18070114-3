What are you. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140004"></xptr> My father keeps an agency office for servants, I am at home with my father, he lives in Hanover court, Houndsditch. On the 30th of December, as I was coming home, between one and two o'clock in the morning, walking very fast in <placeName id="t18070114-3-crimeloc14">Fleet street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18070114-3-crimeloc14" type="placeName" value="Fleet street"></interp>

             came up and asked me what was the matter, I told him I wanted to have nothing to say to him; the woman kept pulling me about all the time, I told her I would charge the watchman with her; the prisoner said he would shew me the watch-house. I walked on a little distance, he took me into a small passage called London house yard, the north side of St. Paul's church yard; he said here is a watchhouse, he collared me directly, and held me till the woman took the money out of my right hand side breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She followed you all the way from Fleet street up to St. Paul's church yard. - A. Yes, both of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had passed some watchman surely before that. - A. No, we had not, there was nobody walking at all. He held me by the collar while she took the money out of my pocket, and then he held me till she got away; he shook me about all the time. When she was out of sight he knocked me down, and directly tried to make his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make his escape. - A. No sir, he did not; just as he got up the passage the patrol seized him immediately, I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose. - A. Nineteen and sixpence; a seven shilling piece, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the woman again. - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was going to goal he saw a woman, he said that was the woman; he did not take her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I thought it was the woman, and when I looked her in the face I saw it was not the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was another man took in the watchhouse with me; he let that man go away, and kept me.</p>
               <p>- MACARTY. I am a watchman in Castle-baynard ward. On the 30th of December, about two in the morning, going my round, the patrol came up to me and asked me if all was well, I told him all was well; in about a minute or two we heard a scuffle just at the entering into London-house yard, Pater-noster row. We heard a voice say, take off from me, let me go, or I will give charge of you; the patrol ran immediately towards the place, I followed him, and as the prisoner was going out of the passage the patrol seized him. As soon as the patrol seized him, he said, Macarty, you lay hold of him, and I will go and see what is the matter, where the rest are; he catched hold of another young chap that was there. Shepherd was getting up, Shepherd said he was knocked down and robbed. I saw Shepherd coming towards him without a hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say by whom he was robbed. - A. As soon as Sepherd came up to the prisoner, he said, this is the man who held me while the woman robbed me; he held him till the woman got out of sight, and then he knocked him down; we took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say. - A. The prisoner said that he was robbed in Fleet street, and he wanted his assistance; after that he said that he knew the woman, and if we would let him go, he would procure the woman and get the money back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man brought into the watch-house. - A. Yes, he was there, but the prosecutor said he had done nothing, he had no charge against him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says very false indeed; when I was in the watchhouse there was another prisoner there, a lamplighter, they turned him out of the watch-house, they mentioned his name, and they said they knew his father.</p>
               <p>- FITZGERALD. I am a patrol. Going along I heard a noise, I paid attention for a minute, I heard words pass, 'let me go, or I'll give charge of you.' I ran over directly, and in the passage I met the prisoner, I secured him, I called my partner to hold him till I found the others; I saw Shepherd without a hat, he was standing on his legs when I came up to him, I took the other lad, he was standing along with Shepherd; I asked Shepherd what was the matter, he said that man that has gone up the passage has held me while a woman robbed me, and had knocked him down. I desired Macarty to bring his man, which is the prisoner; he said he was the man that held him while the woman robbed him. Going along to the watchhouse the prisoner said, if you will let me go I know the woman, and I will bring back the money to the lad; I told him I would not let him go. In the watchhouse I asked Shepherd whether the young man struck him, he said no; I said, then you do not mean to give charge of him, he said no. I turned him about his business. The young lad called me by my name and told me who his father was; I knew his father, but the lad I did not. The father has lighted our ward about four or five years ago.</p>

            (to prosecutor) Was any body by at the time. A. Nobody but the prisoner and the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did this boy do. - A. He seeing the scuffle, came and asked me what was the matter, he never gave me any offence, he only helped to pick me up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Westminster, I had been to sell a horse, it was late when I took it, the man said he would not buy it without he had a trial of it; with that I came along Fleet street, and that gentleman said he was robbed by the woman, and if she did not give him the money he would give charge of her; we came along, and the lamplighter too, he knocked the woman down, the woman got up, held her patten up, and knocked his hat off. I never saw the woman before in my life.</p>

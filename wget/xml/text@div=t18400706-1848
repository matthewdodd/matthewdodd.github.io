                  </hi>. I live in King David-lane—the prisoner and I lived together as man and wife for very nearly eight months—I had several times desired him to go—Idid so on Thursday the 25th of June—he said he could not get a lodging—I told him he must get one—he went out,</p>

I have been and passed my word for your lodging, if you choose to go to it"—he said, "But I want to speak to you"—I went a few paces towards him—he was standing with his back against the public-house door—he up with his hand—he bad some kind of instrument in it, but what it was, I do not know—it was bright—he struck me over the forehead with it—he did not say a word—the blood flew, and he instantly ran away—I called, "Police," and he was taken into custody—I was hurt very much indeed—he struck me above the eye—I am positive he had something in his hand—I saw it bright—there was a lamp over the public-house door—it was in his left hand—I was confined in-doors three days—I could not hold my head up—Mr. Betson, a surgeon, attended me—I had not had any dispute with the prisoner, more than about his going away—I was tired of him.</p>

            . On or about the 17th of October, the prisoner, Serjeant Bayliss, came to our office, and presented a draft for 15l.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft? - A. This is the draft that he presented for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the person whose name appears at the bottom of the order an account at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It appears to me from the abstract, that the name is not the same, it is difficult to say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240029"></xptr>whether it is Burnaby or Barnby. (Here the learned Judge compared the abstract with the indictment, and found it a sac simile.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at the bottom of it; there is something besides the name, I believe? - A. Yes, Lieutenant and Adjutant of the first foot guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that regiment keep an account with you? - A. Captain Burnaby keeps cash at our house, and draws bills on our house on account of the regiment besides.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his presenting this draft, did you pay it? - A. No, I suspected it to be a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you at all acquainted with the handwriting of captain Burnaby? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that his hand-writing? - A. No, it is not; I asked the prisoner in what way he came by it; he said, he received it from serjeant-major Seston, of the same regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. It appears to be drawn in favour of serjeant-major Seston? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the account he gave, what did you do to him-did you secure him? - A. No, he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the draft? - A. I sent the bill up stairs to Mr. Rickaby, it was left at the office, and it was afterwards sent to the orderly-room.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you put your name to it before it left the office? - A. No, not till he was examined at Bow-street, which was three or four days after, but I am persuaded it is the same draft that he presented.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You cannot swear that it is the same of course, not having it in your own custody? - A. No, another draft might be drawn exactly like it; it was two or three days before it was returned from the orderly-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you seen captain Burnaby write? - A. He keeps an account at Cox and Greenwood's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Who did you shew it to after it was first presented to you? - A. I gave it to Mr. Lucas.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that his hand-writing? - A.It is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. At the time Mr. Brett gave you this supposed draft, you did not put any mark upon it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.When did you first see Smith? - A. Sunday evening last.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after Bayliss was in custody? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.When you saw Bayliss and him together, were you within their sight, or concealed? - A. I was concealed by the desire of captain Burnaby.</p>
               <p>Q.What room were you in? - A. In the same room, in Portman-street barracks; Bayliss knew I was there, but Smith did not; I was concealed underneath the bed-cloths in a bedstead turned up.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time that Bayliss and Smith were together, could you hear what they said to each other? - A.Yes; I saw Smith come into Bayliss.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us what conversation passed? - A. First, Smith shook hands with Bayliss, and asked him how he did, and how he should come on; Bayliss said, he thought he should be there about a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240030"></xptr>Q. Was the room in which Bayliss was, a room of free access, or a room of confinement? - A. A room of confinement; he said, he thought he should be there about a week, or till the commanding officer came to town; Smith said, d-n my blood, if I have not been walking about these barracks for this hour, before I could come up to you; Bayliss said, please God I live to get through this, you shall never persuade me to have any thing to do with your forged notes any more; this is the first time your forged notes any more; this is the first time I ever had any thing to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion was it that Bayliss was confined in this room? - A. By order of the commanding officer, on account of this note; then the conversation, turned to something else, and they came and sat down upon a bench before the fire, and drapk a share of a pot of beer; after some time Smith says, this day week you were on the provost guard; Bayliss said, yes, there it was; you dated the note; Smith said, yes, it was; then the discourse turned to something else, and a little while afterwards Bayliss said, Smith was that note for 15l. that you wrote out; Smith said, yes, it was; Bayliss then asked him whether he recollected the date of the note, or not, whether he dated it the 15th or 16th; Smith said, he was not certain, but he thought it was either the 15th or 16th, he was not certain which, and then there was some conversation about something else; then Smith was seized by a constable, and taken away to Mary-le-bonne watch-house; Bayliss was asked, in the presence of Smith, whether he chose to give charge of Smith for forging the note, and Bayliss said, he did; I went and saw him in the watch-house myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. I think you said that Bayliss knew of your being confined under the bed-clothes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was a contrivance for the purpose of extracting something from Smith, in order to excuse himself? - A. That I cannot tell; it was to hear the conversation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (For Baylis). Q. You were placed there on purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were put there in consequence of a promise, that if Bayliss would lead to the detection of any body else, he would receive every indulgence? - A. Not that I know of; it was the serjeant-major that desired me to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. With the approbation of Bayliss? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was in order that he might extract something from Smith, that he might himself escape? - A. That I cannot tell; certainly it was to find out whether Smith was concerned in it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Captain Burnaby here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q.Bayliss was asked whether he would not charge Smith? - A. Yes. (The draft read.)</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. I never saw that note in my life, that note was not my hand-writing, not did I utter that note.</p>
               <p>Bayliss's defence. I received the note of Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>For Bayliss.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a lieutenant of the first regiment of guards; I know the prisoner, Bayliss, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not plan this contrivance for the purpose of inducing from him a confession? - A. I did it for that purpose; I waited upon him in his room, and told him his critical situation, and I likewise told him, it was very certain, tht for the sake of his family, if any body was concerned with him, it would be better to say it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Be so good as look at that draft; does that purport, upon the face of it, to be your draft? - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the description of yourself, J.D. Burnaby, lieutenant and adjutant? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your draft? (Mr. Alley objected to this question.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What is the character of this man? - A. I have been five years in the same battalion with him; I always believed him to be as honest a man as could live.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Smith called Mr. Alexander Wyllie, who had known him from four years old, and gave him an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I hire with my father, John Wallis, a butcher, at Chadwell Heath, Dagenham, in Essex. On the 1st of October I went with a load of wood to Barking, and when I returned my father's pigs were missing—I found the prisoner with them about three miles and a half from my father's, in Little Ilford parish—he was a stranger—I asked if the pigs belonged to him—he said he was minding them for a man who was to give him a pint of beer—I said, I must take him—he said, "What for? Come along with me, and I will show you the man"—I brought him a short distance, and when we got opposite the Rabbits public-house he got into a field and ran—I called to a man who stopped him—he said he ran because I had been beating him with a stick, which I had not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. I was working near the Seven Kings public-house on the 1st of October, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come along with the three pigs—I said, "Where did you get these pigs?"—he said, "My master bought them yesterday at Romford, and sent me down to Romford for them to-day"—I told him they were very much like my father's, and asked where he was going to take them—he said to Ilford—I said there was no pork-butcher there—he then said he was going to take them to a public-house there—I helped him across the road with them, and he said, "My master is behind, and he will give you a gallon of beer for helping me."</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a coat and two pair of stays? - A. Yes, on the 21st of November, about ten in the morning; I had seen them at the door about ten minutes before. At twelve o'clock the same day I went to Marlborough-street; I saw the property there, and the prisoner in custody; I knew them to be mine, when I saw them.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am a carpenter; on the 21st of November I was passing by Emanuel's shop, I saw the prisoner stand at his door; I crossed over the way, and then I turned myself round, I saw the prisoner take a coat and two pair of stays from the outside of the door; he rolled them up, and then he ran two hundred yards before he stopped; I followed him close, and never lost sight of him; he stopped and rolled them up tighter, and put them under his arm, and then he walked a considerable distance before I spoke to him; I said to him, my friend, you have soon bargained for your lot; he said he had, did I see him; I told him I did; he asked me if I would go halves with him; I asked him where he was going with them; he said he did not know, he never did the like before; I asked him to stop; he did not seem to like to stop with me; I collared him and took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any resistance? - A. He only struggled with me; he made no other resistance, he behaved very civil.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARREN sworn. I produce the things; they have been in my custody ever since they were delivered to me by the last witness.</p>
               <p>(The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had you and this young man lived together? - Six weeks.</p>
               <p>Always lived on very good terms, had had not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often had you quarrelled in the the six weeks? - We had not quarelled above once; that was a good while before he left his place.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he gave warning to his master, because he and you could not agree together? - I do not know that he gave warning; he did not bring down his box to be searched; he was taken in Grub-street, within a few hundred yards of my master's house; a milk-man who was speaking to him, came and told us.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner waited till you and the milk-man came back to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might that take? - It took about a quarter of an hour to come and go back.</p>
               <p>He was where the milk-man had described he left him, he was standing by a publick-house? - Near a publick-house.</p>
               <p>Was this room locked up usually in which you and he slept? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>It is a publick tavern that you live at? - Yes. Both my boxes were locked.</p>
               <p>They were not broke open? - I found them locked, and a difficulty to unlock them again.</p>
               <p>This comb is worth a penny I see by the commitment? - It is worth six-pence.</p>
               <p>Have not you quarrelled more than once? - No more than once.</p>
               <p>What was that about? - I do not know indeed; I made a complaint one morning about the fire not being made, and the water not being boiled; he continued in service a month after that; I was neither pleased nor displeased.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - Going on nine months, and he six weeks.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect Rowe going out on Sunday the 10th of May? - I do.</p>
               <p>After he went out, do you know what became of the prisoner? - The prisoner came to me about an hour after the prosecutor went out, and he said, I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030052"></xptr>be glad to know Sir, whether you intend to continue me in your service; for if you will, I will send into the country for my clothes.</p>
               <p>Court. Had there been any talk of his going away before? - None at all; only I told him a fortnight before, that if he did not mend, I should not keep him.</p>
               <p>For what fault had you reprimanded him? - For staying of errands and being lazy, and laying in bed of mornings, by complaints of the bar-keeper, and other servants; I told him I did not mean to continue him, he did not suit me; he said he had another place, to go to be a book-keeper to a carrier, and he must leave my place directly, in order to be there on Monday morning; I told him I thought it was an extraordinary manner of leaving his place at that time, and I should not discharge him then; he went up stairs and brought down a bundle, in the space of five minutes he brought me a piece of paper with figures on it, and said his wages came to so much; I threw it back, and said I should not look at it; he said he knew how to get his wages, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Then you understood by him, that if you had been willing to continue him in your service, he would have staid? - Perfectly, from what he said; when the prosecutor came back, he missed his money; the prisoner was brought to my house on Friday following, I was present; he did not seem to say any thing; I saw the constable search him, and a leather bag was found upon him, with a few shillings; I did not pay any attention to what he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect which of your servants complained most of this man? - I believe the cook.</p>
               <p>He was porter in the house, therefore it was his business to have eased the work of the others? - It was his business to have done every thing that was required of him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner and the prosecutor never had a quarrel that you heard? - I have heard them have some words, but never any that I took notice of.</p>
               <p>He never complained to you? - No, that I am quite sure of, he never complained at all.</p>
               <p>After this money was lost, it was mentioned to every body about the house, and all the trades people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect the expression you used to him about a month before? - I told him if he did not do his business better, if he did not mind better, I should discharge him.</p>
               <p>You did not examine his bundle? - No, I did not, he said I might look into his bundle, for he had nothing but his own. The prisoner had been sent out and received a guinea or two.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there any thing remarkable in the money you lost? - No, it was all new gold, excepting two guineas, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>What sort of a half guinea was the half guinea? - It was a new half guinea of the last coin.</p>
               <p>Strait or crooked? - I believe it was crooked.</p>
               <p>What sort of a comb was it that you lost? - A large comb like a mane-comb, quite a wide tooth comb, there were two of the teeth broke out.</p>
               <p>Where were they out, at the middle or one end? - At one end.</p>
               <p>Was the end broke off? - Only the teeth.</p>
               <p>Both ends of the comb then were entire, but two teeth broke out at one end? - Yes, it is the thick end tooth, and the one next to it was broke; I put the comb and the razor, and all the things together into my box; it was locked up, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your razor and the comb were together? - Yes.</p>

               <p>With respect to the comb, it was taken out of my pocket either by a gentleman or the constable, when searching me at the Globe Tavern, in the room with and in the presence of the waiter, my prosecutor, and then and there returned; it was again taken out of my pocket, together with a knife by Mr. Leicester, the turnkey at the Poultry Compter, and there returned; a gentleman, then present, he who took it from me at the Globe Tavern, when returned thereto, asked the waiter if he had lost any articles besides the money; for he observed I had two combs; immediately the waiter, my prosecutor, answered, that he had lost one, and in consequence thereof came down to the compter a second time, and on its being re-produced, instantly laid claim to the same. Now I would ask him, why he did not lay claim to it either the first or second time it was produced, as well as the third time? if he says that it was not found and produced, how could that gentleman see it, and inform him thereof, as he acknowledged, if I mistake not, at Guildhall? and if he replies, that he did not see it; I would ask him if he was not present every time I was searched? and why the chief person concerned could not see it as well as another stranger thereto? But again, suffer me to enquire as it is of the utmost importance; if, on supposition I had stole this money which I am charged with, may we not reasonably suppose that where he deposited such an amount as fifteen or sixteen guineas, that other articles of value would be deposited? and I would ask, as we had the whole room for our own use, and as he had other boxes larger than that wherein he says these articles were deposited; if it be agreeable to reason or common sense to suppose for a moment, either that I should fix my inclination on nothing but an old broken comb, scarce worth noticing, being valued in my commitment at only one penny; or that he ever would deposit in the same place with gold and silver an old comb. There is another circumstance I would beg leave to remark, and that is, supposing I was guilty of taking this comb out of his box, when it was produced and re-produced, can any person suppose I was so destitute of common sense, as to keep it in my possession, when I had such opportunities of destroying it, especially if I had been guilty of such an offence? it must of course occur to my mind that, in case it was found upon me, it would be a certain means of my conviction; but, on the contrary, is it not more reasonable to suppose that it fell into my hands, in the manner described by my honourable friend Mr. Garrow, (and as such at the awful day of retribution it will be found); especially as the contrary supposition proves to a demonstration, that to take an article, such as it was, out of others of infinitely greater value, that I was the veriest fool in nature, and that I stole for stealing sake. Permit me now to say a few words in explanation, with regard to calling no person to my character; permit me in few words to explain: it is little more than half a year since I came to this city; and during the time I have been here, I have formed no acquaintance with any, save with those who were absolutely necessary in transacting the common affairs of life; but I appeal to Mr. Herd himself, my prosecutor, friend and master, whether in any single instance, during the time I was employed by him, I ever wronged him of the value of a farthing, or ever in transacting his affairs, such as carrying out wine, and giving receipts for the same, I ever behaved in any other than an honest, sober, and upright manner, and what was agreeable to the strictest honor, justice and morality: indeed if any thing detrimental to my character could have been found since I came here, it would not have been wanting, as the utmost vigilance, which the most inveterate malice, rancour and revenge could effect, have been used in order to bring to light any thing which might be of prejudice to me at this day: but I bless heaven, that from my youth up to this day, my life has been such, that no person ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030055"></xptr>could, or ever did (save in this instance) charge me with any thing contrary to justice and morality. Gentlemen of the Jury, permit me in the last place to address a few words with the greatest deference and respect to you: I thank you for thus candidly hearing me so far; and I bless God and the legislature, that Englishmen are permitted to be heard: as a man, and a member of the constitution, my life is very very dear unto me; and I flatter myself, that in consideration thereof, you will from motives of pity and humanity, condescend to heat me a few moments longer: see me a stranger in a strange place, unknown to every one that can be of service to me in this awful situation; cut off from my friends by a long and inseparable distance; no persons in this city who know me, that can speak in my behalf, I mean they are not qualified so to do, for I am told that none but house-keepers can; else I could procure many of unsullied reputation, who would be glad to do it. In this deplorable situation, it is easy to conceive how acute, how sensible the pain must be which preys upon the vital spirits, and at times almost robs me of reason: In consequence thereof, to his lordship, and to your consideration, I submit with the utmost humility, what I have already said; and to God and to you I trust for a verdict consonant to my uprightness and innocence. Let not wealth and power triumph over poverty and weakness; nor rancour ever crush and consign the innocent and helpless to destruction and oblivion: Conscious of the rectitude of my conduct, I conclude with resting my cause upon him whose tribunal is founded in infallible uprightness,</p>
               <p>"where the wicked</p>
               <p>"cease from troubling, and where the</p>
               <p>"weary are for ever at rest." Denying having any more money, if he did ask me, was owing to the confusion.</p>
               <p>Court. Hand me up your defence.</p>
               <p>(Handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court. He refers to the manner described by you, Mr. Garrow; I have not heard you.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Can you state the manner in which you became possessed of that comb?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, when I was porter to the Globe Tavern, in the place assigned to me to clean the knives, my master's shoes, and every necessary article, the waiter used to come into that place to dress his hair; he generally made use of a comb, one part wider and one smaller; this comb lay there from the time I first came to them, within a day or two of my departure; I never saw any person use it, I thought that comb was the property of the other porter; when I saw it laying about for some time; one time I picked it up out of the street, I had swept it out, and I took it as my own, not thinking it was the waiter's, because I never saw him use it.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand from what you have stated, that you have no witnesses here.</p>

             and I went to have a pint of beer, and the prisoner came in and asked me if the Jamaica Fleet was come in; I told her the Jamaica fleet was arrived safe in the Downs; upon that she sat down along side of me, and asked one Davis if we would give her something to drink; she asked if we had nothing better to drink than porter; the prisoner and Davis kept talking together for some time; I laid my elbow of my right-hand upon the table, and out of my jacket pocket she took three shillings, and a half-crown; I had a loose blue jacket on, I felt her nudging me, but I did not perceive her take it, she went away; when she was gone, I said to Davis we will go home; I went to put my hand in my pocket to pay for the beer, and my money was gone; I found out where she lived and took her to the watch-house, about three quarters of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite sober? - A. Yes, as sober as a judge; I asked her for the money she had robbed me of; a half-crown fell out of her pocket upon the bed but that was not mine, for it had a head on it; there was a young man with her and he took up the half-crown and went away; she was taken to the watch-house, and three shillings and six-pence found upon her; there was one of the shillings that I can swear to, I had described it to Mr. Dunbar before he found it upon her.</p>
               <p>JOHN DUNBAR sworn. - I am a Headborough: on the 26th of July, about one in the morning, I was called up to take charge of the prisoner; I found three shillings and six-pence upon her; he described one shilling that he should know again.(Produces the money.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor drunk or sober? - A. He told me he had been drinking peppermint with a woman; I never saw the man before, but I thought he had been drinking, the woman was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my shilling, it has a B. and a star upon it.</p>

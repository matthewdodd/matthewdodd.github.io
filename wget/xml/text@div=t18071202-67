I lost my guinea out of my pocket book, I kept my pocket book in the till of my box; I marked the guinea, as I had missed some guineas before; drilled a hole in the D, on the head side of the guinea; the lock of my box must have been picked, to get the guinea. I found the guinea at Mrs. Chase's.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I missed the guinea on Wednesday evening last; I lost it between the Sunday and the Wednesday in last week.</p>
               <p>Q. to Beale. Had you any more lodgers in the house. - A. I had seven or eight. The prisoner came into the house afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he call upon Smith. - A. I cannot say; the last time I saw the prisoner was last Wednesday morning, between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was eight lodgers in the house besides; no person saw me in the room from Sunday between eleven and one, till Wednesday morning between eight and nine. I have but one arm, I lost the other fighting for my King and country.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, from the evidence, it appears the house had seven or eight lodgers, how it got into his possession we cannot say; nobody saw him with a false key open the box; how he got it out of the box<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020052"></xptr>has not been proved; there is to be sure suspicion about it; it has been proved to have been in his possession, but you all know how soon money passes from one hand to another.</p>

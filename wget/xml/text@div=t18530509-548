                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Harriss, a baker, of No. 153, Whitecross-street. We have dealt with the prisoner for some time at Mr. Wilmer's shop, in Goswell-road—on Monday, 14th Feb., I paid to the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in part payment of an account of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his receipt, signed by himself—I paid him on the following Friday afternoon 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was all the money I owed at that time, including the week's bread—he wrote "Cashed" on the first bill, and "Settled" when he received the remainder, and he has also put "Balanced"—I saw him write it when I paid him the balance—on 28th Feb. I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was not the whole of the money I owed him then; I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 4th March, which settled up to 26th Feb.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his receipt, which I took for those two sums; I saw him write it—I paid all these sums into his hands, and saw him write the receipts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Aldenham-terrace, St. Pancras, and No. 39, Goswell-road. The prisoner managed my business in Goswell-road, for which I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, besides his lodging and coals—it was my practice each week to send a quantity of flour for him to convert into bread, and on the Friday in each week it was his duty to account to me, on which occasions he sometimes produced a book, and sometimes a memorandum; and I, in his presence, copied the statements which he made to me into my book—his signature is to the accounts for the weeks ending 18th Feb. and 25th Feb., but not to that of 4th March, because he was given into custody on that night—he saw me make the entries from his memorandums—in his account on 18th Feb. I find 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. owing from a customer named Harriss, for bread—the account is made out in this way: he gives me credit for twenty-six sacks of flour, making 2,392 loaves, which come to 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which sum he accounts for as follows, "39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. expenses, and customers 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is owing from the customers who are mentioned on the other half-sheet, among whom here is "Harriss, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that means that bread to that amount had been sold to Harriss during that week on credit—I find that sum included in the total, which is afterwards brought over to the other side, and a balance struck as credit—this statement is confined to one week's account—the prisoner did not account to me for any sum received from Harriss—this account for the week ending 25th Feb. is made out in the same way, and Harriss is credited with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received no cash as paid from Harriss that week; the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is included</p>

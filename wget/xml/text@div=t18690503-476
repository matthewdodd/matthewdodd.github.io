                  </hi>. I live at the East London School, Burdett Road, Limehouse—I started that school in 1864 or 1865—I built the premises, and therefore no rent was paid until this transaction; then a rent of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was put on them, and I had a premium for their being at so low a rental—I was also proprietor of Stainsby College for Girls, about half-a-mile off—before the outbreak of cholera, I had 300 pupils at the East London College—Stainsby College was not established then—I obtained premises at Finchley Road, in 1867, in consequence of the outbreak of cholera in Lime-house, and resided there, leaving two masters in the superintendence of the East London College, which fell off on the outbreak of cholera—the prisoner's son was in my school for two years and a half—he was sent there by his grandfather—I knew nothing of the father until he came and applied to be my assistant master, in August, 1868—I refused at first, but after<lb></lb>wards engaged him as junior master—he introduced me to his wife, and I engaged her as governess of the girls' school at Stainsby College—soon after he came into my service, I inserted some advertisements for a partner, after which the defendant came and made statements to me, complaining of the inattention of the superior master of East London College—I said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186905030041"></xptr>
               <p>that I was about to take a partner at the Finchley Road school, and then I should be much more of my time at the East London—he said, "I should like to be that partner"—I said I was just concluding my arrangements, and that I expected to receive a large sum of money in a few days—he said, "I am calling in a mortgage of 2300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at Lichfield"—I said, "You could not do that so quickly as I should require, and as I have been ex<lb></lb>pecting money you must pay a deposit"—he said, "I can't do that, but I can get a bill discounted at the London and Westminster Bank immedi<lb></lb>ately"—he got me to send out for a bill-stamp, and wrote the bill, which he accepted, and took it to get it discounted—he said, "I have banked at the London and Westminster Bank for several years, and have not drawn my account below 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for several yean"—he came to me in two or three days, and said that the bill must be in two separate bills of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; and on the following Saturday he was away from school, waiting, as he said, for the secretary of the London and Westminster Bank—I made the two bills, as he asked me, instead of the one—he had the one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was torn up two or three days afterwards—he said he had left the bills with the head cashier, who would telegraph an answer on Monday morning—next day, Tuesday, he engaged an auctioneer to value the furniture at East London College, and he was to appraise that at Finchley on Wednesday, bat on Wednesday he wrote a letter throwing up the partnership—this is a copy of the letter of the 22nd, from his solicitor, and also the original of the 23rd—I lost the original letter of the 22nd at the time of the Chancery proceedings: I left a bundle of papers in a cab, or else at one of the offices at which I called—I have been to Scotland Yard, and have advertised several times for them—the letter of the 23rd declines the partnership, and proposes a purchase—he had mentioned the name of his solicitors, Messrs. Sheppard and Riley, as early as the 16th—on the Wednesday he had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, saying that he had sent a special messenger down to Lichfield to expedite matters—the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to pay his expenses—he said the messenger's name was George Esdaile; there was a book with that name written in it, but I. have not got it now, it was taken away by the bankruptcy messenger, I imagine—he said Sheppard and Riley knew all about his property, and that they had power to prevent the partnership, and would not allow it under any circumstances; that they had control of his wife's property and would not permit it; that he was very intimate with them, and saw their bank-book, and was going to article his son to them—he had applied to me on a Saturday, a fortnight previous, to attend a meeting of the shareholders of the London and Westminster Bank, as he had the good fortune to have ten shares in that concern—after he proposed a pur<lb></lb>chase I got several letters from him, they were lost with the others—I have copies of seven or eight of them, made by my wife—after the proposal for a purchase, he mentioned the Lichfield mortgage at different times up to the day appointed for settlement, 2nd October—on the 1st October he said, "I am disappointed about the Lichfield mortgagor; his wife is confined with twins, one is dying, and the other not expected to live, and he can't attend to business to-day"—in the afternoon he said that the other child was dead, and his wife was dangerously ill—on the Friday morning he showed me a portion of a letter, hiding the top and bottom, just showing me the words, "I can't attend to business to day under such unfortunate circumstances"—he said, "The Lichfield mortgagor will be able to attend to business shortly, in the meanwhile I can get 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in dock war<lb></lb>rants"—on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186905030042"></xptr>
               <p>the Saturday he expressed himself as wholly disappointed in regard to the cash and dock warrants, and said that the Lichfield mortgagor could not attend to business on account of his domestic afflictions—he said Mr. Dobree was the London agent of the Lich field lawyer, and a telegraph came to him, supposed to have been sent by Mr. Dobree—he mentioned more than once, that he had 2500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out on mortgage, and when I pressed for a deposit, he said he had made several loans lately—he mentioned two or three times about not reducing his balance below 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that it was at the Whitechapel Branch of the London and Westminster Bank—I was induced to believe that, because his father's business used to be there—he said that his wife had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which she drew quarterly—that was confirmed by her signing two of the bills—he showed me some telegrams, but took them away again; two of them were on the day the furniture was valued—one he said came from Mr. Dobree, and the other from Lichfield—I saw them—I employed Messrs. Cowdell &amp; Grundy, solicitors, 21, Abchurch Lane, they have now removed to Budge Row—October 1st was fixed for the settlement of the Bow concern—I went to Cowdell &amp; Grundy on that day, and the prisoner met me in Abchurch Lane, and began to tell me of his disappointments—on 3rd October I met the prisoner at Messrs. Sheppard &amp; Riley's—Mr. Sheppard discounted 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills, and the prisoner gave me an undertaking to retire the rest of the bills on the follow<lb></lb>ing Tuesday, amounting to 1150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the consideration for that was 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for furniture and fixtures, and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., premium for the lease of the premises, at a low rental for twenty-one years—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the undertaking the prisoner signed about retiring the bills—430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be in cash; you have the statement there—he did not produce any cash on the 3rd October him<lb></lb>self, but Sheppard and Riley discounted both of my bills, which produced nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and on the previous Saturday Mr. Sheppard had discounted 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my bills, making 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I made an allowance of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making altogether 1150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be given to me on, the Saturday—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the produce of the discount of the bills, was applied to the payment of running accounts—the bills were afterwards dishonoured, and the property is still liable—nearly 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. came into my hands on my own bills, but nothing from the prisoner whatever—I shall have to take them up, I am liable for them—I executed the assignment to Sheppard &amp; Riley, on 3rd October, and signed one lease for twenty-one years; but the other had to be sent into the country to the solicitor—possession of both colleges was given to the prisoner on the same day, and all the furniture was given up to him on the 3rd October—he made almost daily appointments after 3rd October with me—one day he wrote eight letters, three to me and the rest to my creditors—these are the bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are eleven of them—the three largest are, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 620<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that represents the balance of the purchase-money—that was the money obtained on the discounts—the other bills were given to me from time to time, when he put me off with a most positive assurance that he was going to pay a compensation for the legal expenses I was incurring—he gave me eight bills, each for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as a com<lb></lb>pensation for the loss I sustained by delay, and for legal expenses—I did not make use of them—two of them were discounted by Mr. Brewer—during the whole of this time the defendant was taking the school fees, so that he had nearly the whole value of the bills—the 19th October was the last date that any bill was given—he was then taking the school fees at both places—about 13th October he said something about expecting a</p>

               <p>South Hackney, for the sisters of the boys at the boys' school—the South Hackney school I sold on 15th September to an assistant, who has been with me five years—I had four schools on 15th September—the prisoner came to me as an assistant in August; I had six schools then—the sixth was at Burgess Hill, Finchley Road, and I had a ladies' school at Bow—I was principal of all those establishments—I describe myself as A. C. P., Associate of the College of Preceptors, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and F.S.A., here are the three diplomas—I was certificated at the head of the College at Chelsea, and had a full certificate for five subjects in drawing at the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, and a medal for suc<lb></lb>cessful teaching and drawing—the actual assistant at the East London College in August, 1868, was William Cook—he was first-class master, Mr. Dare was second or third-class, I do not remember which—Mr. Vignon was the French master—the prisoner was also a master, and Mr. Stacey—this prospectus was issued in 1868; that means December, 1867—it is the last book prospectus—it is true that I put forward to the public that Mr. Holt was the vice-principal at South Hackney, he has bought it of me since—I did not give these prospectuses to the prisoner as part of the proof of the re<lb></lb>spectability of my position; he may have taken them—I told the printer to make me a few more prospectuses—he did it right as far as the headings went but left the first page as it is for the list of masters—I can prove that my cus<lb></lb>tom was to tearthat leaf out before issuing the prospectuses—the last was made in December, 1867—it is true that Mr. Holt was vice-principal, he fully repre<lb></lb>sented me in my absence—this is a prospectus of 1867—Mr. Hall was a resident master at South Hackney, in 1867, as far as I can go, but I can show you a list of twenty masters, I cannot recollect all—Mr. Hind was a resident master, but not at South Hackney, nor was Mr. Prior—Mr. Plum<lb></lb>stead was at East London, and Mr. Coakley; Mr. Shone was at East London, not at South Hackney, but the two schools are within a mile and a half of each other—Professor Noirit visited both places—you will find him as a non-resident—he was French master at East London College—M. Vignon was with me between five and six years, and M. Noirit was dismissed and taken on again—there were over twenty assistants at one time at the different schools—when the prisoner came to me in August, I was only in debt for my current accounts—I believe they amounted to as near 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as possible, and by my cash-book I can show you that my current expenses were 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—besides that, I had raised money on mortgage very largely—the total value of my property was nearly 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the mortgages largely 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debts is exclusive of the money borrowed on mortgage—the whole amount is 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., subject to some of it being secured—the 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not secured, but there is the balance value of the property—I have no other property but the goodwill of my schools—the one in Finchley Road is valued at 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I am not aware that the gentleman who has valued the East London school has reported that the goodwill, and other things, are worth nothing, or recommended that it should not be bought—I did not ask the prisoner to raise money for me almost immediately after he came as master—he came, I think, between the 1st and 6th August—I did not, as early as 28th August, give him what was the commencement of a bill, in my writing, and ask him to get money on it—this is my writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but it was never given to him; it is a bill which he must have purloined out of my desk—I cannot account for his doing so, any more than I can see any</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This letter was written to Mr. Brooke: "The reports of our agent, with reference to Mr. Haysman, are of such a nature that we cannot advise you to proceed in the matter of the proposed partnership, &amp;c.; it seems to us that the best plan would be to try the Bow college; that arrangement is the only one we can sanction under the circumstances?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The defendant himself showed me the report upon which that opinion was based, and there is not a shadow of truth in it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the report of which I speak. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "Everything is very doubtful; do not part with your money; although he is a very industrious man, he is resting upon a thread.")—That report is so false, that Mr. Love was going to sue me in the County Court, though he had only cashed a bill for me a few days before; I dare say he is here to prove it—I did not get the prisoner to discount any bills for me before the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he was to take to the London and Westminster Bank—I cannot tell you the exact date, but not before the 12th September; that was the first time he spoke to me—on 19th September, he gave me these two bills, cashed by Mr. Shep<lb></lb>pard—I had given him the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill about the 14th or 15th; it was the Monday or Tuesday; I said the 13th—he tore it up because he said it must be in two separate bills of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—he did not say, "It is no use giving me this bill, the bills ought to be smaller, and you must make it appear that they are trade bills, given in payment"—I do not know whether I sent this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with those two bills—it has the appearance of my writing, and I said that it was, at the Police Court, but I know nothing whatever about it, and I should say that it is not my writing—the only hesitation I have is that he may have so influenced me as to write something which was misinterpreted—I mean, on my oath, to swear that it is not my writing—I distinctly swear that it cannot be, that it is not; I had no transaction of that kind; it is not mine—I know that there was a second mistake, and that Police Court was most cruel torture and degradation to me—I distinctly swear that this is not my writing—it was shown to me at the Police Court, and I was asked, "Is that your writing?" I said, quickly, "Yes," and was going to say something else, but was immediately stopped—I swore that I did not enclose two bills with it; you may refer to my deposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you swear this: "The letter produced, of 19th September, is in my hand; the bills produced were enclosed in the letter?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The latter part, I believe not; the former part, I unfortunately did—the whole thing was a mockery, from beginning to end—I believe I swore that the two bills did not go in the letter—they certainly did not go in the letter to the prisoner; they went by hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear they went by hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot go so far as that, they may have been enclosed in a note, and sent by hand—I had not before said "It is no use giving me bills without giving me something to show that they are trade bills," I would not be guilty of such a trick—this, "Will you</p>

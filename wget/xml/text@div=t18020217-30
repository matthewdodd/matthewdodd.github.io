            Had you your money when you were at the Angel Inn? - A. Yes; I had my money in my pocket when I left the Angel Inn; I came home to the Hotel, and rang the bell twice, the man did not hear me; I staid about ten minutes at the door; and then walked round the square, and met with these two women at the further side of the square; they asked me to treat them with a glass of gin; I said, I had no objection if they could find a public-house open; one of them said she knew a place that was open; we went there, that was in Chandos-street, I went into the tap-room with both the women, they called for half a pint of rum; I asked the landlord how much it was; he said a shilling; I took my pouch from my pocket, and gave him a shilling; one of the women put some liquor into a glass and drank first, then she gave the other a glass, then she gave a glass to the watchman, and then she poured me out a glass; I said I wanted some water and some sugar, I was not going to drink liquor in that way, then the women went away; and because it was too early for me to get in I had four pennyworth of gin and water; and after I had drank it, I put my hand into my pocket to pay for it, and my purse was gone.</p>

            When was the last time you had seen your purse before that? - A. In the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel either of the women with their hands in your pockets? - A. No; I thought I was in good company.</p>
               <p>Q. What was contained in your purse? - A. A seven-shilling piece and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay in the room all the while with them? - A. Yes.</p>

            You did not go into any other room? - A. No; we did not leave the table.</p>
               <p>Q. After all this, you could not be very sober? - A. I was sober enough to know what I did; I called the watchman, and described them to him; then they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>- MACDONALD sworn. - I am a watchman: Going along St. Martin's-lane, I saw these girls, and, soon after, I heard this man say, I am robbed by two women, and if I saw them, I should know them very well; I took him into the gin-shop at the corner of New-street, where they were; he put his hand on Watson's left shoulder, and said, this is the woman that robbed me; they were both together at that time.</p>

            Did the prosecutor speak of them both? - A. He said, this is the woman that was in my company, and this is the woman that robbed me; he swore to one more than the other, he swore most to Watson; I put my hand on her left shoulder, and told her, she must got with me; when she moved, I saw this purse (producing it) lying on her right toe in the wine vaults; that was about ten minutes before six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the purse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Simmons. I know this purse to be mine, because it is broke on one side; I bought it in Brook-street about three months ago.</p>

            (To Macdonald.) Was there any body else in the wine-vaults? - A. No, only Paterson, the master, as we were going along, Williams said, before I go to prison, the best way is to tell the truth; you know you have the money, give it up; she said, she had the money either in her cloaths, or in her mouth; I took her to the constable of the night, and he searched her in my presence, but found nothing but brass.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the winevaults: The two prisoners came to my house about six o'clock in the morning; one asked for a glass of rum, and the other for a glass of gin; Watson gave me a seven-shilling piece, I gave her six shillings, and the rest of her change in halfpence; they did not stay three minutes; the watchman and the prosecutor came in; I heard the prosecutor say to Watson, she had robbed him, and she denied it; they began to search her, and the watchman picked up the purse at her feet; I was lighting my fire when they came in.</p>

I met this young woman; she asked me if I would have any thing to drink; we had some purl and gin, and then we met the prosecutor; he asked us to have something to drink; we went to a public-house, and he called for a pint of rum; then he called for some water; we staid about ten minutes, it was then near six o'clock; we went away, and in St. Martin's-lane this young woman met a man she knew, and we went to have something to drink; then the prosecutor came in, and said, we had robbed him, and they took us to the watch-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to George Cording, a pawnbroker and silversmith, of Aldgate High Street. On 7th June, about half past 5 o'clock, the prisoner came, and asked to look at a gold chain, marked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was hanging in the window—I showed it to him, and he asked to look at another, marked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I turned my head to take it out of the window—it was only two or three feet from me, but I had to open the window—he said that he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said that 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the lowest—he agreed to give it, and left 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit, saying that he would come back and pay the money—he went out, and I then looked at the other chain, and saw that it had been changed—the chain that I found there was not part of my goods—it was lying on the counter; it was not there before the prisoner came—I ran out, and saw him running across the road—he ran through the butcher market, and I followed him—I called, "Stop thief!" and a policeman stopped him—he ran as fast as he could—I only lost sight of him for an instant.</p>

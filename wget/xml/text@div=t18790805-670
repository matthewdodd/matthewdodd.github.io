                  </hi>. I am a clerk, at 2, Picton Villas, Dart<lb></lb>mouth Park Hill, N.W.—about 12.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 9th July, I was near the Reservoir, Pentonville Road, and saw the prisoner and another man and woman standing near an archway—as I passed them the prisoner asked me the time—I took out my watch, which he immediately seized with one hand, and seized me by the throat with the other, and the other man also took hold of me—I struggled and called out, "Police!" and they pulled me down 4 or 5 yards to the archway, and a policeman came—this is my silver watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I saw it at the police-court, and it has part of the chain attached, which was broken at the bar—I also lost a bunch of keys, a knife, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money out of my trousers pocket—I felt a hand in the pocket while on the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been spending the evening at a friend's house—the other man was not standing with the prisoner, but out in the road—I was alone—there were houses on one side the street, and the reservoir on the other—it was a hazy night—the other man and woman escaped—the prisoner was close by—I was sober.</p>

On Wednesday, 9th July, about 1.25 a.m., while on duty in Myddelton Square, I was watching three persons, two men and a woman, near Claremont Mews, when the prosecutor came along—I ran across and heard the woman say, "Here comes a policeman"—the prisoner ran out of the mews, and I ran after him about 4 or 5 yards and caught him, when he threw the watch out of his hand on to the steps of No. 35, Claremont Square—I picked it up immediately—the prosecutor then came up and said, "That man has taken my watch"—the prisoner made no reply—the prosecutor was bleeding from the mouth.</p>

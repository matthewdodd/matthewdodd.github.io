               <p>Q. Had you a portmanteau left in your care, the property of your master. - A. Mr. Johnson left a portmanteau in my care until he returned. I received a letter from Mr. Johnson a week preceding the 5th of November, desiring me to send him down a black coat and waistcoat, a curricle coat, and a portmanteau, desiring that I would enclose the coat and waistcoat within the portmanteau. That I did, with intent to send them down to Mr. Johnson. The portmanteau I enclosed within the box-coat, and then enclosed that within brown paper. I gave it to our porter; it was to be taken to the George and Blue Boar, Holborn. Robert, our porter, left the house with it on the 5th of of November. The portmanteau was worth ten shillings, the great coat ten shillings, the black coat about ten shillings, and the waistcoat two shillings and sixpence.</p>

            , to take to the Stamford coach, at the George and Blue Boar, Holborn. When the parcel was given to me, we were a porter short. I hired the prisoner Oxley. I delivered to him the parcel that Crofts delivered to me, at five o'clock in the afternoon. I told him to take it to the George and Blue Boar, Holborn, to go by the Stamford coach. I gave him this book, and sixpence to pay for the booking. He was to return to me the next morning, deliver me the book, and I would satisfy him. In consequence of his not coming, I had suspicion I waited till ten o'clock the next morning. I went to the George and Blue Boar, made enquiry, they told me the parcel had not been delivered. I looked after the prisoner. I found him at the Ship, in Lime-street. I took him to the George and Blue Boar. I asked the bookkeeper whether the said parcel had been delivered there for the Stanford coach, in the name of Johnson? He said, no such parcel had been delivered. The prisoner had delivered to me the book, there was no entery of the parcel. He said he had delivered the parcel to another man to carry. The prisoner took me to different houses, at different parts of the town, under pretence of finding this man; no such man was to be found as he described. In consequence of that, I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q Have you ever found any of the contents of this portmanteau. - A. Yes, one black coat we found at the Ship public-house, Lime-street.</p>

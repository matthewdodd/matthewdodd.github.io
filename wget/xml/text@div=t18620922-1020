               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220137"></xptr>
               <p>I said, "Well, I am very short indeed of money; I really have not"—he said, "Oh! well, I will go down to his private residence, and see if he has gone"—about a couple of hours afterwards, he came back to me and said, "O dear, I find I was too late; can you lend me seventeen shillings"—I said, "I have not seventeen shillings," but I put a sovereign down on the table, which he took up and put in his pocket, saying, "I will return it either this evening or in the morning"—the next morning he called on me, and said, "I sent to my wife, but I have not got an answer; can you lend me another seven shillings?"—I said, "I told you yesterday I was very short of money, and I most certainly have it back to night, or in the morning I have not seven shillings;" but I had two five shilling pieces in my pocket; I held them out in my hand and said, "Have you got three shillings?"—he took them out of my hand, and put them in his pocket, saying, "You shall be certain to have this with the sovereign to-night or to<lb></lb>morrow morning"—the next morning he called on me and said, "I have not brought your money, but you shall certainly have it this evening; I will call about 6 o'clock, and leave it you"—I never saw him again until he was arrested—I gave him in charge—I had two policemen with me at the time—I put another advertisement in the paper, and called at the library where I had them addressed to me; amongst the answers was one from the prisoner; I knew the handwriting—I answered it in a feigned hand, and in another name, addressing it from a friend's house, 46, Dover-road—the prisoner answered it, appointing a time to see me at 2 o'clock on a Thursday—I had two detectives there ready, and they took him in custody—I advanced him the money because he had engaged with me as his servant at Wootton, in the Isle of Wight, and it was on no other conditions that I let him have it.</p>

I am about to enter upon possession of a small but highly respectable family hotel, in the Isle of Wight, and require a respectable woman that will take the entire superintendence of my housekeeping, and that I can trust with confidence in charge of my business, should I at any time be absent. Nothing menial is required; in return for which, if, after an interview, it is agreeable to both, I should not object to marry, and make</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that there being no such hotel in the Isle of Wight was evidence to negative them, and that the engagement of the several witnesses as housekeeper was a pretence with reference to an alleged existing fact, as well as the statement that he had wine which he wanted to send down there.</hi>

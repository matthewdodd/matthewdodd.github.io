                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, in the employ of Hamilton and John Megary, of Love-lane. The barge <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> belongs to them—I did not miss any coals on the 26th of February—I have seen some coals—it is impossible for any one to say that they are like my employers—they are the same colour—coals are black.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you tell the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told the Magistrate that the coals in the barge were Wyeland coals—I do not know whether these are Wyeland coals that are here—I only said that these were like them, from being black—I have been a lighterman since I was fourteen years of age, and you may load a barge with coals to-day and it may rain, and the next day you may not know the coals.</p>

At half-past six o'clock last Saturday evening, I saw the prisoner standing on the head room of coals in Mr. Megary's barge, the <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>—he stood there about five minutes—I saw him pick up a piece of coal and then come across the Trinity boats—I walked down the steps to meet him—he saw me and ran away—he had got 341bs. of coals.</p>

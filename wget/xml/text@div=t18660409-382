                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, at Kentish-buildings, Borough—on 5th February, the prisoner came to me—he looked at a great quantity of butter, value 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said it was difficult to get good butter, and that he was a ready-money customer, and wanted some good butter—I took him to the warehouse—he selected four casks and two boxes—he said he had been living at 43, Vere-street, Clare-market; that he was well known there, and had been there eleven years—after that I sold him the butter—I entered the goods as usual—he said that he would pay the carman when he brought them—I sent the carman the next day with the butter, and a stamp to bring back the cash—I did not know the prisoner's name was Bristow at that time—he gave his name as George Terrell—I believed he had been carrying on business for eleven years—if I had known that his name was George. Bristow I should not have sent the goods, as my opinion was that Bristow was a notorious swindler—I have a man living with me who knows him well—I have heard of George Bristow carrying on business as a coffee-house keeper in Duke-street—the fact of his carrying on business 11 years influenced me—if I had known George Bristow had opened a shop, I should have made some inquiries—some two or three days after that, some bacon was ordered—I sent it to the prisoner, and the man brought it back—I asked him why he had brought it back, and in consequence of what he said, I sent my foreman to the prisoner on Friday afternoon, immediately after the carman's return—I left the warehouse before my foreman came back—on Saturday morning, in consequence of what my foreman said, I went to the prisoner—when I first called I did not see the prisoner—I made some inquiries in the neighbourhood, and found he had only been there a few, weeks—I saw the prisoner the second time I called and asked him for the money for the goods I sent, or the goods—a friend was with me—he said, "Give back the goods, or you will get into trouble"—he said, "I have been in many troubles before, and I dare say I shall get out of this; but do your best and your worst"—he acknowledged to be Bristow because my friend recognised him—I</p>

               <p>went to Stone's End for his apprehension and the goods—I took a constable with me, and arrived there about 8 o'clock—I found the shop closed—when the door was opened, about half-past 10, I ran to it and put my foot in it, and got inside—I did not see him—a policeman searched the house, and finding he was not there, and seeing the butter on the shelf, I thought it belonged to me—I ordered a cab, and took it away.</p>

I bought it. I have been in worse scrapes than this; I have got over them, and I shall get over this"—I showed him the warrant, and took him into custody—on the way, he said that he had bought everything—he said something about the Bankruptcy Court—he put his hands in his pocket and produced a piece of paper—he said, "Can you read this?

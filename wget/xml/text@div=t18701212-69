On 1st December, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon I was in King William Street, City, with Lythell, another officer—I saw the two prisoners loitering about with another not in custody; they were talking to each other—I watched them, and saw them attempt to pick the pockets of three ladies in King William Street—McDonald put his hand into the pocket, but did not succeed in getting anything—Sawyer was close behind him, and the other man in front—they then went into</p>

               <p>Gracechurch Street, where McDonald put his hand into the prosecutrix's pocket, Sawyer being behind, and the other in front—he did not get any<lb></lb>thing—they then followed the lady down Fish Street Hill, into Lower Thames Street, and there the third man placed himself in front of her, and impeded her passage—McDonald put his left hand into her pocket—Sawyer was close behind—I saw McDonald draw a purse out of her pocket with his two fingers, and the instant he got it he dropped it on the ground by accident—Sawyer immediately picked it up—they then separated, and ran as hard as they could in different directions—I followed Sawyer about 200 or 300 yards—he was running all that distance, but I did not lose sight of him—I came up with him, and told him I should take him into custody for picking a lady's pocket—he made no answer, but struggled to get away—I took him to the station, and there the prisoners denied knowing each other—I believe the purse was passed by Sawyer to the third man, who escaped, but I did not see it after Sawyer picked it up—the other man was close to him at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 326, Kingsland Road—I was in King William Street on this day, between 3 and 4 o'clock—I felt nothing there—I went into Lower Thames Street, and a man endeavoured to prevent my passing—I attempted to go behind the man, and he pushed me up against a cart wheel—I succeeded in getting past him, and after I passed I felt in my pocket, and my purse was gone—it was safe when I went into Thames Street; I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—the detective spoke to me as I was turning back—I did not see the prisoners.</p>

I was with Randall on this day—I saw Miss Harris in Thames Street, and Sawyer close behind her, McDonald on her right, and a third man in front, pushing himself back so as to obstruct her—I saw McDonald put his left hand into her pocket, and as he drew it out he had something in his fingers, which immediately dropped—Sawyer stooped and picked it up, and I saw him pass it to the third man—by that time they were all pushing close together; there was rather a crowd—I took McDonald into custody, after a sharp chase, and brought him back, and then spoke to Miss Harris.</p>

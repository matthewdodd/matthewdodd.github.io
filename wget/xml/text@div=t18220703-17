I tried it again at two o'clock; it was safe, but I found some grease on the stones. I afterwards went to the watch-house, and found the prisoner in custody. I alarmed the family at four o'clock, the servants got up. Some victuals was dropped in the area.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 28th of May, a few minutes before two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Jermyn-street with a bundle; I asked what he had got; he said broken meat, which he had from the Old London Hotel; that his father was an artist, and had once been in good circumstances. I walked to the corner of St. James's-street with him, and he put down the bundle; a leveret fell out. Several people pressed me to let him go, and I did. I met a gentleman, and then returned and took him again; he had got nearly one hundred yards when I overtook him; he was offering a coachman 5 s. to take him to Fulham; the coachman wanted 10 s.; they parted. I took him to the watch-house. A few minutes before five o'clock the prosecutor's servants came to look at the bundle. There was a cup in it, which I produce. When I first saw him he was half a mile from Mr. Adair's.</p>

            . In 1813, I was clearing clerk to Messrs. Trueman and Co., and am so now; it is my duty to clear all goods at the East India warehouse, and pay the rent upon them. On the 21st of October, 1813, I cleared some cottons at the East India warehouse - I cleared one hundred bales which came by the Lord Castlereagh, fifty by the

            , and one hundred by the Union. I had known the prisoner for years before that. After a certain time there is a rent to be paid for goods before they are delivered. I receive a delivery warrant when the Company are paid, and when we want the goods, we write receipts on the warrants, and change them for others in the Company's possession - they are delivered to the warehouse-keeper. I went to the prisoner, who was clerk at the office in Austin-friars. I have a cheque in my hand for 523 l. 17 s, 1 d.; here is our cheque-book - it tallies with the margin. I had to pay a large sum at the East India House that day for these goods - this cheque was given to me. I took it to Messrs. Lubbock's, and fined by, looking at the warrants, that it was on the 21st of October, 1813. I cannot recollect going to Lubbock's, but I have no doubt of it; for it was my province alone. No other person was entrusted to clear East India cottons. My usual practice was to have a cheque which I received at Lubbock's, and from there went to the warehouse to pay the rent on the goods. I had had other transactions with the prisoner; the course was for him to write on the warrants</p>

               <p>"D - d," which means delivered, with his initials - these warrants are so marked, and have his initials. I have seen him write a thousand times. I paid him upon these warrants, 479 l. 13 s. 9 d., with the same money as I had from Lubbocks, for I had no other means of paying it. I had other money to pay in Jewry-street, which I paid also.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the practice as to your taking change - A. If the change exceeds 10 s. we generally take it with us; if not, they give us change. I must have paid him 479 l. 13 s. 9 d. for during the whole fifteen years I have been in this situation I never received a bale of cotton without the rent being paid previously.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At this distance of time you do not rely on your memory, but reason from circumstances - A. Yes; but as soon as the prisoner absented himself I was called upon to inform the Company what I had paid, and this sum was among it. I have sent my son to receive cottons, but did not on this occasion, for the receipts are in my writing. I have done business to the amount of thousands with the prisoner; my constant practice was to go to the banker's for the money. I never recollect paying money there which I had not received for a cheque, but it may have happened. I never paid any monies but to the East India Company, except petty cash, and I never change a 100 l. note for petty cash. The prisoner always received the money at the office.</p>

             READ. I was in the service of the East India Company, as chief clerk in the warehouse department. Mr. Stockwell was head warehouse-keeper, and Mr. Saunders, who is dead, was his assistant. Goodhall was also a chief clerk, but had a distinct branch of the business. The prisoner was employed in the office under me: it was his duty to receive money brought for warehouse rent. The warrants are brought by the merchants' clerks; the prisoner's duty was to receive them, search for the counterparts, see if they agreed, and then to receive the rent; it is necessary to calculate, to see if the merchant made it right, and then write a line on each counterpart, and place his initials at the end, as a guarantee to the Commodore to deliver the goods (looking at the warrants) - these all have the prisoner's writing on them, and his initials; it was his business to receive the money, and if he was at leisure, the very next moment, to enter certain items of it into a small book - this is the book he kept (looks at it) - it begins on the 25th of June, 1813, and ends on the 15th of October, 1814 - the entries on the 21st of October, 1813, are in his writing, and contain an account of warehouse rent received on Truemans' cottons; they may have been delivered on a subsequent day; there is a column for the rent due, the number of weeks, the amount, and the initials of the chief clerk; there is 378 l. 2 s. 6 d. entered as Truemans', in three different sums. I have examined the warrants with the entries; here are seven warrants included in the three entries, and three are entirely omitted, amounting to 101 l. 11 s. 3 d.; my initials, as chief clerk, are opposite the sums entered, by which I know that I received these sums from him, and no more, at that or any other time. I never received the 101 l. 11 s. 3 d. - I have looked through his book; there is no entry whatever of these three warrants, or of the rent being paid on them. I pay the money I receive over to Mr. Saunders's bankers, Martin and Co.; and did so on that day, with other sums, for other lots, amounting to 402 l. in all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner's duty given to him by the Company, or by the chief clerk - A. I cannot say - he accounted to me, and I accounted to Mr. Saunders, the deputy warehouse-keeper for it - he absconded on the 8th of December, 1814. I believe no discovery was made till that time; the warrants had been in a drawer all that time, and in his custody - he paid me only two other sums on that day - they were 7 l. 10 s. and 8 s. 6 d. - he brought me the warrants to compare with the entries.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had destroyed the warrants, would there be any trace left to find this out - A. By referring to the delivery book it would be discovered; those entries would be made by other clerks. I retired from the service in 1815, in consequence of ill health.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did you retire voluntarily - A. I was pensioned, on account of ill health (looking at four notes) - here is</p>
               <p>"Trueman and Co. 21-10" on every one of these, in the prisoner's hand-writing, and his initials. I believe he lived on Tower-hill.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer, and a commodore to the East India Company, and was so in 1813, and knew the prisoner very well in the service. I did not see him, from 1814, till the 16th of November last, when, in consequence of information, I went with a warrant to No. 25, Wapping-street, Commercial-road, about halfpast nine o'clock in the morning. I rapped at the door; Mrs. Mason came; I had some conversation with her, and went into the front parlour, then into the back; the prisoner was not there. I went down stairs, and found him washing himself, and said</p>
               <p>"Mason, you are my prisoner;" he said,</p>
               <p>"On what account?" I said</p>

               <p>"If that is the case, I shall have all the law they can give me." I had done my endeavours to find him since 1814, but never could hear of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did he live when in the Company's service - A. I cannot tell. I went to where I heard he had been, but could not find him - I went after him a dozen times, but had not looked for him for the last eight years. I got the warrant on the 15th of November. I found a letter in his house - I asked for it before it was given me, having been informed, eight days before, that he had received letters to escape to America. I never said I had seen him about the City-road.</p>

He then said he had misapplied some part of the Company's money, or had kept it back and not paid it in - I cannot recollect his exact words, but the substance was that he had made use of, or misapplied some part of the Company's money. I asked if he had the means of making up the deficiency - he said he could borrow it of a friend. I advised him to bring it, and pay it in on the following morning, or put it in his desk, that it might be there when asked for. I left him, understanding that he would attend, and he did, on the following morning; some money transactions took place between him and the chief clerk, and I thought from that that it was settled, as he said no more to me - but on the following day he left the office quite.</p>

               <p>This letter was here read; it was dated Ostend, January 17, 1815, and was addressed by the prisoner to his wife, giving her an account of his going from different parts of the Continent, to avoid persons who he suspected to be in pursuit of him, and stating his intention to go to America.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. For the last eight years the Company have known where to find me; and the officer who took me, told me that he saw me daily, as he lived within two doors of me in the City-road. I was never from home two nights for the last eight years and a half. I had received information that I should be apprehended, and could have avoided it if I chose. My friends had waited on the warehouse-keeper, who seemed satisfied there must be a misunderstanding somewhere.</p>
               <p>Several witnesses, who appeared to the prisoner's character, stated that he had lived in Fountain-place, City-road, for the last eight years, and went about publicly and undisguised.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 59.</p>

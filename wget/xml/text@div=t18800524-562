                  </hi>. I am a grocer at Forest Hill, Sydenham—on Saturday, 27th March, the prisoner brought this cheque to my shop and asked me to change it—I said I did not like changing cheques of this kind, but I thought he might have a friend in the place who would do so—he went away for some time, but came back again and said his friend was out——he said his friend was a wholesale dealer—he mentioned Mr. Parker—I said "I do not like it"—he said "All right, let me have 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, and you will have time to put it through the bank"—I put it through the bank, it was returned "No account"—this is the endorsement which the prisoner made—I went to the address which the prisoner gave me, and found he had removed, and the furniture was all gone—I recognised the prisoner at the police-court—I took the cheque believing it was genuine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You did not ask me to lend the 30s—you had not dealt at my shop for twelve months—I did not say at the police-station it was a pity you did not ask me to lend it, I said I would rather have given you the money than that you should have taken, me in—there was an account at the London and South Western Bank two years ago in the name of Parker—I did not know you were pressed for money, had been laid up, that you had been engaged in election business, nor that you were respectable—I marked the cheque in your presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief cashier at the London and South Western Bank, Holloway—I do not know the prisoner—an account was opened at our bank on 21st February, 1878, in the name of George Parker—it was closed on 17th April by an overdraft—one or two cheques have been refused since.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 275). On the 10th April I saw the prisoner about 3 p.m. in Great Dover Street, Borough—I stopped him and said "Is your name Edwards?"—he said "l Yes"—I said "Have you been living at Forest Hill?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I shall take you into custody for fraudulently presenting a cheque and getting 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took him back to Sydenham—when the charge was read over to him he said to Mr. Hilder "I do not want to put you to any trouble, I wrote the whole of that cheque, I have had an account at the bank."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My name is not Edwards, but Parker. I used that name as a blind, because I had been separated from my wife. I believed I had a balance to meet that cheque. I had not used the bank for two years. I have suffered from rheumatic gout and hardly attended to business. My impression was that Hilder lent me the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had no in<lb></lb>tention to defraud him. I left Forest Hill because I had had notice to quit, which had expired. I was at work, and could not appear to time. I have been two months in custody, and have suffered enough.</p>

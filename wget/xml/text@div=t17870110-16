               <p>Court. Now, from your seeing him a single minute, and in the confusion you was in, can you take upon you to say he is the man? - I have not a doubt but he is the man; I lay on my back all the time, and there were three lamps so near, I could not be mistaken.</p>
               <p>But I understood you that some part of this single minute he had his back to your face? - Yes, his face was to me at first, then he turned his back, and then his face again; there was a shilling found upon him, a very bad shilling, a crooked one, which I think is mine, but I do not swear positively to it, because one bad shilling may be like another.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - In Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>What business? - I was in the tea trade; I left off business about two months past.</p>
               <p>I presume you was sober at the time? - As sober as I am now.</p>

               <p>Last Saturday was a week I had information of this man; I went and found him; on searching him I found this shilling upon him; the prisoner told me he sold this watch for a guinea to one Thompson, a buckle maker, that lives in a court in the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him, that it would be better for him to confess? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you threaten him? - No; he told me after he was examined, at the public house.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing of this before the Magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>(The shilling produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at that shilling? - It is the same shilling I saw at the Rotation-office, which I think is mine; it is like the shilling I had in my pocket five or six months; I cannot swear positively to it; I went to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street, and at Bow-street, and at Justice Walker's, and described the man, and took a great deal of pains, because I thought I should know the man again.</p>

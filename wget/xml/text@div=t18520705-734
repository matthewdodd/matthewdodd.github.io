                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. John Warne Cathie, who keeps the Salmon and Ball, at Bethnal-green. On the 15th June, I closed the house at 12 or a quarter past 12 o'clock at night, it was all fastened—I was called in the morning by the policeman, about five minutes past 4, I slept up stairs—I went down, and found everything in confusion in the bar—the side door was partly open, but nearly shut-to—I had shut and bolted that door on the over night, anybody inside could undo it—I found in the bar some cigars, they had been turned out of the boxes in which they had been kept, hut not taken away—the cupboard had been broken open, and about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper money was missing—it was in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paper packets, some of it was in newspapers, some in brown paper, and two or three were in blue paper that some stationery had come to the house in—I saw a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, found in the bar—we lost some forks and spoons, which I believe were plated.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 431). On the morning of 16th June, I met the prisoner in Charles-street, Waterloo-town, about a quarter past 4 o'clock—that is in the parish of Bethnal-green—I met two men about 100 yards in front of her, she had a bundle of coppers with her—I stopped her, and took the bundle from her—I asked her what it was, she did not tell me, she tried all she could to get away, and she did get away—I found the bundle contained 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of penny pieces and these papers—two of them the last witness can swear to.</p>

               <p>it took about half a dozen men to take her to the station—she was not kicked at all, when she was at the station she complained of being kicked, but I saw nothing of the kind—she told the Magistrate something about a man in a flannel jacket—one of the men that I met before her had a corduroy jacket, and the other a black coat.</p>

I am the wife of the prosecutor—I missed half a dozen desert forks, and half a dozen dinner forks, three table spoons, and ten tea spoons, they were white metal, and were my husband's property—I missed this piece of Orleans cloth in which the money was wrapped, which the policeman took from the prisoner—I had purchased it a week before—I know it by its appearance, and it is a very unusual length, 7-eighths of a yard, a quantity that is very seldom used—I am sure it is the same piece, and I had noticed the edge of it in particular, the man offered me a piece with two braids at the edge, but I chose this with one braid—I had this piece safe the night before the robbery—there were two pieces of tape in the parcel which were thrown on the floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). I have now been married fourteen months, and during that time I received great cruelty from my husband; about seven weeks ago, he left me, after he had dreadfully ill-used me, and I have not seen him since, until the night that I was taken; a young woman coming from the theatre in Whitechapel, came and told me that she had seen him in the night houses—before knowing that I was in search of him; I was searching each night house until it was broad daylight, when a man came up to me dressed in a flannel jacket, and told me he would be thankful to me if I would accompany him to the Cambridge-road, for his brother was a sailor, and he had received his money two days before, and he had received a part of it in coppers; he told me his mother lived in Pitt-street, Bethnal-green-road, and his brother had gone to fetch them; and he told me to stand round the corner of a public house, which fell back in a great hollow; when the policeman came round, and saw me standing, he looked very hard at me; it was about ten minutes before the man returned; he came up to me with a bundle, and asked me if I would carry it to the coffee shop in Back-church-lane, Whitechapel; I was going along towards that way, when the policemen overtook me, and told me to walk on before them; I heard some one walking sharp after me, which I thought was the man, but instead of that it was the policeman; when he came up to me, I held the bundle openly; he did not stop to ask me what I had got, but he took it away from roe, and said he was all right now, and I must go to the station with him; I then ran towards the corner of the street, to see if I could see the man who gave it me, and another policeman was standing at the corner; and</p>

               <p>before I could get to see if the man was coming, the policeman pulled me back, and threw me down, and kicked me in my stomach twice; and I am heavy with child; it made me so bad that I could not then tell them where the man was, but as soon as I could I told them that a man in a flannel jacket gave it to me; they gave the alarm, and no less than seven policemen came round me; they told me to walk, but being in such pain I could not do so, when they began dragging me along by my arms and the hair of my head; I was so bad when I got to the station, that the inspector very kindly sent for a medical man; he sent me a bottle of stuff, which very much relieved me of the pain I was suffering; the Magistrate was very kind in letting me have everything for my ease; they dreadfully tore ray clothet, but I have changed my dress; I have kept my shawl, but my dress was so covered with mud, with their dragging me along; I was in deep distress, my husband leaving me, or I would not have taken the bundle, but the man promised to reward me.</p>

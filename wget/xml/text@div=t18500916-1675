                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Guy's Hospital. On 4th Sept., about ten minutes past nine o'clock in the morning, I was called to see the deceased at No. 5, New-alley, White-street—I found her dying—I examined her body after death—I found a bruise under the right eye, and immediately within the private parts I found a laceration of the skin, where a large quantity of blood had collected—the skin had given way to the extent of one inch, and immediately under the skin a large vein was torn, the pressure of the blood which poured from that vein had broken the skin.—the rupture of that vein was the cause of death—she was in a state of pregnancy; I should say between the seventh and eighth month—the rupture of the vein might have occurred either from external violence, such as falling against any sharp object, or a blow or kick, or it might have occurred during a violent struggle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Felix Sweeney, and live in New-alley, Southwark. I knew the deceased, Catherine Collins, she lived at No. 5, in the same court opposite me—on Wednesday morning, 4th Sept., about half-past eight o'clock, I heard a noise, and Mrs. Collins screaming—I went over to her room, and found her dressed and lying on her left side on the floor—she was screaming when I got there—the prisoner had hold of her gown with his left hand, and said, "Let me have the money"—I said, "Mr. Collins, mind, don't hurt your wife"—he said, "I want some money of her"—I said, "Well, Mrs. Collins, in the name of God, give him the money"—she</p>

               <p>said, "Yes,<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> Collins, I will give you the money"—I set her upon the chair, and she threw herself across my breast, and kneeling down said, "Mrs. Sweeney, my baby is coming into the world"—I knew she was in the family way—this was not her first child, she has three living—I then said to the prisoner, "Leave the room, Mr. Collins"—he said, "What does my wife say?"—I said, "Your wife is in labour, leave the room," and accordingly he did—I called another female on the same floor, Mrs. Corston; she is not here—I asked her to examine the deceased, which she did, and it appeared to me as if the baby was coming into the world—the large swelling deceived me—I went and fetched Mr. Morgan—when she threw herself across me, her face looked quite dark—she said she had a black eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband in the room adjoining the prisoner's. On Tuesday evening, 3rd Sept., I saw the deceased about seven o'clock—she then appeared in very good health and spirits—she had no black eye then, she was large in the family way—between three and four that morn<lb></lb>ing, I was disturbed by hearing a very great noise and screaming in collins's room—I heard Mrs. Collins screaming very loud indeed, and saying, "Oh, don't Collins!"—he wished for some money—the little girl screamed very much indeed, and said, "Oh, father, don't beat my mother"—I heard some<lb></lb>thing very heavy fall, it might have been a chair or table, I cannot say what it was—I heard her scream directly after the fall—the little girl said, "Oh, father, don't"—he said, "Give me the money"—the deceased said, "I have no money"—I was disturbed again about six by the same noise and scream<lb></lb>ing; the child screamed very much indeed, and made use of the same expres<lb></lb>sions—she screamed murder, and not to hurt her mother—I was disturbed again between eight and nine, by quarrelling and screaming.</p>

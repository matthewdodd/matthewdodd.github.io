               <p>I let a lodging to the prisoner at three and six-pence a week; he was with me a month; he began another week, but left me in the middle of it without any notice. His long absence created a suspicion, the prisoner had put a padlock upon his room, which he did every day, and the key hole was filled up with paper. I took out the paper and looked into the room and missed the sender. I told my suspicions to a person in the house, who said he thought it was proper to break the door open. I had it opened and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.)</p>

               <p>I am a broker. The prisoner applied to me to take these things out of pawn. I agreed to take them out; he said they were his own property. I advanced him three pounds odd money upon them: all the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of pawn by me, except two pillow cases and the brass candlesticks.</p>

               <p>[There were some of them produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Kirby; I know the prisoner, in February 1787, he and another were tried here for stealing a boat and convicted, and sentenced for transportation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150038"></xptr>for seven years; I was present when he received the sentence; I believe it was where his majesty should appoint; but I cannot be certain to that there; he was at the Hulks at Woolwich a short time after he was convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was put on board a ship? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he escaped from? - I do not from my own knowledge.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. I had been seven months in Newgate before I went away; I staid three years and one month at Woolwich; I thought it very hard to be a slave in my own country, working morning, noon, and night. One morning a boatswain's mate and another, said to me, will you go away, here is a boat loose; I said, I did not care, I would as soon die as live; we all three went down and rowed away with the boat; I went away directly and entered on board his majesty's ship, the Eagle Frigate; I escaped from the hulk called the Stainslaus; the door was left open on the deck, were we go through to go down the gang way; we made our escape, and I went down to Sheerness, to the Eagle Frigate, a 36 gun ship. As soon as I was paid off from there, I went on board his majesty's Speedy Frigate, and had the Yarmouth station to keep out of the way; I went from thence directly to France, where I staid till these distresses happened, when I was obliged to come to England, and that was the way I was taken. If I knew where the captain lived, I know I could get a good character; I took two prizes while I was on board the Speedy Frigate. I was obliged to come to England, or else I never should. No body has been me ever since I have been away.</p>

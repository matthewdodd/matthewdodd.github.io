            . On the 9th of April, I was going down Shoreditch, I went down Swan-yard; it is a public thoroughfare, in Swan-yard, four men came by, and the prisoner run up against me, he was one of the four, whether they run against me accidently, or by design, I cannot say; as I was going up <placeName id="t18150510-7-crimeloc41">Slaughter-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were more persons about you besides the prisoner - A. I did not see them; while I was down, I saw nobody about.</p>

I was walking up Swan-yard, in company with Butler, he is a tin-plate worker; he was knocked down in Swan-yard; it goes from Shoreditch into Brick-lane, it is a common thoroughfare.

We went on till we came to the corner of Wheeler-street; there the man ran against him, as if he was going to throw him with both hands; Butler says, halloo, my friend, what are you at; I did not see any thing in the man's hands. I am not certain whether it was the prisoner or not. I thought the man's determination was to rob Butler; I saw three more rush forward on Butler, with dark great coats on; I saw that by the light of the lamp. Butler immediately hallooed out murder; I ran, and made an alarm myself; I went back again to the place where I left Butler; I found Butler with his coat all over mud, standing up, and from the violent blow he had received, his nose bled very much.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any other person to notice them, but that one that ran against Butler - A. No. The three others past by us first, and presently after, the same three came back again, they had dark great coats on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip Lewin Samuel, of West Brom<lb></lb>wich, in Staffordshire, a tailor and draper. On 27th Aug., about 2 o'clock, I was in High-street, Whitechapel—George-yard is a passage leading from High-street—I was crossing the end of George-yard, and saw the prisoner and two other persons standing at the entrance of the yard—as I was cross<lb></lb>ing, the prisoner snatched my gold chain, which was round my brooch, and pulled my brooch open—a miniature of my husband, in a large gold locket, was attached to the chain, two pencil cases, and two lockets—there was no watch—the miniature was in my watch pocket—he succeeded in getting my chain—I did not think at the moment that he had got my miniature, the act was so very quick—I turned at that moment, and tried to tear the chain from him—I caught it, but he wrenched it from me, and went off down George-yard, and the two others went with him—they ran as fast as they could—I saw the prisoner's face when I turned round—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man—I could not exactly say how he was dressed—I know he had not the same jacket on that he has now—I gave a description of him as soon as the policeman came up, which was not above ten minutes afterwards—I told him what had happened—I saw the prisoner the next afternoon at the police station, in Leman-street—he was alone—nothing passed—I merely looked at him, and said that he was the man—the inspector said he had got a man—the value of the articles taken from me is about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, who keeps a coffee shop at No. 96, Whitechapel. On 27th Aug., about 2 o'clock, I was crossing George-yard—I saw Mrs. Samuels and the prisoner, and two other men were stand<lb></lb>ing at the end of George-yard—the prisoner ran up to Mrs. Samuels, and snatched her chain, and ran away down George-yard, and the other two men ran with him—the prisoner was not dressed then as he is now—I believe he had a dark coat on—I am sure he is the man.</p>

About 2 o'clock, on 27th Aug., I was on duty in High-street, Whitechapel—I was called to George-yard and saw the prosecutrix—she complained of being robbed, and gave a description of the man, and I took the prisoner about 11 o'clock next morning—I told him what he was charged with, he made no reply—when he got near the station I door he asked me again what he was charged with—I told him again, and I he said, "Very well, I will go with you "—I know that he frequents George-yard—I have seen him there for nine or twelve months, and I found him there—he lodges two streets from there, in a lodging house.</p>

I missed some of them the beginning of last month; the pit is in a field near our garden - the field has a hedge and is about twenty yards from the road - the prisoner buys and sells vegetables - he keeps a horse and cart. I told Mr. Gunner that I missed the potatoes on Friday, the 12th of November - we went to the pit; there might have been half a dozen sacks taken or more - we traced the foot-marks of three persons from the potatoe pit over the hedge; and towards the road we found some tracks of a cart wheel - we followed the tracks, and they led us to Twickenham Common, and right into the prisoner's yard - we found his cart there - we could not discern any footsteps along the road by the side of the cart; this was about eight o'clock in the morning - we got a search-warrant; and about nine o'clock my master, I, and the constable, went with the warrant - the prisoner was at home. I saw the potatoes found in a little place adjoining the stable; there were twenty-six bushels; he said, he had bought them. I thought they were master's. I believe them to be his; there was some straw about them loose, and some whips of straw; there had been some whisps of straw with master's potatoes, which had been put in the holes of the sacks, and had fallen into the pit - we found some pieces of string, which I am certain had been used to tie Mr. Gunner's sacks. I had not observed any pieces of string in the pit before. I had ordered the man to cut the string in the evening when it was dark, and I did not see any in the pit; the cart wheel had what is called a cut-tire; the width of the rut in the road agreed with that which the wheel would have made; we found breaks in the rut, which the cuts in the tire would have made; they measured two feet seven inches. I am satisfied it was the same cart which had been on the road; there was a place which showed where it had turned on the road, near the potatoe pit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is this the high road leading from Teddington to Twickenham? A. Yes; there are a good many carts on that road. I did not go beyond his house to trace any further - I did not go into the premises till we had got the search-warrant: the cart was traced up to his gate, which is close to the road; we saw the cart at eight o'clock, but did not get the warrant till nine. The tire of the wheel is not broken, but is in different pieces, such as most old carts have - the wheels of old carts are mostly of the same breadth; there was not any mark which showed that the tire had been broken, that I know of - oat straw is generally used with potatoes; these potatoes were champions, which is a very common sort. I have known him some time as living at that house, and know a man of the name of Love, who works for him.</p>
               <p>WM. GUNNER. I am a farmer and live at Teddington. The business is carried on for the joint benefit of my brother Richard and myself; he is underage; the property belongs to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020028"></xptr>us. These potatoes were in a pit, with some straw; they had been shot out of sacks - the sacks were not tied when I saw them. There were seventy or eighty sacks of them in the pit. Carpenter came to me - I went with him, and we traced some footsteps over my own field, and two others, about 2 or 300 hundred yards to the road; they appeared to be the steps of three persons, and in the road we saw the track of a cart, very plain - there had been much rain in the night, and there were no other marks so early in the morning. The cart had come from Twickenham to our premises, turned round, and then led us to the prisoner's premises. In his shed there were two carts, but the one which had been used was the outside one; I examined the tire of the wheel, and compared it with the marks in the road; it corresponded so exactly that I believe it to be the same; the tire was quite wet, and bright; if it had been all night without going out it would have been rusty. We got a search-warrant, and went to his house; I described the potatoes to the constable before I saw them. I have not the least doubt that they are mine. I found among them some oat straw, and some string; the pit is under a walnut tree, and we found some walnut leaves among them; these circumstances make me more certain about them; there were some whisps of straw, such as had been put in holes in the sacks. He said he bought them between five and six o'clock on the evening before, of a man, coming across the common, with a cart - that he called to him, "Mate, what have you got there?" he said potatoes; the prisoner said he would buy them if he could, and he bought them at 5 s. 3 d. a sack. I said if he could produce the man he bought them of I should be satisfied; he said he did not know where he came from, nor who he was - that he had a lad who helped him to unload them. I had been at my potatoe pit on the evening before, after four o'clock; it would have taken three persons more than an hour to have got that quantity of potatoes out, and taken them to his house. The road is very public. We were selling those potatoes at 7 s. a sack at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your father living? A. No. I am one of the executors under his will; my brother, Richard, is thirteen years of age. My mother is executrix - she and Richard live at home with me. We growed the potatoes. I carry on the business, for the benefit of myself and Richard. The potatoes have a remarkable thin smooth skin; they are not champions that I know of: but I do not pretend to know the different sorts; they may be called champions, but I should not call them so. I think they are a little more round. Carpenter has been in the habit of growing potatoes some time - he knows them pretty well.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Gunner. I live in the field. I had worked till dark the evening before the potatoes were stolen; I left work at five o'clock - they were all safe then. My cottage is twenty or thirty yards from the pit: three men could not have come into the field, before five o'clock, without my seeing them; there were some whisps of straw among the potatoes in the pit, which had been put in the holes of the sacks; these strings are some that I had given out of my pocket, because they had not got enough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the potatoes belong to the ground? A. Yes; the ground is Mr. Gunner's - the potatoes had been put into the pit on the 11th of November, in the evening, near five o'clock; they are early champions - they are like my master's.</p>

I went with Mr. Gunner to his premises, with the search-warrant. I saw the cart, and measured the tire with a rule; it quite satisfied me that it was the cart which had been on the road. I brought away the potatoes - there were six sacks of them. I have brought two samples of potatoes - one taken from Mr. Gunner's pit, and the other from the prisoner's shed.

            . I am a watchman of Twickenham - my beat is at a place called Cross Deck. I know where the prisoner lives, and the field where the potatoes were stolen from; my beat is half a mile from it. About two o'clock in the morning I saw a horse and cart, and a man, going towards Mr. Gunner's farm. - I spoke to him, but did not know him; he did not answer. The horse was a black one, and the man had a straw hat on. I saw it but once. I had seen the prisoner many times before, and have seen him wear a straw hat - his horse is black.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him in the course of the week? A. Yes; he sometimes wore a straw hat, and sometimes a black one; it was quite moonlight. I could tell a black horse from a dark brown one, and I could have seen his feet if I had noticed them.</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's employ for about 3 weeks, but not at the time he was taken up - I was then at the house of Mr. Harris. The prisoner got me to mind his business while he was away; I helped him on the day before, at Twickenham common, between five and six o'clock in the evening, to unload some potatoes - I do not know the man he had them of, but he was coming along with them, and I was standing by Harris's corner, and Mr. Master's said, "What are you loaded with;" he said, "Potatoes: I am going to take them to town, to try to sell them;" the prisoner said, "What do you want a sack for them?" he said 6 s. The prisoner said, "That is as much as I sell them for." The man then said, "I will let you have them for 5 s. 3 d., as it is a wet night." Masters asked me to go and help unload them, that they might get them in as soon as possible, being a wet night - the man had some sacks, and some oat straw over the top of them; they were put into Master's little shed, next to his stable. The man said there were twenty-four bushels, and the prisoner gave him two sovereigns and two shillings for them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where do you live? A. At Twickenham Common. I work in gardens, or do any thing I can get to do. I worked about a year and a half for Lord Waldegrave. I left there about two months ago - he lives at Strawberry-hill; my father is a gardener at Lord Waldegrave's. I was at Mr. Harris's, having a little beer with my brother. Masters had not been there, but while I was standing at the corner, he called to me - his house is about a hundred yards from there. I know where old Mr. Brown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020029"></xptr>lives, but I do not know the potatoe pit; the man had a long frock on; and a straw hat, with a white ribbon, or some ribbon round it. I did not notice his neckcloth - he was a middle aged man, and did not say where he came from. I was on the top of the cart, and took off the straw - it took us about a quarter of an hour to unload them; there were eight sacks; the man, the prisoner, his wife and myself unloaded them - there were three carts in Masters's shed, but the cart the potatoes were in, stood outside. I slept with my brother, at my father's house. I went to bed between nine and ten o'clock; the prisoner's horse is a black one, with a bit of white round one hoof. I go with his cart every day - his name is on it. I was at work next day in a garden, and Mr. Simmonds and Mr. Gunner fetched me. I have seen the prisoner at Clerkenwell - he never sent me to look for the man he bought the potatoes of. I should know him if I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Why did you leave Lord Waldegrave? A. Because he went to France. I had been at Mr. Harris's all that afternoon; the cart was about six yards from the corner, so that I could hear every thing that passed - my brother was inside the house - the prisoner deals in potatoes, and it is very common for him to buy them in this way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the cart driven to? A. To the prisoner's stable door - it was unloaded within a yard of the shed where they were deposited. I have never been desired by the prisoner, or his wife, to look after the man he bought them of. I told them I should know him again. Mrs. Masters gave the money to Mr. Masters, and he gave it to the man - the cart went into Masters's yard. I had not been there that afternoon; the cart went a short distance down a road opposite Harris's, and then returned: it was a great deal larger than Mr. Masters's. I did not notice the tires of the wheels when it had delivered its load, it went back again - it came in a contrary direction to Mr. Gunner's.</p>

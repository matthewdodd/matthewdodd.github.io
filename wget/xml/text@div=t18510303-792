                  </hi>. I am a tea-dealer, of Somers'-terrace, Wal<lb></lb>worth-road. On Sunday morning, 12th Jan., between one and two o'clock I was returning home with my son who is nine years old—we went down West-street which leads from Walworth-road into Lorimer-place—I heard two men walking rapidly behind me—I crossed out of West-street, across</p>

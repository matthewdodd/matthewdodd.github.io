"—he said, "I have been fighting with a man this morning, and I have since heard that he is dead; I stood the same chance as him, and I am very sorry for it"—I then went to St. Mary's Hospital and found that the man was dead—on the 22nd, Rubridge was brought in by sergeant Beckley for violently assaulting another man—I said to him, "I have been looking for you, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For being a second to one of those fighting this morning, and the man is dead"—he said, "I was a second to the deceased, and I meant to give myself up after the Coroner's inquest."</p>

On the morning of 21st Oct., I was on duty in the Harrow Road, and saw a crowd of persons going from Paddington towards the Harrow fields—I followed them—I noticed Groundwell and Hodgkins, the deceased, in the field; they stripped off all their clothes except a pair of drawers—I spoke to several as they were going down, and begged them not to go fighting—I saw them begin to fight, and I saw them both fall to the ground—I then went and got the assistance of three more constables—When I returned I saw the deceased fall the last time, as I entered the field—I Was not near enough to see what caused the fall—we went to the spot and found that he was insensible—with the assistance of the constables and his brother, we got him to the road and got a conveyance to St. Mary's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 28, Exeter Street, Lisson Grove. On 21st Oct, there was a contest between Groundwell and the deceased—Rubridge was there, he did not act as second to the deceased more than any of the other friends who were there—as the men fell they were assisted up by their friends—I saw Rubridge lift the deceased up once or twice—I saw Ground<lb></lb>well at last give the deceased a blow, and he staggered and fell inspectable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you saw blows exchanged? A Yes, many, they were knocking one another about—I do not know who gave the challenge—I knew the deceased well, he worked in my employ off and on—when he was in liquor he was rather irritable, and would as soon strike a man as look at him—I have known him fight before—he was very drunk, indeed, the night before this—I saw one draught of brandy given to him daring the fight, only about a table spoonful, there was no more to give him, he had drank it before he got to the ground, he seemed to be intoxicated when he was fighting, he could not stand firmly on his legs, he was staggering about—he was very anxious to continue the fight, he had considerably the best of it up to the last moment—I do not think they were both drunk—the fight lasted about an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital. On 21st Oct., when Hodgkins was brought there, he was in a perfect state of insensibility, he died in two or three hours—I was present at a part of <hi rend="italic">the post mortem</hi>, examination—I believe the cause of death to have been a blow—the remote cause was effusion of blood into the cavity of the skull, thereby compressing the brain; the immediate cause I believe to have been a blow whilst in a state of intoxication, the vessels thereby being in a fall or congested state.</p>
               <p>Gross-examined. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A fall might do it, might it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—there were no evident marks of a blow at the time he was brought in, merely a slight cut on one lip and a little swelling, of the right, eye lid—those could not have caused the injury; it might Have been a fall.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice any contusions afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; after death contusions appeared on several parts of the head and on the jaw, and there was a very slight mark under the left ear—the man lived so short a time that there was scarcely sufficient time for black marks to be noticed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you connect the effusion with the mark of any blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no reason to suppose that effusion into a particular part of the skull must be caused by a blow upon any one part; the cause of the effusion would probably be the concussion, not the direct consequence of the blow; a simple fall on level ground might have produced it, in the congested state of the vessels from intoxication.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital On 21st Oct. I made the post mortem examination—the cause of death was extravasation of blood, under the left hemisphere of the brain, the excite<lb></lb>ment of drink, and opium being the pre-disposing cause, the blow—being the immediately exciting causer-the left eye was very much bruised; there was effusion of blood into the lids, the skin over the left temple was vary much</p>

               <p>bruised, also beneath the temporal muscle, and there was extravasated blood there—it is impossible to say whether a blow on the head would be likely to produce the effusion I saw—I do not know the force of the blow given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might a fall have caused it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it would quite depend upon what he fell on—I believe he had taken a good deal of drink—I heard he had had opium—I did not use the stomach pump, but it was used by Mr. Rogers; that would not be injurious if there was a quantity of drink in the stomach—a fall would be more likely to produce the injury if the man was intoxicated—a blow on the jaw might produce the effusion, but I think not without a fall.</p>

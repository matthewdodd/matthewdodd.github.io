I immediately went and gave information at the office, the next day the officers had taken five men out of that passage and the neighbourhood; I went to look at them, and immediately fixed on Daltry. On the Monday following the prisoner, Rule, was taken; I immediately picked him out from seven others - He was not there the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you - A. Not a minute; I saw them for about six yards as they came up - They met me-there was a strong gas light from a butcher's shop, which shone very bright on them. I described Daltry immediately; and the next morning I described Rule, I was more collected in my mind then; I had a better opportunity of observing Daltry than the other - I positively swear to him, but I hesitate about Rule.</p>
               <p>DALTRY. Q. Are you sure I am the man - A. I am.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I took Daltry in Black Lion-yard, in a house, up two pair of stairs, with a girl. I took him from the description that I received of him at the office. As soon as the prosecutor came into the office he pointed him out from five others-it was on the Monday.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I took Rule into custody, on Thursday the 16th of October, at the Black Horse, George-street, Spitalfields. I was present on the Monday, when the prosecutor pointed him out.</p>

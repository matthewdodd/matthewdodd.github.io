               <p>I live at Westminster, as I was going home disguised in liquor, I was picked up by Dun and Gardener at the Horse-Guards; they took me into their room and locked the door; and both got about me to persuade me to stay all night; they asked me what I had got for them; I said but one shilling in the whole; they insisted upon having that; and drew my watch out of my pocket before I had time to give it them; then they went to the window, threw up the sash, and called out to a man whose name was Biddle, and said, you may come up we are ready; he came up, they let him in; the first words he said was, d - n you, you rogue, what do you do with my two wives; that man was taken up and bailed for an assault in striking me; when he had beat me as long as he pleased, he ran down stairs, and I ran to the window to call the watch; I then asked the two girls whether he had got the watch or they had got it; they said he had got it; I ran down stairs to call the watch; I lost him in the street; I went to the watch-house and he was afterwards brought there by a gentleman; I got a constable in the morning and took him up; he confessed being with the girls over-night. I never got my watch again, it was a silver watch with a landscape on the face, and the initials of my name were engraven on the back of the case in a cypher; the maker's name is Dunstaff, at Newborough, Leicestershire.</p>
               <p>Did you stay with them all night? - No; I did not stay ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Dunn and I were coming along together; the prosecutor asked if he should go home with us, we said yes; he said he had but one shilling; when we came home we said it was too little; he said he would leave his watch for five shillings and fetch it next day; and he gave me the watch.</p>
               <p>DUNN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He had but one shilling; he said he would leave us his watch for five shillings; and when he brought the money he should have the watch; he went to bed two hours, and then got up and demanded his watch; we did not choose to let him have it without the money.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I took them up on the morning of the 16th of June.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing to you about your pledging the watch for five shillings? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you let them have the watch for five shillings or any other sum? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed for two hours? - No; in the morning they handed my watch about, and

               <p>Did the two women give the same account then as they do now? - No; to the best of my recollection they said the man picked them up at Whitehall; that they took him home, but denied knowing any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150047"></xptr> thing of the watch; the soldier (Waitcroft) said he had taken the watch, and hid it under some stones, but thought some person had seen him; for when he went to look for it, it could not be found; the prosecutor has told your lordship the same story he told me.</p>
               <p>That Waitcroft had hid it for them? - Yes; he said so.</p>
               <p>You are certain that the women denied knowing any thing of the watch? - Once they denied it; and then they said they handed it about from one to the other.</p>

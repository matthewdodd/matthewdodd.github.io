            . I am a labourer. On Wednesday, the 30th of July, I was mowing in a field with the prisoner and his brother - we finished about seven o'clock in the evening. The prisoner said to his brother,</p>
               <p>"B - r your eyes, you told master I could not mow more than an old woman;" he swore a great many oaths, and said,</p>
               <p>"You know I can mow your legs off" - William said,</p>
               <p>"You know you can't mow, and can't keep up in company;" the prisoner swore if he did not get out of his way, he would break his scythe in pieces - they both had their scythes in their hands at the time; the prisoner chopped at his brother's scythe two or three times with his own scythe, and at the third or fourth stroke he missed the scythe in consequence of his brother dropping his down, and stuck his brother in the side - his brother dropped his scythe, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am ruined for ever," and walked out of the field directly, and went up stairs into a house. The prisoner kept on chopping the ground and the grass up, and said nothing; he stopped there. He seemed a little fresh, but not much in liquor. I went up stairs to see William - he died on the Friday morning at one o'clock. He struck at him three or four times; William never struck him. The prisoner stuck his scythe into a tree before he said anything to his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he strike the tree for - A. He seemed in a passion; we had been mowing together during the afternoon - there had been a heavy shower; his brother and him went in doors, and after they came out he used these expressions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When a man says,</p>
               <p>"I can mow your legs off," does not it mean, I can mow so fast that you cannot mow quick enough to get out of my way - A. Yes, that is the meaning of it. He said,</p>
               <p>"I can mow your legs off;" his brother said,</p>
               <p>"No you can't, you can't keep up in company." I had only known them a fortnight, and never heard them quarrel before.</p>
               <p>Q. When the blow which stuck the deceased was struck, did he happen to turn his scythe - A. His scythe dropped down certainly, and the prisoner's scythe passed upwards, which it would not have done if the brother had not dropped his scythe; he had been standing with the blade up, and dropped it, which suffered the prisoner's scythe to pass over.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Winchin, of Ryeslip. My mistress's garden joins the field where the men were mowing. I was in the garden on this evening, and heard them at high words; I went up to the hedge, and looked over into the field - I could not hear what passed but saw plainly; they were a hundred yards off. I think it was the prisoner who I heard swearing - he was whetting his scythe when I first saw him. I heard him say to his brother, that he could not mow, and never could mow in his life - I think it was the prisoner who said so; I saw him in the act of mowing, and cutting towards his brother, who appeared to be standing still; I do not think that he was mowing. I heard him use an oath, and say he would mow his legs up, meaning that he could mow better than him. I saw him cut towards his brother's scythe, and heard the scythes make a great rattling together. I think he cut three or four times towards his brother's scythe, and was too far off to say whether his brother struck again or not - I saw him attempt to keep the blows from his legs, and heard some one say,</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop, there will be mischief, or an accident;" I cannot say whether it was the deceased or the third man. I saw the deceased drop his scythe, turn round, and go towards the house - he put his hands to his bowels, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am ruined!" and saw the blood run.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The three men were in the field - A. Yes. The prisoner's brother was on his left, and he was mowing towards the left side. I do not mean that he was directing the scythe towards his brother's body. His brother put his scythe down, to stop him from mowing his way.</p>
               <p>MR. BARLOW SLADE. I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased, and found him wounded in the lower part of his body - his bowels were nearly out; he died of that wound.</p>

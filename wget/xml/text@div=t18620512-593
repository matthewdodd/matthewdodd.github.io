                  </hi>. I live at 96, Powis-street, Woolwich, and am a cabinet-maker—I have been tenant of those premises between fourteen and fifteen years—Mr. Barnett has been my landlord for the last sixteen month—I formerly held it under other landlords; from the temperance society, and a Mr. Booth—during the whole fifteen months I have occupied the back shop and the yard—this is the yard on the south (<hi rend="italic">referring to a plan</hi>)—this it my gateway, and round here is my other little workshop, and this is my yard all round—that extends to this boundary wall—there is a partition between a cigar-shop and my yard—I built this coke-shed six or eight years ago—I am in possession of the passage on the west, and this small strip of ground on the east of the workshop—that comes right round, but lately Looker has put a doorway and stopped me from there—Powis-street is north—the coke-shed cost me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to build—I also built the water closet at the same time—I think Looker came to the cigar-shop in December—a person named Russell was a tenant before him—Austen was the last man before Looker—Looker took it from him—Russell was there before that, and a person named Clout before him—all the time I have been there I have been in possession of the yard up to the boundary wall, which is eighteen inches thick, and about seven feet high, with a gate between the premises and the wall which divides the two—there is also a window looking out of my premises into this yard, near the coad-shed—up to 8th March nobody has ever claimed a right to this piece of yard—about a fortnight before the defendant took possession, he said, "I am going to be a neighbour of yours"—I said, "Are you?"—he said, "Let me see, you have the whole of this yard; I suppose you will have no objection to my wife drying a few clothes in there?"—I don't think I said "Yes" or "No" to it—I allowed him to do it—I had been laid up with abscesses under my arm-pit before this—on 8th March, Looker came to my workshop before I was up, and said to Mrs. Richardson, "I want to see the master"—I came out and asked what he wanted—he said, "If you don't move the coke out of that shed, I will move it for you, and <hi rend="italic">chuk</hi> it in the yard"—he had not said anything</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186205120147"></xptr>
               <p>about that before—I said, "The yard is mine, I have a right to it; what do you want with the yard?" in fact, I laughed at him—he said, "Oh, I'll let you know; I will have the yard"—he then went away, and about half-past 1 he came again and said, "I see you are in the same mind about that coke-shed as you were before"—I said, "What is it to you about the coke-shed; the coke-shed is mine, and there is an end of if—my wife and servant were there then—he also said, "You are determined not to pull it down; I will pull it down and chuck it into the yard, if I go to Maidstone Gaol for six months for it"—I cautioned him—he went away, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards the girl heard a knocking; the door of the shed was locked; I saw him break it open, and break the lock—the girl immediately came to me, and called my attention to it; I looked out of the window, and Looker was the man who did it—when he broke the door open he began shovelling the coke into a barrow, and wheeled it into the middle of the yard—my wife persuaded me, not to go out, as I was ill—he took the coke all out; it took him pretty well all the afternoon, and then he took the front of the shed down and threw it on the coke—since then he has put up a door against the water-closet, which has shut us out altogether, and kept us out ever since—about three weeks or a month after that, on Good Friday morning, I had an iron bedstead in the yard, and Looker threw the barrow from the part he claims into my yard, and grased the bedstead very much—I went out and moved the barrow—he was in the water-closet then, and said, "Thank you, Mr. Richardson"—I said, "You are quite welcome, Mr. Looker"—we have access to the water-closet now—he said he would let me see that the yard belonged to him, and that he had a right to it, and threatened to break my neck—he invited me inside his gate, and said he would break my neck for me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my agreement with Barnett for the premises.</p>

DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not tell us on Monday as much as you did to-day; did you say anything on Monday about this barrow being thrown in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you tried to prevent my paying it—I never had a quarrel with Looker about furniture being left opposite my door—I swear I had no disagreement with him that I am aware of—there is only one water-closet for both houses—it is used by the inhabitants of both houses—he had to come out from his yard through this narrow strip into mine—the width of the two yards is about five or six feet—I knew Susannah Clout as living there—I let the place to her; I was trustee at the time—she left the cigar-shop in December, 1860—part of the shed was there at that time—I made it larger while she was there—it was a coke-shed before—I took up more of the ground—there was a pan-tile roof to it—part of it was off and part on at this time—it was made up against the wall in a proper manner; it is a lean-to shed—it was built of wood, and pan-tiles on the roof when it was first built—I presume Mr. Barnett is Looker's landlord; he is my landlord—I am not in a position to swear that Looker holds the premises under Mr. Barnett—the premises all belong to Barnett now—I have had conversations with Barnett about this coal-shed—my arm was in a sling then—it was about 8th March, in the evening—he did not tell me to take away the coal-shed—I told him what Looker had said, and he said, "Bother the fellow! I don't want to have any bother about it; it is a pity the coal-shed is not away"—I said, "I can't do anything"—he did not tell</p>

               <p>me to take it away—I did not tell him I would take it away when my arm was better—when I went back Looker was <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> the coke about and pulling the shed down; and I said that he, as the landlord, ought to have come and stopped him—he said, "The yard belongs to yon, Richardson; go and get out a summons, for he is doing wrong"—I said, "I would make peace when my arm was better"—I told Mr. Barnett that I would take it away when my arm got better—I did it to make peace and quietness between me and the landlord—the servant was out at the back when she heard the noise, and she came to the front and told me of it—I and Mrs. Richardson and the girl ran up stairs, and looked out of the window and saw him at it—I had not seen him at it before the serrant called my attention to it—I saw him in the act of breaking the door open—that was at the time the girl spoke to me—but for my arm, I think I should have gone out and prevented him—I do not think I should have been frightened on my own premises—I should hare gone out if I had been in good health, and got somebody to help me—I think there are some receipts to prove that I have been paying rent from fourteen to fifteen years there—I was there longer than eight years—I was a tenant in 1852—I was in the premises in 1847—a Mr. Hugh was not there before me—he was not tenant of my premises in 1852—I believe he was tenant of the next door.</p>

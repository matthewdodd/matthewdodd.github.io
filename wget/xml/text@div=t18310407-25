               <p>SARAH MIFFLING. On the 17th of January the prisoner lodged with me - I missed this shift, and told her of it; she denied it - I found it on her person that day, and charged her with stealing it; she promised to return it to me, and I did not give her in charge, nor take it from her; I did not see it again till she was apprehended - my initials are on it; I never gave her permission to wear it - I saw it produced before the Magistrate, and identified it; it was found on her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You did not take it from her when you first found it? A. No, she was to return it in the course of a week; she had three or four of her own in her box - she slept with me with it on; we could not have exchanged shifts by mistake when we got up.</p>

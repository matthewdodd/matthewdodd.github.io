                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Stepney. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service—I knew where he lived—I had occasion to go to his house on the 25th of Feb.—I there found this plaister of Paris, this scaffold cord, and other articles—they all belong to me—the prisoner was my carman—he had not the use of these things, and had no occasion to have any of them at his house—I was using this brush just before Christmas.</p>

I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house, and found a paper of plaister of Paris—the chain, the rope, the awl, and other things—these are the articles—the prosecutor was with me, but the prisoner was not there—I produced these articles to the prosecutor in presence of the prisoner—the prisoner said he had bought the plaister of Paris of his master, and the other articles he had had in his house for some considerable time.</p>

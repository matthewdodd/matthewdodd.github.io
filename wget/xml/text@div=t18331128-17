            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I produce a small stone given to me by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BUNTING. This is one of the stones I lost; I know it by the fineness of the quality, and the scarcity of this size, and the colour is very peculiar, it being an East Indian garnet; and the cut of it - it was not cut in England; it is Indian cut; all the garnets I lost were Indian cut - I lost one very large one, and some of this size; the generality of them were smaller than that; none of them were like this, not that peculiar cut - I have not the least doubt that this is one of them - Groves has worked for me seventeen years, and Mrs. Groves was in the habit of selling for me to a great amount, and has been in the habit of seeing my stones - she has seen my garnets repeatedly in my place, she has seen this one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known Mrs. Groves? A. About fourteen or fifteen years - I have known her all that time, coming backwards and forewards to my house; the husband works for me; she had access to my house - there is no private mark of mine on the garnet.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear it was East Indian cut? A. Yes, and from that and the colour I swear to it; there is not one of a thousand of that quality - I have not seen twenty of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280025"></xptr>that quality; I do not know that I have seen any; but I may have seen fifteen or twenty, or more; very likely I have seen fifty; I will not swear I have not seen one hundred, nor one thousand; but I swear to the quality and cut - I have not seen five of this cut - there is not a lapidary in this country can cut as this is done - the tools are not such as they cut with - they cut them in the East Indies on wood and emery; I believe they are all cut in the same manner from the East Indies; exactly like this - this is the only one I saw cut in this way, I think; I might not have noticed - I do not believe I have seen any of this cut at all; I swore to this positively at the police-office - I believe I gave the cut as a reason, and the fineness of the quality, I think; I will swear I mentioned the cut to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. Do you know the male prisoner? A. He is servant to a greengrocer in the neighbourhood, and came backwards and forwards.</p>

            . I am apprenticed to Mr. Hasler, a jeweller. I saw the male prisoner last month at Hatton-garden; and I remember seeing him about the 24th of last May - he asked me if I would mount him a stone into a brooch; I said, I would - I went to his place - I do not know the name of the street; I saw the female prisoner there, who is his sister - they both showed me the stones in a piece of paper; they were garnet stones - the male prisoner asked if I would mount him a stone, and he selected one, and he asked his sister if he might have it; she said he might, and he gave me the stone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it he said to her? A."Will you give me this stone to make into a brooch?" or something like that - those are the words, as near as I can recollect; and she said he might have it - the stones were at that time in his hands, in a paper - when I first went into the room he asked his sister to get them; he asked a female, and I think it was her, but I did not take particular notice who it was - this was not in the room; it was in the passage - I am certain she was there; it was in the evening, and it was dark, and I think from her voice it was her - I did not go into the room; we went out of the passage into a cart-shed adjoining - I saw both the prisoners in the passage when I went in, and some others, but I do not know who they were - the male prisoner got the stones and opened the paper, and then we went into the other place - I saw the stones in the passage; they brought a candle; I do not know who brought it - I saw the female prisoner there; after that the two prisoners went into a cart-shed with me; somebody else came in after - we went out of the passage into the cart-shed without going into the street - I believe a door goes out of the passage into the cart-shed - the female prisoner had the candle: the male prisoner picked out the stone, and asked his sister, if he might have it; she said, "Yes" - he had them in his own hand in a paper at the time; he gave the stone to me to make into a brooch; this is very much like the stone - I took it to Mr. Groves, to be re-cut, and left it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What directions did the man give you about the garnet? A. To make it into a brooch; it was not in a fit state to be set; it could be set without being re-cut, but it would not look well; if it was re-cut it would make it look different from what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were not directed to have it re-cut, why desire Groves to do it? A. It would look so had if it was not re-cut; I thought it would not do so well for a brooch - it would cost about 3d. or 6d. to re-cut it; I knew the woman by hearing her voice afterwards - I will not be certain it was her - I am certain she is the woman who was there, but am not certain she is the woman he asked to get the stones; there was a girl there, but I am almost sure it was the prisoner he asked; it might he the girl who brought the stones; there was no light in the passage when I heard the woman's voice, when he asked for the stones to be got; I had not known her before; Mr. Hasler could not recut the stone; he is a jeweller; I took it as a little job for myself; I should charge for making the brooch about 1s.; he asked me what it would be: I said, "About 1s.;" I was to set it in brass - I should have 3d. or 6d. to pay for re-cutting it; that would be out of my pocket; I have known Mrs. Groves, I believe, about a year and a-half; it might be more; she worked for my master; I never saw her with any garnets; I have been with my master two years and three months - living with him nearly all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time your master first hired you, up to this time, have you ever quitted him? A. Yes; about twelve months since; I had been hired by him then, a year and ten months - I did not tell my master I was going away, he had beat me before I left, because I lost a little coral drop; I went to a house to get a bill receipted, and in opening the paper, it fell out of the paper and fell down a hole in the room, and I could not get the board up; the value of it was 1s.; I ran away from him because he beat me for it; I went to Liverpool - my master was living in London; it is two hundred miles to Liverpool - I walked there; I found my way by seeing the coaches and things going along; I did not intend to go to Liverpool when I set out - I am sure I don't know why I went there; I had 1s. 6d. in my pocket, and eat acorns and blackberries to support myself on the way; I was eight days walking - I slept in the hedges; I had some clothes - I did not pawn any of them - I had none but what I had on; I did not pledge any clothes before I left - I once pledged a waistcoat, that was nearly twelve months before, I had no friends in Liverpool - I was only there one day; I went to the dock yard there to go to sea; I was never at sea.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you discovered at Liverpool? A. I was standing in the dock yard; a policeman asked me where I belonged to; I told him, and I was sent to London to my master; I was sixteen years old then; I did not see hand-bills offering a reward for me - I saw hand-bills describing me when I returned; my master had scolded me for various things before - he did not accuse me of stealing coral; I am in his service at this time; he refused to become bail for my appearance.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. You were flogged and ran away from your apprenticeship? A. Yes; I said I was doubtful who the prisoner asked to fetch the garnets; I have not a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280026"></xptr>doubt who it was that seemed to own the stones - it was that girl; I am quite sure she is the girl who consented to let the male prisoner have that garnet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know who he asked to let him have the stone? A. Yes - that girl at the bar.</p>

            ; I remember receiving a garnet from my husband, about the 25th of October; it was a particularly fine one; I had seen it in possession of Mr. Bunting before, with others, and recognised it; I have worked for him seventeen years - I have had goods on commission from Mr. Bunting, to the amount of 2 or 300l. at a time; I believe this to be the same garnet; I took it to Mr. Bunting's and left it with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen Gibbons many times? A. From his coming backwards and forwards for the last two years - I knew him when he went to Liverpool - I heard of his going, but not till he was gone; I heard it from his employer, after he was gone; I only knew him as a boy bringing work backwards and forwards; my maiden name was Harris; I was not married more than once - I have been married to Groves thirteen years; I never went by the name of Eaton - I never knew that name; I know Hatton-garden, and the Police-office - I was born in the neighbourhood of it; I have been in the Police-office - I was there last month; I cannot tell you how long it is since I was there the first time - I have been there several times as a witness, or any thing else - I was there, and if Mr. Wooler is here he can answer the question.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you charged with the first time you made your appearance there? A. I was seen to be talking to a bad character; that is the only charge - I was never brought to the police-office again - I was never charged but once at Hatton-garden; Mr. Wooller was astonished that the key should be turned on me - I don't know who the policeman was that had me; it was one of the new police - I was never there in charge of any officer, not a policeman; I was there a month ago only as a witness in Mr. Bunting's case - I never was in the office, except as a witness for Mr. Bunting, and at the time I was charged with speaking to a bad character, that was last summer - I know Waddington, he is well known in the neighbourhood; he has never had me in custody, that I will swear; the policeman took me, and of course I was in the care of Mr. Waddington; it was only once; and that was, because I spoke to a bad character - my house has not been searched lately - I know Busain, the police-inspector - my house was never searched but once; that was last summer, when I was charged with speaking to a bad character; and, my brother, unfortunately, was in trouble at the time; he had a trial here, and you, Sir, was kind enough to plead his cause - my house was searched, for furs, I believe; it was searched, but no stolen furs were in my house - I was never charged at Hatton-garden, with four other women, that I swear; nor with any women, except what I have said; that was last summer - I was not charged with three or four other women, with housebreaking - I had but two examinations, that was on account of the furs; on account of my brother and me talking to bad women - when I come to recollect, it was the summer before last, but that was the transaction - I was not examined twice; I was not asked questions the next time - I went down, I believe, two days, and was then brought up and discharged - I went by my own name then - I was never in Waddington's custody, by the name of Eaton, nor any name, except Groves; and I was only once in his custody - I was never charged with a girl and two men - I have made no mistake.</p>

            . I am a police-officer, of Hatton-garden - I have been there seven years and a half - I have seen Mrs. Groves to-day - I have been acquainted with her since I have been jailor to the office, which is only between two and three years - I have the name in the book before.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion did you see her at the office first? A. Two burglaries were committed; her brother was charged with them, and she was taken also by Busain; it was on the 20th of January, 1832; four prisoners were committed, and she was discharged; two males, and two females - I think she went by the name of Groves; I will not positively say that I knew her by any other name - I have seen her several times at our office - I think the last occasion was about some furs, where Busain had searched about furs - I don't recollect what she was charged with; she was, on one occasion, charged with something - I am positive I saw her at our office under a charge once; the second time I cannot be certain of - she was in the office, which is only a small room; but whether she was charged or not I don't know; that is eight or nine months ago - it was about the furs and some shoes that she was there the first time - it was two burglaries together; her brother had been transported. and came back, and was taken up twice since; and on every occasion that he was there, she was there - the burglaries were about robbing a man in Leather-lane, of some furs; that was in January, 1832.</p>

I re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280027"></xptr>member his running away from me - he had pawned a waistcoat some time before - I was asked, by the magistrate, to be bound for his appearance, but I would not; I had not confidence in him - he is a boy I would believe; I have no fault to find with him as a liar; he was away about eight weeks altogether.</p>

             I live at No. 13, Serle's-place, Carey-street. On the 10th of July I saw the prosecutrix at Apollo-court - she was very tipsy, sitting on a chair, and a person, named Pears, was washing her face with vinegar; her cap was off, and her hair in disorder - I was not there when she missed the sovereign, but I saw her give her purse to the prisoner: she took it out of her basket, and said, "Mrs. Henry, take care of my purse, I will trust my life in your hands" - Mrs. Henry said all who were there should see what was in it; I saw it counted - there were four sovereigns and a 5l. note in one end, and one sovereign in the other.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar took a lodging of me at 18 d. per week; as she was gone out, I went up to sweep my rooms, and make my beds, and I miss'd one sheet from off her bed. She came home and lay in her bed that night, and I took her up the next morning; then she had the other sheet concealed under her petticoats. She fell on her knees, and acknowledged she took them, and said it was done through necessity; she owned she sold the other to an old-cloaths woman in Monmouth-street when she was before justice Welch.</p>

               <p>I lay there two or three nights; I was very much in liquor, and know nothing of the sheets laid to my charge.</p>

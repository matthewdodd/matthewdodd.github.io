                  </hi>. I live in Sidmouth-place, Gray's-inn-road. On the 11th of May, the witness Mawley brought a cask ofpotatoes to me, which came from Cornwall—the prisoner was with him—I afterwards filled the cask with five gowns and eight yards of printed cotton, and gave it to the prisoner on the 12th of May as he came for it—he said he would take it to Cornwall—he said he was a sailor, and had come from Cornwall by the boat—the cask was directed to my uncle Vigors, to be sent on to my father—I have made every inquiry, but have been unable to find the cask or property—this is the bill I paid the prisoner, and here is the one he brought when he took away the cask—(<hi rend="italic">producing them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I went with the prisoner with the cask to Mrs. Stana<lb></lb>way's—I know nothing about the cask which she gave him—I heard the prisoner say something about her uncle at Cornwall—he said he was going next week—I cannot tell whether he went or not—the cask we took came from Chamberlain's wharf, Tooley-street—I am employed by Mr. Hunt—the prisoner went with me when the prosecutrix paid me for the cask—he heard her say the cask was to be returned—he and I used to work at the same place at one time.</p>

There has never been a cask directed, as the prosecutrix states, at our wharf—if there had been I should have known it—I know the prisoner by sight—I do not know what he is—Mawley is employed by me—I am sure I never received the cask in question from the prisoner, nor was it ever shipped at our wharf—these bills belong to our wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 30th of September I received charge of the prisoner—he acknowledged going along with Maw<lb></lb>ley to take the cask, but denied going next day to receive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was at work at the wharf, on and off, nine or ten years, which Mr. Hunt knows; I went with Mawley on this morn<lb></lb>ing, as I had nothing to do; the cask was to be delivered at the Pewter Platter, in Gracechurch-street; Mawley said we might as well go round with it, and charge the shilling, instead of giving it to the carrier to take; so we went, but I never heard any more about it till I was at work on the wharf, and Mawley came to me and said, <hi rend="italic">"Bill,</hi> have you been after the cask?" I said, "No." He said, "If you have, you had better keep out of the way." I said, "Why should I keep out of the way?" and I have been on the wharf ever since; I never had the cask in my hand.</p>

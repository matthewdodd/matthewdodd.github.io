                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Ludgate-street. I also have a shop in Sidney's-alley—I am in partnership with my sister, Rebecca—the prisoner was our errand-boy. On the 19th of May, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, he came to me at Ludgate-hill, with a message from my sister—I was serving some customers, soon after, and he went into the back shop, where I had a cash-box on the desk with sixteen sovereigns in it—I had been to the box five minutes before, in the prisoner's presence—I turned the key, and, as I thought, locked the box, but I had not—the sovereigns were there then—I left him in the shop with the box—I returned to the back shop to write a note to my sister—I took the box up to put it into the desk, and the lid came open—I immediately counted the money, and missed five sovereigns—the prisoner was then in the front shop—I asked a person, in his presence, if I had paid any money away.</p>

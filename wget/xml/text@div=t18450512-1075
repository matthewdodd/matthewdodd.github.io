                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 27, Harcourt-street, Maryle-bone. In 1844, I was living in a house in Newoham-street. Viner and his wife were living in the same house—some time afterwards he took a coal<lb></lb>shed in White Hart-street, Drury-lane—I had told him that I had property which I was desirous to invest, and went with him to look at several different houses—I received a letter from him about a fortnight before the 30th of Sept., which I unfortunately destroyed—before that Gruby had spokes to me about a house, and Viner also—they both jointly recommended the house to me, saying it would pay me very good interest for my money—I declined it, it being in a very dilapidated state, and I thought the money a good deal for the time—the letter I received from Viner stated, "I have come to some agreement with Gruby; he is willing to let you a lease of this house for nine yean for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; will you come down to-morrow morning yourself?"—the words, "Nine years;" were in writing, not in figures—I went next morning—Viner and Gruby were both there—Viner recommended it very highly, and so did Gruby, laying it would bring me very good interest for the money—Gruby said he was very sorry he was obliged to sell k, but he was so much in want of money, or otherwise he would not make soch a sacrifice—I considered from what they said, that Gruby was in possession of the house—Viner said, "Now I should recommend you to have it; if you make up your mind, I will do all the business for you, and see it properly executed, and done pro<lb></lb>perly, see all the rent paid, and all the taxes, up to the time"—I said to Gruby, "Mr. Gruby, I think it seems such a very curious time, your saying nine years, why not say ten?"—Gruby said, "The reason I say nine is, it being about half my term unexpired"—I then agreed to take it for nine years—I gave Viner a sovereign for his trouble—I said, "Mr. Viner, I must entirely trust to you to do it for me, because my eyesight it so very bad"—Viner knew that I had had three successive inflammations in<lb></lb>my eye, that summer, so as to weaken my sight very much—the prisoners appointed me to meet them on Saturday, the 28th; but I was too late fag the Savings' Bank—I went to the house in White Hart-street, and Viner accompanied me back to the Savings Bank, and solicited them to pay it at an unusual time, to which they agreed, and I got it on the 30th—I received it myself, I went to the house in White Hart-street, and there saw the pri<lb></lb>sohers in a part of the shop selected from the shop which they used as a sort of little counter-place—there was a round table—the shop was very dark—it was candlelight—Viner brought out this paper, and told me it was the lease of the house—Gruby was there at the time—Viner read it over to me, and he distinctly read over "Nine years"—Gruby must have hoard that—he sat close by—this is the document that was read over to me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—and which I had in ray possession afterwards—I</p>

               <p>have no doubt about it—when it was read over to me, I signed it, Gru<lb></lb>by signed it, and Viner signed it, and then Viner, with a pen in his hand, took it to a man named John Newman, who was in the shop, and asked him to put his name to it—I then gave the money, 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., into Viner's hands—I it was in notes—I think all in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Viner said, "Will you have the receipt for the money, or shall I seal it up in the lease?"—I said, "Seal it in, if you please"—the lease, receipt, and all was got ready be<lb></lb>fore I went there—Viner folded up the receipt before me in the lease, sealed it up, and handed it over to me, saying, "Now I know you are very close-minded person, it is not worth while to say anything at all about it, put it at the bottom of your box, and leave it there till the ex<lb></lb>piration of the nine years, till it is called for"—this is the paper in which it was wrapped—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—and here is what he wrote on the out<lb></lb>side—I thought it was ail right, and put it in my box, where it remained until the end of Nov., when a relation of mine called upon me—in con<lb></lb>sequence of something he said to me, I told him I had purchased the lease of a house, and showed this to him, and that was the first time I disco<lb></lb>vered the fraud—(<hi rend="italic">this was a lease for a term of three years instead of nine</hi>)—I went in search of the prisoners, but could not find either—(I went first to an attorney, who wrote to them)—I saw Viner's wife, who told me he was out of town—I never found him until he was taken into custody—Gruby called on me in the beginning of Jan., to know the rea<lb></lb>son why I did not pay the rent to him, and why I paid it to Sir Herbert Jenner's agent—I asked him where they resided, but he would not give me any answer, and I said, "Anything you have to say, you had better say it to my attorney"—I never saw him again till I gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody in White Hart-street—I then took a newspaper with me, and showed him what account I had heard—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a piece of newspaper</hi>)—this is a portion of the paper—it is what I showed him—I took the whole paper—I did not cut this out—I gave the whole paper to my attorney'! clerk, Mr. Lassiter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 74, Earl-street, Lisson-grove—Mrs. Price is a cousin of mine. I called on her in Nov. last—in consequence of something I said she took the lease out of a box and gave it me—it was sealed up in this envelope—I read it—three years is mentioned as the term—I went to No. 12, White Hart-street, by her request, weekly, to receive the money that the rent produced—on one occasion Newman seemed desirous of taking the house as tenant at will—Viner was then present—I said, "I am not aware under what terms Mary Price holds the lease," but I turned to Viner, and said, "Your name is Viner!"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Probably you can inform me?"—he said, "Oh yes, I can;" he stated the rent to be 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, and taxes 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for nine years—that was some week or so after I saw the lease.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Mills, a solicitor, No. 3, Brunswick-place, City-road. I produce a lease of the house No, 12, White Hart-street—I saw it deposited with Mr. Mills, by Gruby, at a security—a warrant of attorney was executed at the time it was deposited—this it the warrant—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it has Gruby's signature—I am the subscribing witness to the warrant—the lease has been in my possession ever shice.—(<hi rend="italic">The warrant of attorney here read was dated the 24th of Feb., 1841, given by Gruby, to secure the payment of </hi>50<hi rend="italic">l., and interest, to one John Tarr, and agreed that the lease of certain premises in White Hart-street, granted by Sir Herbert Jenner to Gruby, should be deposited mth the said John Tarr, at a collateral security.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gruby's Defence, written:</hi>—"I never knew viner till a short time before he introduced me to Miss Price, and then only at a customer, I being then in the coal-trade. About last April Viner told me Miss Price wished him to take a business for her, which he did, a chandler's shop, in Eagle-court, about thirty yards from my house; he used to super<lb></lb>intend the business for her; he then told me she wanted him to live close by her, as she was afraid, it being a basinets she did not understand, she should require his services; be then made me an offer for my business; and said she was going to lend him the money to take it; he ultimatelytook it; soon after that he said she wished him to take the house for twelve months, and to lend him the money to purchase it. Viner then took the house for twelve months; he then let the shop he had previously taken for her in Eagle-court to Mrs. Hands, who let lodgings to gay women; a short time after that Viner told me Miss Price wanted him to purchase the house for three years; he said it was for him, but it was to be in Miss Price's name. I declined at first, but after repeated applications on Viner's part I agreed for the sum of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. subject to my paying back the money I had previously received from Viner. The documents were drawn up according to Miss Price's directions; Viner then read both over to Miss Price in the presence of Newman, and she also read them herself and was quite satisfied with them; all this was not in my presence, neither, when Viner told her to nut the document in her box, as Viner told me it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120094"></xptr>
               <p>was Miss Price's wish that I should be present; knowing that they had been very intimate I did not think anything of it, and she always said she was quite satisfied with what Viner did; he then brought me the money, and I gave a receipt for it, at the same time agreeing to lay out some mo<lb></lb>ney in painting and repairing the house, which I did according to my pro<lb></lb>mise; all this was under the superintendence of Viner. Miss Price then agreed to let Newman the shop for three years, as a weekly tenant. On the 1st of March, 1845, Miss Price gave me in charge for obtaining the money under false pretences, a charge the Magistrate would not entertain; she then gave Viner in charge, much against her will, for the sake of pu<lb></lb>nishing me, and preferred a charge against us both for attempting to defraud her of the money. She states in her depositions that she could not find me from November, 1844, till she gave me in charge, when, at the same time, I had left my address for my rent about the 18th of January, 1845; after that I went with Newman to her lodgings in Crawford-street, and saw her there; since then she has been in the house and seen me. I sub<lb></lb>mit that the charge of obtaining the money under false pretences cannot stand, insomuch as both Miss Price and Viner know the profits of the house is worth the money given, together with the business. I distinctly deny the statement made by Hands, but I have every reason to believe she was influenced by Miss Price to appear against me that she might be allowed to reside in the house to look after the lodgers; likewise Mrs. Hands owes Miss Price money; Miss Price has received the benefits of the house since September, 1844, till the present time, and is still doing so. I laid out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to obtain a new lease under Sir H. Jenner for twenty-one years; the house will bring in with lodgers one pound per week, besides the business, which is worth more than the original rent. I have been a tenant of Sir H. Jenner's seven years next September, and I sincerely de<lb></lb>clare what I have done was with no intention of defrauding any person."</p>

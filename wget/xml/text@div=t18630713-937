               <p>he admired the pony—I told him the price was thirty-five guineas—on Sunday evening, the 7th, he came to my master's stables, admired the pony, and said he should like it to make a present to a lady; if I would allow him to try it next morning—I took it to Sloane-street next morning, and saw him, and let him have it—we arranged on the Sunday that he was to give me thirty guineas for it—he asked me to put a silk front on—he then mounted the pony—I had arranged on the Sunday evening that the pony was to be returned, or a cheque—he gave me this card, "Capt. Logan, 133, Sloane-street"—on the Monday evening I received information from my wife, and went next morning again to Sloane-street; I saw the prisoner—he asked if I could wait till Saturday for the money—I said no, I wanted it then, as I had payments to make that day—he then gave me this cheque—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>; "London, 9th June, 1863.—To Messrs. Stephens &amp; Son,—Pay to Mr. Stephen Lane 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and charge the same to my account, A. G. Logan")—at the same time he gave me this card, telling me it was the address of the parties whose names appeared on the cheque—I went and presented the cheque almost directly—I saw Mr. Stephens, I believe; I got no money—I afterwards saw the pony at Cambridge, and took possession of it—a boy was riding it; we have not been able to find him since.</p>

I am a commission-agent, in Ebury-street, Pimlico—I know the prisoner as Captain Logan—on Monday, 8th June, about half past 10 in the morning, I saw him in Burton-street, Pimlico, riding a pony—a Mr. Percival was with him, looking at the pony—Percival said to me, "Mr. Grant, here is a pony that will suit you"—I looked at it; and asked the prisoner what he wanted for it—he said thirty guineas—I told him that was above my price—he said, "Oh! I suppose you would want him at about sixteen"—I said he had a little underdone it; I was going to bid him seventeen—I had a show up and down, and I then bid him eighteen; I then said if he would give me one out of twenty I would have it—he offered me one out of twenty-five; that was 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Percival went down the yard, came back, and tapped me on the shoulder, and, in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he said, I did not buy the pony—I have since seen that pony in the possession of the police.</p>

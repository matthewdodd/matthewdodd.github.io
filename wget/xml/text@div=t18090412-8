               <p>BARNARD GLEED. I am a patrol belonging to Bow street office, attached to Worship street office. On Saturday the 25th of February, I was at Mr. Perkins's, pawnbroker, Bishopsgate street, the corner of Widegate alley. Esther Newnham, a little girl, came in with a ring in her hand; she asked the pawnbroker what it was worth; I heard the conversation, and I saw her leave it; I came out of the shop and stood at the corner of Widegate alley, I saw the little girl come out of the shop, she went down Widegate alley into Petticoat lane; I followed her; she went from there into Artillery street, she went into Bishopsgate street, she went towards Shoreditch church; she then went up to

            , who was in the street looking in at a shop window: I went up to them while they were in conversation, I asked Wood if she sent that little girl to pledge the ring; she said she did; I asked her if she knew what ring it was; she said it was a diamond ring, she found it in Hackney road, a little after Christmas, in the snow; she said when she found it she shewed the ring to a gentleman coming past, he told her the ring was worth eighty guineas. I took them both into custody, and took them to Mr. Mason's house, an officer of Worship street office.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the ring while the prisoner was talking to the little girl - A. No; I saw it on the counter at the pawnbrokers; they had refused to take it in of the little girl.</p>

The last witness brought the prisoner and the little girl to my house; I left the prisoner with Gleed for him to take her to the office; I went to the pawnbroker's; this ring was delivered up to me. The prisoner told me two or three stories, the last I believe to be the truth, that she found it in her master's garden in the City road; first she said she found it in Hackney road, then she said she found it in the City road, and then she said she found it in her master's garden; I asked her if she had shewed it to her master and mistress; she said she had not.</p>

Yes; I know it to be mine, I lost it from my dwelling house; at the time it was lost I lived in York place, St. Mary, Islington; the prisoner lived servant in the house at the time, she was cook. In the latter end of December Mrs. Whitmore took it off her finger and dropped it in the dining room accidentally as she was going to bed; Mrs. Whitmore looked for it but did not find it; Mrs. Whitmore spoke to all the servants when she went up to bed about it.</p>

No; the next morning I came into the dining room, the prisoner shewed me two rings in the dining room of my mistress's house; she said she thought my mistress had left these two rings upon the piano forte; she gave them to my mistress; my mistress said there was another ring dropped, to both of us; we both searched for it; I went and shook the green baize in the front area, I shook the ring out; I gave the ring to the prisoner, she was the first that came into the kitchen; she gave it to my mistress; that was the third ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her where you found it - A. Yes, against the area door; my mistress said there was another, she said there was four dropped, she described the ring to both of us; she said it was a gold ring set with diamonds: we both searched for it; I never knew of it being found.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw that did you - A. Yes; they were dropped after she took them off her fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had she put them - A. To the best of my recollection she had put them on the marble slab over the fire place.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the whole of them dropped - A. Yes; I believe two of them were found that night; I heard of one being found, I was not at home at the time. That ring has got children's hair in it, set with diamonds.</p>
               <p>Hyam. In the present state the ring is worth three pounds; it cost five pounds or guineas.</p>

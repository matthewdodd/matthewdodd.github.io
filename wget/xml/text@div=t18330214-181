             (Police-constable B 55). I was on duty in Jew's-row on the night of the 15th of February; I saw Wiggins and Turner - I knew Wiggins; I followed them to George-street, which is a dark street, and then I heard Turner say "I can't," and Wiggins said, "You can if you like" - they parted; I saw Wiggins go into a public-house in Sloane-square - I got a man to go in and tell the landlord to come out and speak to me; the bar-man came out to me, and I spoke to him - I then pushed up the shutter and saw Wiggins and Neale there - and while I was there Turner came in and joined them; I got another officer to go in and ask them where they came from - Neale said he lived in the London-road; I then stepped up, and took Wiggins - I said to him, "I know you to be a reputed thief;" I unbuttoned his trousers, and found two pairs of new shoes, and on Turner I found two duplicates of two new pairs - I found nothing on Neale; I went to the prosecutor - he sent the shopman with me to the cell where Neale and Wiggins were; the shopman said he could swear to the shoes on Neale's feet, but of those on Wiggins he had a doubt - they utterly denied knowing Turner, but the publican said that they had all been to his house for a fortnight; I found some money on Turner, and the next day I found five pairs of shoes which had been pawned at one shop, and four pairs at another.</p>

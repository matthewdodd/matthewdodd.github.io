She went up stairs, and fetched it down to dry. I went out, and came back again between twelve and one. I asked her for the shirt; she said it was missing. She sent for Mr. Freeman, the officer. I had seen my shirt hanging at the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there at that time - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLLINGS. I was in the tap-room having a pint of porter. The prisoner and another came in. They drank together. The prisoner had no money to pay for the beer. I said I would let him have money to pay the landlord. In the mean time the landlady came in, and said the shirt was missing. The landlord locked the door, and said nobody should go out. I looked round, and saw the shirt under the prisoner's waistcoat. I am sure I saw the shirt under his waistcoat, because there was a piece hanging out, and the shirt he had on was dirty.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FREEMAN. I am an officer. On the 10th of November I was sent for at this public-house. The landlord pointed out the prisoner. I went to him, and between his feet, in the box, there was this shirt.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my shirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of taking the shirt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

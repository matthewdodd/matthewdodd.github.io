On the 9th of January, the prisoner took two rooms in my house, ready furnished; he left them on the 14th, at seven o'clock in the morning; he gave me no notice, nor did I know that he was going. I went up stairs immediately after he went out, and missed the articles stated in the indictment; some of them belonged to my lodger, and were in the room above the prisoner's apartments; he was taken about seven weeks after; my things are worth 20l. They were in the room when I let it to him. My other lodger was gone into the country.</p>

            . I lodge with Mrs. Thompson. On the morning of the 9th of January, I left my lodging to go into the country for a few days. I lodged in the room below the prisoner. My portmanteau, which contained the articles stated in the indictment as mine, was put in the room above the prisoner's, in Mrs. Thompson's care, the things were worth 40l. altogether. When I returned to town, on the night of the 12th, my things were safe - I went away again the next morning. On Thursday, the 14th, I received a letter from Mrs. Thompson, to say, she missed my portmanteau, and some of her own things. I was then at Kensington. On the 27th of February I was sent for to Bow-street to see the prisoner, he was stripped before me, and my drawers and flannel-waistcoat were taken off him; they were in my portmanteau when I left it in Mrs. Thompson's care.</p>

            . I was standing at the bottom of Mercer-street, Long-acre, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th of February, and heard the cry of stop thief, the street was very clear, and the prisoner was running very fast towards me. I did not see any other person near me. I called out to him to stop, but he sprung on the other side of the street, instead of stopping; I secured him. He said he had been with a girl, and that she had raised the cry of stop thief after him. I told him to stop till the girl came up, and if that was the case I would let him go;

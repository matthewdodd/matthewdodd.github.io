                  </hi>. I am member of the firm of Norris and Gilby, merchants, of 44, Mark lane—we are London agents for Morgan and Co., of Hamburgh—Mr. Edwin Chaplin is the sole partner of that firm—I have known the defendant for some time as a customer of Morgan and Co.—on 14th January last year he was indebted to them about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—bills were runnign for that amount—on 29th January he came to my office—I had then a letter from Mr. Chaplin enclosing this copy of an order for 50 quarter-casks of brandy and 25 quarter-casks of sherry—I told him that I thought he was indebted too largely to Morgan and Co.—he said that we might hold over the order till the first bill was paid if we liked, but it would be a great pity to do so, as it was a right season to ship these goods, and if the shipment was deferred they would not go to so good a market—I said "You already owe Chaplin and Co. about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I cannot recomment them to extend that amount; if you wish to send them out now you can send the bills of lading through an Australian bank, who will advance you 80 per cent. on the invoice price, and Morgan and Co. will draw upon you for the remaining 20 per cent."—he said he could not do that, as the interest and charges would eat up the profit, that there was no risk in taking the order, and that I might look on the bills now running as good as paid—I said that part of the 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was consequent upon re<lb></lb>newals of bills, that I did not like renewals, and if he did any more busi<lb></lb>ness with them there must be no more renewals—he then agreed to that—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120079"></xptr>
               <p>he repeated several times that there was no danger in taking the order, and that the bills would be met at maturity—he said "If Morgan and Co., wish it, they can draw at a shorter date and then renew, making up the usual credit"—I said "I will agree to no renewals, but if you assure me that there is no risk in talking the order, and thar the running bills will be met regularly at maturity, I will write Morgan and Co. advising them to make the shipment, but in future your account must not exceed 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there must be no renewals"—to this he agreed—some of the goods were to be shipped to Melbourne and some Sudney—on the same day I wrote to Mr. Chaplin, and the goods were shipped—either I or my partner had the mate's receipt—I could not say that I saw it in the office—in the ordinary course of business it would be obtained first and be afterwards exchanged for bills of lading—this is the letter I wrote to Mr. Chaplin on 29th January: "I have seen dhyhenson and had a long talk with him; he is very reasonable, and says it you don't like to ship now you can wait till the next bill runs off. He offers to accept at four months and you to renew, but I hate renewals, and said he must not expect them in any case; to this he agrees. write and let me know if you like this arrangement. I don't think there is much danger in executing his last order now, but you can leave it till after the 9th March if you like." This is Mr. Chaplin's reply: "February 3rd. I am much obliged for your report as to G. F. D. Under all the circumstances I think it would be as well to execute his order; it will therefore be sent off this week." On 20th February I sent this memorandum to the defendant: "I herewith beg to hand you mate's receipt for G. F. D.,50 quarter-casks brandy and 20 quarter-casks wine shipped per your account per Ann Duthey for Sydney." Om 25th February, in consequence of what I heard, I went and saw the defendant at his offfice—I said "I hear that one of your bills for a small amount has been dishonoured, and I have come in consequence to demand the mate's receipt sent to you a few days ago"—he said "It is impossible to give tit you, as I have already sent it to my correspondent abroad"—I said "That is unlikely, as there has been no mail for Australia. since the date it was sent to you"—that was so—he said the dishonour of the bill was a temporary affair, and he expected to put it to rights in a day or two, when all things would go smoothly as before—I said I could not believe that, as a man doing his large business must be very hardly pushed to let a bill about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. come back dishonoured, and I again demanded the mate's receipt or the bills of lading, whichever he might have in his possession them—he declined to have anything more to say on the subject, and I then told him that I considered it a rank swindle, and should recom<lb></lb>mend Messrs. Morgan to prosecute him—a few days after that notice of his liquidation was sent my office—these bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), except the one dated 25th February, represent the outstanding liability—the last bill, dated 20th February, for 252<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was for these goods supplied—it was never accepted—none of the other bills were met—I was induced to part with the mate's receipt by the statement made by Dickenson to me at the interview at my office on 29th January—I should not have parted with it if it had not been for that. Croos-examined. I was agent for Mr. Chaplin in this transaction; the order was his and the goods were his—he finally decides whether the order small be executed—in this case he wrote me a letter stating that he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120080"></xptr>
               <p>decided to execute it—he selected the goods according to sample; I suppose he made out the invoice, I don't know it as a matter of fact, but there is no doubt of it—the goods are sent to this country by Mr. Chaplin; the invoice might go either before or after, and the goods are put on board—when the goods come here the name of the vessel by which they are to go Australia is given to me—that name is given by Mr. Dickenson or his clerk, and my clerks put the goods on board, and the mate's receipt is sent to Mr. Dickenson by another clerk of mine—the great question is whether the order shall be executed, and when we decide on that the ordinary steps are taken, among them the handing over of the mate's receipt—I did not see the defendant between 29th January and 25th February—I have known him a number of years, I could not say how long—I believe he has carried on an extensive businesss in the City for a good many years—I think it was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was due when I saw him in January—I attended the first meeting that was held after he filed his petition, and was appointed chair<lb></lb>man—the creditors met and his affairs were placed before them—I believe he afterwards went into bankruptcy—I had a claim of my own against him because I discounted one of the bills; I proved on the estate, and no doubt Mr. Chaplin did—I don't know that I was invited to oppose the bankrupt and to inquire into his proceedings; everything went to Messrs. Wontner and Sons—I made to opposition to the defendant's passing in bankruptey or getting his discharge—I never went to the Bankruptey Court and did not know that he was examined—Messrs. Wontner attended; I did not; I can't say whether Mr. Chaplin did—I saw in the paper that the defandant had passed his final examination and received his dis<lb></lb>charge—he had creditors to nearly 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; some to more than 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen the trustee about these proceedings—I attended before the Lord Mayor; he dismissed my application, and I was bound over—the conversaction I have related took place about this time last year—I have no notes of the coversation made at the time—I believe I am quite accurate in all I have stated to-day—I have not stated to-day that he told me at that interview that he never did such a thing as to obtain an advance on bills of ladinh through a bank—I don't think I said at the Mansion House, "I said, 'You can send the bills of landing and drafts thorugh an Australian bank, and obtain 80 per cent. upon them, putting a margin, and they drawing for the odd 20;' he said, I never did such a thing, and the expense would be too great'"—I believe I did not say so—I said something very like it, but not that—what I said was that he could not do such a thing because the expense would be so great—he did not say, "I never did such a thing"—I signed my deposition; it is incorrect—he said, "It would not do to do such a thing"—I cannot say whether I have said in evidence before to-day that he said there was no risk—you may not take it that I never did say so; I am not sure, I believe I have said so before to-day, but I don't know that I have said it in evidence—I don't know whether I said so at the Mansion House—he said that we might hild the order over till the first bill was met if we liked, but that it would be a great pity to do so as it would lose the season—he did not say he believed that the current bills would be met; he said I was to look upon the current bills as paid—I did not show him my letter to Mr. Chaplin; it was a private letter—the solicitors called some one at the Mansion House to prove the state of his account at Prescott's; not with my kmowledge; I did</p>

Morgan's In January went to Australia; he did make away with them—I attempted to attach them; we found afterwards that they were properly in the hands of persons out there I could not do so—I do not know that the con<lb></lb>signments signments have not all been realized; I have not inquird into that—I know that there has been a great depression in trade for the last eighteen months—I don't find that there has been a diffculty in getting returns from ship<lb></lb>ments ments to Australia—I think there is danger in any bill that is drawn, to a certain extent—before I saw the defendant I saw him that thay were not to trust him, and afterwards that there was little danger in doing it.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and clerk to Messrs. Wontner and Sons, solicitors for the prosecution—in March last I was not personally consulted about this matter by Mr. Chaplin, Mr. Blanchard Wontner was, and the matter was put into my hands on 4th April—the proceedings were com<lb></lb>menced at the Mansion House in December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The defendant had then passed his pro forma public examination—before that I desired to have a private examination—the trustee told me he was willing to give me any information I could desire—the process of the Mansion House was used after he had passed his last examination—Mr. Chaplin undoubtedly gave instructions to take criminal proceedings in March, when he was over here, not to me directly—I know that in the following month we were instructed; he did not instruct me personally, but I know as a fact that instructions had been given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I know perfectly that instructions had been given to prosecute; the prosecution was delayed until the appointment of a trustee.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I gave instructions to prosecute im<lb></lb>mediately On receiving notice of the postponement of the meeting; that was in March last year, then I left the matter in the hands of my solicitors—I was only here a few days after I heard of the prisoner's failure—I arrived in London on 24th March, and in Liverpool on 1st April—the instructions were given on the 27th I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi> Submitted that no case was made out on either Count. As to the first, nothing was obtained from Mr. Norris, the contract was made by Mr. Chaplin, and upon any representation of the defendant to him, but upon Mr. Norris's letters; and Mr. Norris was really acting under instruction received both from Mr. Chaplin and the defendant. As to the Second Count, there was no evidence of the contract having been obtained by fraud from Mr. Chaplin, he acted entirely upon Mr. Norris's report; and the statement made to him by the defendant was simply the expression of a confident opinion that the bills would be met, and not a statement of anything that was untrue.</p>

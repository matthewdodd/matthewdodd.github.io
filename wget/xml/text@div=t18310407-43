            . I am in the employ of Mr. Joseph Foot - he lives in Church-street, Spitalfields. I missed about a hundred and fifty yards of silk on the 13th of March; I believe it was on a Sunday - on the Thursday following it was brought to the warehouse by a constable - I knew it again; it was in two lengths, and one of them has a particular border - I superintend the manufactory, and I gave a different coloured silk for the border, to show the silk better; I can speak to it as being the same we lost from that, and from other circumstances - I did not know the prisoner before, but I have ascertained that he lives in Wellington-street, and is in the silk line.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of Police. I took the prisoner on the night of the 17th of March - I asked if he had had any dealings in silk with Denoird - he said No; I asked if he had sold any duplicate of silk to him - he said he had not: I then asked if he had pawned any - he said he had not; I took him to the watch-house; he lived at No. 29, Wellington-row, at the bottom of Pollard's-row, Bethnal-green - I found no silk there relating to this indictment; I had taken Denoird before that.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Hunt-street, Mileend New-town. I know the prisoner - I had no transaction about silk with him till the 16th of March, when I purchased a duplicate of him; I redeemed the silk from Mr. Harrison. in Tottenham-court-road - I offered it for sale at Mr. Godwin's, and he detained it; I was to give the prisoner 25s. for the duplicate - I gave him 10s. in part; we made the bargain at his house - he had come to my house the day before, and asked my wife if I would buy it; Mr. Godwin's detained the same silk which I got for the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did not you go to Mr. Foot's, and give the name of Simmons? A. I went to Mr. Foot's with Mr. Godwin's servant, and did give the name of Simmons, though I knew I bought it of the prisoner; I went with the Police-officer, and waited for Simmons coming home - we waited at Mr. Brown's, the Turkish Slave, in Brick-lane, till nearly eight o'clock; we went to several other houses, and as we could not find Simmons, the officer looked my up - I had no doubt I bought the duplicate of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did he ever go by any other name than Robertson? A.Not that I know of; I stated I had it of Simmons because they took me in a moment, and I hardly knew what to say - I said that wherever the silk went I would go, as I had actually borrowed the money of my wife's mother; I should not have offered it for sale at Mr. Godwin's, No. 7. Tottenham-court-road, when I had only redeemed it at No. 5, if I had known it was stolen - it is worth 2s. 6d. a yard, and there is nearly sixty yards of it.</p>

I have a duplicate of some silk pawned by the prisoner - it was similar to this, but I could not swear to this; there were sixty-four yards in one piece, and thirty yards in the other - I lent 5l. 10s. on it; I only know Denoird by his redeeming the silk.</p>

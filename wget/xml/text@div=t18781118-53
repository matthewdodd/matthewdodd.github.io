I am the wife of Daniel Lucy, a labourer, of 10, Rope yard Bails, Woolwich—on 18th Oct, a little after 6 o'clock in the evening, I went into the house of Mr. McCarthy, who lives at No. 6—while I was there the prisoner came in—I said to her"Kate, why should you say my girl is as bad as you are? "—she said "So she is "—I said "Why should you say so, she has never done anything out of the way, she was never in prison"—she took up a knife and hit me in the forehead and said "Was I in prison?"—I said "Yes you were, Kate"—Mr. McCarthy came round from the other end of the table where he sat, and she hit me over his shoulder across the nose with the knife, and the same blow cut my lip and</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Sharpe, a surgeon of Woolwich—I was called to the station to see the prosecutrix—she had a large wound on the forehead on the right side, between two and three inches long, and going to the bone; there was a second wound on the right side of the nose extending from the top to the lower portion, almost cutting that part of the nose off, and a third wound on the upper lip, cutting the lip right through to the teeth and exposing the teeth and gums underneath—the wounds must have been inflicted by some sharp cutting instrument only—she bled very much indeed—I dressed the wounds and sent her to the infirmary—she is now getting on pretty well, but seems weak as yet from the loss of blood.</p>

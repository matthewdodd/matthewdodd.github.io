            , and Henry Meyrick Hoare; I have known the prisoner many years, I remember his coming the 23d of July, about four in the afternoon, and presenting a draft, for which I paid him a 500l. a 300l. and a 50l. note; he said, the 50l. note was too large for him, as he, or Mr. Bray, were going to travel that night, and it would be difficult to change it on the road, I changed it for five tens; upon which he went away.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the whole of the conversation at that time? - A. It was; I never saw him again till he was in custody. At the time of his examination, I lamented that I was so unfortunate as to appear against him, as I knew him so well; he said it was unfortunate, but he was changed in his mind, or he should not have done it; he told me some particulars at the time, that passed, which I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bray keeps money at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose account was this charged to? - A.Messrs. Hoares; they have paid it. (Produces the draft). There is my writing upon it. (It is read).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; I have known him about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft, is that your hand-writing? - A. This is not my hand-writing, nor was it given by my order or consent, it is an imitation; I have not seen him since the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go away with your knowledge? - A. No; the 23d of July was Saturday, I expected to find him at the office; I received a note that he was going to see a friend, and begged leave of absence; I afterwards heard he was in Dublin, I received a letter from him on the 9th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. This man was in your service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He behaved himself extremely well? - A. Yes; he had a very good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Willoughby.) Q. Supposing this to be a forged draft, and you paid it, are you not liable to reimburse the money to Messrs. Hoare? - A. We do not consider ourselves in that situation? - A. We do not consider ourselves in that situation; I don't conceive myself liable to any thing except a fraud upon the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my Counsel; I have some witnesses attending; I wrote a letter to Mr. Bray in Dublin, desiring him to settle affairs, and waited ten days in Dublin for his answer. I did it in a paroxysm of madness, and was willing to make any atonement.</p>

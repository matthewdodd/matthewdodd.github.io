On the 12th of December I gave him a silver gilt repeater to clean; he brought it back; but not being perfect I sent it him again. When the gentleman came for it, I sent my boy to him; he sent me word, it was not done. I sent to him again to bid him to send it as it was, and I would give it to somebody else to do; then he sent me word that he had lent it. I went to him and asked him what he meant by lending a watch of that kind without my leave; he told me he had done it, but was sorry for it.

Upon which I told him I thought he had pawned the watch; he said if you will not believe me, send over to No. 4, Fair-street, Horselydown, and you will find whether I have pawned the watch or not. I said I would send Vaughan, a young man who works with me, if he would pay him for going; and if he had lent it I should be satisfied. He said he would. Mr. Vaughan went and brought the person to whom he said he had lent it; he was a Dutchman, a countryman of his. When he came he said to him in Dutch (I understand Dutch pretty well)</p>
               <p>"say that you have the watch and Mr. Arnold shall have it in a week." I then said to the person, are you a receiver of stolen goods? He said, sir, I beg your pardon; he desired me to say so, but I know nothing of it. Then he told me it was pawned. I sent for a constable and took him to the watch-house; the next morning I took him to Sir

               <p>The watch was given me to repair on the 5th of December; I repaired it and wore it in my pocket to regulate it. On the Saturday following I asked Mr. Arnold to let me have two or three guineas which I was in want of, he promised me the money, but gave me none. I agreed with him that he should not let me want money, and should let me have a guinea a week till my work was done. I finished some work for the Earl of Chesterfield, but Mr. Arnold made excuses, and said his lordship did not pay him, and instead of giving me a guinea gave me two or three shillings. I have been obliged to pledge my things to supply myself and my family.</p>
               <p>Arnold. I paid him a guinea a week; he was ever in my debt; he could earn two guineas and a half a week, but would not earn above twenty-five shillings.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Mr. Arnold made excuses about Lord Chesterfield's not paying him? - When Mr. Arnold had completed a watch, and delivered it at his lordship's house, I believe his lordship was out of town. Mr. Arnold went several times and could not meet with his lordship; it being a watch that came to a good deal of money he said he wished he could get it. I never heard him say that his lordship refused to pay him. I have lived with Mr. Arnold many years; I never knew him employ any person either in the house or out of the house without paying them as soon as their money was due, or before it was due.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Mr. Arnold ever made excuses, and said he could not pay us on the Saturday if he did not receive money from somebody besides his lordship? - I never heard Mr. Arnold say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time when I finished a watch of the same sort for Colonel Keppel, which he was disappoinded in selling, whether he did not send to a captain that owed him twelve pounds, and he not being at home, whether he did not give me a crown, and let you go without any money? - He never refused to pay me; I was generally paid first, and went away; he never refused paying any one to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This watch was given into my care; I appeal to your lordship and the jury whether this is stealing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, and in partnership with Henry Edwards—we live in Bridge-road, Lambeth. The prisoner was in our employ as an upholsterer at the time of this charge—he kept a private account with us, and bought things of us—the account had been balanced, and there was a balance due to us—we never gave him authority at any time to dis<lb></lb>pose of, or to pledge any property of ours—he was given into custody on our premises—I told him he was guilty of stealing goods, and I must give him in custody—he said, "I hope you will not give me into custody, I shall be able to get the things out"—I was willing to give him indulgence for a few days, but finally gave him into custody—I saw the piece of damask in question—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is our property.</p>

On the 4th of December I went to Mr. Attenborough's, and found the prisoner there, and this piece of damask—Mr. Attenborough said in his presence there were several things pledged there—I said I had long suspected him—the prisoner said, "I beg you will be lenient; if you will come with me to my house I will give you up the du<lb></lb>plicates of all the goods taken from your house."</p>

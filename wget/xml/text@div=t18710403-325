               <p>1st September I was a witness, at Marlborough Street, against a man named George—I met George, the day after, in St. Martin's Lane, and we went to a public-house there, where we found Shannon, Kingwell, M'Carthy, and the two prisoners—I went in a cab, with George, to High-gate, and the others followed, in a second cab—when we got to Millfield Lane, I was led out of the cab by Finch, who knocked me down, kicked me in the side, and knocked me about with a riding-whip, which he took from me—Brown dashed lumps of dry earth on my face, as I lay there, and I was left on the field—I was examined afterwards by a medical man, and gave evidence against the other men, who have been convicted. (<hi rend="italic">See Sessions Paper, October,</hi> 1870, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 618). I feel the effects of it now, at times, and my memory fails me very much.</p>

I am a cabman—on 2nd September, about 1 o'clock, I was hired in St. Martin's Lane, and took the prosecutor, and some men, to Millfield Lane, Highgate—I took Brown—I am sure of him—they got out at Millfield Lane—there was a second cab, taking some other people, who got out, too—they got larking, as I thought, and got out of my sight—they were away six or seven minutes, and some of them came back; but the prose<lb></lb>cutor did not come back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the prosecutor get out of the cab—he was not in my cab—the driver of the other cab is not here—mine was the second cab.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Norfolk Square, Hyde Park, and am in the General Post Office—on 2nd September, I was on the Hampstead Heath side of the Seven Ponds' Field, and saw two cabs come up to the lower stile, Millfield Lane—eight or nine men got out, and went into a field, and there seemed to be a general assault on one man, who I after<lb></lb>wards discovered to be Fairweather—I saw him out about the head with a stick, knocked down, and dragged to the second pond, where Brown flung clay, or mud, in his face—I was within a few yards of them—the lumps of earth were hard, dry clay, on the slope of the pond—his face was covered with blood, and he seemed quite insensible, when they left him lying there—he was taken by two men to the "Duke of St. Albans'," where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187104030061"></xptr>
               <p>they sponged him—I could not interfere, I had two ladies with me, and there were eight or nine great ruffians; but I saw him to the public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CBOOME</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On the 20th February I took the pro<lb></lb>secutor to Manchester, where he identified Browo from twenty others—I read the warrant to him—he said "Yes, I know I did it; I deserve all I get. I should not have done it if it had not been for others"—he said that several times, on the way to London in the train.</p>

                  </hi>. On 2nd September I was called to the police-station, and found Fairweather semi-conscious, and very much cut about the face and head; both his eyes were closed, and his left arm was injured—the injuries were caused by blunt instruments, or by kicks—he was in a very dangerous condition—he was handed over to Mr. Harris.</p>

                  </hi>. I received Fairweather into my care from Mr. Rawlings, and attended him six weeks or two months—he remained unconscious six or eight days, and after that he could scarcely articulate—I considered his life in danger for some time, after he recovered con<lb></lb>sciousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Brown's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor has a spite against me, because when I was in the same employ as himself (Dr. Bell's) I would not stick up bills in the City for him, and I was discharged.

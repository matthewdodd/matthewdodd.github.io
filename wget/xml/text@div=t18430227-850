                  </hi>. I am forty years of age, and am the wife of Thomas Magness. I fill the situation of upper bar-maid at the Auction Mart hotel—I was there for eleven months before this happened—it is an hotel behind the Auction-mart in Bartholomew-lane, and communicates with it—the lower part of the hotel is called the tap, and that part is under my ma<lb></lb>nagement—Mr. Baker is the keeper of the hotel—the prisoner was potman at the tap—he had been there five months—I noticed that his behaviour was very cross on the Sunday previous to the 12th of Dec.—he has attempted to kiss me, and I rebuked him for it—I have heard that he is twenty-one years old—he went by the name of John in the establishment—the housemaid is called Ann—on the evening of the 12th of Dec she complained, in his presence, that she and John had been locked in the cellar—I took no notice of it—it was afterwards mentioned to me that John and her had been in the bed-room together—in consequence of that, about a quarter to nine o'clock, when the prisoner came into the tap, I told him he had better be minding his work than playing—he said he had not been playing—I said it was false, he had—I said he had better be clearing his tables, that I had been clearing them all day, and he had better be clearing them himself—that was part of his duty—I told him he was in the cellar just now, referring to what I have mentioned—he said it was not his fault—he did not say he locked the door—somebody locked him in I believe—when I scolded him, he seemed very surly and sul<lb></lb>len—he cleared the tables, and after that he sat down on one of the tables—there were customers there, and he waited on them—the sulky or sullen ap<lb></lb>pearance continued—I had occasion to go past where he was sitting, and he said something to me—I did not hear what it was—I felt offended—I thought he was jeering me, and I called him a forward vagabond—later in the evening, he came to the bar for some porter, which he took out to a customer—when I spoke to him I scolded him about his work, and he said, "Go to heaven with</p>

               <p>you"—he was not long gone with the beer—I saw him come back—nothing more passed after that till Ann called him—she said, "Mrs. Baker wants you"—it was about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock—he left the tap in consequence of that and remained away till about eleven o'clock, which is the time we usually begin to prepare to shut up—it was his duty to shut up the shutters—I desired him to be called for that purpose—Sarah, another servant, called him—I did not hear him answer—he did not come—I rang for him—I did not hear him make any answer to the bell, and at half-past eleven, as he did not come, I proceeded to shut up the shutters myself—I did not fasten the door, as there was still some customers in the house—I came in again and attended to them—I returned to the bar—the customers did not stop long—they only came to the bar and had what they wanted—there are two gates outside the house—I proceeded to lock them at about a quarter to twelve—there are steps and a sort of iron railing—the whole is below the level of the street, down in a sort of area—I was fastening the right hand gate first, inside, intending to come back—I had gone up the steps to get to it—a young man, a customer, who had been in the house, seeing me come up the steps, came and asked what I was doing—I could not find the right key, and he helped me—I had never fastened the gate before—he was not on the outside—he had been having some<lb></lb>thing to drink—he did not go outside—another door is left open till twelve, and when he did go he went out that way—while I was fastening the right hand gate, at the top of the steps, the prisoner came half-way up the steps, as if to help me fasten the gate—I told him I did not want him—I said I had done the rest part of the work and I could do that—he said, "Go to hell with you," went down the steps, and stopped at the bottom—after I had closed the gate I came down, and the customer who had helped me came down with me—we passed the prisoner, standing at the bottom of the steps, and went into the tap, leaving him there—I served the customer with liquor—while he was drinking it I observed the prisoner come in—he said nothing—he passed through the tap and went in a direction that would take him to his bed-room, which is on the same floor as the tap, right facing it, at the left hand side of the building, about the middle of it—there is a door going out of the tap—the bed-room is not behind the bar—as you stand at the bar you can see his bed-room—it is on the other side of the building, a very little distance from the bar, just across the passage—there is the mart door about the middle of the passage, at the back of his bed-room—it was not my duty to fasten that door, it was his duty, but I went to do it—I took the key with me and a light in my hand—when I got into the passage, to fasten that door, I observed the prisoner towards the right, sitting on a pair of steps which were there—I went down the passage, in a direction from where he was sitting, leaving him behind me—as I went along I heard something behind me, and felt both his hands behind me, one on each shoulder—he did not say anything—I pushed him from me, and said, "Be quiet, sir, or I will call Mrs. Baker"—I proceeded to put the key in the door to fasten it—I was quite separated from him at that time—I heard something click, and just as I was in the act of turning the key I felt myself shot—I heard a report, as of the dis<lb></lb>charge of fire-arms—I heard the click as I was putting the key in the door—it was followed by the report instantly—I fell—I did not lose my senses at first, I fell on the ground immediately, it knocked me down—my falling with the candle in my hand put it out, and the place was in darkness—before I lost my senses I heard him say, "Woman, what have I done?"—after I laid there two or three minutes I got up—it was after I became insensible, immediately after he said, "Woman, what have I done?" and he fell down near me—I had said no<lb></lb>thing thing myself before he used that phrase, nor at any time before I lost my senses—before I became insensible, I felt something trickling in my hand—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270025"></xptr>
               <p>was afterwards found that it was blood—upon that I became insensible for a minute or two, and then I got up—I do not recollect rising, but I found myself on my feet again—I left the prisoner on the ground, I think—I went to the tap—I believe I tried to open the door to get into the street, but could not—I forgot I had locked it—when I turned round from the door I met the prisoner—there was a gas-light there, which reflects inside, and gave me an opportunity of seeing his person—I put my hand to my side, and said, "What have you done?"—he stood firmly fixed before me, with his right arm up, with a knife in it—he said, "Now I'll finish you"—there was blood on the knife—I put my hands together, and said, "For God's sake spare me," and rushed past him, screaming "Murder"—when I left that spot I was again in darkness—I did not fall during my progress—I scrambled along the wall, and eventually succeeded in getting up to my bed-room, which is along the passage and across the yard, in the upper part of the same build<lb></lb>ing—the prisoner followed me—as I was going along he said, "For God's sake stop, and I will not hurt you"—I think those were the exact words, or "Come to me, and I will not hurt you"—he said it more than once—that was while I was going along the passage—it was all dark there—I got into my bed-room—he came up after me—I hid myself by the side of the bed, and heard him say, "Where is she?"—the room was in darkness—he was in the bed-room at that time—soon after that the house was alarmed, a medical man was sent for, the police came in, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the tap of the Auction-mart coffee-house—I go by the name of Henry there—I remember the talk in the house some time ago about the prisoner being in the women's bed-room—the prisoner gave me an account of it a few days afterwards—he told me he went up to the window out of a joke to see them get into bed, and that after they were in bed, he lifted the window and got into the room, that he fell asleep by the side of the bed, and might have slept two or three hours—when be awoke he endeavoured to leave the room, but the door was fastened—in endeavouring to open it the noise awoke Mrs. Magness and the kitchen-maid—they got out of bed to see if there was any person in the room—I am not positive whether he said they both got out or only one; at all events, the kitchen-maid got out, lit a candle, and closed the window, when he saw that that was the case, he got under the bed, that the kitchen-maid fancying she heard a noise the second time, got out and found him in that position—he said neither Mrs. Magness or any one else was aware he was in the room till the noise awoke them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 648.) On the 12th of De<lb></lb>cember about midnight, I was on duty near the Auction-mart tavern—I heard the report of a pistol or fire-arms, and in about two minutes I heard a female crying, "Help, help"—I went near and found Cushway standing opposite the door of the Auction-mart tavern—in consequence of what she said, I got into the house at last by the door being opened by Mrs. Baker—I went through the further end of the coffee-room—I called out for the prisoner—I ultimately found him on the top of the stairs, and took him into custody—he said, "Here I am, here I am; what have I done, what have I done? "—I then appre<lb></lb>hended him—he said at the bottom of the stairs, "What a coward I must be, to shoot the woman I love, and that has been so kind to me"—I had charged him with shooting at Mrs. Magness, but said nothing to induce a conversation from him—he attempted to tear his heart out—he appeared to be very much excited.</p>

               <p>into the charge of Edwards, I went to see for Mrs. Magness—the prisoner said she was up stairs—I saw her in the bed-room in the arms of a person who was supporting her—I returned, and found the prisoner in Edwards's custody—after his throat was dressed, I asked him where the pistol was—he was on a form in the coffee-room—he said he had thrown it down in the passage—I went to the passage, where I saw the blood, and found the pistol—a little further on in the passage I found a razor-case, four or five yards from the pistol—I then went to search the bar, which is about four yards from where I found the pistol and razor-case—I found a knife on the bar counter, open, and wet with blood—I returned to the prisoner—he said while in the coffee-room, "Take the razor from my pocket—I have a razor in my pocket"—I saw Edwards take a razor from his right hand pocket, wet with blood—this now produced is it—I produce the pistol, razor-case, and clasp-knife—as we went through Bishopsgate-street to the station, he said, "O that woman! that woman!"—I took him from the station to St. Thomas's Hospital, and remained with him all night—he told me he had bought the pistol in Little Bell-alley for the purpose of shooting cats, and he had shot one about six weeks previous, and during that time the pistol had been loaded in his bed-room—he said be could not account where his senses could have been to have hurt the woman he loved, that she was in the act of locking the door, when he drew out the pistol and shot her, that he immediately cut his own throat, and they both fell to the ground together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am the medical person who attended Mrs. Mag<lb></lb>ness on the night in question—I found her standing, partly leaning against the bed—I caused her to be undressed, and examined the wound—there were two wounds, one at the upper edge of the eighth rib, on the right hand, and the other on the left side, opposite the cartilege of the sixth rib, about two inches below the heart, but that would vary in different individuals—I do not remember to have seen a pistol or gun-shot wound before, but I believe</p>

               <p>it to be so—I did not see the ball found in ber stays—I picked it up myself—I have applied it to the pistol—it appears to be a rifle-ball—this ball would have inflicted the wound—it must have passed through her body, from the back to the left side, about two inches below the heart—I believe the lungs to have been perforated—such an injury is very dangerous to life—she con<lb></lb>tinued in imminent danger till the middle of Thursday, the 18th—when she recovered a little I had some account of the transaction from her—I had a conversation with the prisoner about it—I said nothing to induce him to make a confession to me, nor threatened him if he did not—I requested to know if two balls were in the pistol or not—I asked him if he had ever any con<lb></lb>nexion with Mrs. Magness—he hesitated, and replied, "No"—I requested him to be careful what he said, not to injure her character, as he had endan<lb></lb>gered her life, and before he answered me any question not to be in a hurry—I cautioned him before he answered any question—he said that he withdrew a step when close to her, and then fired—he gave me no account of what led to this transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that all he said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All that I can remember at present—I had heard something said that might affect Mrs. Magness's character, before I went to him at the hospital—not from him, but generally—I did not go for the purpose of asking him whether he intended to confirm these rumours—I was not desirous of doing so—when I went there I asked him if he would answer my question—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have nearly taken the life of Mrs. Magness, don't ruin her character"—he said he went to kiss her, and she pushed him away, and then he stepped back, and fired—that did not occur to me before—I did not write down my con<lb></lb>versation with him at the time—I went to inquire whether there was wadding in with the ball—I had heard something said that might affect the character of Mrs. Magness, and was desirous of knowing-whether he intended to confirm the rumours—I asked him if he would answer my questions—I said, "Relate to me all that happened at the time," meaning at the time he shot her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with ray father, in Princes-street, Soho, and am an engraver. On Wednesday morning, the 20th of March the prisoner came to our shop to have a plate engraved, exactly hike the pattern of a bank note, which he produced—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said he wanted a fac-simile of that engraved—I said we could do it—he said he wanted an exact copy of that, with the stamp at the back—I told him it would require two plates to do that—I asked him how many he should want, and he said 3000—he wanted them that week, if it was possible to get them done—I told him we could not, and Monday was named—I asked him if he wanted a fac-simile of the signature—he said, "We will do that ourselves"—he left 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with me as a deposit—he asked what the printing would be—I said I did not exactly know, and asked him what he had been in the habit of paying—he said, "About 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hundred"—he then went away, and in about an hour I gave the note to my father, and told him what had passed—the prisoner wanted to know if I could do one while he staid, to see if it was correct—but I told him is must be engraved.</p>

                  </hi>. I am engraver. On the 20th of March I received this note from my son, with 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the following day the pri<lb></lb>soner came, and I saw him in the presence of my son—he wished me to engrave a plate as near as possible to correspond with the note in question, and also wished the government stamp at the back of it done—Iundertook to do it for him, and asked him for a further deposit—he asked me how much—I told him at least I should require 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he pulled a bag of sovereigns out of his pocket, and threw down four sovereigns and a half, which made 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—he wanted the plates to be done by the Monday following—that was the understanding, and 3000 impressions—they are £5 notes—he said he thought the first note he had brought not sufficiently legible as to the stamp on the back, and left me another country note, not of the same bank, but on which the stamp at the back was more legible—I have parted with that note by mistake since—I went the same day to Praed and Co., the London agents of the Cornish bank, and made a communication to them, and also wrote a letter by post to the firm, to Tweedy and Co. of the Cornish bank—On Saturday, the 23rd, the prisoner came again, and asked how I got on with the plates—I</p>

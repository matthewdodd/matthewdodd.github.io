               <p>JAMES ENGLEBURT. On the 3rd of April, about half-past nine o'clock, I was opposite <placeName id="t18340410-206-crimeloc1173">Shoreditch church</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I knocked up against the gentleman, and he charged me with stealing his handkerchief - he searched me, but I had not got it - he let me go, then came after me again, and gave me in charge.</p>
               <p>JAMES ENGLEBURT re-examined. Nobody else could have picked my pocket - no body else was near him - he was about three feet from me - my handkerchief was red, yellow, and black - I could discover the handkerchief he had was those colours, and fully believe it to be mine - I felt my pocket picked the moment before, and nobody was so near me as him - I saw it go out of his hand immediately - I can swear that no person was near me except the prisoner when I felt my pocket picked.</p>

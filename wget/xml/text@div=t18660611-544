                  </hi>. I live at 10, Dereham-terrace, Chelsea—about 5 o'clock, on 29th May, I was in Charles-street, Westminster—I went into a public-house—the two prisoners were there—I entered into conversation with them—I ordered a pot of beer and paid for it, and they assisted to drink it—I went into the back yard, and on returning, I found some one's hand in my</p>

About 5 o'clock, on this afternoon, I was in Charles-street, and saw Groves' holding Daley by the collar—they were struggling—I saw Daley take something from his breast, and pass it to Smyrk—Smyrk ran away, and I followed him, and called out, "Stop thief!" and he was stopped about seventy yards from the spot—I was taking him back, when a gentleman said, "A lad has picked up the watch, police-man," and produced it—I did not see it picked up—there was no one running but Smyrk—I took the prisoners to the station—they struggled very violently—Groves had had a little drink, but was perfectly sober—I was about thirty yards off when I first saw him on the ground.</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, in Newgate-street: The prisoner came into my house, and requested the favour to leave the basket till Monday; she said she was going to take it into the country to a town called Kent, to a lady; she said, a lady in Fleet-market gave them to her; I put my hand in the basket, and saw four fur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180005"></xptr>tippets; the constable searched, and found who the property belonged to; I detained her and the property.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable; I went into four or five shops to find the owner of the property; the prosecutor came, and owned the tippets directly.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The person whom I suspected to have robbed me of them, I think the woman by some means or other got them from him; I had some suspicions of my porter, that he had stolen them from me, and gave her the basket, it is my porter's basket; they, between them, wanted to make money on them; they are my property, they have my shop-mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going down Fleet-market, and I met this woman; she asked me if I wanted a job; I said, yes, and thank you too; she told me where to carry it; I went on, and forgot the place; I left the basket; I wanted to see if I could meet her again; this man looked at the basket, and had me taken up.</p>

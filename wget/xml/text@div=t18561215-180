                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Ricketts, Smith, and Cutts, coal merchants, of Tooley-street, and am also trade assignee under the estate of John Shapman, an insolvent. I was appointed on 6th Nov., 1856—I obtained, as trade assignee, this order (<hi rend="italic">produced, dated 21st Nov.</hi>) to seize the goods of John Shapman—before the Commissioner made the order he investigated the matter—I went down on receiving the order to Shapman a premises, and saw two vans, three horses, a set of harness, and a cart on the premises—the prisoner was there part of the time—I knew him previously, and he knew me perfectly well—he had not spoken to me as assignee—I had shown him my warrant, and he said that the goods were his—he did not produce any document, but I afterwards saw a bill of sale in his hands—I made a return to the Insolvent Court that I had seized the goods, and then obtained an order for the sale—that was on a Saturday; I am not quite sure whether it was 22nd Nov.—I heard nothing more, but on the follow<lb></lb>ing Tuesday, as I was leaving my office, about half past 6 o'clock, two policemen, and Gadsden, and Mr. Perry, a solicitor, introduced themselves to me—I applied to Mr. Gadsden to know if he gave me in charge—he said, "I do"—Mr. Perry said that they charged me with stealing two horses, two vans, and a set of harness, which the officers were there to take me to prison for—the constables took me into custody; I was taken along the street to the station, and a charge was made against me—I saw Gadsden sign this charge sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was locked up in a cell for little more than an hour, until the inspector came—my partner was there, bail was given, and I appeared before a Magistrate next morning, and was discharged—before Shapman was insolvent, the defendant was his carman; he came as his carman to fetch coals, up to the time of the hearing at the Insolvent Court, up to 22nd Nov.; but after Shapman became insolvent, the defend<lb></lb>ant came in his own name—up to that time I knew him in no other capa<lb></lb>city than as carman to Shapman—my claim on Shapman was 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Mine is the Bermondsey station—I have known the defendant since this matter—I first saw him at the Stones-end police station on Monday, 24th Nov.; Mr. Perry, who came with him, said that they wanted a policeman to take a party into custody for stealing some horses and vans—having some previous knowledge, I asked him if it was the horses and vans that were in Castle-street—he said, "Yes"—I said that I believed it was more of a civil than a criminal affair, and he had better take some other course—Mr. Perry said, "I mean to give Mr. Cutts into custody"—Gadsden said, "We will give him in charge"—I said, "You had better consider of it"—next morning Mr. Perry and the defend<lb></lb>ant came to the Bermondsey station; Mr. Perry said that they wanted a policeman to take the wharfinger into custody—he then seemed to consider again—he said, "Well, I am not exactly ready"—I said, "Well, if you wish to do it, you had better do it while the Magistrate is sitting, but I advise you to consider again"—he said, "I am a professional man; I know my business"—I said, "Yes," and I appointed 2 o'clock, when I would have a constable ready to meet them—I waited some time at the station, but they did not come—I went to the station again about 7 o'clock, or half past, and found the prosecutor locked up in the cell—having a knowledge of the circumstances, I took substantial bail for his appearance the following day before the Magistrate—I cautioned the defendant at least half a dozen times—there was no Magistrate there when they came, not after 5 o'clock—Mr. Cutts was taken before a Magistrate next day, and discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The more you cautioned Mr. Perry, the more indig<lb></lb>nant he was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I cautioned both of them, but the prisoner had very little to say.</p>

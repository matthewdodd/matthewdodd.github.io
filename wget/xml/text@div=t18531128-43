                  </hi>. I work in a brewery. On Tuesday evening, 18th Oct., I was at the Roebuck public house, which is about three quarters of a mile from Claremont-street, Edmonton—it was about 11 o'clock at night—I saw Pluck there—I had known him a little while—he had a bag with some money in it, but what there was I cannot say; it was a largeish bulk, and he had a handkerchief likewise—he pulled the bag out of his pocket; it was darkish, something like a sample bag—I think it was canvas, I could not say—it looked more like that—he had a handkerchief round his neck; he pulled it off and put it in his pocket—I should know the handkerchief again if I were to see it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—lie drew a watch from his waistcoat pocket, and he showed it to all that were in the room—he tried to open it, but could not for a little while, and he said he would throw it across the room—at last he opened it, and showed it to all round the room—when he first came in he saw me, and said, "Will you stand half a pint of beer?"—I said I had got no money, and after a little while he drew the bag from his pocket, and said, "Never mind, I have got plenty of money, let us have a pot"—this is the watch he had—I did not have it in my hand, but I looked at it the same as others—there was no key or guard to it—he said he had left the key and guard at home on the shelf.</p>

I was at the Roebuck when the last witness was there—I saw Pluck; I knew him previously by sight—I did not know his name—we were there just before 11 o'clock—I know the time by the time we left work—after we were there, Pluck came in the parlour where we sat—there were four persons in our company before he came—there were no strangers—Pluck first asked Bosher if he could stand half a pint of beer—lie said-no, he could not—Pluck then offered to toss for a pot, and after that he produced money in a bag, something similar to a sample bag—it was rather a dirtyish colour—I cannot say whether it was canvas or leather—it was not leather—I did not see him take any money out of it, but it appeared to have money in it—he took out a watch, and showed it round—it was in a silver case—I think this is the same watch—I did not have it in my hand—I was near to it—he handed it round in his hand—he showed a handkerchief—I believe this handkerchief before me to be the one—we did not stay long; we left Pluck there when we came away.</p>

H."—I swear I saw "G. H." at the Roebuck—I did not point out the letter when I was at the Magistrate's; I was not asked—I did not hear all Mr. Hedge's examination; I was not there quite so soon—I was there when I identified the handkerchief—I was not there when he pointed out the marks—I told Mr. Hedge I saw the letters on the handkerchief—I told</p>

H." on the handkerchief—I do not know where he lives, to the present time—I know where the street is—I could find out the place of the robbery if I went to look; but I had plenty to do without going—I did not go to Mr. Hedge at all, I met him—I did not notice that any money was produced out of the sample bag in the Roebuck—he opened the bag, and nestled it up—I could see it was silver—by what I could see it looked very much like a sample bag—I do not say that I will swear to this watch without any doubt—I thought it was the same—it looks very much like it—I believe it to be the same; I had not it in my hand at all—when the money was shown in the room there were only us four and Pluck—there was one came in directly afterwards—the baker and Brown are at Tottenham.</p>

On the evening of this robbery I saw Charlton, about a quarter past. 6 o'clock, in Claremont-street—he was going towards Hedge's house—I was with a brother constable when he first saw Pluck, but I left to go after Charlton—I was with Hack at Pluck's lodging—I assisted him in making the search in the bedroom—I believe Pluck's mother rents the house—I found 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and this watch, buried in the garden, in a silk handkerchief, about 20 yards from the house—I saw Hack find in the bedroom two ear drops and two pieces of coin, in a flower pot, buried in the soil—I examined the rear of Hedge's house, near the washhouse door—it was not paved, it was gravel, but about 100 yards from the house we could trace where footsteps had been—we traced them over the wall into a field at the rear of the house—I took off Charlton's shoes, and compared them with the footmarks.</p>

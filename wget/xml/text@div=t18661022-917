               <p>was in our employment—his duties were to see the invoices from the workmen, enter those invoices into a book expressly for the workmen, to bring the book to me, and I would then see that the entry corresponded with the invoices—I then attach my initials, "M. D.," and give an order on the petty cashier for the amount—the book is what is called the "Bought Ledger Book," for work only—it was the prisoner's duty to give the order to the workmen—I have always given the orders to the prisoner—the petty cashier paid the workmen—latterly the prisoner has paid them—I remember on 10th August the prisoner bringing in this invoice—the sum total now is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he brought it to me it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he put his initials on it—it is an account due to a glass-cutter in our employment, named Garland—the prisoner also brought to me this order for the payment of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when he brought it to me—the "o" has been taken out and the "elve" been put in, and I before the 2—there is my mark in the ledger, which I invariably put—the figure 2 was in the shilling column when I put my mark—I find 12 now—the 1 is put over part of the D of my initial—the cashier would pay the money on the production of that order if it was signed by any member of the firm.</p>

                  </hi>. In August last I was petty cashier in the employment of Messrs.

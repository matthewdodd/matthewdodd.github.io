               <p>Q. Are you a Christian? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been baptized? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner? - A. The prisoner came one day with a pair of shoes for my mistress, October the 5th, about three o'clock in the day, my mistress was out, and I took the pair of shoes from him, and put them into the parlour, then she came home and tried on the shoes, and left them in the parlour and went up stairs; the man went away immediately, he left the shoes, and came an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him your mistress was not at home? - A. Yes, I told him so, and he went away directly; at the time he came again, a coach came to the door, I went up stairs, he was standing at the servant's hall below, he came down the area steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him through the area? - A. Yes, the area-door was open, and he came down the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were called away from the door? - A. Yes; I was obliged to go up at the same time he was talking with me; I did not shut the pantry-door, I just shut it to, I left him in the hall; I brought the shoes, after the carriage was gone, and gave them to him, he went away directly; I did not miss the things till my fellow-servant came in; he went out to buy some things, when he came in to put them in the drawer he missed the things, he asked me what had become of them; I told him I could not tell, I washed them and put them in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you miss? - A. I missed a silver tea-pot-stand, three silver tea-spoons, a silver milk-pot, a table-cloth, and a pair of silver sugar-tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all silver? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you miss? - A. A pack of cards, and my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all there when the man came? - A. They were all there a little before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. About half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been in the hall? - A. No; in the place all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes; I remember his features very well, he stood up and talked with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes, I am sure he is the man; I was sent for to Bow-street to know whether it was the same man; I came into the room and found my hat upon his head.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was he taken? - A. I cannot rightly remember, I think two weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he taken by? - A. I don't know who took him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your hat was found upon him; how soon after this did you find the hat again? - A. The hat was not found till he was taken at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the hat that was found upon him? - A. It is here. (It was produced by the officer).</p>
               <p>Q. Independent of the hat, are you sure of his person? - A. Yes; I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Were none of the other things found upon him? - A. No; nothing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Your name is Jackson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master's name is Jackson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are no relation to him to be sure? - A. No; I have been christened so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever learned your catechism? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you when the prisoner called at your house? - A. Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other people in the house? - A. There are always a good many servants in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. The man told you he would call in an hour, and kept his word? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you say you saw this silver to the time it was missed? - A. About half an hour after I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen it since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The servants were in the kitchen at the time this man was on the stairs going down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is not very likely that a man should go into the kitchen when the servants were there? - A. It was not in the kitchen; it was in the pantry, in a different part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner was at the steps, you went up to the coach? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see into the kitchen? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see any body go away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body observe any person go to this pantry? - A. No, they could not; the servants were all about, but not in my apartments.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this hat? - A. Hanging up in the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had a hat on when he went to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300043"></xptr>Q. Your hat was lost, and found upon his head? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were rather suspicious that the man had stole the silver, as he went away with two hats? - A. He left his and took mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person in the house? - A. Only the servants.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know how many hats the other servants have? - A. There is no man servant but me and another.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether he had two hats? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of marks are there about this hat? - A. It is a plain hat.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark about it? - A. It is a hat that was brought from the West-Indies, and my master gave it me; I took the hat and scraped the dirt off the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, I suppose people scrape their hats when they are dirty - but there is no mark about it by which you can swear to it? - A. I am sure it is mine; I know the hat by experience.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear to it though there are no marks about it? - A. I know it is mine, he took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, Sir, did you see him take it out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a mark in the hat you lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was no mark in the hat you found; and will you swear it is your hat - do you know that man's life is at stake? - Now attend to that-upon recollection, as an honest man, will you undertake to swear to it? - A. It is an old hat, it was given to me, I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. The hat you lost was the hat you wore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether this is that hat you wore you cannot undertake to say? - A. I have had it long enough to know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that hat is your's though there is no particular mark about it, when that man's life is at stake? - A. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is not that the hat you lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. With respect to your master, had he any other servant but yourself? - A. No; only one man servant.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I took this hat off the prisoner's head, the 4th of November, at a public-house, the Brown-Bear, opposite the Public-office Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it off his head? - A. By the Black coming out of the office, he said he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him that hat? - A. Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you shewed him that hat? - A. He said, that is mine, directly, that is the hat; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The man had that hat on at the Public-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any appearance of the mark being taken out? - A. Yes; at the bottom, the lining is taken out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. It is no uncommon thing for the lining at the bottom, you know, to fall out of a hat - nine out of a dozen do so, don't they? - A. Not if it is placed fast in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you return the hat back again to me? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You did, in the Brown-Bear; I came up into the office with the hat on, I had friends there, and I might have changed it if I liked.</p>
               <p>Witness. When I had it in my custody I kept it, he never had it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing farther to say.</p>

             sworn. - I am beadle of St. Martin's parish: On the 2d of August. I was in Bedfordbury, about twelve o'clock, the witness came wringing her hands, and sereaming terribly; I asked her the cause, and she said, a woman with a child, in a bed-gown; that was all I could get out of her; a man passing by, said, there was a woman of that description gone into the Old Scotch-arms; I went in, and charged her with stealing a child, for I did not know what it was; she said, the child was her own: the girl then came in, and said, you cruel woman, you have got my notes and my money, which she denied; then I asked her to go with me into another room, to search her; I took her into that room, and by the corner of the fire-place was a cupboard without a door, and the moment she went into the room, she went up to that place, and turned short; I thought she had thrown something there, she said, she had not; I told her, I should search her, but first I should search that cupboard, where there were pots and kettles and lumber; I began so to do, and was some time in pulling out the pots, and she said, to save further trouble, I did throw it there; I looked for some time, and found it, (produces it); the girl described what was in it, and it tallied with her description.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was tying up some flowers, under the Piazzas, and this girl came up and asked me for a pin, which I gave her; and she desired me to put that bit of rag a good way down her bosom, and I did; she staid after that, I dare say, ten minutes, picking up some flowers that I had thrown away; after the was gone, I found the rag among my flowers, and I went with it to this public-house; I heard the girl crying, I told her, I had not got the money, I had got the bit of rag, and threw it under that place.</p>

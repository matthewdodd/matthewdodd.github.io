            . I am a smith, and live at Wimbledon. I have taken coals of the prisoner, and have paid him money at different times. On the <rs id="t18241202-129-cd724" type="crimeDate">2d of October</rs>

I paid him two sovereigns. I had paid 2 l. in August - that was one sovereign and 1 l. in silver. I supposed the coals to be Mr. Brown's, because they came in his cart. I never gave any order to Mr. Brown himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I sell you ten sacks, which I said I had paid for out of my wages? - A. I never had ten sacks of you in my life. I never heard him say any thing about them being his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the money for these ten sacks of coals, and my fellow-servant was there, and helped me to unload them.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN re-examined. Q. Did he ever buy any coals of you for the purpose of selling them? - A. No; I never stopped any thing out of his wages. I never heard of his buying coals of any other person.</p>

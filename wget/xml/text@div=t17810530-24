               <p>I am chief cook of the Middle Temple. I gave the last witness a guinea to buy some goods. I was at the taking of the prisoner; I took her before the justice. She was examined; we found half a guinea and 3 s. 6 d. in her pocket. The husband was ordered out of the room, and the justice asked her, how she came by the money? She said, her husband gave it her, while they were at breakfast, at nine that morning. Then the prisoner was put on one side, and the husband was called in. The justice asked him, if he had given his wife any money that morning? He said, no, he had not given her a farthing that morning; nor could he trust her with a shilling; that she would pawn every thing he had.</p>

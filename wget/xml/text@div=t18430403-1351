I found Elizabeth Loader, took her into the house, and befriended her—she suddenly went away, on the 17th of March, while I was gone out—I missed a watch and chain, and locket—she would have an opportunity of taking them—I never saw either of the prisoners before—Loader never came back.</p>

On Monday, the 20th of March, I went to No. 20, Carlisle-street, where the prisoners lived—I saw Margaret first—I said I came about a watch she had pledged—she said the had pledged it; she found it in the Edgeware-road—she produced this cap, and said she found this watch-chain and locket in the cap on the morning of the 18th, close against her coffee-stall—I asked if she knew a girl named Elizabeth Larey, or Loader—she hesitated a few moments, and at last said, "No"—James then said, "We don't know anybody"—Margaret produced the dupli<lb></lb>cate of the property—I told her she had done very wrong in pledging them, if she had found them—I took her into custody—James being very ill, I did not take him—after the examination the next morning I went back to the pri<lb></lb>soners' lodgings with my brother officer, and found this cap, bonnet, boots, and shawl, which she said Loader wore when she absconded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Foster, Butland, and Co., tailors, No. 186, Great Portland Street—on 29th December the prisoner into the shop and said, "Mr. Nicholl has robbed you of the goodwill of the business; he is a scamp and a blackguard"—I asked him what he meant by it—he said, "It is quite true, and you can have it in black and white'—I said "I should like to have it in black and white"—he said, "If you write down at my dictation you can have it," and I then wrote this at his dicta<lb></lb>tion,</p>

               <p>and he signed it said it was quite true. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Mr. Box says that Mr. Nicholl has robbed Foster, Butland, and Co. of the goodwill of 186, Great Portland Street. J. Box.") I afterwards sent that to Mr. Nicholl—I have known him some time—he is a solicitor, a member of the firm of Nicholl and Sharp, of Great Portland Street and King William Street, City—he acted for me in the purchase of the business—we bought the goodwill as well—there is no truth in the allegation that Mr. Nicholl has robbed us of the goodwill of the business—I wanted to find out whether it was so or not if anybody has robbed us of the goodwill I should say it was the prisoner—he said he had been round to all his customers and told them it was made nothing but a slop-shop now, and told them not to come there and buy any goods whatever.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Fifteen-foot-lane, St. Pancras,' next door to the prisoner. On 22nd June I heard a noise outside the house, went to the door, and saw the prisoner fighting with a young man, and using gross obscene language—he went into his house afterwards—I still heard a sound outside the house of fighting—it lasted about ten minutes—the prisoner came to the door—there was a mob of people and children there—I saw him throw a ginger-beer bottle, which struck the boy Reed on the forehead, and knocked him down—he was about nine or ten feet from him—the crowd were not taking any part in the matter—I could not see who he threw it at; he threw it among the crowd—he appeared very angry—he was not drunk—I ran for a policeman.</p>

On 22nd June, Reed was brought to me, bleeding from a wound in the fore<lb></lb>head, which he said he had received shortly before—it was two inches long, sod down to the bone—I should not have thought it had been inflicted by a ginger-beer bottle unless I had been told so, because it was a clean cut—it might have been done by a fragment of a bottle—if it was done with a whole bottle it must have been thrown with extreme violence.</p>

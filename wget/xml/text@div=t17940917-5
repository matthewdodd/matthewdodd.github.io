About half past ten, the 20th of August, at night, my house was shut up; a Mr. Hansel, a constable, came and knocked at the door, and he told me the rioters were coming to my house; I let Mr. Hansel in.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had let Mr. Hansel into your house, was the door shut again? - The inner door was, and the outer door was on the jar. He desired me, if I had got any property, to take care of it; I went up stairs and I laid my hand on a little writing desk, and Mr. Hansel called out again, and said, for God's sake make haste, for here they are; with that my wife took the child out of the bed, wrapped up in a blanket, and ran off; I followed, went down immediately with this desk under my arm; then I made my best escape out at the door, and by this time the bricks were flung in at the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go out, at the back part of the house or the front? - There is only one door to the house, the front. When I came out at the front door, the prisoner at the bar, of the name of Berry, was there, and a shorter one, and the rest of the mob were situated opposite to the pile of bricks, at the front of the house; I suppose when I first came out, there might be twenty or more.</p>

            Was it as soon as you came out of the door that you saw Berry and the other? - It was immediately; they were rather within the door; I was going out at the door as they were coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into the house beyond your situation? - I did not stop to see; then the other took me by the collar, and asked me if I was not a crimp?</p>
               <p>Q. Can you point him out amongst the prisoners? - He is not in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Berry to you at the time he collared you and asked you this question? - Not a yard from me; there was just room for me to pass between. I went immediately to a friend's house with this desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give him? - I told him I was no crimp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass in the passage between you and that man that had hold of you, and Berry? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was anxious to get out of the house? - I made the best of my way to a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you observed when you got out of the house? - They were slinging in brick bats through the windows.</p>

            How were they behaving themselves, quietly or otherwise? - They were in a riotous manner, hallooing out, this is the house! this is the house! d-mn him, we will kill him, if we can find him, or something to that purpose.</p>

            Was that the language of this party of people so assembled? - It was. They were joined at last by two hundred at least, in about fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to when you had escaped from your house? - I went to a neighbour's house, of the name of Cocket, in Mulberry-court, about one hundred and fifty yards from my own door, up an alley; then I returned back to my wife's mother, to see if my wife and child were safe; they had got out of the house before I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any other persons in the house when you came away? - The maid was in bed, and the lodger and the boy; that was all the people that were in the house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170034"></xptr>Q. When you returned from this neighbour's house, did the neighbour go with you or any body else? - The neighbour was not at home; I gave the box to his lodger to take care of it. I returned by myself; the light horse association had been there, and were there; I got into my house before they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how soon after your return to the spot, you got into your house? - I suppose in about five minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observation on what was passing while you was near the spot, before you went into your house? - I could not, there were a crowd of people flinging at the house, and a great many people in the house spilling of the liquors.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell my lord and jury every thing that you observed, when you returned from your neighbour's house. what they were doing, and how they were acting, and how many people appeared to be there? - When I returned there were two hundred, as I said before; when the horse came they drove them all away. I believe there were one or two taken; I don't know which at that time. When the light horse came, they all ran away and hid themselves in the quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into your house? - I did; but before I went in I met the prisoner Berry, in custody with an officer, about ten yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you know him to be the man that you had seen when you fast attempted to get out from your house? - Yes, I did very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about it? - I told him that he was the man that first knocked at the door; it is this nearest to me, I believe; he had a black beard on then, and a brown coat and black hair; I believe that is I cannot swar to him not.</p>

               <p>Q.

I ran up to the watch-house as fast as I could, and there were the light horse gone up to guard the prisoners to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity, so as to speak to your own knowledge, how long they might be in the second attack? - I went up to the watch-house, and told them the rioters were doing more mischief than they were before; they came down again as soon as I could make them sensible, and dispersed the mob again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come back again with him? - I came back with the constable; there were a great many in the house, and they cried out, there is the horse coming again, and they rushed out again; I see them slinging the bricks, but I could not distinguish one from the other; they were soon dispersed, we searched the house, but we could find nobody in it.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you first discovered he was in your house? - About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. What part of the house was he in? - In the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been there all night, I suppose? - He told me he was pushed down by the mob, the last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him out by going into the cellar yourself, or by hearing any noise? - It was the maid went down into the cellar to draw some beer, about seven o'clock; she is not here; the boy is here; she came running out of the cellar, and said, there is a man in the cellar; I see him coming up the stairs of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him, or he to you? - I asked him what brought him there? He told me he was pushed down by the mob, the last night; I asked him his name? he would not tell me; then I asked him his business? he said he was a razor grinder; I desired him to sit down, and I desired the people of the house to take care of him, while I went for a constable; but he did not know I was gone. I did not talk to him any more.</p>

            What were the contents? - Ale. There was a partition in the cellar, and by his turning over the partition he overturned the casks; the partition had been made on account of the water coming into the cellar, and in order to hide himself, this cask was overturned.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you had provided an officer, I suppose, Rainbow was taken into custody? - Yes. During the time I was gone, there were a number of people came to the house, and he got into the front room, and said, that he was kidnapped.</p>

            Can you speak to seeing either of the men at the bar about your premises that night? - I can only say to him in the black hair, to the best of my knowledge, that is Berry.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man that you saw in the hands of Harper, the same man that you had seen in your house before, with the person that collared you? - He was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I will ask you a question or two. From the deplorable state of your mind, I should think on such an accident, that you was a good deal confused? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Very much flurried? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Was you able to account for this attack being made on your house? - I did not know of it four minutes before it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to guess at any cause why they should attack your house? - Not in the least; I never expected it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We had got to the length of your acknowledging that you was in a considerable flutter of mind, very much distressed? - It was enough to make me so.</p>
               <p>Q. I think so too; that makes it more likely you should not recollect the persons of the people? - That man, Berry, I took particular notice of.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this? - It might want about a quarter to eleven.</p>

               <p>Court to Wheeler. Look attentively at all the five men; examine them at your leisure; tell us who it is that you suppose to be Berry? - I cannot say now; this is Berry in the green coat; I would not wish to swear to him now; I cannot.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the officers belonging to Worship-street, near Shoreditch Church; I was at the Sash public house after the prisoners were secured. I secured Berry.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Berry? - That black complexioned one in the green coat and yellow waistcoat. I took him after the gentlemen horsemen had been there, and before they came in. I was surrounded with the mob, for I was near the man's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it you came to the house? How soon after the mob being collected? - Very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing when you came to the house, before the light horse came there? - They were tearing the house to pieces, and some of them in the house, breaking the windows; but who they were in the house, or did it, I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think there were in the whole? - A great number, and they were like lions, they roared like lions, and extremely riotous.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think there were? - I dare say there was a hundred; I cannot positively tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170037"></xptr>Q. You say the light horse came and dispersed part of the mob? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you apprehended Berry? - The light horse had been there and dispersed part of the mob, and I myself was then released from the mob, for I was before surrounded with them; then I withdrew from the door a little way; I was nearer to the door of the Sash public house before; and when I thought the mob was pretty well dispersed, I then went towards the Sash again; there were a great many people there then; I got pretty near the sash to the mob, and I saw the prisoner Berry, come from the mob; I says to him, what have you been at? I really don't know what answer he gave me; but I told him, seeing him come from that mob, he should go with me to the watch-house; and in taking him along from there to take him to the watch-house, I met Mr. Wheeler.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress was the prisoner in at that time? - In a working dress; not as he is now. Mr. Wheeler came up to him, and said, I will swear that is the first man that entered my house; the prisoner declared that he was in bed, and he got out of his own bed to join the mob; I asked Mr. Wheeler to aid and assist me; and we took him to the watch-house, and there we secured him; that is all I know of Berry; I know no harm the young man did, because I never see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We are pretty well ac- quainted with you in this Court? - O yes!</p>
               <p>Q. At this time, you say, the young man did nothing? - I did not see him.</p>

               <p>I am a peace officer belonging to Worship-street police office. I was in Moorfields watch-house, Wednesday, the 20th of August, about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you called out from thence? - I was not; Mr. Hansel and I went out together, to go to Mr. Wheeler's; we got there about half past ten; I called to Mr. Wheeler; and Mr. Wheeler came to me, and I observed the house all quiet, and nothing broke; when I went in I told Mr. Wheeler to get any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170038"></xptr>that he had of any property to take it away, because I heard the mob were coming to his house; with that Mrs. Wheeler came down with the child in her lap and went away; I went out with Mrs. Wheeler, but another officer conducted her away with the child; I went back again to fetch Mr. Wheeler, about half past ten, it was all in about three or four minutes; when I returned I called out to Mr. Wheeler, why don't you come down, they are all a coming; just as we came out at the door, Mr. Wheeler had a little desk in his arm, as he came out at the door, one was in long clothes, and the other in short clothes, in a waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the man? - It is this man in blue; I believe his name is Todd, I believe; but I was so bad the next day that I fainted away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other? - I don't recollect the other. The other man said to Mr. Wheeler as he came out, here comes a crimp; I said, he is no crimp; then he says, d-mn you, you are a crimp; and I turned away to look for some of my fellow servants, and I had my staff in my hand, and I held my staff this way, and I turned about to look for some of my brother officers that I expected from the watch-house, and I had not gone ten yards from the door, when I was knocked down with a brick bat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who threw that brick bat? - I thought it was Todd, because I saw nobody behind me but Todd; I was quite flunned with the fall, and I catched hold of a man behind me by his apron, and it happened to be Todd, and I pulled myself up by him, and I laid my head over his shoulder, and I had a cutlass in my pocket, and the handle of it came out, and they said, d-mn his eyes, he is a crimp, he has got a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man at all active in the riot? - I did not see him active at all, only he was in the riot.</p>

            That man that you laid hold of, was the man that came into Wheeler's house? - He was, and I saw nobody behind me; in a minute's time they all came flocking about the house, a great crowd, and the windows were all knocked out.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you suppose there were? - I was not sensible, because I was knocked down the second time and carried away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had raised yourself from the ground, by taking hold of his apron, what followed then? - Another man with a white jacket came and gave me a blow upon my head, which brought me to the ground senseless; then I could do no more; I was carried to the watch-house; in a short time he was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other persons brought there? - Yes, Mr. Harper brought a man there, and that was the man that came first up to Wheeler's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides that man that Harper brought, what other man came? - The next man that was brought was Todd; I thought I knew him, that is the man, I believe that cut me.</p>

            Had you any doubt that that was the man that you had had the scuffle with? - I could not tell; I said, at the time, that was the man that cut me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You have told us that when Todd was brought to the watch-house, that you even then could not tell exactly whether he was the same man or not? - Not exactly; I said he was the man; I got up and could hardly stand, and I said then, here is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. In short you was very much hurt? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And although you have been in this employment a number of years, yet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170039"></xptr>you was so much affected that even the next day you fainted away, when the matter came on again? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say likewise there were at least two men dressed in the same way you have described, and it is natural enough that at that time of night you could not distinguish one man from another, but all that you speak of with tolerable certainty, is, that if it was Todd that served you so, he permitted you to rest on his shoulder, to support yourself? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you take on yourself to swear that you do or do not know the man positively? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Although you did at the magistrate's say, on your first impression, you cannot keep to that positive evidence, but you have since altered your opinion? - And I desired the constable to look at his jacket, to see whether there was any blood on it, and there was not.</p>

I was informed he was the servant of the house; I then let him go. The next person I saw was Todd, the prisoner at the bar, in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing? - I did not see him acting; he opened the door to come out of Mr. Wheeler's house, he shut the door after him, and I took him into custody, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person in the way to the watch-house, that you had any conversation with at all? - Some person assisted, but who it was, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Wheeler at all? - I did not see him at all till the examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Todd do any thing at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Rainbow? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place between Rainbow, Todd, and any body in you presence, in the watch-house? - No, except Mr. Blackiter, when I brought him into the watch-house, he got up and said, that is the villain that cut me; his head was bleeding. He was then locked up, and I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Slater, you told my lord and gentlemen of the jury, that Todd was not active in the least, that he merely came out of the house, shut the door, and that you laid hold of him; I believe Blackiter, in fact, had fixed on somebody else? - He had, as I was informed.</p>

               <p>Q. When you took him, did he go readily with you? - He said he would resign himself to me, and go peaceably; then I went back to the Sash, and went with Mr. Wheeler, the landlord, over the greatest part of the house, and there were the window shutters broke very much to pieces, and some of the inside broke; I asked Mr. Wheeler whether he would go into the cellar? poh, poh, says he, there is nobody in the cellar; when I came out Mrs. Holder calls out, for God's sake come this way, she said there is a person in the yard, there was the prisoner Ridley, the middle one, in the yard; Mrs. Holder asked me to take charge of him. I replied, I am not an officer, and therefore I don't know that I can take charge, but I will take him to the watch-house safe; before I took him out of the yard I observed he had but one shoe on, I asked him how he came to have but one shoe only? he observed to me that he had lost the shoe on the top of the tiles, the tiles of the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the shed to Mr. Wheeler's? - I cannot say, the shed is between the two houses, as near as I can tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say how he got into that yard? - He said he got over the tiles, for fear his legs should be hurted by the horses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. With respect to Ridley, the yard that he was taken in, was Mr. Holder's? - He was in Mr. Holder's yard.</p>

               <p>Q. That is a house or two from the Sash? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that there is a narrow passage next Mr. Holder's? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that in the account he gave you of his having lost one of his shoes, that he had a sore leg? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that his shoes was slip shod? - No, he did not, he said that coming to see what was the matter, he heard the house coming down.</p>
               <p>Q. That he must have heard in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the reason he gave for going away, was for fear the horses should hurt his leg? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And that in making his escape, he went down this passage, and he got on the tiles to secure himself from the crowd? - I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. These tiles adjoins this passage? - No, not on the passage side, they are on the other.</p>

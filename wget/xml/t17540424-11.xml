The things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of my box in a garret, but I don't know by whom, or when; when I missed them, on the 2d of April, the prisoner's husband worked for my master. I found the things at a pawnbroker's in Bow-Street. Having a suspicion of the prisoner, she was taken up and had to the pawnbroker's, who said he had them of her.</p>

            . The prosecutrix lived servant with a son of mine. She was paid her wages, and going away missed her things; the prisoner was at our house, and I charged her with taking them. She denied it, and said she would go to all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240006"></xptr> the pawnbrokers to clear herself. I then went to, I believe, 40 of them, and found the goods at a pawnbroker's in Bow-Street. I shewed the man a paper of the things, which were produced, and then went to take up the prisoner, and brought her; she then confessed that she had pawned them there We took her before Justice St. Lawrence, and there she confessed the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the yard of Messrs. Wood and Co. I remember, on the 29th of June, the order being given for the plumbers to separate from the other workmen—while the search was going on my attention was directed to the prisoner Rainey—I saw him move from the stones where he was sitting, and go to the corner of the stones, which are five or six feet high—I saw him put his right hard into his bosom, take out this piece of metal, and place it between the stones—I was searched, and after that I communicated what I saw.</p>

               <p>the prisoner I did not speak to him—I felt agitated in mind, and did not know what I was doing, which continued till after I was searched—I then told Mr. Fisher—the prosecutor asked me what was the reason I did not speak before—I was never sent to work at the plumbers' shop at any particular time—I have worked there, but not lately—I do not know that I like to work there—I will not swear that I do not—I did not say to the prisoner that I would rather be removed from the plumbers' shop altogether, as I did not feel comfortable there—nor to any one—I have not worked there for a month or five weeks—I did not work on the 28th of June—I and another man were drilling holes in some lead—I was not always working at the plumbers' shop when there was any thing to do—I was not always working at the plumber besides myself, that I know of—there were other men in the yard all up at the gate—I gave this to Jarvis—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in Ranelagh-road, and have more partners than one. I had all my men mustered this afternoon—it occupied from half an hour to three quarters of an hour—I think the search was not quite completed when I heard of this—the witness and pri<lb></lb>soner had been searched—the prisoner had no right to property in that place.</p>

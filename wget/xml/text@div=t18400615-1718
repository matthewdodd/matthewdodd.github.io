                  </hi>I am clerk to Benjamin Robinson, of Little Britain. On Monday, the 15th of June, I saw the prisoner there about ten o'clock in the morning; he had a written paper which he gave to me—he said he wanted the money for a horse that was sold in the name of Bristow, which was the name of the person the horse belonged to—he did not say who it belonged to, nor to whom it was sold—I read the order—I was proceeding to pay him for the horse, and observed another clerk was paying the brother of the owner, for the same horse—I observed it was a horse of the same colour and the same price—the account was lying before me—I said to the prisoner, "There must be some mistake here, who gave you this order? "—he said, "Mr. Bristow, I came from him"—Mr. Bristow, who was re<lb></lb>ceiving the money for the horse, said, "What sort of a man is my brother? he said, "He is a man rather shorter and stouter than you"—Mr. Bris<lb></lb>tow's brother said, "I have only left my brother half-an-hour, there must be something wrong in this"—the prisoner then said, "No, it was not Mr. Bristow sent me, it was a person I have seen once or twice, named Hooper, that sent me, and I am to meet him at the Post-office, or the Rummer tavern, to receive the money"—another clerk went with him to the Post-office—that was all that passed in my presence—I kept the order in my hand—Mr. Bristow drew upon us—we sold the horse for him—Mr. Robinson had received the money—I gave this order to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>I am one of the clerks to Mr. Robinson. On the 15th of June, Mr. Bristow's brother came for the money for a horse which we sold on the Thursday previous, belonging to his brother—I was paying him—the prisoner presented the order to my fellow-clerk—in consequence of this occurring, it remained unpaid until after the investigation—I went to the Post-office with the prisoner, but did not find Mr. Hooper there—I saw no one there that spoke to the prisoner, or that the prisoner spoke to.</p>

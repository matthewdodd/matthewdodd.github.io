             sworn. - I am a foreigner; at the time this affair happened, I lived in Rosemary lane: On the 24th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was coming out of a public-house, the Horse-shoe and Horns, close by Rosemary-lane, the prisoner at the bar asked me if I wanted a lodging, -</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was quite sober; she said her husband was a blacksmith, and so I went with her to an alley adjoining <placeName id="t17991030-48-crimeloc273">the Blue-Angel, in Cable-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. He gave them to me to sleep with me all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you last see the prisoner? - A. In the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not sleep with her? - A. No; she went away after she had shewn me the room; it was about eleven o'clock when I went to bed.</p>

             sworn. - I did live with Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Cable-street: On Wednesday, the 25th of September, about nine in the morning, the prisoner brought a blue coat and pantaloons to pledge; she asked half-a-guinea upon them; she said, she did not think that would do, she would go and ask her husband; she returned in about fifteen minutes, and said, it would do; I gave her the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave the duplicate to Myers.</p>
               <p>Myers. I never had a duplicate from her; I found her husband out, he had inlisted for a soldier, and was in the rendezvous house, that was the way I came to find out where the things were. (The property was deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This man came home with me, and said he had not a farthing of money, but if I would let him sleep with me all night, I should have these things for as much as I could pawn them for; I returned him the duplicate, and I got him some breakfast; he did not come again for two or three days after. <rs id="t17991030-48-verdict274" type="verdictDescription">

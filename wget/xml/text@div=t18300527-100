            . The prisoner was in my employ at Christmas last; I had this hat then in my possession - here is my writing in ink on the lining of it, W. P., 678; the last time I saw it was in the early part of January - I missed it about that time, and spoke to the prisoner, who said he supposed it must have been sold; I had bought it of Mr. Bowler, No. 24, Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road - I saw it again at Mr. Archbutt's, the pawnbroker; this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you speak to the prisoner about this hat in particular? A. I spoke about this and some others; I did not say any thing to him at the office: I have not said since he has been in custody that I meant to prosecute him for this - I was told by Mr. Minshull I might bring any other charge against him; I believe Mr. Humphries told me I ought to give him notice, but I am not quite certain - there was something said about it; I cannot tell what the words were, or their real intent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen draper, and live in Conduit-street, in partnership with my brother—the prisoner was our shopman between two and three years. On the 19th of June I marked all the silver there was in the till, and put it in the till again—I cannot say the amount—the first time I marked about sixteen shillings—the prisoner was out at the time—he returned between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—he re<lb></lb>mained at home a short period—after he was gone out a second time I marked some more money, which made up twenty-six shillings, and put</p>

               <p>that in the till in the presence of another shopman, who is not here—the prisoner came home, and I sent him out again to his dinner—he had been at home nearly an hour, between half-past ten and twelve—during that time we missed some marked money—he was at home in the afternoon from two till three, and during that time we missed some more money—he came home about four, and the policeman came—I said, "I am sorry, Carter, I am obliged to give you in charge, for robbing my till"—he said he was innocent—the policeman said, "That we shall gee about, come this way"—the policeman searched him in my presence, and found three half-crowns and six shillings—two of the half-crowns and five of the shillings were what I marked—the other shillings were marked by a gentleman who I had procured to come and purchase something.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your brother at home during part of this day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—ours is a moderate business—we have five hands—I had the prisoner from Mr. Myley, of Warwick-street, with whom he lived three years—I know he lived with Mr. Horridge, of Mary-lebone-street five years—none of my hands are here,—we have two tills and three counters—it was the prisoner's duty to take the oversight of the department of the shop in which he was placed—he had the charge of the till—he had to put down all the money taken by others, or see that it was put down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you not found, night after night, that the till contained more money than there was in the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, frequently, generally—when the till contained more than the account we had the surplus—it was the occasional practice of the shopmen to pay money into the till—I am not aware that they ever gave change from the till—it was the prisoner's duty to give change from the till—if the account furnished by the prisoner was correct, we should have known all that was taken, but almost every day there was more paid into the till than was down in the book—we have three other shopmen and a boy—I did not ask the prisoner, before he was given into custody, if he had any marked money in his possession—I did not charge him with having marked money, bat with stealing from the till—we have from fifty to sixty customers in the course of a day—I have no doubt of his family being respectable—he was in a situation of the greatest confidence—I cannot say how much money was in the till when I gave him into custody.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Fleet-street. On the 11th of October, the last witness brought me this bit of a spoon ( producing about half a spoon.) I told her the King's arms was upon it, and I could not buy it without an account of her character. She gave me a direction where to enquire after her, but I mistook it, and went wrong. Before I could advertise it, I found that Mr. Dunn was informed about it, and had taken the matter in hand.</p>

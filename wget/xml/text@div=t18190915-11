On the 2d of September, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in my office, on the first-floor, and heard a person creeping lightly across the passage - my office-door was about one third open, and by the shadow on the wall, I observed that he was peeping into my room, where I was sitting. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner had just shut the passage-door, and was walking down stairs. I asked him what he did in the house? he made no answer, but looked confused. I suspected him, and went down after him; he looked behind and saw me, then ran away; I called Stop thief! and he was stopped. I went up to him, and took him to the watch-house; he was searched in my presence, and in a handkerchief that he had in his hand, was found, two silver cups, a wine-strainer, a plated toast-rack, and a phosphorus box; and in different parts of his clothes, were found two gravy, four table and four desert-spoons, all of which are mine, and are worth above 15 l. as old silver. I rent the house.</p>

            . I am one of the city constables. On the 27th of June last I went, in company with Mr. Nalder and Drinkwater, to the Fleet prison; we went into the prisoner's apartment, and searched the room, and Drinkwater found a ten pound plate, which he immediately gave into my custody; the prisoner came in, I shewed him the plate, he acknowledged it to be his. We found a great number of notes, one's, two's, ten's, twenty's, and fifty's. I delivered them to Mr. Nalder, and the plate.</p>

            .

               <p>Q. Look at that and tell me whether the sum 10, is what you understand a white letter on a black ground - A. It is a white letter, but the ground is not black, I call it grey; the white is to be seen between the lines, in a black ground it would not. I can see white copper plain with the microscope. If they were printed in red green or blue it would produce the same effect.</p>
               <p>COURT. Look at that, do not open it, do you call that a black - A. I do not call it a pure black.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Is a grey ground a term known in your profession - A. Not peculiar known.</p>

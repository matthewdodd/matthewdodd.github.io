                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Hart-street, Covent-garden. On the 18th of August, about one o'clock, I was in James-street, Covent-garden—I crossed from Long-acre—I was going into my father's house—a person named Jordan was going in just after, and told me something—I felt in my right-side pocket, and missed my purse, containing four sove<lb></lb>reigns and a half-crown—it was safe at nine o'clock in the morning—I had not used it in the mean time—I have not seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live in Henrietta-street. About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 18th of August, I was in Long-acre—I saw the prisoner and three men behind the prosecutrix—a man in a white hat put his hand into the prosecutrix's pocket, and took a purse out—the prisoner, took it from him, and put it into his side coat-pocket—he then walked fast up Hart-street, as if he was going to Bow-street—I went into the shop, and laid to the prosecutrix, "You have lost your purse"—she said, "No, I have not got my pocket on"—she felt, and said she had got her pocket on, and had lost her purse</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in Kmg-sireet, Long-acre. On this day 1 saw five persons about together in James-street—I had seen them frequently before—the prisoner was one of them—I saw something taken from the prosecutrix's pocket by one of them, and given to one of the others, I do not know which of them—they were all close together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, and live in Tower-street, West<lb></lb>minster-road. The prisoner was in my employ till 27th Sept., when I discharged him—on Friday evening, 26th Sept., I had sent him to Mr. Hardy, at Clapham, with a bag containing palls and other things—there was one cotton-velvet pall, one silk-velvet pall, two porters' cloaks, six gentlemen's cloaks, two small pall-hags, and six pieces of silk—I helped the prisoner to pack the things in the bag, and he took them—he came back, and said they were quite correct—on the next evening, Saturday, I discharged him—I told him he was not to consider himself my servant any longer, nor I his master—I paid him his money, and away he went—on the Wednesday following I heard about those goods which had gone to Mr. Hardy—I went with an officer, I think on the Friday, to Mr. Matthews, the pawnbroker, where I found the cotton-velvet pall, a silk-velvet pall, six gentlemen's cloaks, and two porters' cloaks; they were part of the goods I had sent—the value of the whole was about 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner bad no authority from me to get these goods, or to pawn them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was the value of the goods altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is what it would take to replace them—these goods were my property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you were a bankrupt for nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you swore in the Court you were not worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you took the benefit of the Insolvent Act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That has been decided in the Bankruptcy Court; everything has been decided—I know John Tobin—he is now in my service, and was in 1848, 1849, and 1850, but not all the time—when I took the Act, I did not swear that all the goods were the property <hi rend="italic">of</hi> John Tobin—I did not employ you to take up a quantity of goods in my back shop, which I had hidden to keep them out of the way, and swear I had not got them—I probably may have sent you to the pawnbroker, but you had a memorandum from me—I know the Pilgrims Tavern—I did not apply there for a loan in your name; you got it in your own name; I was your security—you lent me the money—you might say to me that it was as great a crime for a master to forge on a servant, as for a servant to forge on his master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. On 29th Sept. some goods were brought to me in a bag, by a boy whom Mr. Dunkley has identified—they were some mourning-cloaks and other articles—I sent the boy back, and the prisoner came back with him—I asked the prisoner whose property they were; he said Mr. Dankley's, and he came from Mr. Dankley—knowing him to be in Mr. Dankley's employ, I had no hesitation in taking the goods in, because I had previously taken in property for Mr. Dankley—the prisoner wanted 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The goods were sent by another boy, and were never in my possession; I own I did pawn the goods; I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., another party got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the boy had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I offered to pay the money back, if Mr. Dankley would forgive me; I have done several things for him, in getting him loans and other things; I sent Mr. Dankley a letter, to say he should not lose one farthing; these goods are the property of his creditors; there was from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property he kept back, at the time he took the Insolvent Act.</p>

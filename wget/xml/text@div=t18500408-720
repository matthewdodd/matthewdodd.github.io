                  </hi>. I live at 20, York-road, in the parish of Lambeth; Mr. Theodore Rosseau lodged in my house. On Monday, 11th Feb., about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to take a lodging—she gave me a reference, which I objected to on account of the distance—she then gave me another, who she said was her ancle, who was in the Dividend-office, but I found there was no such person—she required to come in that evening, but it was after Bank hours, consequently I had not time to get her reference; but as she had a young child with her, I took her in that day—she came in between eight and nine that evening; she only staid an hour—she asked me for a table—there was none in her room, and I went into Mr. Rosseau's room and got his—his watch was then on the table, and I removed it on to the drawers, and took her the table—she soon after went out, and never returned—I directly went up-stairs, and the watch was gone—she had gone with me into Mr. Rosseau's room at four o'clock, to look at it, as he was about leaving, and the watch was then on the table—I did not see her again till she was in custody on another charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I went to Mrs. Hunter's, my two sisters were with me; I never went into the room she speaks of, except when I went to take the lodging; I was to pay her weekly, and she was to provide, and when I went she would not provide, and there was nothing ready, so I went back to</p>

               <p>my old apartments. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Two persons came with her—the room was ready for her—the servant let her in, and immediately went out—she asked for some cold meat, which I took up to her, and sent out the servant for tea—the prisoner knocked at my door as she went out, and said she was going for her baby's night clothes, and asked me to have tea ready by the time she came back, but she never came back—she said she took the lodging for her<lb></lb>self till the following week, and then for her brother.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>).On Tuesday, 18th March, I was in the Waterloo-road, and a woman called me into her house, and gave the prisoner into my custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The charge is made against me purely from motives of malice; I engaged this person's room, and no doubt she felt annoyed; I was there upwards of an hour, and could get nothing, and then went back to my own apartments, which I found I could still occupy, and as she objected to provide, I did not think it necessary to return.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cornwall, and am a sailor. On the 17th of this month I was paid off from the ship <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>, at Tower-hill—I received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I bought a pair of shoes with part of it—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left, in one corner of my comforter, and eighteen-pence in the other—that was all I had—I wanted to go down to Liverpool for another ship—I went to the railway-station at King's-cross—I left my bag there ready for starting next morning—I got there in the afternoon about 2 o'clock—between 2 and 10 o'clock I occupied myself by having a walk part of the time, and part of the time I was in the Iron Duke public-house, where I left my bag—about 10 o'clock I went out for a walk—I had three shipmates with me—we fell in with three or four girls—my comforter was then round my neck—I had the Guernsey frock on that I have to-day—after we met the girls we went into a public-house, and called for a quartern of rum—I drank one glass of it—we went into another public-house where I drank one glass of rum—after that I went into a house with two girls—my shipmates had gone away—after drinking those two glasses of rum, I was just as sober as I am now—when I reached the house in Hope-court, the prisoner and the two girls took me up-stairs—it was there that I first saw the prisoner—she asked me for some money to get something to drink with—I gave her half-a-crown which I took out of my hand—I had been carrying it in my hand all the time—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in one corner of the comforter, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the other, but I had half a-crown besides, which I kept out to spend for the evening—after I had given the half-crown to the prisoner to get drink, I took off my com<lb></lb>forter and frock and laid them down on the bed—the prisoner took the comforter up and looked at it; I took it away and threw it on the bed again—she then took a knife that she had in her hand, cut the end of it off, and went down-stairs—both ends were alike—the end she cut was tied up with a piece of twine—she cut the end in which the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was—I was sit<lb></lb>ting on one end of the bed, speaking to the other girls, who were in the room at the time—after she had cut the end of the comforter, they ran down-stairs, the three of them together—the prisoner ran first, and she sung out for her husband as she ran—I was afraid to go down-stairs—I sung out "Police" as hard as I could, from the window, and a policeman came—I knocked out the window intending to jump out; but I saw a policeman outside and called him—I did not hear any person below when the prisoner cried out for her husband—the policeman came into the passage, and came up to the door—I then walked down-stairs—the girls were gone—the prisoner was standing by the door, just outside—I told the policeman to take her in charge for stealing my money—I told the policeman how it was stolen, and showed him my comfortet—one end of the comforter was left behind—the policeman has it—he took the prisoner into custody—that is all I know.</p>

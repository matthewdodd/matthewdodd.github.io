                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Whitewood, of South-street, Greenwich—the prisoner was in my service. On the 9th of Aug., a gentleman called to pay me some rent—he paid me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I put it all into a pocket-book, and placed it in a sideboard-drawer, in the parlour—the prisoner knew of it—I said before her that I had received it—she had access to the room—the drawer was left open—next day I placed the pocket-book under lock and key, without examining it—I do not know whether the note was in it then or not—next day, Wednesday the 11th, I went to the pocket-book, and missed the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—nobody but the prisoner and my daughter knew anything about it—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner said, in my presence, she had not seen it—on Friday, the 13th, she came into the kichen, and asked me if I would forgive her if she paid me back the whole of the money—I asked her if she took the money—she said, "No"—I said, "Can I receive of you what you say you have never taken of me? No, I cannot do it"—in about a minute she came again, begged me to forgive her, and said she had taken the note and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had told her that day, that if she had been tempted to take it, if she would replaced it, I would forgive her—I said nothing about her confessing, only about replacing the money—I sent for a policeman in the evening, and gave her in charge for something else—she is an orphan—I had no character with her—mine is the first place she has been at.</p>

I refused to go, knowing that was not the right way. He then struck me, and knocked me down, and said, if I made any noise it should be the worse for me. I got up in a few minutes, as soon as I could: I complained of being cold, and he said there was a shed close by, to which he would take me. I walked there with him; - he had hold of my arm: - that was not in my way home; - there was no door to it. I went in with him; he pressed me to sit down, and he sat down by my side upon the ground for a very few minutes. I perceived his hand in my pocket, and asked him what he was doing; he said nothing: he then left me, and said he would return in a few minutes. He never attempted to be rude with me, or any thing of the kind; - he said I could sit and rest myself. As soon as he was gone I missed my money. I never stated upon my oath that he wanted to be rude with me: he never asked me to lay down.</p>

On the 15th of March my cash-box contained a cheque for 15l., two 5l. Bank notes, a 30l. Bank note, and about 9l. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns; a bill of exchange for 69l. 17s. 6d., five gold rings, a silk purse, and a canvas bag; I had seen my cash-box safe on the evening of the 14th, locked up in an iron safe, and I had the key in my pocket; I left home about nine o'clock on Sunday morning, the 15th, leaving the key of the iron safe in my coat pocket, and the coat was in the bed-room - the prisoner slept in the house, on the floor above my bed-room; at the time I left my house every thing appeared as safe as it did the night before; I returned about a quarter-past nine o'clock in the evening; when I rang the bell the servant maid and the prisoner opened the door to me - the servant said Mr. Jackson, a neighbour, had been and said some glass had been broken; I went and looked over the house, and found the sky-light at the back part of the shop broken - the opening was not large enough to admit the body of a man or boy; I am quite certain no person could have got through there - I immediately looked at the iron safe, and found the door of it open, and immediately missed the cash-box; I am certain the door was locked the night before, and I had not unlocked it - I had not seen it on Sunday morning; there was no key in it - I looked at the desk, which was safe overnight, and that was broken open; I had a key of the safe in the desk, and another in my pocket - I found the one in my pocket, and the other was in the desk, where I had left it; if it had been used to the safe it had been put back again - no violence was used to the safe; it must have been opened by a false key, or the key from the desk - neither the prisoner nor the servant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090074"></xptr>appeared to know any thing about it; on the Thursday following one of the 5l. notes was returned to me (which I had taken of Mrs. Cundy) - it was brought to me by one of Whitbread's men; I knew it to be one of the notes in my cash-box - I had put Cundy's name on it when I took it; it was in my own writing; I made further inquiry that same day (Thursday, the 19th,) and charged the prisoner with this offence about two o'clock; I found the remainder of my property in Union-street, in Mrs. Holland's house; the prisoner gave me a written order to Union-street - the order was sent by Mr. Glanville, who brought the property back; I saw the prisoner write the order - Glanville brought back to me the greatest part of the property, a pair of ear-rings, three gold rings, a bill of exchange for 69l. 17s. 6d., a cheque for 15l., a 30l. Bank note, and some gold and silver, but none of the 5l. notes; I know all the property to be the same as was safe in the cash-box on the Sunday morning.</p>

Nearly six months; he came with as good a character as I ever wish to have, and he had been in my service before - I put great confidence in him; I charged him with the offence on the 19th, but the officer had taken him before the Magistrate on the Tuesday before, as he suspected him; but he was not charged with it till the Thursday; I had written the name on the note myself - I do not know on what day I received it.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Union-street, East-lane, Walworth. I have known the prisoner eighteen months; he used to lodge with me when he was not in a situation - he brought a parcel to my house on Sunday, the 15th of March. between six and seven o'clock in the evening: I did not know the contents - he left it with me - he put the parcel carelessly on the table; I moved it on to a chest of drawers; I parted with it on the Thursday afterwards to Mr. Glanville, who brought a note from Gill for it; my mother gave Martin the note, but not in my presence - (looking at it) this is the note; I believed it came from the prisoner - my mother gave up the parcel to Glanville in my presence: it contained a Bank note I believe, and some rings and papers; when he came to me on the Sunday he asked me if I could get him change for a 5l. note, and he gave me one; I went out, but could not get change; I returned it to him, and he took it away with him - he left our house that evening, and did not come again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain it was the same parcel as he left on Sunday? A. Yes; I was at home when it was left, and when it was taken away - he did not tell me the contents; he has lodged with us several times - we considered him honest and upright; we never knew any harm of him.</p>

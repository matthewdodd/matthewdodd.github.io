(<hi rend="italic">One of these was labelled "Laudanum.</hi>") They are empty—Mrs. Hall took hold of them and took them to the doctor's when she took Jane—the other children were then living there; they are well.</p>

I live at 23, Gerard Street, Soho—on 8th June, a little after 3.30 Jane Hall was brought to me by her mother—I saw that she was suffering from a narcotic and administered an emetic—the mother showed me these two bottles, which smelt of laudanum—I kept the child three hours and sent the mother to fetch the other three, which she did—Frank and Annie were suffering from a narcotic, but the baby did not appear to be sleepy at all—I sent the other two to the hospital—laudanum would produce the effect I saw—in a child of this age, if it had no assistance, thirty to forty drops would be a fatal dose—I should think Jane had had a large quantity; I cannot say how much, I judge from the effect.</p>

I am resident medical officer at Charing Cross Hospital—on Friday evening, 8th June, the little girl Jane was brought there; she was holding her mother's hand and staggering, she was intoxicated—the boy seemed very tired, but nothing very noticeable—I looked at their eyes, the pupils of both were contracted, especially the girls', which were contracted to a pin's point; that would be caused by the narcotic, such as laudanum; that would account for the intoxication—they both vomited per<lb></lb>fectly clear saliva—after a child has been sick from natural causes that would be the kind of vomit—they were discharged cured on, I think, the 14th—laudanum is a very dangerous thing to administer to young children—I think their lives were endangered.</p>

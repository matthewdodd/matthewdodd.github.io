               <p>I am one of the patrol belonging to Sir Sampson Wright on Uxbridge and Kilburn roads; on the 27th of January about a quarter before seven, we came off the Kilburn road, and when we rode to Tyburn Turnpike, we heard that three footpads had committed a robbery on the Uxbridge road; we went down Park-lane into Hyde-park, there were six of us, and as soon as we came to the Bason, I saw the three prisoners coming towards us, and towards Grosvenor-gate, I then made up towards the prisoner Jacobs, and he took to his heels and ran away, I pursued him, he then took a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250024"></xptr> a pistol out from withinside his coat, and turned round to fire at me; he turned just half way round, he presented the pistol to me, and he found I was rather too much on the left side of him, and he threw his pistol down, and as it fell it flashed in the pan; he was still running, and I pursued him and laid hold of him; I tied his hands and searched him, and found on him this watch, which was in the fob of his breeches pocket, with one seal and two keys.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the other two prisoners? - My other partners took the other two, I held him fast, and kept him in custody till we came to Covent Garden watch-house; we all came into Oxford-road, and there we took two coaches and went to Sir Sampson Wright's, and about two days after I saw the prosecutor there, the watch was then produced: I found on Jacobs one shilling and sixpence, and one penny.</p>

            ? - In about half a minute, as soon as I had hold of Selshire, I turned round, we took them to Sir Sampson Wright's, they were sent to different prisons; I was present on the Thursday following when Mr. Chapman came, he then saw his watch after the charge was laid to the prisoners; Sir Sampson asked them, what they had to say, and they then all of them acknowledged the crime, and Selshire in particular desired to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Did Sir Sampson take down any thing in writing? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I have heard that a question did arise which was pretty thoroughly debated, whether evidence should be admitted of a confession by a prisoner before a Justice of the Peace; the law is, that the Justice of the Peace is to take the informations of the witnesses, and the examination of the prisoner, and shall reduce them into writing, and return them to the gaol delivery.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Reynolds. Was not there some question whether parole evidence might be given of confession taken before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. It has always been understood that where no written examination had been taken, parole evidence may be admitted; but if the Justice takes the examination in writing, then they cannot give in evidence his parole examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. It is his duty to take it in writing: the rules of law are the things that you should steer by, but I want to know whether something of the kind has not been thought of, and considered here, and under that distinction the parole proof admitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. My Lord, the parole proof has been admitted where no written examination was set up; a very little while ago a witness asserted in his evidence, that an examination had been taken in writing, and the examination was not returned, but that having been asserted by him, the Court would not admit the parole evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I understand by Sir Sampson, who sits by me, that he really thought that this evidence had been taken down in writing; indeed the Justices have hardly time to take down the examinations, but yet the law is not to be departed from, and the Act of Parliament says, the Justice shall take the informations of the witnesses, and the examination of the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250025"></xptr> and shall return them. - Mr. Reynolds. In London, unless it is a very special case, Examinations are never taken in writing, as only one gentlemen sits there, and they could not do the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould what is said in other places may be received, but before the Justice of Peace, there it should be reduced into writing, therefore I cannot admit this.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. The prisoners were taken in about half an hour after the robbery.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol; I can only say what the others have said, except just as we came into Hyde-park and went down walnut tree walk, I thought I heard somebody say, damn my eyes, here is somebody a coming.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear it, or did you not? - I did hear somebody say so, and I mentioned it to Captain Bowyer; we had scarce got a yard farther up came the three prisoners, Jacobs was the first man I saw; I went to make up to him, and he immediately advanced from me, and attempted to run, he clapped his hand to his side instantly to draw out this pistol; the moment I saw it I called to Creedland; says I, Creedland! Creedland! take care, he has pulled out a pistol! the instant moment I said so, it flashed in the pan, and he threw it away; I then called out, pursue him, and I will wait here and see whereabout he has hove that pistol; I saw him throw it away; then we took him to Sir Sampson's.</p>
               <p>Court to Creedland. Was not the pistol thrown to the ground before it flashed in the pan? - As it fell it flashed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. It is a very different thing as to the conduct of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER JACOB's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been out that afternoon, and as I was coming up to the Lock Hospital I found a red and white pocket handkerchief, with two pistols in it and a watch; I found it almost facing Mr. Tattershall's; Selshire was with me; he said, says he, I will have half; I gave him the pistol and the handkerchief, and I had the pistol and the watch; coming to the turnpike we met M'Donald, and as we were going through Hyde-park he came with us, and just coming through Walnut-tree Walk we met three gentlemen, so I threw the pistol away; I thought, may be they would take me up or something.</p>
               <p>PRISONER SELSHIRE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was along with this man coming from Battersea, he picked up this handkerchief, and he gave me that pistol.</p>

               <p>I had been with an acquaintance of mine, and coming by Kensington turnpike I met these two young men; I had the pistol about me, and the bullets, which I found in Hyde-park the day before; I carried them about me for my own defence.</p>

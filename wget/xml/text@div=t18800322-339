                  </hi>. I reside at Blackheath—on Sunday, the 15th February, I was a third-class passenger in the 10.45 p.m. train from Charing Cross to Belvedere—the prisoner got in at Lewisham, and accompanied me to Belvedere—there was no other occupant—when I got on the platform I put my hand in my pocket for my watch, and found it was gone—I gave information to the railway authorities at Belvedere—the prisoner had left the station in the train—I arranged to go to Scot<lb></lb>land Yard, and I did so on Monday morning, the 17th—on or about the 20th I received information at Greenwich Police-station—I went and identified my watch at a pawnbroker's at New Cross—when the prisoner got in the train I thought he was sober, but when I found his head on my breast between Abbey Wood and Belvedere I thought he was not—I put his head up, and told him to sit up.</p>

There was the usual third-class lamp—I was perfectly awake to Lewisham, and drowsy from there to Belve<lb></lb>dere when the train was in motion, but I was awake, and knew every station, as when the train stopped I woke up—the prisoner first sat on the opposite side at the far end—when he had his head in my breast he was sitting opposite—he fell forward—that roused me—I gave a descrip<lb></lb>tion of the prisoner—I have not got it—I was too sure of him—I had this greatcoat on, and another vest, which came lower down, and my chain was attached to the pocket in the ordinary way—I had come from St. John's Wood Police-station to Charing Cross—I was on Charing Cross platform about five minutes.</p>

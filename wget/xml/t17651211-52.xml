Nailor. I was coming home to my lodging Sunday the 1st of December, between 2 clock in the morning. I had been drinking, and</note> got a little in liquor. I light of the prisoner and another girl, and stood and talked with them, I believe, a quarter of an hour before I parted with them. I missed my shagreen case of instruments; I told them I suspected they had got it; they denied it. I said, if they would give it me, I would give them something that would be of more service to them: they asked me what I would give them; I gave them a shilling. When they had got that, they would not give me the case. I told them I would give them something more if they would give it me. I charged the watch with them, and took them to the watch-house. The constable examined them at the watch-house. The prisoner said, if I would forgive her, she would give it me again, and that the other girl knew nothing of the matter: she went and fetched the case out of the street, where she had hid it (produced in court and deposed to.) I can swear to the case, because there is a piece of the shagreen broke off.</p>

            . On Sunday morning the first of this month, the prosecutor brought the prisoner to the watch-house. She said, if I would go with her she would get the case. We went: she put her hand down by a wooden pipe, where there is a waste cock; she said, there it is, and gave it me. This was in the narrow part of Holborn, near St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was standing in the street talking with some women. The prosecutor came up and talked with me. He pulled out his handkerchief very often, and so I suppose dropt it. I found something against my foot. I stooped and picked it up; I did not know it was the gentleman's. As I had been a long time with him, he gave me a shilling for my trouble.</p>

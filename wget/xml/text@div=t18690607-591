When the man came in, he looked up and down at the police, as though he expected a signal. The inspector said, "Well <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>?" and then he pointed me out. He says that I was on Clapham Common at 2 o'clock, therefore, as I was at home at 1.30, I should have to go six miles, and go through this operation on the prosecutor's door in three-quarters of an hour. This hat is very tight, and if I had worn it would not have fallen off my head, and it was tighter still when it was tried on me at Wandsworth—I never got up till the next morning, when Mary Blower came to look for her brooch. My acquaintance with these witnesses does not extend over two or three weeks, and therefore they have no interest in stating anything but the truth.</p>

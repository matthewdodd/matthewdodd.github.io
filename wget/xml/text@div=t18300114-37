On the night of the 21st of December, when I returned home with my wife at a quarter before twelve o'clock, I had occasion to go to the top of the house to a private room, and heard a noise; I went down and called the Police - I met with a private watchman and a Police-man; they went with me to Wilkins' bed-room, and discovered a closet, the door of which was locked -Wilkins said he had the key, but said there was no one there; I said, "Stand on one side and I will open the door" - I opened the door and saw Harlington sitting there in a chair; I inquired what she was doing there -Wilkins made no answer, but in going down he told the Police-man that he had taken her there; I then inquired if she was the woman that I had heard of as his sweetheart - he said, Yes; I sent him to the watch-house, then went to the cupboard where Harlington was, and found a hat-box, which I presume belonged to Wilkins, and in it two cups, two saucers, and a wine-glass; these are the articles - they are mine; I missed no plate - I searched Wilkins' box the next morning at ten o'clock; it was locked, and these trousers of mine, which are nearly new, were in it.</p>

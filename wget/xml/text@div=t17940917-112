She went away; I kept the silver; that was on Saturday, the 6th of this month; on Thursday by making enquiries in the trade I found out the owner of it, Mr. Bateman. I sent it out by a person about the town; I gave it to

               <p>On last Wednesday was a fortnight, I was informed that a person wanted to speak to me in my dwelling house; when I came in there, the last witness was present, and he asked me whether I knew any thing of this silver that he produced there to me? As soon as I see it, I said, yes; I was conscious that the silver came out of our manufactory; I knew it by the particular pieces, because it was all in pieces; but I said I would call my nephew, who was better acquainted with it than myself, because he was always distributing it to the workmen; it is no difficult matter for a workman to know his own work. We have our own sletting mills, and it is about a month since one of these rolls broke; we put in a new one, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170250"></xptr>happened to be what we call cross cut; one of these pieces that were produced has the impression on it of the cross cut, and were statted in these rolls that had not been in above a fortnight. There are six ounces, but we swear to a certainty of an ounce and a half. I swear to one piece that is cross cut; I have evidence to make out the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it was produced to you, how long might it have been missing? - I cannot tell only that of the cross cut. On the evening of that same day, Mr. Stocker called on me again to know whether we wished the prisoner stopped, because she had been there to demand it again that day. I said, by all means; he waited on me the next day, and told me she was stopped, and desired me to come down to the City Arms.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Bateman.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the silver which Mr. Bateman spoke of just now? - I see it when it was produced before the Lord Mayor, at the Mansion-house. It is the property of Mr. Bateman? I made the tools that it was drawn in, I have got some in my pocket to correspond.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the piece that has the cross cut? - No; I know some of the other pieces, that were drawn in the tools that I have with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has every workman in the trade different tools? - Different tools of their own making.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make your own tools? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can swear to some? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of what you can swear to? - Three or four pieces.</p>
               <p>Tipper. I produce some silver; I got it of Mr. Cave.</p>
               <p>Cave. It is the same as Stocker brought it in; it was put on the counter, and I gave it to Mr. Tipper.</p>
               <p>Tipper. I have kept it till now.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bateman. What account did the girl give of it? - When I came down to the City Arms, that a man, who prosessed himself to be a mate of a ship, that she had lain with two nights, in Dark-house-lane gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you his name? - She did not know his name; she said, that she went on board a vessel with him, lying at Chetter quay on Wednesday, and that they drank together, and that the Thursday afterwards he came to the Green Man, and gave her this silver, and she got up on Thursday morning; she did not lie with him on Thursday night; and went down to the vessel to seek him, and the vessel was gone. On this information we went to the Green Man, in Dark-house-lane, and there found she had been there with a man, but they could not say who he was; but they said, that she lay there on Thursday. I went, in hopes that we had got in a train of finding out the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she always kept to the same story? - She has; but we have done all we can to find it out, but we find it was a false one.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the silver? - This is the piece that is cross cut; here is another piece, that I have compared with our tongs, which every piece has the impression on it.</p>
               <p>Ware. I can swear to these three pieces from the tools that I made to draw them.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of all that you can swear to? - Seven shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went with Mr. Bateman to the house in Darkhouse-lane, and I told him that I slept with that man. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170251"></xptr>was with that man, as I told him; and I said to him, you will not treat me ungenteel, and on Thursday morning he untied his silk handkerchief, and gave me that, and said, he had given good money for it to take it abroad, to make some trinkets. I kept it till Saturday night, when I went to an acquaintance's house, to know if she could tell me where to sell it; and she sent her girl with it to this gentleman's. He stopped it, and I went for it; and he said, he could not deliver the property. I called for it on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday; on Wednesday they told me they had found an owner; I said, I hope you will not let the gentleman have the property, for it is mine. I went on Thursday morning, and they took me into custody; I came honestly by it. I have nobody to speak to my character only women of the town, whose characters I would not wish to bring before you, that I am not connected with.</p>

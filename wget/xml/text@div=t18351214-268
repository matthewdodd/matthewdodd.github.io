                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Wyndham Ryves, and live in Speldhurst-street, Burton-crescent. On the 3rd of November I missed a towel, a silver and an apron the prisoner had slept in my house the night before—I did not know her before that—I saw the things safe on Friday morning—I missed the shift on the Tuesday afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is your name Ryves or Jones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ryves. I did not introduce a person named Jones to Mr. Higgins, as my husband—Mr. Higgins lives next door to me—I went there, and you was there—I had taken the house, and was alone in it—I asked Mr. Higgins to recommend me a woman to sleep with me for company, and he recommended you; on going to bed you had no shift on, and I gave you one, as you said you had been in distress, and next night you took another shift out of my drawer—I was not drunk, nor reeling in the Kennel—I did not lock you out in the passage that night—I was very ill that night—I had been under the doctor's hands for seven weeks—my piece had gone the day before, and Mr. Jones had not been in the house that day—I never saw you after taking my things, till you were in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not come to me on Monday, and send me to pawn your cloak? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I sent you to pawn a bolster, and several other articles—you brought me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the duplicate—I did not give you the gown or any thing—the apron was in the kitchen drawer—I never saw you after Tues<lb></lb>day morning, the 3rd of November.</p>

After we crossed Woodstock-street, the prisoner entered into conversation about the rebellion of Ireland, when I told him I should be happy to hear of a peace in that country; this conversation continued almost to the opposite side of Cumberland-street; the prisoner then laid hold of my arm before. I came to Park-street; I told him to keep his distance, that I did not like his mode of laying hold of me in that sort of way; in the mean time I crossed to the corner of Cumberland-street, in my way to George-street, Edgeware-road; when I came to Upper Berkeley-street, the bottom of Cumberland-place, I turned myself round and saw the prisoner at a distance, I walked down Berkeley-street towards the Edgeware-road, when the prisoner came up to me a second time; I asked him his reason for lurking after me; his answer was this, that he hoped I was not affronted; I then walked from him, and turned round to the side of the turnpike in the Edgeware-road, in my way to George-street, and then I lost sight of the prisoner; when I got within twenty yards of <placeName id="t17980912-54-crimeloc313">George-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. You were down all this while? - A. Yes; at this time I got myself from the prisoner, when he seized me by the neck-handkerchief, and put the knuckles of his fingers into my throat to choak me; he then said, I will have your watch, when he immediately put his fingers down to the bottom of my fob-pocket, and took out my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there a chain to it? - A. No; the prisoner then asked me if I had any Bank-notes; I told him, no, when he immediately put his hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and took out what silver I had, and some papers, there were three or four shillings, and five pence in halfpence; he then said, I will feel in your coat-pockets, when he took out my pocket-handkerchief, and some papers; he then shoved me away from him, and told me I might be d - d; the prisoner then left me, and walked into the Edgeware-road; I followed him, and told him I must have my watch, my watch was dear to me being my father's; the prisoner, and myself, was by this time at the corner of Berkeley-street, he told me he would go home to his quarters; I then asked him where his quarters were; his answer was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120057"></xptr>d-n your eyes shall I tell you; I told him I did not want to know, I only wanted my property, my watch I valued; the prisoner said, if I followed him one inch farther, with his fist up to my face, but did not strike me, he would be hanged for me, when he immediately laid hold of my waistcoat, and said, I think I know you, and looked very stedfast in my face; he immediately shoved me away from him against the iron rails, when I called out, watch, but no assistance came; I called out more than once or twice; the prisoner then went away from me to the corner of Park lane, in Oxford-street, opposite the coffee-house, when I seized the prisoner, and told him I must have my property, it being my father's; he then laid hold of me with his left-hand, and took his right-hand away from me; I at that time called out watch but to no purpose; several times he put his right-hand up to my face, and stopped my mouth that I should not speak; then he said, if you will give me five guineas you shall have it, and he was to go home with me; he then said, but stop, if you ever take me into custody it shall be worse for you, I will either do, or cause to be done your business; he then said, if I would adjourn to a public-house below he would make the matter up with me, as I set to much store by my father's watch; from that place we walked down Oxford-road, about an hundred and fifty yards, when a public-house appeared, with the landlord, or some man, putting up the shutters; the prisoner said, here, we will have a pint of porter, accordingly he asked the person who was putting up the shutters for a pint of porter, and the pint of porter was brought; the prisoner first put it to me, I refused; the prisoner in the mean while had occasion to pull out his pocket handerchief, he took out two, and a piece of string; I said to the prisoner, that is my silk pocket-handkerchief, the one that he had was a white one; he then asked me if the piece of string was mine; I said, no; he then asked me to drink a second time, I refused; he then drank, and threw the remainder part into the street, when he paid for the pint of porter, and we went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see at that house? - A. Nobody, except the man who was shutting up, he was crippled and deformed; when we left the public-house, the prisoner asked me where I lived, the number of my house, and my name; I told him where I lived, the number of my house, and my name; he then said, if you will bring me down two guineas, if I go to the door with you, you shall have your watch back again; then he went down to the corner of Queen-street, about an hundred and fifty yards below the public-house, into Brown-street, Grosvenor-square, when I shewed the prisoner the house where I lodged; I knocked at the door, and a very elderly lady came to the door, a Mrs. Haycock, who is the landlady of the house, having first looked out at the window and asked who was there; I then told the prisoner, if he would wait, I would go up stairs and bring him down two guineas; when the door was opend by the landlady, in her shift, I called out at the bottom of the stairs to the person whom I lodged with, and nobody answered; and this person being a very elderly lady was the only person in the house; I came to the door again, and the prisoner had got away near fifty yards; I followed him, and came up to him in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square, when the prisoner said, have you any pistols about you, have you brought down any; I said, no; the prisoner said, I will search you, and immediately put his hands into my coat-pocket, both right and left, and in my waistcoat, and my bosom, to see if I had any there, for he said, there were such cases; the prisoner then walked into Grosvenor-square, almost close to the railing, at least within five or six yards of the railing, then he said to me, do not make any noise here, or otherwise I will do your business; the prisoner then told me, if I would bring him two guineas to the King's-arms, in Little St. James's-street, about twelve o'clock the next day, five minutes before, or five minutes after, I should have my watch back again; he told me his name was

            ; he said, but mind, if you bring any constable, or runner with you, from Bow-street, or if you hereafter have me taken; up, I will do your business, or cause it to be done by some of my comrades; then the prisoner immediately shoved me away from him; I then thought I must let the matter drop, for I perceived there was no use in following him any further, and I returned back. On the Monday following I attended the parade in St. James's Court-yard, fronting St. James's-street, when the prisoner stood under the south side of the portico; I crossed from the west side, and in crossing the prisoner said, how do you do, sir, why did you not come down according to your appointment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go at all according to your appointment? - A. Not at the hour that the prisoner proposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go? - A.From the fall, and the ill usage of the prisoner. I was not able to get up till two o'clock, and then I did go to the King's arms, with my brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the prisoner at the bar then? - A. No; they did not know any thing at all about any person of that name, but they thought they knew the description of the person that I had given, but he did not go by that name; I told the prisoner, upon his asking me the question, that I could not come to my appointment; I then asked him for my property, when the prisoner said, do not make any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120058"></xptr>noise here; I told him then, if he did not give me up my property, I certainly would have him taken into custody; his answer was, then if I would adjourn to a public-house he would make it up to me; I told him, no, if he did not immediately give me up my watch I would have him taken into custody, I should lay hold of him; the prisoner then made a frivolous excuse, there is no occasion for that; when I immediately took hold of him by the collar, and called out to the adjutant on the parade; I held the prisoner till the adjutant called out a file of men to conduct him to the guard-house; I then went to the Queen-square Police-office, and brought two constables to take the prisoner from the guard-room to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, from the opportunities you had of seeing him, that he is the same man? - A. I am very certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of your property again? - A. Yes; I saw my watch at a pawnbroker's in the Almonry, Westminster; the pawnbroker is here that took it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any thing of the handkerchief? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are an apprentice to a statuary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married man? - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. You lodged in Brown-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who might you live with in Brown-street? - A. I lodged in the house of Mrs. Haycock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body live with you there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of night was it you first met the prisoner? - A. About ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You entered into conversation about one thing and another, and at last upon the affairs of Ireland? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. May I take the liberty of asking who you might have been going to visit? - A. Mr. Howard, a surgeon, in George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might it be from where you met the prisoner to George-street? - A. About six or seven minutes walk; if I say half a mile it is as much as it can possibly be.</p>


               <p>Q. What time of night was it when you parted with the prisoner? - A. When I got into my house it went eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been with the prisoner near an hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the prisoner had not gone into any house as you went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not cross Portman-square at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch was set at this time? - A. Not in the Edgeware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner dressed as he is now? - A. No; he was dressed in his full regimentals, and his full dress.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have thought it rather an extraordinary thing that a man of that description should accost you who was a total stranger? - A. Yes, I did think it a very extraordinary thing, and several times put him at a distance, and told him I did not approve of his following me.</p>
               <p>Q. I should take it when he talked of the affairs of Ireland, you did not give him an answer? - A. Yes; I did give him an answer; I said, I wished for a peace in that country; from his manner of speaking, I took him to be a man of good sense; he said, he expected some of his comrades home in a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch was set, I presume, upon your return? - A. No, there never is any watch upon that road in that month.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure you were not in any public-house? - A. yes; neither public or private house, or any house whatever, with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any wine-vaults? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned into Oxford-road, the watch was set? - A. Yes; but from the time we left the Edgeware-road till we got into Brown-street, I did not see a single soul except four profligate girls against the Park wall, and when I got there, I called watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were so near Mr. Howard's house, how came you not to go on? - A. I had no idea that the prisoner meant to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that, after he had kept following you so far? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got within twenty yards of Mr. Howard's house, how was it that you did not go on for assistance? - A.Because I was afraid of losing my property.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that you did not seek for the assistance of watchmen, after you came into Oxford-road? - A. He threatened me so much what he would do to me, that I thought I had better make myself quite sure of his face and person, as I had not had a full view of his face at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from you? - A. A very short distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen might you have passed? - A. Not any from the time the prisoner robbed me till I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you come after he had robbed you? - A. to the corner of Berkeley-street; there is a watch-box near the turnpike, and I called out watch, there, but there was no turnpike-man nor watchman, and I can prove it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the turnpike-man's box? - A. I called out watch, and I called out assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Oxford-road is Brown-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120059"></xptr>in? - A.Between North Audley-street and Duke-street, on this side of Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. And you passed down that public street, Oxford-road, and no watchman was to be met with? - A. On my return there was not either man, woman, or child.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you met with neither man, woman, nor child, during all that time? - A. I mean to say that upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came to your house in Brown street, you did stop at a public-house, and the prisoner called for a pint of beer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did see a man there; how came you not to ask his assistance? - A. He was a cripple, and the prisoner had told me if I made any noise he would do my business for me; I went to put my ear to listen it there was any body in the taproom, and the prisoner would not let me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me the only reason why you did not speak at that public-house was, because he had intimidated you, and said he would do your business for you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the wounds you had received, you could not attend according to your appointment? - A. No; I had received no wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that you did not attend on account of the injury you had received? - A. Yes, from the prisoner keeping me down with his knuckles in my throat, and his foot upon my breast at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had got some distance when you got to your own door? - A. About 50 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of bringing some weapons down with you? - A. I could not get into my room, there was nobody in the house but the person that let me in, and the was in her shift, about 80 or 90 years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might you have walked with the man after you left your own house? - A. Not more than twenty yards; I left him in consequence of his saying that he would do my business, or be the means of my business being done.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you apprehended him? - A.On the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, before you apprehended him? - A. On the Thursday I was very ill, on the Friday I went to Whitehall, and begged leave to walk through the line, and observe the man; on the Friday, on the Saturday, and on the Sunday, I did the same, and on the Monday I met with him as I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you went next day before the Magistrate to give information of this transaction? - A. No, I did not, till after I had taken the prisoner into custody, for this very reason, I could not apprehend the man form the fictitious name that he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could not have gone to a Police-office and given information? - A. The adjutant told me, the only way I had was to walk through the lines till I found him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met with him in the court-yard, at St. James's, he spoke to you first? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. About the time the guard was relieved at St. James's; it was about eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not ask you for five shillings that he had advanced you? - A. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been ten years in the Guards, and never was arraigned at the bar in my life before; that gentleman and I had been together at different public-houses, drinking together, and he was going with some girls; he said, he had no money, and I lent him five shillings, he gave me his watch in my care till he paid me; he ordered a pint of beer as we went along, and he called at Brown-street, and said, his wife was gone to bed, and he could not get me five shillings; and then he appointed to meet me the next day, at the King's-arms, and to bring me the money, and have his watch. I have a comrade here to prove that I went to the King's-arms at the time appointed; and when I met him on the 27th, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, why did not you come to your time, I am very sorry, but I have been obliged to pledge your watch, in consequence of not having the five shillings. I told him, I would give him the duplicate.</p>

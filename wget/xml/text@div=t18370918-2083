                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, Wilks-street, Spitalfields—I have lived there about ten months. On the 18th of August I was porter to Messrs. Graham—I received the silk, to take to the factory in Wilks-street—as I was going along I met the prisoner—I never saw him before—he said, "You must go back and tell Mr. Graham that Mr. Harris has got a girl down in the kitchen that has got some silk about her, and you must give me the parcel; I am to take it to the factory"—Mr. Harris lives at the factory in Wilks-street—I had gone to Brown's-lane, which is about five minutes' walk from Wilks-street—hetook the parcel off my back—I went back, believing what he said, and saw Mr. Long and Mr. Graham, and told them—when I went back to the factory I found this was not true—my master let me go to the factory, and when I got there he came with a policeman, and took me—I was in custody about an hour and a quarter—I was taken to the Magistrate the same day—I was remanded, and came up again on the Monday—I was remanded a second time from the Monday till the next Monday, and then discharged—this man was a stranger to me—I never saw him till he came up.</p>

Grahams' employment—I brought a character with me to Graham's, not a written character—I was a week altogether in gaol—it was half-past nine o'clock in the morning that the silk was taken from me in Brown's-lane—the prisoner had a hat or cap on—I did not ask him his name, or who he was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Horgood, a pawnbroker, in Brown's-lane. On Friday morning, the 18th, I was standing at my master's door between eight and nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner at the bar at the comer of a court called Corbet's-court—he stood there some time—I saw Hayward come up, and saw the prisoner go up to him—I noticed that they were conversing—I saw the prisoner take the bag off Hayward's shoulder and march off with it.</p>

               <p>

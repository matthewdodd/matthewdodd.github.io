I found my Wife's Cloaths taken out of the Drawers, and were laid, - some on the Chairs, and some on the Table in the Room. I missed 4 pair of silver Watch-cases, a Mother of Pearl Snuff-box with silver rims, and a Gold Watch-case was gone likewise. How can this be, says I! Why, says the Gentleman, it must be your Servant that has done it to be sure; I believe so too, said I, for 'twas very dirty Weather, and I thought it impossible any body should come in and go up Stairs without dirting the Room. Sometime after this, a Neighbour inform'd me, that if I would search at the Pawnbrokers, I might probably find some of my Goods: upon this, I got a search Warrant, and, Mr. Grainger's a Pawnbroker upon Puddle-Hill, I found 2 pair of Watch-cases and the Snuff-box.

               <p>Mrs. Mason. This is mine; I lost it in Mr. Wilson's House. I used to keep it in a leather Glove in my Scrutore, and when I went to Kingston, I intended to carry it with me, but I chang'd my Mind, and left it behind me backed up in a Chest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173802220003"></xptr> up Stairs in my Closet for fear of being robb'd, and took the Key of the Chest with me. While I was at Kingston, I wanted my Watch to wear at a Ball, so I sent for my Chest, but when I came to look for my Watch it was gone. The Chest was lock'd when it came to my Hands, but the Watch was taken away.</p>

I own the Fact, and hope you'll take it into Consideration, and do my Family Justice. I own these Things, but my Mother has given my Master a Bond of 10 l. for the rest. <rs id="t17380222-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">

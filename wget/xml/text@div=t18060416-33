               <p>Q. On the 13th of March last, were you by the Victualling-office. - A. I was, about a quarter past three in the afternoon in <placeName id="t18060416-33-crimeloc188">Thames-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did the clerk say to him. - A. He said that he never suspected him to do any thing of the sort before, they had frequently lost nails; I opened the handkerchief, and found they were new nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on the bag. - A. There is part of a mark, which has the appearance of the King's mark.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at that property, and tell me whether you know that property to belong to the Victualling-office. - A. They are similar nails as are used at the Victualling-office, and on the bag there seems to be a part of the King's mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. The nails were not kept under your custody. - A. They were, it was impossible for any body to get at them without they had a key.</p>

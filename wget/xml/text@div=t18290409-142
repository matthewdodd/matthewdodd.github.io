Between six and half-past six o'clock on the evening of the 13th of February, I saw the prisoner in our back yard, with this copper in his hand; the yard was full of clothes - I was looking through the landing window - I thought it was a person who had come to take the clothes, but what he had in his hand was an iron pot: I went out and met him at the corner - he went down the street with it in his hand; I went back to report it in the house - they made some delay in going after him; the copper had been fixed in the wash-house, and the woman had been using it all day - I knew the prisoner before, and had often spoken to him; he lived in Oxford-buildings - I cannot swear it was the copper.</p>

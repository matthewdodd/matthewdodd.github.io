                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Godfrey, at Hanwell. On Tuesday, the 2nd of February, I was going towards Hanwell, between nine and ten o'clock at night—I had occasion to go by the church, path, and saw a man standing by the old house—it was the prisoner—he said nothing to me as I went—I returned about ten minutes before ten, and as I passed under the arch of the railway station, he said, "It is a snowy night"—I said, "Yes, sir," and walked on till I got to the wooden swing gate—he seized hold of the gate, to prevent my passing through—I got through, and he said, "Would you like a good rolling in the snow, my dear?"—I did not speak—I was very much frightened—he continued to follow me: and when I got to the trees, he said, "Have you not got any money to give a poor fellow for a night's lodging?"—I put my hand down and held my pocket—he took hold of my hand with one hand, and with the other felt all round me—I struggled violently with him, and hurt my arm in struggling—I have been obliged to wear it in a sling—he continued to hold and abuse me till I got to the iron swing gate, and said there, "I will not let you go through till you tell me whether you are going to Green-ford"—I was so frightened I could not speak, but 1 pointed to Mr. Carr's cottage, it being the nearest—he swore at me dreadfully, gave me a violent blow on my back, and pushed me through the gate—the blow, I after<lb></lb>wards found, cut my clothes through—I saw a small dark thing in his hand, what it was I don't know, but my dress on the right hand side was cut and torn—the cut was a small notch—and then it was torn, I think, in pulling; but my things were cut through the back as well—he then walked alongside the iron fence, and turned and watched me—I had never seen him before that night—I have not a doubt of his identity at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general waiter at the Duke of York public-house. I saw the prisoner there on Tuesday night, the 2nd of February—I first saw him there about eight o'clock, or five or ten minutes after—I staid there till half-past ten o'clock—I looked at the clock when I went out, as I generally do—I left the prisoner there—Rowland, Rimel, and Haines, the other ostler, were there—the other ostler had been away ill—I know this was the 2nd of February, for I went to Brentford that day for a pair of driving gloves for Rowland, the ostler.</p>

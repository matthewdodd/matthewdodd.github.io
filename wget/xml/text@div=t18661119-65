                  </hi>. I live at 8, Esplanade Cottages, Lewisham—I knew the deceased George Styles—he lived in the next cottage to me, No. 7—about half-past eleven on Saturday night, 13th October, whilst in my house, I heard some noise in front of my cottage by Mrs. Cole and her children—I came out and looked, and Styles opened his window—Cole walked along, and Styles said, "What is the matter, Sam?" and he said, "Oh, my son-in-law is going to stab me"—Styles said, "Shall I come down, Sam?"—Jones said, "No, not to-night; come down some other night," and while he said it Mr. Jones (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) stood out there—Mrs. Jones said, "If he comes down I will drench him with water"—she repeated those words several times, and with that Styles dressed him-self and came down—while he was doing so Jones walked indoors and got what he had, and stood behind the front of the house three or four minutes—Mrs. Jones got hallooing to him, and said, "You stop here, Jack; if he comes down I will chuck this water over him"—Styles walked down, and I walked down too—in the meantime Mrs. Jones took up the pail of water, and chucked it partly over him and partly over me—she then went to the door, and took up a broom and struck at Styles—he put up his hand and took the broom, and tried to break it, and while he was in the act of breaking it Jones stepped from the front of his house and struck him down on the head with something similar to a hammer, and it went off just like the bursting of an air-ball or a paper bag, and he fell—I did not see Styles do anything to him—I was close to them—I said to the prisoner, "Jack, what have you done? have you hit him with a hammer?"—he made no answer—I got a candle, and went and looked at his head, and I said he was killed; I thought he was—I saw a hole in his head, and blood running out at the back of his head, and running right down into the river—I directly went and fetched a constable—I think the prisoner had had a little beer that night, but I did not notice whether he was tipsy or not—he only went into his house once—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand or not—I did not observe anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on Saturday night, 13th October, there was a disturbance going on in the front of our house between Mrs. Cole and her son—I went out with my husband into the street—the deceased lived next door to us—he was upstairs at his bedroom window—when I went out he opened the window, when he heard Mrs. Cole crying, and he asked if he should come down—Mr. Cole came along, and he asked what was the matter—Cole said that they were going to run a knife through his guts—he said, "You should have your guts lined either with lead or with iron, then the knife would not pene<lb></lb>trate through"—with that Jones came out of his mother-in-law's house, and said to me, "It is the women's long tongues that causes all these dis<lb></lb>turbances"—Styles made some remark to me, but what it was I do not exactly know—the prisoner did not answer it—Mrs. Jones said if Styles came down she was up and dressed and ready for him, and would throw some water over him—the deceased told her that she wanted throwing into the river to wash the scabs off her arms—I did not hear her call him any name particularly—he said, "Do you want me to come down? if you do I will come"—the prisoner said, "No, not to-night; another night"—Mrs. Jones then called him a bald-headed old something, but I did not hear the word, and with that the deceased came downstairs—he was not dressed when he was up at the window; I could see that, because he put his legs out—when he came down he had his trousers on, but no hat or cap or jacket—he had a bald head—he no sooner came down than Mrs. Jones up with a pail of water and threw part over him and part over my husband—it was a large tin pail, that she brought out of her own house—as soon as the water was gone she seized the hair broom, and began to strike at him—she did not hit him—he took the broom away from her, and was in the act of breaking it and throwing it into the river when the blow was struck—the prisoner was standing outside his door, by his window, while this</p>

               <p>altercation was going on, in this position (<hi rend="italic">with his arms behind him</hi>)—I went to him and said, "Mr. Jones, shut your door; Mr. Styles is coming down"—that was before he did come down, when I saw the light dis<lb></lb>appear from the bedroom window—Jones said if he did come he should have what he came for—I saw Jones step out and strike the blow—it looked to me like a hammer that he struck with—he had it in his right hand—I am certain he had something—it was a very violent blow—I could hear it—it appeared to me like a paper bag filled with wind burst in his hand—it was a very loud report indeed—I saw the deceased put his hands up and fall back, and he never spoke for a time—I know no more that went on after that—the deceased had nothing on his head at the time—I did not hear the prisoner speak at all—I saw him throw what he had in his hand behind him, in the direction of the passage of his own house—I said to him, "Mr. Jones, you have no business to hit that man with that," and he said, "What is the matter? I am going to look for my broom"—I observed him go into his house after he came out of his mother-in-law's, just before the disturbance began, before Styles came down—he had nothing in his hand when he came out of his mother-in-law's I did not see the deceased do anything to him, the deceased was picked up and taken in, and he asked me whether I saw the blow struck—I said, "I did," and he said, "It was cruel of him to hit me with that hammer"—they were both under the influence of drink, but not as I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Could your husband have heard him say that what he came down for he should get? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think he did, he is rather hard of hearing—I do not know whether he did hear it or not—he was standing close to Mr. Styles some part of the time, and some part of the time close to Mr. Jones—I told the Magistrate of that expression—I am sure of that—I do not know whether it was in my depositions—I said at first that the blow went off pop—I heard my husband examined before the Magistrate, and heard him say it was like a paper bag or an air-ball—I said the same, because we were both there, close to each other—I was examined before him before the Magistrate—I never saw a blow struck by the deceased—they were close together, against Jones's window—it was close to his door that the deceased was breaking the broom—he might have struck the prisoner without my seeing it, but I was close there and never saw it—I saw the prisoner go into his own house—I did not see his wife go in with him—he went in by himself, when I saw him I should not think his wife could have gone in with him without my seeing it—I say positively she did not go in with him when I saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital when Styles was brought there, on Sunday morning, the 14th October, about five o'clock, by one of the constables—I found a large cut in his forehead, at the top, on the left side, where the hair begins—he was bald there—it was about two inches long and gaping wide open, and a fracture of the bone—part of the bone was depressed, knocked into the brain, and fractured—Mr. Durham, the surgeon, was sent for at once, and took out a good deal of bone—he went on well till Tuesday morning, and on Wednesday morning, about ten o'clock, he died—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found that the membranes of the brain were inflamed—that was the cause of death—the brain was bruised opposite the place of injury—the skull had a large hole in it where the bone had been taken out—it was an oval hole, about an inch wide by an inch and a half long—the injury to the brain was the cause of death—a blow with a hammer of this description would be calcu<lb></lb>lated to inflict such an injury, one blow—the pressure of the instrument would most likely prevent the blood from coming at first—I should say the skull might be fractured in that way, and yet the instrument not have blood upon it—it would be impossible for a fist to cause such an injury.</p>

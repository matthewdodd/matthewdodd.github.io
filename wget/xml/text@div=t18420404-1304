                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the London Docks, and live in Charles street, St. George's in the East. On Saturday, the 26th of March, I was passing Crombie-row, Commercial-road, and saw three boys and a girl looking into Tuffs' window, about a quarter-past three o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner was one—I went down the Commercial-road and returned in about ten minutes, and still saw them at the window—the two boys and girl went across the road—the prisoner still remained at the win<lb></lb>dow—I saw him put his hand through a pane of glass and take out as many cheroots as he could hold in his hand (the glass was perfectly sound when I first saw them—there was no hole in it)—he went across the road and gave the cheroots to one of the others, returned and took out as many more, crossed the road and gave them to the girl—there was then a cry made, and they parted—he went down Dean-street—a policeman followed with me and took him—I looked at the window, and found a square hole in it, large enough to get the cheroots out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live with Sophia Tuffs, a widow, who keeps a tobacconist's shop in Crombie-row. On the 26th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw some boys go from the window—I went to the door, and a little boy said, "They have been taking cigars"—I looked at the window and missed the cheroots—the window was per<lb></lb>fectly safe about half-past nine in the morning—there was a crack, but it was quite secure—the alarm was given about a quarter after two—I then found the glass pushed in, and the boxes in disorder—the window was shut down—the cheroots were Mrs. Tuffs' property, and worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

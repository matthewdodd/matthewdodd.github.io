                  </hi>. I am assistant to Evans and Colley, of Cripple gate-buildings, and am the brother of William Evans—he has one partner—they are parasol and umbrella-makers, and have been established about three years. On Monday, the 9th of June, I saw Mr. Hargreaves—he showed me a parasol, which I recognised as one belonging to our firm—in consequence of what he said I got a policeman, and then went to Mr. Rotherham's, some time that afternoon—Blundell and another officer were with me—I took possession of eight parasols, which were given to me, and which I recognised as belonging to Evans and Co.—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—this is the one I received from Mr. Hargreaves, and these eight I received from Mr. Rotherhara—I afterwards went to Stagg and Mantle's, and received twenty-one parasols there, which are our make, and have our private mark on them—I can swear they have never been sold by us, because this is a class of goods that we never fit up in this sort of way—they are fitted up in a more common way than such parasols of our make are, both the tops and bottoms are—these fittings were never done in our house—that enables me to state they were never sold from our place—the whole of them are given out to women to cover, which is putting the silk on the frames—Mrs. Butler was not employed to cut them out—they were cut out, and sent in dozens for her to give them out—they are cut from large pieces of silk of 100 yards length or more, and tied up in dozens to be given out—an account is kept of them in the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a dozen to be partly cut out, and you get to the end of one piece of silk, do you finish the dozen by beginning another piece? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is not at all probable that there can be more than two patterns in one dozen parasols—it is not likely—there are eight patterns in these thirty parasols—after receiving them, in consequence of what I learnt, we went into the prisoner's neighbourhood, and ascertained that he was not at home—we waited outside, but did not see him that day—we were there next morning, about eight o'clock, and about ten in the morning I stood at the corner of Camomile-street, and saw him and his son coming across Bishopsgate-street—they saw me, and came up to me—his son-in-law addressed me, and said, "Mr. Evans, I want to see you, if you will come with me to Mr. Barnard's house we will explain this matter to your satis<lb></lb>faction"—I went in, and the officer followed me—Mr. Barnard then entered, and explained that Palmer worked for him and for us, and that two dozen of work that she received about three weeks before from us, she had brought to him by mistake, and that the two dozen which she had received from him she had brought to us, and they had been received by us in mistake—I then asked him if she had ever made such a mistake before—he said, "Never before, never, but in this instance of the two dozen," and then, after some hesitation, he said, "She might have done so"—he said he told her of it at the time, and she said, "If this is not your work, I must have taken your work in to the other shop"—I proposed that Palmer should be sent for, and proposed to go with Milligan, the son-in-law, to her, to which he disputed, saying, "I will send for her," or "fetch her," and he left the room—I staid a few minutes, and left in about five minutes after—Milligan</p>

               <p>had previously said, "I hope this explanation is to your satis<lb></lb>faction"—I said it was not to mine, and I supposed it was not to the offi<lb></lb>cers'—one of them said "No, I shall take Mr. Barnard into custody"—I did not go to the station—I went in search of Palmer, but could not find her—I went to the station, and found her in custody there—she gave the same account that Barnard and Milligan had, that all she had got to say was that she had brought the wrong work in—when the work comes into our warehouse, every dozen passes through my hands after it goes from the woman who takes the work in from the other women—I never detected any other goods than our own coming into our stock, nor is it pos<lb></lb>sible that a dozen of other goods could come into our stock, or I should bare been sure to have detected it—here are two qualities of goods—the average price would be about 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—they would cost us that to make.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness. I know the prisoner—I saw him at my lodging, at Finsbury, where I lived when this matter happened—my daughter Charlotte lived there with me, no other daughter—I have another daughter—I remember the Tuesday my daughter was taken to the station—the prisoner had been at our lodging, I think, about a month or three weeks before that—that was the last time before the Tuesday—he did not take anything from the lodging that day; but a month previous, when he called at my Charlotte's, and said there had been an exchange of work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he call and say there had been an exchange of work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Monday—it was the very day she was taken to the station—he was at my house, but I was not at home—it was about half-past eight o'clock he called, but about half-past nine he came again—I saw him then—he said he wanted my Charlotte to come up, as he had been selling para<lb></lb>sols which Mr. Evans claimed, and if my Charlotte did not stick to the story about the exchange of work, she certainly would go for fourteen years, and he for seven—it was an exchange of work he said—I had seen him at my lodging about a month previous—it was on the Saturday before Whit-Sunday—that was the last time I saw him there before the Tuesday—he took a dozen parasols from our lodgings on that occasion—they had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184507070050"></xptr>
               <p>been brought there by my daughter Charlotte—I told him, before he took them away, that Mrs. Butler had sent a dozen of work out, and there they stood in the corner, if he thought proper to buy them—I had seen Mrs. Butler on the Friday before, and had some conversation with her about parasols—I told the prisoner what passed—I told him Mrs. Butler had sent a dozen of work, and there they were in the corner, if he liked to buy them—he pulled one out, and said, "I will give you 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the dozen"—I said, "You can do as you think proper"—the money was put down on my table—I put it on the mantelpiece, and it was given to Mrs. Butler—those parasols were unmade—I had not any conversation with him before that about parasols from Evans and Co.—he has not been at my lodging more than twice since Whitsuntide, for me to see him, but he has been there several times, as I have heard—he took one dozen of parasols from my place afterwards—they had been brought by Charlotte—I told him then there was a dozen, if he liked to buy them—he gave 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, I cannot exactly say which.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were any of those he took away at any time sent to your place tobe made up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—two dozen, he fetched them avray one day, I can<lb></lb>not tell when—it was since Whitsuntide certainly—I cannot say whether they were the same kind as those now produced—they were brown silk like these, and finished in all respects, except the top and bottom knobs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you the same lady that lived with Cotterell the transport? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not live with him at all—I never slept out of my own bed—I did not leave my husband—I lived in the same house with him, and went home to sleep every night—there is no truth in the story that I cohabited with Cotterell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you never had connexion with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know, Sir, my husband is dead—I had not before my husband died—I was there working—I could swear I was not connected with Cotterell in my husband's lifetime—my husband died in the workhouse—I was living at home in Daggett's-court—he had been in the workhouse for about twelve months, when he died—I was living in Daggett's-court all that time—I saw my husband on the Wednesday before he died—I do not know where Cotterell lived—he was not at home—when I worked for him he lived in Cross-keys-court—I went there every afternoon with my own child, James—Cotterell lived in Cross-keys-court before he was transported—I was out<lb></lb>side the Court at the time of his trial—I did not come in—I believe he was tried here—I do not know whether I was here every day—I dare say I was—I saw him in Newgate—I cannot tell how often—I took his clean linen in by his mother's orders, and his food—I did not go in every day—I cannot tell how long he was confined—I did not go in twenty times—I went two or three times, when he wanted clean linen or any thing—my daughter Eliza gets her living by needlework—that is as true as that I have not lived with Cotterell—I do not know that she has been a pros<lb></lb>titute in the streets—Mr. Evans did not come to tell me to speak the truth—I never saw him at my house to speak to him—I could swear it—he never came near me, and I never saw him at my house—they said he had been there—my daughter Charlotte lived at Birmingham—she never stole parasols—she brought them out by the forewoman's orders—I went to the Mansion-house when my daughter was in charge—I heard Mrs. Butler examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say one word about Mrs. Butler giving your daughter the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184507070051"></xptr>
               <p>parasols? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not in the Court till the bail came—the reason my daughter changed her name was that Mrs. Butler wished it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Zeal too well known among the officers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—because Mr. Cotterell was transported in regard of Mr. Evans's warehouse—I sup<lb></lb>pose Mr. Evans knew he was transported—I never heard that the prisoner had given the information which got Cotterell transported—my daughter Eliza gets her living by her needle and thread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I asked you whether to your knowledge, and sleeping in your house, she was not walking the streets, and had three b----d children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not watch after her to see that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness, and am between twenty-four and twenty-five years old. I live at home with my mother—I remember the Tuesday morning that my sister went to the station—I saw the prisoner that morning at my mother's—I had occasion to go out before breakfast, and when I returned he was sitting on a chair between the two windows—I and my sister were in the room—he had my book and my sister's in his hand—he said to me, "I see you have pot got two dozen of work in your book as your sister has, therefore your sitser must say the work is an exchange, for I am in a great deal of trouble—Mr. Evans came yesterday morning and took the work off the premises which I sold belonging to him, and cleared off the premises, along with the policeman"—he said, "Now Charlotte, you must stick to what I am going to tell you; you must say the work was in exchange; that you had two dozen from me, and two dozen from Mr. Evans, and yoa have "dislocated" the work and given the wrong to each party, and I only wish it was you had got to speak instead of your sister, as she is a very bad one to speak"—he said that to me—I said I would have nothing at all to do with it, and I would know nothing about it—that was all that took place—he said to my sister, "Stick to what I hare told you"—he then went away, leaving me and my sister there—she fell a crying against the fire-place, and said she did not like to do it at all—and he said, "Either you or your sister must, as I am in a very great deal of trouble"—she said nothing to that—he told her to stop at home till he had been to Mr. Evans, but she did not—she went to shop about twenty minutes after he went—I saw Mr. Zacks at the corner of South-street, about half-past ten o'clock the same morning—I went out, and as I re<lb></lb>turned I found my sister coming out at the door, and Mr. Zacks beckoned her—he is the prisoner's son-in-law—she went to him, and I went with her—I did not see the prisoner after that—I went from Crown-street into Bishopsgate with them, and he put up his hand and said, "Stick to the text that my father said this morning"—we went to Bishopsgate-street, and I then parted with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know Cotterell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by sight, ever since I was quite a child—there was not the least familiarity between us, nor any of my family, that I know of—I had nothing to do with him—my mother ceased to live with my father about two years before he died—she kept him seven years before he died—he died, having been in the workhouse a year—he lived in Sun-square the last part of his life, before he went to the workhouse—my mother was living in the same place—Cotterell was abroad then—my mother and him never lived together as man and wife, that I know of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he keep her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was in the habit of coming backward and forward—I know nothing further—my mother was not in the habit of taking him his meals to Newgate, that I know of—I did not go—I was not at home at the time—no gentleman has been to my house to examine me since my sister has been committed for trial—I have been asked what I had to say—I went to Mr. Wontner's—Mr. Hutchins, one of Mr. Evans's workmen, sent the news that I was to go—he came to me on Monday three weeks—I was outside the Mansion-house, and came inside—I saw Mrs. Butler examined by Mr. Wontner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of Green and Andrews—their warehouse is at Rutland Wharf, Upper Thames Street—William Barham was their warehouseman—his hours were from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m., and my hours from 8 a. m. to 6 p. m.—on Friday morning, 2nd November, I went to the warehouse earlier than usual—I got there about 10 minutes to 7 o'clock, and Barham arrived about 7—the prisoner drove down the wharf about 7. 15 in a van, and said to Barham "I have come for 12 quarters of oats"—Barham said "Very good"—Fearn did not say who he was or where he came from—Barham told him to back his horse against the stable-door—Fearn's man did so, and Barham told me to get on the stack and he would get the oats—those were Prince Oscar oats—the 12 quarters would be 24 sacks—while they were being loaded the prisoner was outside the stable-door watching, but nothing was said—his man then took the horse and van to the top of the wharf, and drove off towards Blackfriars Bridge—Fearn then asked us to go and have a glass of beer, and he, I, Barham and Green, and Andrews's carman all went to a public-house in Thames Street, whore we drank, and then returned</p>

               <p>to the wharf, and Fearn went up Thames Street in an opposite direc<lb></lb>tion to which the van had gone—I saw no order handed by Fearn to Barham, and I must have seen it if it had been—no goods would be delivered at any time of day without a delivery order—the warehouse<lb></lb>man receives a ticket from the clerk—Barham complained of being ill that day, and the next day he did not come—I had never seen Fearn before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">In custody</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to an indictment charging me with stealing 12 quarters of oats, the property of my master—on Wednesday, 2nd November, I was in Green and Andrews's employmen as warehouseman—my hours were from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.—the clerk used to come at 9 o'clock—if persons came for goods between 6 and 9 I should deliver them, but they would have to produce an order to me, and I should give the clerk the particulars when he came—on the Monday morning before this Friday Fearn came to the wharf and said "Is Ted the carman in?"—I said "He has left"—there had been a man named Edward Foster in the employment—Fearn asked me if I would have a glass—I said I would not mind, and we went to a public-house down Thames Street, where he said "Can you let me have some oats; I used to have some when Ted was here, can't you let me have some?"—I said I could not give him a decided answer then, I would let him know—I had known him before—he gave me his address, Cable Street, Shadwell—I went there between 7 and 8 o'clock on the Wednes<lb></lb>day evening—it is a corn chandler's shop—I said to him "You can come for some oats"—he asked me what time—I told him about 7—he said "I will come to-morrow morning," and we went in and had a glass—he came on Thursday or Friday morning, I won't be sure which; it was a little after 7 o'clock—he only came once—I loaded his van with 15 quarters instead of 12, in 30 sacks—I can't say the value, but he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his carman took away the van with the oats in it, and I went with him and Partridge to drink at a public-house—he gave me no de<lb></lb>livery order—I was unable to give an account of the oats disappearing, and I absented myself for two or three days.</p>

               <p>were given to him to hand them over to the clerk at night—about November 8 my clerk made a communication to me, I gave certain information, and on the 9th Fearn was taken into custody—Fearn did not speak to me—he was taken before an Alderman and remanded—we could not find Barham to call him as a witness—the oats stolen cost me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter, and some 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I went with Brown on 8th November, and watched about the prisoner's place of business, but I did not go inside—I saw three sacks of very fine oats at the station—if I had known that Barham had been convicted I would not have taken him on a second time—I had a very high character with him when he first came.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 9th November, about 10 a. m., I went with Detective Pott to the prisoner's shop, 296, Cable Street, Shadwell—I told him we were police-officers, and he would be charged with receiving, on 2nd November, between 7 and 8 a. m., 12 quarters of oats from a man in the employ of Green and Andrews, knowing them to be stolen—he said "I did receive them; I paid him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter"—I said "Have you any here?"—he said that he had four sacks full and four empties, pointing to where they stood—the four full ones had the name of Green and Aldridge on them, with the address—I showed them to Mr. Green—the prisoner said that he had sold the rest to his customers—I asked where the sacks of the rest were—he said "I sent them up to the firm two days after,'' and that he had no receipt for the money—I took him to the police-court, where he was discharged by the Alderman; but a bill was found by the Grand Jury against him, and I took him in custody again on a Bench warrant—he said "I thought it was all over"—I said nothing about Barham—on 13th December I went to Flowers, from information I received, and received 10 sacks—I heard Flowers examined at the police-court—he is ill, and there is no prospect of his being here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The full sacks were standing at the far end of the shop, and there was some com on the opposite side of the shop, which had been shot out of sacks, and empty sacks were standing by with that great mark, "Rutland Wharf," visible on them—he did not keep out of the way; he was away two days, but I believe it was on business—I heard Flowers say at the police-court that he bought 10 sacks of oats of the prisoner—other corn had been put into the sacks, but I found 10 sacks there—I heard Flowers say that the prisoner had given him 10 sacks for a load of hay, and they were very inferior, not so good as he had bargained for; they were rubbish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Green and Andrews, and have charge of the books—Fearn was never a customer—his name is not upon the books—it is not true that he returned a lot of sacks on 4th November belonging to the firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I dare say we have 2, 000 sacks on our premises; they are brought by our carmen and other carmen—if 50 empty sacks were brought into the yard the warehousemen would take them—he would not throw them on the ground or he would get no receipt—every empty sack brought in should be booked, and it is the men's duty to give me an account of all that are brought in—they all bear our name and address, but there is no mark by which we can tell that they have been to a particular customer.</p>

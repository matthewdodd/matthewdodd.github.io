On the day in the indictment, I left the Opera House at nine o'clock; every season after the Opera House closes, the workmen have a supper; we had so on the night in question, and I had a one-pound note, a three-shilling piece, and an eighteen-penny piece. After supper was over, I got a little way on my road home, when I met the prisoner by <placeName id="t18160918-55-crimeloc289">New-square, Westminster</placeName>

I felt the prisoner's hand go from my pocket, and on feeling, I told her she had picked my pocket of a one-pound note, and she denied it. I had been with her about twenty minutes. I called watch; the watchman came up; he searched her, and the one pound note was found down behind her on the stones. When I charged the watch with her, she said she had dropped it. I told her if she would give up the note, I would let her go, and she said, she had dropped it.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Davies-street. I am married; I was sitting at work, and heard Stop thief! called - I looked out of my window, and saw two lads; but I can take my solemn oath that neither of the prisoners are those who were running at that time - their father and mother live in York-court, or a yard that leads out of it.</p>

            . I am a porter, and live at No. 20, York-court. I know the two prisoners - on the evening of the robbery I was standing at my door, smoking a pipe; I heard Stop thief! cried, and went to the top of the court - I saw a lad running, a tall man after him, and a Policeman after him, but neither of the prisoners were there; I saw

I lost the stockings mentioned in the indictment, on Thursday the 5th of January in the morning: house and shop is not together; my apprentice my and boy went to the shop before me in the morning, and found the shop door open; he came immediately to let me know the shop door was broke open, and I was robbed. When I came to examine, I found a considerable quantity of silk stockings lost: among the rest, the things mentioned in the indictment. By the information of a barber's man, in St. Mary-Axe, who had bought a pair of my stockings, I went to one Mr. Aggibb's, in Broad Street, and found seven pair of silk stockings, two pair of white thread, and a pair of silk and worsted stockings, that were brought me, by the barber's boy; the pair of silk and worsted were bought by the barber's boy for half a crown; they cost me five shillings and six-pence at Nottingham: by the same information, I found one pair of stockings in George Street, in the Minories: the stockings are in the possession of the constable. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

I went to the Old Bailey for some of Sir John Fielding's men; then we went to the prisoner's husband's house, in Bull Court; there we found the prisoner; she began to talk in Hebrew, and said, O Lord, what is become to me! she did not know I was a Jew: she said, she only sold the things for three guineas.

I went after him. He left my watch behind, in my fob. I followed him into a public-house, and took him. When I took him he went down on his knees; he asked my pardon, and said, he would leave all his money with me, if I would let him go. I am quite sure the prisoner is the person that snatched my watch-chain. It was a steel chain, and I am certain he didnot run against me by accident. He turned me round to rob me. I have never seen the watch-chain since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a buiider—my business is at the wharf in the City-road—the prisoner has been in my employ since last July—in conse<lb></lb>quence of missing some coals, and what I heard, I gave instructions to the policeman on duty on the 14th of April, and at a quarter to ten o'clock that same evening, I went with him to the prisoner's lodging in Regent-street, City-road—I found some coals there and a file—the coals were of the same sort as those we burn in the factory—they are small—we burn shavings with them, and there were some shavings amongst those—they were exactly similar to what we burn—the file corresponds with one I had at my premises, and which was missing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 158.) On the 14th of April, in consequence of information from Mr. Smith, I set myself to watch, and about twenty minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Smith's premises with a basket of coals in his hand—I stopped him, and asked what he had got there—he said it was all right, that he worked on the premises and he had got the coals from a boatman—he wrested his arm to get from me, but I brought him to the station—I then went to his premises, and found some other coals.</p>

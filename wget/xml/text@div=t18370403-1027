I know the prisoner and her hus<lb></lb>band, William Barton, who keeps a public-house—I knew her before she married him—I was present at their marriage, on the 29th of January, 1824, at Skirbeck in Lincolnshire—they lived together as man and wife for several years—I saw Barton last Monday night in Lincolnshire.</p>

               <p>before they parted, and went to live at Boston—Barton got into reduced circumstanes, and all his property was sold off—the prisoner, after that, came to London, and got a situation as servant—the children were on the parish—the child she had by Taylor, and two she had by Barton—she did not take them from the workhouse—they have always been on the parish, I believe—she left Barton about seven years ago, and I understand since that she has supported herself—the second husband is the prosecutor in this case.</p>

            , who rents part of Mr. O'Hara's house; the prisoner lived with my sister. On the 21st of December, as I was making the prisoner's bed, I dropped my pocket in his room: I did not know it till next morning. The articles mentioned in the indictment were in my pocket. On the evening of the 28th I saw the piece of sealing wax and the pencil taken out of the prisoner's pocket by the constable. I had asked him if had seen my pocket, and he said he knew nothing about it. My sister told him she thought it was dropped in his room; he persisted in deny-it. We sent for Hartly, the constable, but he did not search him thoroughly; the prisoner then went up to his sister, who lives in the house, and did not come down again. We afterwards sent for Watson, and he found the sealing-wax and pencil on him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SAYER. I live with, and am employed by, Mrs. Wynn; my mistress told me to watch the prisoner. I saw him go out with his sister; I followed them to St. Martin's-court, when they turned round and saw me, and then dodged me about. I watched them into a gin-shop, in Holborn, I looked through the door, and saw them change a note; when they came out, I went in and told the landlord to keep the note.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RAMSEY. I am shopman to Mr. Perryman, who keeps a wine-vaults, in Holborn; the prisoner came to our house with a woman, and had some rum, the woman gave me the Â£1 note to change; she gave me the name of Jones, No. 25, Broad-street. I gave her the change. The instant they went out the last witness came in.</p>

             M'GINNIS. The sealing-wax is bent up in a particular manner; and there is a notch in the pencil, which was done by my sister's child. I am sure they are mine, and that they were in my pocket when I lost it. The prisoner was not in the habit of nursing the child.</p>

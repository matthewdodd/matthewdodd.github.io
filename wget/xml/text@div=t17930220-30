I was going up Broad-street, Bloomsbury, it was a little turned eleven o'clock; as I was going past the said shop, a person passed by me very sharp, and he might fling them down for what I know; that young man came up to me and said, you have got a pair of shoes; not that I know of, said I, and I turned back with him and he picked them up, about a dozen doors off from where he stopped me; I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a very good character.</p>

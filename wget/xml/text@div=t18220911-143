On the 31st of July, I went out at one o'clock in the day, leaving nobody there. I double locked the door, the windows were fast. I did not return till next morning, between ten and one o'clock. I then found the window shutters down - they take down outside. I missed this property. I lost some crockery also, which I have since seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. How long had you lived there - A. Four months. King sleeps there occasionally; I pay the rent with his money - he lives with me when his business does not call him from town - he has contracts in different parts of the country. The prisoner's back door is by ours; his wife and a man came and offered me money to settle it - I refused.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The clothes are yours - are they bought with King's money - A. Part of them.</p>

            . I am a widow. My little girl was in the habit of going to King's on errands, and on the afternoon of the 31st of July, between five and six o'clock, she came and told me something. About an hour afterwards, I went to our privy, and found four basins, a wash-hand basin, and a mug. I went to King's house, and saw the door wrenched open - a chair was against it, and there were also some blue plates by the door. I went up stairs, and missed the bed clothes.</p>

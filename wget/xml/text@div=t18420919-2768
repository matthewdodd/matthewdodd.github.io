                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ISAAC SKEET</hi>. I am brewhouse master to Mr. Beaufoy, of South Lambeth; Wilmot was our brewer; Stemp was a customer. On the 29th of August, in consequence of information, I was on the look-out as to what Wilmot might be doing—the dinner hour was one o'clock—the men went to dinner—I did not go that day—I and Wilmot were on the same floor where the barley-stones are—we were grinding, and the furnace was lighted that day, as there was to be brewing going on that day under Wilmot's direction—he did not go to dinner that day—it was his duty to attend to his furnace—he is'the brewhouse foreman—there is a seat and a table for him between the two furnaces—it is the usual place for the brewhouse foreman when tne furnaces are lighted, to take his dinner at—I take my dinner near the same spot, and have in full view the barley stores on which I am working—on that occasion Wilmot took his dinner at the top against the stain, at a considerable distance from the furnace where be ought to be; and from the part where be sat to take his dinner, he could command a view of when I was, and could see through an opening down below stairs—he could see any person who might enter the premises on the ground-floor—just before dinner I had occasion to leave the room in which land Wilmot were, and go down stairs to wash my hands—when you get down it brings you to the pavement yard, on the ground-floor—there were some empty hogsheads and casks standing on the pavement—just by there is the fermentiog-tun<lb></lb>stage—when I went down I noticed these casks—there was no sack on any of them, or on the pavement floor, nor on the tun-stage—I washed my hands and returned—there was no sack there then—I found Wilmot up stairs then—my dinner was brought me, and he called to me to go and have it—some time afterwards his dinner was brought—I began eating—Wilmot sat down for a moment, and then he left me and went down—thit would lead him to the tun-stage—he could step on the-tun-stage—it is about five feet from the paved yard—there is a canvas funnel descends from the bins—by putting an empty sack, and untying this canvas funnel, a sack is filled instantaneously—Wilmot returned to the room up stain in a few minutes—during his absence he had sufficient time to draw two sacks of malt from the canvas funnel—I went down stairs again after he had returned up, and there was one sack standing on a hogshead, and an<lb></lb>other on the tun-stage—they were quite full—I am quite certain that neither of these sacks were there when I went down before—the one on the hogshead was tied up—I found there was malt in the two sacks—in the floor immediately over the pavement there is a well for the purpose of putting up the sacks—I took my station in the room above, after I returned; and while I was leaning over the rope-rail there, Stemp came with a horse and cart in front of the door—there were four full sacks in his cart—Stemp came to the door of the brewing-house, and turned the tail of his cart round to the door—there is an outer gate, about sixty yards from the brewhouse—the well which I was at was just over where these</p>

               <p>sacks were, which I had seen in the brewhouse—the door is about forty feet from where the sacks are—a man on the ground could have seen the cart and the casks—Stemp could have seen the sack which was on the cask—he got off his cart, and walked into the brewhouse, and unloaded the sacks from the cart—I asked him if he had got some barley—he said, "Yes, I have got a quarter of barley, a quarter of oats, and a quarter of malt"—that would have made six sacks, and I am confident he only brought four—he placed the four sacks on the pavement floor, about six feet from the sack upon the hogshead—I said he had got no malt there——he said, "No, there stands one there," pointing to the sack of malt that itood on the hogshead—I said, "Yes, I know there is"—he made no answer, but talked about his barley meal, and asked if it was ready—(he had before that brought us some barley meal to grind)—I said, yes, I bad got it ready for him—he then passed out of my sight, went up into the brewhouse, in sight of all the sacks—I heard voices while he was out of my sight—they were Stemp and Wilmot's voices, as if speaking together—I then saw Stemp up stairs—I went with him to the room where we were grinding the barley—I then went back, to convince myself that then were but four sacks which he had brought, and they were exactly as he left them—I then got his meal ready for him—I went with him up to the meal-trough, in the room where my barley stores are—they are in the same room as the furance is, and about twenty yards off—Stemp went with me to the end of the room to get the meal, which I weighed, and gave to Stemp—Wilmot was not there—I heaved the meal on my shoulder, and came down with it, accompanied by Stemp, for the purpose of patting it into Stemp's cart—I came down stairs to where I had left the sacks, and there was then a sack of malt pitched down, just by the four sacks which Stemp brought—there were five sacks there then, and the one was removed from the hogshead—Stemp said he wanted to have his barley, oats, and malt ground—I said it would be ground on the following morning, and said be had not brought any malt—he said he had left it in the morning, as he was going by after coals—he gave me a sixpence, and went off—I found the second sack standing in the same place—after Stemp was gone I told my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brewer at Mr. Beaufoy's. I had the sole charge of the malt—Wilmot was foreman, under me—it was not his duty to draw off any malt from the canvas funnels without a written order from me—the bin, No. 1, contained about 100 quarters at this time—after I had heard about Wilmot and Stemp, I looked at the top of the bin up stairs, it presented the appearance of a conical shaped hole—I should think there had been rather more than two sacks of malt gone, four bushels to the sack—I saw the sack on the tun-stage—I looked, and found it contained malt—I afterwards saw a fifth sack of malt, with four others, containing oats and barley—I saw samples taken from these sacks, and compared with the malt in the bin—Mr. Darby and Mr. Beaufoy ex<lb></lb>amined it in the middle of Tuesday—I heard Mr. Beaufoy tax Wilmot with drawing down the malt without an order—Wilmot said he had drawn it down (referring to the sack on the tun-stage) in consequence of something that I had said in reference to cats dirtying it—the policeman was then sent for—I afterwards looked into a closet used by Wilmot—it contained two sacks, which did not belong to Mr. Beaufoy—I had some conversa<lb></lb>tion about cats with Wilmot—it had no reference to the bin No. 1—it was another bin at the further end of the premises, thirty or forty feet off; there are other bins between them—there had been dirt on the surface of that bin, but that had no reference to No. 1—if there had been dirt on the top of No. 1, it would not have been a likely manner to get rid of it to draw it by the canvas shoot—there is a hopper to bin No. 1—there was some loose malt spilt round the top of this hopper—I said if Mr. Beaufoy came round, he would be displeased at it—it was only a few shovels full spilt—Wilmot could not have got two sacks from what was spilt—I found</p>

               <p>no deficiency there, with the exception of what we cleared up—I bad not given Wilmot any order to draw one or two sacks of malt from No. 1—my attention was drawn to the four sacks that Stemp brought between nine and ten on Tuesday morning—I afterwards saw them sealed by Mr. Beau<lb></lb>foy, and they are here now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a vinegar merchant, brewer, and miller. I live in South Lambeth—I have no partner—my attention was first called to this on the Tuesday morning—I saw tone samples taken from the two sacks and the bin No. 1.—I have beet in this business since 1805—according to my judgment they corres<lb></lb>pond in every respect—I had information and kept a look-out—I asked Wilmot if he had drawn the malt out of No. 1 bin—he said he had done it—I then asked by whose order, and after repeating the question at least half a dozen times, he said, by order of Mr. Cooper, he had desired him to draw from the bin because the cats had dirtied—I went up to the floor af<lb></lb>terwards and the bins were closed, so there could have been no scattering from the other bins.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant V</hi> 16.) I took this sample of malt from bin No. 1—I took Stemp into custody on the 30th, near the Black Horse, Brixton-road—he seemed very much confused, and said he nothing about it—I asked him how many sacks of corn he took to Beaufoy's the day before—he said, five sacks, two of oats, two of barley, and one of malt—as we were going to the station, he asked me if I was a right one, if I was, money should be no object, if I could tell him what to say to get out of this—I said I was not in a situation to advise him, I could say nothing to him about it—about two minutes after, he said he carried the sack of malt on his back into Mr. Beaufoy's yard in the morning when he went to Vauxhall-road for coals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Wandsworth Magis<lb></lb>trate. I was present at the examination of Wilmot—he made a state<lb></lb>ment—I took it down in writing—this is Mr. Thomas Paynter the Magis<lb></lb>trates signature—what he said was correctly taken down, word for word—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner, Richard Wilmot, says, When I was asked how that malt came there, I said I <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> it down; I was asked by whose orders, I said by Mr. Cooper's and Mr. Skeet's, and the reason for my drawing it down, which was on last Friday, was, Mr. Cooper and me being on the top floor, looking behind the glass door, I observed the malt standing above the floor; he asked me what it did there? I told him that the malt had been shot into the bin until it would go no further; Mr. Cooper told me I had better take it up, and said if Mr. Beaufoy came up he would not like to see it lay there, because he objected to the cats dirty<lb></lb>ing in it; that was all that passed then between Mr. Cooper and me. In the course of the day Mr. Skeet found fault of the cats dirtying in the malt, and said that unless it was took up it would stop his roller; that is all that pasted between him and me; and accordingly I went down stairs and took a tack from about fifty, some with one mark and some with another—after I had drawed it down I placed it against the wall at the back of the tun; there is a mark on the sack "M" in red, and I think it is marked "24" in red, that is all I have to say; the sack I refer to is the one that stood on the stage floor; the malt I drew was from bin No. 1."</p>

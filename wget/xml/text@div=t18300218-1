On the 22nd of January, a little after nine o'clock in the morning, I received information from an officer, and missed this flannel; I went to Guildhall directly, and saw the two prisoners in custody - I saw seven pieces of flannel there, which I am certain are ours; they are worth about 23l. - they were kept in different parts of the warehouse - I had put part of them by myself the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you know that at the time Crane was in your warehouse, that Saggers was not there, being ill? A. I do not know that; Saggers has been occasionally ill - I will not swear Crane was not employed part of the time of his being ill; I did not employ him - I believe Saggers has been ill for a fortnight or three weeks at a time. Crane could not be in our employ as extra porter while Saggers was ill, because he could not be there without Saggers employing him - our warehouseman is here; we have a clerk, who is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not be employed part of the time that Saggers was ill? A. He might, but it would be extraordinary - I should think it impossible; I will not swear it- he could not be in our employ unless Saggers employed him, because he always employed the extra porters; he generally does - if he is on the premises he does it: Crane never was employed by any body else, I am certain - I will swear that; nobody but myself, Saggers, and the warehouseman employ extra porters, as far as regards Crane I think I am right - Crane was never employed by any body except by Saggers; if Saggers was away we must, of course, employ an extra porter - nobody but myself and the warehouseman employed them; I will not swear Crane was never employed there when Saggers was ill, I do not think he was - the warehouseman is here to tell you; we have not two warehouses in London - we have an upper and lower room in the same house, but not two establishments; we serve customers in Cheapside, both wholesale and retail, but never send goods there to be sold retail on our account, I swear that - they could not be sent without my knowledge, unless they went the same way as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask Saggers to go to Guildhall, without taking him into custody? A. I did, and he went - I do not know whether it was willingly; he did not manifest any unwillingness, but I cannot tell what passes in a man's mind - I told him to go for the purpose of identifying Crane, who was in custody; he went without making any objection - the Magistrate was not sitting, and he was at liberty; he had not been taken into custody: he went again willingly, at my request, in about half an hour - he knew I had charged somebody with stealing the goods; he was examined and detained - he denied all knowledge of Crane: he has been in our employ three years - he lived in Philip-lane; I went to his lodgings, but found nothing there of ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you or the warehouseman attend to the business? A. We both attend; I do not know which of us is most employed - I cannot state any time at which Crane was employed; it must be within two years or two years and a half - I will not be confined to two years and a half; I have seen him on the premises, but cannot say when; I will swear I have seen him on the premises, my present warehouseman was then in my employ - we have been in business in London nearly three years; I will not swear to any time; I will swear it is within the last three years, but I recollect seeing Crane there, coming with a knot, and putting it aside - I know him well, and Saggers must have paid him - he always paid the extra porters; if he was ill we must have paid them; I never paid Crane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say about how long it is since you employed him? A. I cannot tell - I have seen him on the premises.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday, the 22nd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180004"></xptr>of January, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I met Crane in Whitecross-street, nearly opposite the prison wall - he had a load on his back, tied up in a sheet; I asked him where he was going with that load - he had it very loose on his head; he said he was going to Islington with it - I asked if he had got an invoice of the goods; he said No: I told him to bring them over the way to Harris' public-house, where I deposited the goods, and took him to the Compter; he did not say how he came by them, or whose they were, nor ask why I took him, but went with me directly - the sheet contained seven pieces of flannel; I inquired at different houses - I saw the prosecutors the same morning, about half-past ten o'clock; they saw the goods at Guildhall, and claimed them - I saw nothing of Saggers till I went to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>HENRY WESTON. I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. About half-past nine o'clock on Friday morning, the 22nd of January, Salter came to the door, and produced a wrapper, which I could not swear to; I afterwards saw the goods at Guildhall, and can swear to their being the prosecutors' property - I cannot say when I had seen them last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you swear these goods have not been sold? A. I can swear I never sold them; Mr. Tweedale sells goods, and occasionally Saggers and the clerk; the clerk is not here - I cannot swear he had not sold them; he is in our service now - his name is John Brenan; we have had another clerk within the last three years - our manufactured goods are never sold with a private-mark on them; other goods have been sold with the private-marks - I know of no place in Cheapside, or any where else, where goods are sold on my masters' account; we have a manufactory at Rochdale; four persons were engaged in the warehouse at this time, Saggers, Mr. Tweedale, the clerk, and myself; no other porter was employed at the time - I did not miss the goods till the officer showed me them; I could see the goods were taken from the holes - we missed them after the officer came; unless the officer had brought them we might never have missed them, our stock is so extensive; I might have supposed them sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been warehouseman to the prosecutors? A. About three years, since they have been in London; I have some slight recollection of Crane, but cannot swear I have seen him on our premises.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was employed as extra porter must you not have known it? A. No, I am out of town a good deal.</p>

            . I live at a wine-vaults, No. 110, Fore-street, Cripplegate. On the morning of the 22nd of January, Crane came into the shop with a load on his back - he put it down on the stool, and called for a glass of gin and spruce; he asked me to help the load on his back - I did so, and asked him if it was cloth; he said it was, and he was going to Shoreditch with it; I lifted it on his back, and he went out - I have known both the prisoners for the last two years, coming for spirits; Crane was quite alone in our shop; an officer came and made inquiry - I saw Crane in custody at Guildhall on the following Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is Fore-street from the White Swan, Bunhill-row? A. About half a mile - it was about half-past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. TWEEDALE.

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate that you thought it was not your's? A. Never - it has Leach on it.</p>
               <p>Crane's Defence. I met a man who employed me; he looked like a porter, and wore a long frock coat - I met him in Cripplegate-buildings; he asked me to carry the load to the top of Goswell-road - he gave me 6d., and said he would overtake me at the top of Goswell-road, and give me the other 6d.</p>

            . I live at No. 99, Britannia-street, City-road, and am a commercial traveller; I am acquainted with Crane's person - I have been in the habit of meeting him at the White Swan, Bunhill-row. On the 22nd of January I had occasion to meet a person at the Bird-cage, Wood-street; I breakfasted at McLellan's, at the end of Wood-street, and saw Crane in Cripplegate-buildings - it was just after eight o'clock, for while I was at breakfast some hot rolls were brought in; Crane was at that time selling goods in the silk trade, and haberdashery, and I believe travelled with them - he was talking to a person in Cripplegate-buildings, and standing leaning on a post by Deacon's warehosue; only one person was with him - a short man in a fustian jacket had the parcel; Crane had not got it - the other person had it leaning on the post; I could not hear what passed because I was not near enough - they appeared in conversation, and had I not seen him in company with another person I should have spoken to him - after they had conversed together for some time, Crane took up the parcel, which had been carried by the other person, and went towards Whitecross-street, towards Fore-street - had he been going the other way it would most likely have been the same way as myself, which was up Wood-street; the person talking to him had the parcel before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not see where that person got the parcel? A. Certainly not - it was a large bundle, packed in a coarse cloth; I was the length of this Court off - I was coming out of the coffee-shop, and saw him standing by Deacon's warehouse.</p>

            . (in continuation) It was much about the size of that wrapper - Crane went towards Whitecross-street; the other man turned up towards Monkwell-street - I did not go and speak to Crane, for my time was up to be at the Bird-cage.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you known Crane long? A. Two or three years, and considered him an honest man from what I knew of him - I am intimately acquainted with the landlord, with whom he dealt, and visited him frequently.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you hear Crane was taken up? A. Either on the Tuesday or Wednesday following - this happened on the Friday; I mentioned this to the landlord of the house I use, the week after he was taken; I did not attend the examination; I did not know he was committed till I saw it in the newspaper - his wife having heard what I stated, asked me to come forward on the trial.</p>

             re-examined. The parcel weighed about 1 cwt.; I stopped him at the gateway of the King's Arms, Whitecross-street, nearly opposite the prison - there is no post about the spot Taylor describes, where a load could be rested on - they are all high gas-lamps; I am not quite certain of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 102, Brunswick Street—on Tuesday evening, 31st August, I was at the Duke of Sussex with the prisoner and his wife—the prisoner came into the bar suddenly and ordered some bread and cheese—he called for some ale, and said to Mrs. Green's mother, "Don't give that b—cow anything"—he went out for a quarter of an hour, came back, and said he wanted cheese, a buiscuit, and a knife, which were given to him—he ate a bit of cheese and biscuit, and all of a sudden he attacked Mrs. Green with the knife and tried to cut her throat—he knocked me down and I got the knife from him once, but he got it from me—they had two or three words before he knocked Mrs. Green down, and he said that he meant to do for her—on the day before that we were at the George IV., at Dalston, and he said to his wife that he meant to corpse her or corpse himself—we were sober, but Mrs. Green was not.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—I had been living with another woman, as the prisoner had deserted me—I met him in the City on 20th December, and we went on to Bowling-green-lane—he asked me to take hold of him—I refused—he said that he would go home—I said that he should not—he got hold of my shawl, and cut it, I believe, with a knife, but I did not see one in his hand—he then tore my bonnet and cap, and then struck me on the mouth—there was a cut, and it bled very much—I cannot say whether he had a knife in his hand or not—he ran away, and I followed him—I was under treatment for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker of 7, Wood-street, Exmouth-street. On 20th December, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going home to tea, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor at the corner of Bowling-Green-lane—the prisoner said to her, "Catch hold of my arm," he then pulled her bonnet over her eyes, and some people hallooed out, "There is a knife," but I saw no knife—I saw blood on the female's lips, and saw four cuts from the knife on the breast part of her shawl—I saw the prisoner put his hand in his pocket, and saw blood on his knuckles—he ran away, I followed him, saw him throw something into a cart, and found there this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with blood on the blade and handle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did his hands appear as if they were bleeding? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was blood on them, I cannot tell where it came from—I did not see that his knuckles were cut, I thought he might have hit her in the mouth and hurt his knuckles—I did not hear the dispute about the furniture—she was not quarrelling with him that I heard after I went up—it was all done in about four minutes.</p>

I took the prisoner in the Bagnigge-wells-road about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—his knuckles were cut—I looked at the knife, and there was blood on the blade—the prosecutor gave him in charge—her lip was cut through from the outside to the teeth, it was severed—it was a kind of a rounding cut—I did not take her to a surgeon, she went to the station and the blood stopped.</p>

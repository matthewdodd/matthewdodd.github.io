            . Q. Were you serving in Mr. Thwaites's shop - A. Yes. The prisoners came in together between three and four, they asked for some muslin, I shewed them several sorts; after some time May bought a quarter of a yard at one shilling and sixpence a yard, that was fourpence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any printed cottons on the counter where they were - A. A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the pieces that were picked up nae them - A. After they were picked up I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they upon the counter by them - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they pay you - A. They gave me a shilling, I took it to Mr. Thwaites and told him I suspected the prisoners, and got the change of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoners done any thing that made you suspect them - A. Their manner was very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them do any thing which made you suspect them - A. The prisoner Kolp stooped down several times, I looked over the counter, and she gave me a piece of printed cotton, which she said had fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that induce you to look over to see if there was any more on the ground - A. No. I then went with the shilling for the change, when I returned I saw Kolp with one hand in her pocket hole, and her side stuck out very much, which made me suspect that she had taken something. I saw Mr. Thwaites pick the print up; I did not see it drop; I believe Kolp dropped it; Mr. Thwaites picked it up from the place where she was standing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him pick up the other piece - A. I saw him stoop, and then when he got up he had it in his hand; I was not on that side. He picked up the second piece from where May had been standing. Kolp struck me with a patten; I did not see her strike me; I received a blow as they were going out of the shop; when the officer was attempting to take them out of the shop.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. I have got two pieces of cotton; I received them from Mr. Thwaites and his son.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The small piece is what May dropped; it has my private mark upon it. The other piece, I picked it up at the same time, it has my private mark; the value of the smaller piece is ten shillings, and the value of the large one, it cost fifteen pence halfpenny a yard; it is near forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the cotton fall did you say any thing to either of the prisoners - A. I charged them with having dropped the cotton; Kolp did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge May with dropping the other piece - A. I cannot say I did. I could not be certain that May did drop the other piece; I only saw it lay at her feet. I saw Kolp distinctly drop one piece; I was within three feet of her at the time it fell.</p>
               <p>Kolp's Defence. I went to this gentleman's shop with this young woman; we went to buy some muslin for caps; there were a great many pieces on the counter; I never touched them at all; after I had the change the gentleman came and challenged me with taking a piece of print, and at Hatton Garden he only challenged us with taking one piece. He locked us in a room for two or three hours; when he came round the counter and challenged us; I told him I did not know what he meaned; I knew nothing of it. He searched me; I had nothing. I was outside of the door; he brought me in again and said he had lost some print; he told the young woman at the time he did not see any thing; somebody said there was a piece of print laying on the ground; I was never nigh it.</p>
               <p>May's Defence. I cannot say any thing more than what she has said.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I challenged her she was at the further part of the shop; fifty-five feet from the door. I picked up the two pieces at one time.</p>

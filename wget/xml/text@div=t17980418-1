She stated that she had been at Steel's for six or seven months past, and that she worked for Steel, who had a wife and one child, for which she received her board and clothes; that she had done needle-work for the family, but could not recollect what part of the family. She stated that Steel had kept the Cock two years; that she had received a two pound note from Steel about a week ago; that Steel had taken the Horse and Groom public-house from her husband, in St. Martin's-lane; he was to give two hundred pounds. She admitted that she had gone into the shop to purchase spoons. I questioned her how she had been employed for several days previous to the 28th. She stated, that, on the 27th, she had not been out of Steel's house the whole day; that she had been employed in nursing the child, and needlework. That, on the preceding day, the 26th, she did nothing material, but made the beds; but was not out. On the 25th, she could not tell what she was about; that she was reading, but not out on that day. On the 24th, was cleaning the house. On the 23d, could not tell what she was about, but was not out. In short, that she had not been out of Steel's house all the week; that she had received the note in question with several other notes, six I believe, then twelve, afterwards eighteen, and I believe at last, one hundred, from Dighton, in Shoe-lane, who she supposed had manufactured them; that they were not filled up; but a circumstance occurred, her son being in her presence; he was an apprentice to an engraver. Her own son stated, that she had asked him to fill up those blanks, and she would give him a shilling a piece to fill them up; and the boy said, he would sooner suffer death. He said, she had told him she had received these notes from Dighton, and that she was to share in the produce of them. To all which she assented.</p>

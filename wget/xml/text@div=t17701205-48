            , in Spital-fields. I was one of the members of the house of call in Spital-fields. About the beginning of December last, a circular letter was sent to the society I belong to, desiring the society to send a representative to meet the Town at the sign of the Maidenhead in Ram Alley, Fleet-street. No attention being paid to this, about the middle of December last a second was sent, containing words to the following purport:</p>
               <p>"That several journeymen taylors had assembled to work piece-work, and upon other business of importance" signed, the Town. After the letter had been read in the society, they desired me to go and meet the Town as their representative, and deputed me to act for them. I went to the Maidenhead next evening, that was Wednesday; there were about nine journeymen there; they desired to know what wages we had, they said they had 3 s. a day, and plenty of work. He called to the representative of Westminster and places adjacent to know what wages they had; they made that answer. Then he called for those that represented the city of London to give instructions; he called to me to advance; I did, and desired to know the cause of that meeting; he told me he supposed I had heard or seen the note that had been sent, about the taylors that worked piece-work in Long-acre; he then gave me instructions, which was these: that it would be a great prejudice to those journeymen that had assembled there and that the taylors of Westminster had com to a unanimous resolution not to work piece-work or over hours, and those that did it were to be excluded from the society; and they were to pay a fine of 5 s. upon reenterance; and that they should not work or be re-entered till the fine was paid: these were the instructions that I was to deliver to the society I represented. They agreed to work with no matter that work'd by the piece, nor with any that gave work for over hours; nor with those that worked over hours; and any that should act contrary thereto, were to be fined 10 s. 6 d. and I was to bring the conditions of the society, I represented, to them at their next meeting. I desired leave from them to make remarks upon their proceedings: I told them that I highly disapproved of their meetings, as it might be attended with fatal consequences. After I had represented it to the society, they all agreed to work for the wages allowed by law. We continued till the 4th of January, when we received a note, desiring as to meet at the Poulterer's Arms in Honey-lane market; it was signed The Town. The contents of it were, that the journeymen in Westminster had agreed to strike off on the 8th of January, and they wanted to know whether the other societies were willing to do the same. It was put to the vote, eleven agreed to it, and ten opposed it; they were to meet on the 7th of January in the evening, and were to strike upon the 8th. On Saturday the 6th I desired the members of the society to be together, and we agreed not to take any notice of the Town; and we agreed to work on Monday the 8th for the wages allowed by law. We continued to work without being molested till the 16th, and then about half past Six, four men came up into the shop, and went to the right hand side of the board, and required of the men to leave off work, pulling sticks from under their coats, with many imprecations, threatening revenge to those that would not directly comply. They fell upon one

            , he not knowing what they said; one of them gave him a violent blow upon the side. Then they came on the other side of the shop, where I was working, and desired me to leave off directly. It was very hard to leave off that moment, as my master had some things in a hurry; I desired we might work till one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050038"></xptr> o'clock, and then we would strike. They said it was in vain, we must strike directly. I replied, that I would not consent to their demands be the consequence what it would. I pretended to leave off work. I got upon the board, and took an iron in one hand and a plank in the other, and defended myself. I seized one in the shop, and Mr. Clann, my master, secured another; but for want of an officer they made their escape. The next night I went to the Blue Last in Salisbury Court, and remonstrated with James-Cargill on the ill consequence of their proceedings. He replied to me, that it could not be avoided, we should comply with the Town, and then such things would not happen. He said, you have it now in your power to have 3 s. a day, and to force the masters to give it; and I request that you would persuade others, and then the scarcity of hands will make them give more wages; and I recommend it to you in general, that all men that work at under wages you do keep to the original fine.</p>

            . I am a journeyman taylor, I know the prisoners Dixon and Longland, I know the others by sight.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any general meeting of the journeymen taylors, called the Town?</p>
               <p>Evans. I have known several that have been sent as representatives to meet the Town.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect one in the Minories?</p>
               <p>Evans. There were several, but none in particular at that time; I know the society in the Minories, at which Frazer acted as Clerk; I was present at that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do?</p>
               <p>Evans. Mr. Frazer and I were shop-mates, on the 10th of January last, he told me that an order was issued out by the clerk of the committee, that all journeymen taylors should strike for 3 s. and he said that if we did not all agree to strike, we should be very ill used at night. I therefore thought myself under a necessity to comply with it; six of us did strike, I went the same afternoon to the Marshal and Anchor, where I found none that had struck for wages; about seven at night there might be I believe, about twenty or twenty-five that were determined to strike according to the order of the clerk of the committee: on the 15th, when I went into the house aforesaid, about eight o'clock, Dixon, Frazer and Longland were present; Dixon rose up, d - d my blood, and asked me where I had been that I had not attended the house to know what they should consult about for that time. I told them I had been doing a little business for my uncle; then he and Frazer seized me by the collar and bid me sign a paper they had got, in order to go and search Mr. Neale's men and Mr. Thompson's and Clann's in Spital-fields. I declared I could not agree to it nor sign it; they d - d me again, and asked me why I would not be agreeable with the rest of the men, for that many of the men had signed that paper in order to meet him at five in the morning precisely, and they were to bring sticks in their hands and stones in their pockets; part were to meet at the Angel in the Minories, and part at the Pea-hen in Bishopsgate-street, and they said d - n their journeymen's fouls, if they will not agree with the Town to raise the wages to three shillings and three halfpence per day, we will break their arms and fingers, and knock out some of their eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said this?</p>
               <p>Evans. Dixon, Longland and Frazer; they said they would break their arms and fingers, &amp;c. and then they were sure they could not turn doings; by these mean they obliged me to agree to sign that paper. I told then they might put my name down, and if I did not meet them I would pay any fine that they should fix upon me; and as the Pea-hen was a house of call, I made in my business to call there, and I found about six there that were all entire strangers to me; they asked me what house I belonged to, and asked me if I would meet them in the morning; I told them I knew nothing to the contrary; they were preparing themselves with sticks, and they wanted to know where they could get stones; one said there was enough in Moor-fields, and they could get them as they went along, and also they said they hoped that every man would have conduct enough not to call any man he knew by his right name, for it might be dangerous: before we went, after I had left that house, I took an opportunity to give an information of it to a servant of Mr.

Mr. Neale's was in bed; we went to his uncle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050039"></xptr> and by his order we went to the constable of the night to get him to prepare men to guard the men to work in the morning. On the 16th of January, about eight at night, I went to the house of call: Dixon and Frazer were present, they both d - d my blood, and said, they had been at my apartments to enquire after me; they said I had been to give information against them, I said I had not. Dixon took up a case knife that lay on the table, and said, d - n my blood, if I was sure that you had been to give information, I would cut your throat from ear to ear before you get out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing any other of the prisoners conversant in this matter?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Evans. Three, Mr. Neale's, Mr. Thompson's, and Mr. Clann's in Spital-fields.</p>

               <p>I never saw the paper till a fortnight afterwards; there never was any animosity between us; I sold him a pair of breeches afterwards.</p>

               <p>Samuel Carpenter. I keep the Fountain, a house of cast in the Minories; Dixon has used my house about three months; I have sent him to several masters, and I never heard any complaint; we have nothing in my house but what is regular.</p>

He told her he would stay there, upon which she the said Mrs. Bary went out, and Mr. Goring coming up, seeing Mr. Deering, cryes, Who's here? Mr. Deering, and desires him to go down; which Mr. Deering refusing, he told him, If he would not by fair means, he should by foul; and putting too the Door, and locking it, drew upon Mr. Deering, who, defending himself, received divers Wounds, and, at last, people running up, found both Swords drawn; and parting them, laying hold of Mr. Deering, Mr. Goring presently fell down, and dyed.

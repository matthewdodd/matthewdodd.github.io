I went to bed at one o'clock, every thing was then safe. I was disturbed about half-past three, and saw two men in the shop, behind the counter - one of them held a lanthorn. One said to the other</p>
               <p>"We had better go, or we shall be found out." They went out at the side door, which opens into Catherine Wheel-alley - I did not hear it open, it must have been open before. I ran to the door, called out Stop thief, and followed one to Spital-square. They escaped. I could not well see their faces - one was smaller than the other, but I cannot identify either. I returned, and found a water-spout put through the skylight into the parlour - the glass was cut out as a glazier would do it - a small man might get through. I missed the property stated in the indictment; I have seen part of it since. There was a watch-box three doors off, but I could not find the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were not both the men you saw larger than the prisoner - A. I cannot say, I did not tell the Lord Mayor so: I have no recollection of saying anything of the kind. One was taller than the other, but the tallest was not very tall.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Houndsditch. On the 18th of October the prisoner came to my shop, and offered to pledge a gold necklace, a brooch, and a pair of ear-rings; I suspected they were stolen, and questioned him; he said his father sent him with them. He wanted me to send for his father, I sent for an officer. I knew him before, by his occasionally pledging goods at my house, and knew he lived in St. Mary Axe. He sometimes pledged jewellery and cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You asked no more than who sent him - A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Parsons's, and asked the prisoner how he came by the property? He said he was going to fetch some butter, and met a man who wanted to sell them to him, and he took them to pawn in order to satisfy the man for what he asked, but he did not know the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know his father, and can find him at any time - A. Yes; I asked him why he did not send for his father, as he was a dealer, and might deal in jewellery. I searched his father's house, but found nothing.</p>

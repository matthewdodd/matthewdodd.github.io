                  </hi>. I am a widow, keeping a grocer's shop at No, 18 Upper Marylebone-street. The prisoner was my porter—between eleven and twelve o'clock on Saturday night, I went into the back kitchen and found 3lbs. of what I believe was my sugar, put into the prisoner's apron, and put into a tub—I watched—he removed it from there, and put it into a barrel of ginger—I told him I had seen the sugar and could swear to it—he said he had taken it, and asked my forgiveness.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I lived with Mr. Parker for eleven years, and had a good character—I did not move this sugar at all—I never touched it—it was not in my apron. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I saw him remove it.</p>

I am a constable of Covent-garden-market, On the 23rd of December, about half past twelve o'clock, I was at Bucking-ham Palace—I saw the prisoner, in company with another—I watched them, and when the Queen left the Palace I saw them go behind Mr. Young—the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and I saw him put it into his own jacket pocket—I saw him go behind Mr. Young, and take the handkerchief from Mr. Young's coat pocket, I am certain—it was from his coat pocket—Mr. Young had his hat on at the time—when the prisoner took it from Mr. Young's pocket he put it into hit own—I took him into custody, and took the handkerchief from his pocket—I then called Mr. Young, who claimed the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your husband here? A. No; he is rather embarrassed; we expected an execution in the house, and employed Simpson to move the goods, and bring me back the key - my husband only took a few necessary things for his own use. There was plenty left to satisfy the creditors.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether your husband afterwards assisted in pawning the goods you do not know? A. He was not out of the house before two persons came and told us of it. He was arrested that night - he never told me he had desired the prisoner to pawn them, if he could not find a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the house stripped of every individual article before the execution came? A. That I deny. After we took a few, the King's tax-gatherer moved a few, but there was a good deal left.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were any goods except these, moved before the examination? A. There were about ten chairs and four or five tables.</p>

            . I am a watch-house-keeper. On the 12th of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners come out of No. 38, Middlesex-street, Somer's-town - Gadsden had a large bundle, and I asked him what it was; he said a bed - that it belonged to that man, who was behind, he believed; I asked what he had done with the other bed which he had carried; he said he nver had any other bed, Simpson came up with a mattress, and said it was his own. I took them to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to HARRIET PEARSON. Q. At what church were you married? A. I do not know the name of the parish - it is a church at the top of Oxford-street, on the left-hand. I was married seven years ago.</p>
               <p>SIMPSON'S Defence. I was four hours before I could get a place to put them in; I at last took them to Middlesex-street; the carman said they should not be taken out till I paid him 12s. - a quarrel ensued; he said he would give information where the things were, and thinking them not altogether safe there, I said I would pawn them - the constable who searched me left 2l. in my fob; he said he had 2l. 13s.; I said, "You should have 4l. 13s., and if you have no more you have robbed me."</p>
               <p>ROBERT TEASDALE. He said if I had not got 4l. 13s. I must have robbed him - I put my hand into his pocket, and found 2l. more.</p>

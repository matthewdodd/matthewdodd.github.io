                  </hi>. I reside near Hollybush, at Chase-side, Enfield. I am a captain in the West Essex regiment of militia—I am in the habit of sending hay up to London—the prisoner was in my service twelve months ago, and I took him back about five or six weeks since; I keep two carters—I generally leave it to Monk to allow fodder for the horses; I have no settled rule as to the quantity—on 22nd Nov. I was called up about half past 3 o'clock, by sergeant Good all; I came down into the high road opposite my house, and found the prisoner there in a hay cart; there was a load of hay in it—there were two bundles of hay on the ground, and one of <hi rend="italic">rowan</hi>, or second crop of grass—there was also a nose bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the prosecutor's employment, and have been so three years—during that time I have had the superintendence of the carts going up to London with hay; we keep two carts and two horses;</p>

               <p>we have sent up three a week lately, since the hay harvest—I used to give out to the prisoner the food for his horse; I have been in the habit of doing that—I gave it him over night on 22nd Nov.—I cannot exactly say how much I gave him, we never weigh it—I gave him from twenty-five to thirty pounds, as near as I could tell; I tied it up in a little bit of a band; I gave him as much as I thought the horse would want, we never stint it—I never gave him orders not to take more than I gave out; I asked him if there was enough, and he said he thought there was—there was no other carter besides the prisoner—I drive up to London sometimes—on that morning only one cart was going to London—I gave him out a peck and a half of corn to bait his horse, and to take with him; I gave him that in the morning, he had only one horse—the thirty pounds of hay was to take with him for his horse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant</hi>). On the morning of 22nd Nov. I was in a field belonging to Mr. Edinborough, adjoining his yard, about forty or fifty yards from it; it was rather a dark night; I heard a noise in the yard which drew my attention in the first place—I waited a short time and then saw the prisoner come down from the stable with a bundle of hay on his back—he placed it by the side of the cart, and immediately returned to the stable—in a short time he returned again with something bulky; I could not distinctly see what it was—I then saw him get a fork and endeavour to put it on the top of the load of hay—he did not succeed; he then placed it in an empty cart by the side of the loaded one—he also put up a sack containing what I afterwards found to be chaff and corn; he put that on the top of the tilt, on the top of the load of hay—he covered over the chaff and corn with the two bundles of hay—he then went away with his cart; he had got into the high road when I went up to him—I asked him if his master allowed him to take such a quantity of hay away as that—he said, I have got hay for two horses, the other horse is coming out directly"—I called Mr. Edinborough up, and showed him the hay; I found two bundles of hay on the tilt, and under that was the sack containing fourteen pounds of chaff and corn—I weighed the two bundles of hay; altogether they weighed sixty-eight pounds—Mr. Edinborough said it was decidedly wrong—he ordered the carter to drive the cart back into the yard, and gave the prisoner into custody; he said he had no right to take the hay, and he had repeatedly told him so.</p>

               <p>JOHN SHIRLEY. The prisoner came to my brother's warehouse on the 3 d of May, between seven and eight in the morning. In consequence of former suspicion, I strictly looked at him; I was convinced he had nothing in his pockets at that time. When he was ready to leave the warehouse, I stopped him on the premises, and told him I had suspected him of stealing some time, and told him I should search him. He, in the first instance, refused me doing so; he afterwards said, I will be searched by you. He had got a dozen of them. I then sent for an officer, and before the officer came I took out of his pockets this dozen of glasses. He said it was the first time he had ever done any thing of the sort, and hoped we should forgive him. The officer came in, and took him to the public-house adjoining the office in Worship-street. The officer took his hat off; out of his hat he took these two glasses, in addition to the twelve I took from him. These are the glasses; they are the property of Cephus and

               <p>Martin. Her husband is a shoe-maker; she came in the next day, my wife ask'd her what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170014"></xptr> she went up stairs for; she said she was not up stairs; I ask'd her to let me look at her foot; I did and saw she had one shoe with a string in it, and the other with a buckle; I said I believe I can match the shoe with such a buckle in it; I found the buckle in the shoe found in the Club-room, matched the buckle she had on; and the two sho es matched also; then I told her I had lost a sheet, and she had better tell me where it was, or I should send her to Bridewell; she acknowledged she took the sheet, and had pawn'd it for two shillings, and had not money enough to fetch it out; I kept her in my kitchen; the next day her husband and sister came and said, they were very sorry this should happen; but one of them said if I would be favourable to her, one of them would be a shilling towards fetching the sheet again; I made them no promise; but said, if they would fetch it again they might; as far as I could find the prisoner never knew where it was pawn'd, for she sent another woman to pawn it; she was committed, and in three days after her husband came and brought the sheet to me; produced in court.</p>

               <p>Eliz. Martin. No: my maid was going to bed; she came down and told me there was a sheet taken from off her bed; the night after the prisoner came to our house; I ask'd her what she was doing up stairs the night before; she said she had not been up; I said she had, and had left a shoe behind her; we looked and found she had got two odd shoes on; one of them and the buckle, were fellows to that and the buckle that was left in our Club-room; then she own'd she had taken and pawn'd the sheet, but would not say where; but said she had given it to an aunt to pawn.</p>

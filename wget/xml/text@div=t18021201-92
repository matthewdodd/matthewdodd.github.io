               <p>JOHN THOMPSON sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Fontaine: On the 26th of October the prisoner brought three pots to sell; I was very busy, and told her to stop a minute or two; I weighed them, and said your pots come to 1s. 6d. and asked what she wanted in exchange; she said she wanted two candlesticks, and two spoons; but she had only one candlestick, and one spoon in exchange, and went away; I left the pots on the counter, and in about an hour after my master came in and asked me what I had been doing of, and who I bought the pots of; I said I did not know, that a woman came into the shop, and said she had been in the public line, that people had set the pots before the fire, and melted them, and it would have been a good thing if she had not been in the line at all; my master said it was evident the front of the pots had been melted to put the name out, for they were all melted in the fronts; I said I would endeavour to find her, and that I would be more cautious, being but little acquainted with London: On the 30th of November she brought two more pots; I run up to my master and told him the woman was come again, with more pots, she said I have brought you some more pots, as I am now going to leave off the public line, and I dare say they will be the last; my master came down, and Mr. Lawson was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the woman who brought the first pots to your house? - A. Yes; and she acknowledged it before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the three first pots? - A. They are here, five in all.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not rob Mr. Lawson, for I have not been in his house these five months; I have dealt with him four or five years and had an accident with two of the pots, which I was ashamed to return in that state, and meant to make him recompence for, as soon as my son got into employ.</p>

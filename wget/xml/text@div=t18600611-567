My father is executor to my late uncle, who died last year—my uncle was a pawnbroker, carrying on his business at Deptford—I had been assisting him in the business about seventeen years—the prisoner had been in the service a much longer time—it was my business latterly, to wind up my uncle's affairs—I was entrusted by my father to do so—there were two shops; one for sale, the other for receiving pledges—the prisoner often received from the salesman in the sale shop, things to dean and brush—his general duty was to attend to the pawnbroking department—in consequence of certain information. I marked these five coats and three books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I marked some of them, and copied the marks off some of them—there were two other costs that I marked afterwards—there were five coats air in one parcel—I marked them all, about 6th April—I marked the books a little later—I missed them on 21st April; and the coats on 27th and 28th—I missed the whole—on 23d April I instructed Westbrook the officer to keep a watch on the house—the prisoner was given into custody on 18th May—I went the same day with Westbrook to search the prisoner's house—I there found three books and three coats—the prisoner had no authority to take those off the premises.</p>

               <p>his employer—he was not in the habit of taking away things without mentioning it to his employer, and subsequently handing over the money for them, according to the estimate put upon it in the shop—the goods were not marked with the prices they were to fetch; the cost price was put on them, but not the sale price—the prisoner was not in the department where the clothes sale was managed—he used to sell and redeem pledges of plate and jewellery to people who came into the shop—when he took property away he mostly paid for it afterwards; sometimes he did not—I have never heard him say that he had sold such a thing, which he had previously taken away, and then ask how much he should be charged for it, and pay the money over—my uncle, when he was alive, used to take a considerable share in the management of the business, so I was not always present—he was taken in custody at the house not at the shop—previously to that the solicitor spoke to him about it; I was present—he charged him with taking things away—I cannot recollect the exact words; he spoke of the fact generally, that he had been guilty of a systematic robbery—the prisoner said he should decline answering any questions—he did not say, "There is no foundation for such a charge, but as you think proper to take these proceedings, to charge me in this manner, I shall decline to say anything until I go before a proper tribunal"—he did not make such a reply—he did not say that he was innocent, or that the charge was unfounded, or anything of that sort—he had the management of the jewellery department—I went immediately and searched his house; I did not find any of my diamonds or plate, or any such articles as those.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I saw her go into the shop, and come out with something—she looked in at the window before she went in—I did not see whether Buchanan was there—she looked in at the window, and then went in—she had not anything with her then—she came out with a bundle which looked like a pledge parcel—it might contain one or two coats, nothing more—she took it to Buchanan's house; the house to which I subsequently went—I saw that done also on the 5th and the 16th of May—that was the last time—the same thing was done on each occasion—she remained outside sometimes a quarter of an hour before she went in—I cannot exactly say, because I saw her so many times, and when she did not go to his house, I did not take so much notice—I took him in custody on the 18th; I searched his house with Mr. Sharpe, and found the coats and books which have been spoken to—I produce a coat which I received from Mr. Hill—I found twenty-nine duplicates on the prisoner.</p>

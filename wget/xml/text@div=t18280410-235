On the 22d of March, I was crossing to my own house, and saw the prisoner come out of my shop; she looked in at the window, then turned the corner, into another street - I went in and asked my wife if she had sold anything, she said, No; I went out and saw the prisoner with another woman - they separated on seeing me, and went up to the prisoner who had a basket; I asked what she had there; she said, "That woman gave it to me; she opened the basket, and there was a hand of pork in it - I said, "Have you not got a leg?" she said, she knew nothing of that - I took her back to the shop; I went for an officer, and when I returned, she had dropped a leg of pork from under her clothes; I am sure she is the woman who came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see her within the shop? A. I saw her just on the top step of the door; I did not say she was holding up her gown with her other hand - she had a great cloak on.</p>

                  </hi>, I live in Johnson-street, St. George's. I am a wood-cutter—I had some scaffold-poles at my yard, on the 15th of Fe<lb></lb>bruary—I missed two of them the next day—I have never seen them since—I was very ill, and forced to go to my daughter's</p>

                  </hi> I am a dustman, and live at Little Union-street, St. George's. My yard is at the back of Mr. Desgranges—on Tuesday night, between seven and eight o'clock, I was coming out of my yard—I saw the prisoner on the top of the paling of Mr. Desgranges' yard, handing one pole after another to a man who was taking them—he handed two poles over—I am sure the prisoner is the man that was handing them over—I asked what he was doing, taking those things away—he gave me no answer—I then went for my master, and then the man ran away—the prisoner was over then—my master sent me for the policeman, while he and another man were minding the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I lodge next door to the yard—I was going home, and being dirty, I got over the yard fence, got to the back yard, and cleaned myself—I heard a disturbance at the door—the officer came with a lantern where I was—he said, "Is there any one here? "—I said, "Yes, I am here"—I went into the street with him, and Pennington said I had handed these poles over the gate, which I had not.</p>

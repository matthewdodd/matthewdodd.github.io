                  </hi>. I am treasurer of the Surrey Theatre. At half-past ten o'clock in the morning, on the 10th of Nov., I was near the Old Jewry, and missed my handkerchief—I turned, and saw the prisoner pass close to me—he had on a brown coat, similar to the one I have on now, with pockets in front, and I saw my handkerchief in his coat-pocket—he passed close to me, and crossed the road—I followed him, and when he reached the opposite pavement, I collared him, and said, "You have got my handkerchief"—he said, "I have not"—two gentlemen came up and said, "There is your hand<lb></lb>kerchief," pointing behind the prisoner—I picked it up—this is my handker<lb></lb>chief—there is no mark on it—I only identify it by the pattern—I am sure I saw it first in his pocket, and when I took him there was no handkerchief in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I was at the bottom of the Old Jewry—I saw the prosecutor have hold of the prisoner—he said, "You have got my handkerchief," and immediately the prisoner dropped this handkerchief behind him—I found nothing else on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Hand-in-fland public-house in Wynyatt-street, Goswell Road. On 9th July, about 12 o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and I served him with a pint of ale—he gave me a bad half-crown—I put down the change—I took np the half-crown, and bent it nearly double—I am sure it was bad; I told the prisoner so—he said it was no such thing—I bounced it on the bar table—I came round, and he took up the half-crown and put it into his pocket—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went out—I followed him and gave him in charge—there was another man with him, but the prisoner was the man who gave me the money, and asked for the ale.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

I followed you and never lost sight of you—I did not see you throw any<lb></lb>thing away—I saw you till you were taken in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 240). On that day, the prisoner and another man were given into my custody, charged with uttering a counterfeit half<lb></lb>crown—the prisoner said he neither knew the prosecutor nor yet the house.—I searched him at the station and found on him a good half-crown, one shilling, two sixpences, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—the half-crown was not bent at all. I took the two men before the magistrate—they were remanded till Monday, and discharged, this being the only case against them. The prisoner gave the name of Charles Elliott.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an eating house in St. Pancras Road. On 17th July, the prisoner came and bought a penny pie; he gave me a half-crown—I laid it on the counter—my servant gave him two smooth shillings; one was of George the Third, the other was William the Fourth, or George the Fourth; they were worn shillings. I put them down, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—the moment the prisoner saw it, he said, "I have got a penny, I thought it was a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pie—I would rather have the money back, and not change." I took up the penny which he gave me, and I gave him back the half-crown; he put down the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—the moment I took up the two shillings, I saw that one was bad—I took them up, and followed him; he had hastened out of the shop. I am able to say that one of those shillings was not one</p>

               <p>which I had given him—I did not give him the Victoria shilling which I bent. I did not see him take up the two shillings to my knowledge—I had stooped to pick up the penny which he had thrown over the counter; the two shillings were right before me—when I got up, I gave him the half<lb></lb>crown, and began to take up the two shillings, and I found one was bad—he left the moment I gave him the half-crown—I followed him twenty or thirty yards from my shop, he was eating his pie, and walking rather fast—I said to him, "Here is a bad shilling, I will thank you to change it"—he said, "I never gave it you." I collared him, and took him back to the shop—he said he had no other money. A constable was sent for—I gave him, the prisoner, into custody, and gave him the bad shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What did I ask for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You asked for Dothing; you took the pie out of the window, and threw down a half-crown, which was good I believe—I did not put it in the till, but by the side of the till—I did not try it—my servant gave me the two shillings, and I laid them before you—I took notice that they were both worn shillings, and one was of the reign of George the Third; the other I did not take notice of the reign of—they were not Victoria's—the one you gave me back was George the Third's, and the bad one—the one of George the Third, I parted with afterwards on the same day; the Queen's one I gave to the policeman I did not see you take the money from the counter; I did not say that I could not say whether it was a Queen's shilling or not—you might be 20 or 30 yards from the shop when I took you. I did not see you with any one before I took you—I touched you and said, "I beg your pardon, this is a bad shilling."—I afterwards took you by the collar, and brought you baok; you did not run away. I can't say how long you waited before the policeman came. I did not hold you while you was waiting; I stood by the door, that you did not go out—the chair was standing opposite the counter.</p>

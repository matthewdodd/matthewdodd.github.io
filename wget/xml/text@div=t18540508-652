                  </hi>. I am a former, residing at Sutton, in the parish of Heston. I rent the Vicarage farm at Heston—about 1 o'clock in the morning of 17th April I was disturbed from my sleep, went to my farm, and found that the whole of the barns and stacks were on fire—there was a very large quantity of straw, wheat, oats, hay, and other things—the sheds were also burnt, containing the whole of the machinery—the premises were all in a blaze; there was an immense light—the fire was not out for a week or ten days, but it was got under about 6 o'clock in the morning—the sheds were burnt down, and property destroyed to the value of 1,2002. at least—a very large barn was burnt down, and a lot of sheds adjoining—they were obliged to pull down the sheds at the back of the cot<lb></lb>tage where May lives or it would have been all burnt, and the stack yard in front of the cottage as well—I know nothing of the prisoner; he is a perfect stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jonathan May, Mr. Brevington's bailiff I live on the farm at Heston—on Sunday evening, 16th April, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner on the premises, standing against the bare, talking to an Irishwoman that lodged there—he asked her where did the master live, and where was the foreman—she directed him to Mr. Brevington's house—I asked him who he wanted, and told him if he wanted anything, if he came to me I would give him information—he said he wanted a night's lodging—I said, "We are not allowed to let any one sleep on the premises, and if you take leave you are liable to be taken up"—he said he did not care a d—about the policeman, and turning round to me he said, "And you can't tell how soon you may want a night's lodging yourself; you are born, but you are not buried; you won't five for ever"—I was very much alarmed at his manner; he held up his hand in a threatening manner, and told me not to forget what he had been saying—his manner made me think he meant something more than he said, and I was alone on the place at the time—he went away threatening me, as far as I could see him, with the same words, "You wont live for ever; don't forget what I say, you may want a night's lodging yourself, and you cannot tell how soon—he kept repeating those words as far as I could see him, and then I heard some one say to him, "Come on," and I lost sight of him—about half past 11 o'clock that night we were awoke by a policeman telling us that the premises were on fire—the barn was burning; the stack of straw and the wood stack was all in flames, and were ail burnt down—between five and six o'clock next morning I saw the prisoner coming from the direction he had gone in on the Sunday evening; he was just going past the gate—Mr. Brevington lives about a quarter of a mile from the place.</p>

               <p>where he slept last night—he commenced trembling and seemed very agitated, put his finger over his shoulder in the direction he had just come, and said, "Just above there in an open wagon"—I told him I understood he had been down to the farm, and been threatening and abusing the fore<lb></lb>man's wife—he replied that he had done so, but that he was drunk at the time—he then said he would not be guilty of a fire—the fire was net quite out at that time—I said, "I did not say anything to you about a fire;" he said, "I know you did not, but I would not do it"—the fire was no secret at that time, the soldiers were out from Hounslow barracks, and "fire" was being halloed all over the neighbourhood—I had my uniform on, he knew that I was a policeman—I asked him if he knew there had been a fire—he said he did not—I asked if he heard any one call "fire"—he said no—I asked if he did not hear persons calling "fire" and cunning past, and about the neighbourhood—he said he heard persons running past him every ten minutes, or every five minutes during the night, but did not look out to see what they were running for—the sergeant came up shortly after and searched him in the road in my presence, he found on him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., three short pipes, a congreve match and a fusee—I took him into custody, and took him to the station—on 29th April, I took him to Brentford for re-exami<lb></lb>nation—when. we were turning out of Stamford-street into the Waterloo-road he sew a man lighting a fusee—he said, "That is the sort of thing you found in my pocket, is it not?"—I said, "Yes, it is"—he said if he had known it had been in hit pocket, it was very likely I should not have found it there—his clothes were very dirty on the morning in question—I asked him what made him tremble so—he said his clothes were wet, and that made him cold—he said they were wet by means of his lying in a wagon, that had had grains in, it—his clothes were not wet.</p>

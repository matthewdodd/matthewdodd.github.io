                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Cabban, of Stockwell-street, Greenwich—he is a linendraper. On 26th Feb. the prisoner came to the shop—I had not known her before—she came about half past 9 o'clock in the morning—she asked to look at some silks—I showed her some—Mary Thompson assisted me in showing them—I showed them on the counter—the customers are on one side of the counter and the shopmen on the other—she did not buy anything—two days afterwards I missed a remnant of silk of five yards and a quarter—I missed it because a customer who had had a little of it previously came to match it—I am able to say it was part of what I showed the prisoner—I did not miss it when the prisoner left, because I did not clear the counter: another person did—this is the piece of silk (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I next saw it at Mr. Nash's, in London-street—I am, positive this is the piece—I am sure this, was placed before the prisoner—two days before that I gave leave for ten yards of it to be cut, and ten yards were cut, and that left five yards and a quarter; and I know it by this stain on its outside, which was from the running down of the window, and the last customer objected to it on that account—this is not a very uncommon silk—other shops may have the same, but from the marks I have mentioned I identify it; and from the length of it—to the best of my knowledge the prisoner had a black mantle on, the same as she has now, but her features I am quite sure of.</p>

"No"—(when she pawned the silk she gave the name of Watson)—I asked her whether she had not pawned a piece of silk at my house—she said, "No"—I told her I was positive she was the person who pawned it—she said I was mistaken—I took the silk in myself, and I asked her what name it was to go in—she said, "Watson"—I am sure she is the woman.</p>

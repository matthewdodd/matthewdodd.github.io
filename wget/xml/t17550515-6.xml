My husband's name is George; I have missed napkins ever since last December; the prisoner washed for me; at last by an advertisement I found there were some with one Dodson a pawnbroker the corner of Winchester-street; I went there, and found six diaper napkins, numbered 53, six damask ones marked 52, and three damask marked 50, and three huckabeck ones marked A, my property; the pawnbroker told the justice he would appear here without a subpoena, but I subpoena'd him, and he is not come with the napkins; he told me they were all pawned by the prisoner in her own name. I took her up, and before the justice she owned, in my hearing, that she took the napkins and pawned them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.</p>

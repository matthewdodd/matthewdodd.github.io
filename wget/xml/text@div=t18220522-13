On the 1st of May, about noon the prisoner came to the shop and asked to look at some French cambric; she wanted one-eighth to match some which she had in her hand; I tried to suit her, and when I threw the cambric on the counter to cut it, I saw her hands under it moving about - I pulled the cambric away, and saw her hand go off the counter with a piece of cambric, which she put under her shawl - I took no notice, but cut what she wanted, she put the money down - I walked round the counter, and asked her to give me the cambric that she had. I lifted up her shawl and saw it sticking out of her pocket - before I could lay hold of it she threw it out on a chair, and denied having taken it; I said it was useless to say so; she immediately begged we would forgive her, as it was her first offence. We gave her in charge.</p>

               <p>the Clapham-road from a quarter to half-past five o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoners going towards London—I knew Wood—I followed them as far as Kennington Church, and lost sight of them—I got sight of them again a little before seven o'clock, they came out of Church-street—there were two carriages in Church-row, near to a public-house where the livery<lb></lb>stables are—one of the carriages had two lamps; it was standing by the side of the foot-path, opposite the churchyard, near Kennington-common—Cully went to the side of the carriage, took hold of a lamp, and attempted to take it out—Wood was standing near the carriage on the other side—I passed by; Cully saw me and let go the lamp again, and walked a little way—I hid myself by the corner of a wall—I had a view of the carriage, it was twenty or thirty yards from me—I saw Cully come to the same carriage again—his back was towards me, I could not see him take the lamp—Wood stood on the other side of the carriage—I saw Cully come away from the carriage—I walked round the churchyard, and met him; he had the tail of his coat up—I stopped him, but I found he had nothing—I told him I should take him into custody for attempting to steal a lamp from a carriage round the corner; he said, "I know nothing about it"—Lillystone was with me, he went and took Wood—I afterwards received from George Fuller this carriage lamp; he pointed out to me the spot where he found it—I had directed Fuller to go in the direction in which I bad seen Cully go, and he found it—this lamp was shown to John Long; he claimed it as belonging to his carriage—I saw the carriage afterwards; one lamp was gone.</p>

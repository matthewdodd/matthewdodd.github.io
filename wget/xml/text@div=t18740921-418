I am a master bricklayer—I was at work at the Holly Tree, which is a little over three-quarters of a mile from Leytonstone—between 2 and 3 o'clock I saw Stuart come out, and in consequence of something I heard I followed him, and saw King and Harris (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>) in a ditch about twenty or thirty yards from the house—they could see the house from where they were—I followed Stuart about a quarter of a mile towards Forest Gate—I afterwards returned towards the Holly Tree and met the other two walking together on the road towards Forest Gate—they were 200 or 300 yards behind Stuart—I fetched Mr. Heath who keeps the Holly Tree, and we went with a policeman after the prisoners towards Forest Gate—we came in sight of the three in about a quarter of an hour standing together in Upton Lane, West Ham—we did not go towards them—we went towards the Lodge Gate and as we did so King and Harris jumped the fence into the park—the constable secured King and I ran after Harris—Stuart was brought back by another constable—they were all taken in custody, and I afterwards went back to the place where I had seen them jump the fence and found thirteen florins and six half crowns, wrapped separately in tissue paper, some were in a bag and some outside—I handed them to the sergeant at the station—I have been to the spot with the constable since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place, and lodge at Mr. Shrubsole's public-house, No. 8, North Audley-street. I have known the prisoner between fourteen and eighteen months—he lodged in the next room to me—he was in my room several times in the course of the 10th of February, and took some refreshment there—he stated that he had not 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. until he received some money from the country—he was obliged to borrow 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a penny-loaf—when we were going to bed he grumbled at the landlord because he would not give him credit for a pint of beer, because he owed him a little money—I said, "Well, never mind, George, here is a little will buy us a breakfast to-morrow morning"—I had nine sovereigns in a piece of paper, which I put into a wooden box which I use as a dressing-table—after I was in bed, he took my candle away, and went to bed himself—the sovereigns were screwed up in a bit of the "Times" newspaper, within an inch of the candlestick—I awoke about eight o'clock in the morning, and as I put my browsers on, I looked for the money, to put into my pocket, and missed it—the prisoner was brought home that evening between six and seven o'clock, in a state of intoxica<lb></lb>tion—he was given into custody directly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

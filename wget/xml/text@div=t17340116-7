            . I and Tom. Dun went from his House in the Minories, to the Prisoner's House, by the Tenters, in Moor-Fields; we asked him to go with us, to look for a Chance. He said he'd go and see what could be done in the new Street, I think 'tis Queen-street, which is hard by where he lives. At the farthest End we saw a Light in the Kitchen Window; and looking over the Pallisades, says the Prisoner, there's a Chance of a Silver Cup, if we cou'd get at it. We soon contrived a Way. They two hoisted me over the Pallisades, into the Airey, and I listed up the Sash. I suppose the Maid had lately been washing, for some Sheets and other Things lay on a Table by the Window. I took out the Cup, three Pair of Sheets, a Shift, and a Handkerchief, and had taken more, but that we were afraid the Maid would come down and surprize us. I handed the Cup up first, and the Prisoner not being tall enough to reach it as he stood, he rais'd himself up, and leaning over the Pallisades, took it in his Mouth; then I gave them the Linnen, which they haul'd through betwixt the Bars Dun helpt me up. The Prisoner gave him the Cup, and covering the Linnen with his Great-coat, carried it into the Vinegar-field, where he left it, and went Home, and returned with a Bag which he had forgot to bring out with him at first. He put the Linnen in the Bag, and so we went to Mr. Cotterel's, a

Dun told Mrs. Cotterel, he wanted some Money, and so had taken his Wife's Cup, and was going to sell it. Why, says Cotterel, as you look like well dress'd Persons, and have drank here before, I'll lend you a Guinea upon it. Dun told her that would not do, for he must sell it for two Guineas. Then, says she, I'll let you have 38 s. and if you redeem it in a Month, it is yours; if not, it is mine: So we struck a Bargain, she paid us the Money, and Dun, I, and the Prisoner, went to the Prisoner's Lodging, where we made a Dividend, each Man taking a Pair of Sheets, and 12 s. 8 d. in Money. - I discovered the Robbery in about a Fortnight afterwards.

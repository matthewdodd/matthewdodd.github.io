                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers. I have been in the Post-office forty years—if a letter-carrier of one division finds a letter directed to another division, if he discovers the error of its being. mis-sorted while he is in the Post-office, he should transfer the latter to the proper carrier to deliver it—it is passed regularly through the different books—it is not delivered to the letter-carrier immediately by the person finding the error, but through a charger—if he discovers a letter missorted to him after he leaves the office, it is his duty, after delivering all his own letters, to deliver the letter, so missorted, wherever it is addressed—I am supposing the letter being missorted, is charged to him in the lump—he should pay the postage to the Receiver general—it would make no differ<lb></lb>ence in his amount.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHEPHERD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the letter is not missorted, and comes to his hands honestly, suppose it was dropped, and he found, it in the street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be his duty to deliver it, and receive the money, and then he ought to report it to the Post-office next day, and get himself charged with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say if one carrier drops a letter, and another finds it, he is to deliver it and receive the postage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—if it was a considerable distance perhaps I should not deliver it, if I were a carrier—there is no general rule on the subject—if it was within a reasonable distance, the rule is, that he should either deliver it or bring it back to the Post-office and report it—he might do either—there is no rule that they must deliver it, it occurs so rarely—I do not remember an instance of it—I think I have known a carrier pick up a letter in the street, and he has brought it back to the office—not delivered it—it is very probable if a carrier brought a letter to me, saying, "I have found this letter," that I should send that carrier out to deliver it.</p>

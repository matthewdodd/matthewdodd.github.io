I am the wife of Benjamin Buck, of 7, Mount Square—at 8 o'clock on Sunday evening, 28th August, I was in Brick Lane—the female prisoners came up and took hold of me, and the mail came to my right side—I had my purse in my left hand—a man who is not in custody put his hand round my throat—I struggled—I believe Hall took my purse away—McCabe said "Do it quick, she has got a purse in her hand"—when the man who has got away put his arm round my threat McCabe hold my arm—the man held my right hand, and I lost my purse.</p>

I live at 71, Jamaica Street, Commercial Road—on this Sunday evening I was passing along Orman Street, and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutrix walking rather slowly—the three prisoners were behind her—after a bit Hall went up, caught hold of her hand, and said "I want your b—purse;" one of the men then came up and caught hold of her over the mouth, and Hall took the purse—they walked away, and two minutes after that Maccabe came up and said "What are you following Hall for?" and Mrs. Buck said "I have lost my purse," and that woman over there struck Mrs. Buck a violent blow—the man kept the crowd back, so as to let the prisoners escape—Maccabe gave her a violent blow—she went away to a public-house, and after she came out Maccabe came up and gave her another blow—then up came a man, who said "What the b—h—are you waiting about for? you'll get taken up." <hi rend="italic">Hall.</hi> I never saw him before in my life.</p>

On the 10th of April, between five and six o'clock, the prisoners came to the shop, and desired to look at the glass of earrings; I put it on the counter. While Edwards was looking at them, Smeed broke a glass on the counter, about three quarters of a yard from the rings. She asked what it came to, offered a 1 l. note, and paid 6 s. for it - Mrs. Jefferson gave her change. Immediately after the glass was broken, we missed two pair of ear-rings out of the case which Edwards was looking at. I said I was certain they were there half an hour before. She said it was unpleasant that it should happen while she was in the shop; she ordered things amounting to 5 l. 14 s. She selected some-before, and some after this. She said she had no money, but wished the things to be sent to No. 28, New-street, Minories, to Mr. E. Jones, and left 2 s. as a deposit. The circumstances altogether made me suspect them, and I said it was very strange. They said did I suspect them? I said it was a delicate thing to suspect a customer, but I must acknowledge that I could not help it. Mrs. Jefferson said if they suffered our man to take the goods with them, and they paid for them, if they lived where they said they did, it would clear our suspicions; the man went with them - they neither consented or refused. He brought them back in about half an hour; they said they came back, being disappointed in receiving some money in the Strand. We again spoke of the ear-rings; Edwards said,</p>
               <p>"If you suspect me, search me," but they both felt themselves hurt, and much insulted. They gave me 1 l. more as a deposit on the things ordered, and then went away. In about ten minutes Gook, the officer, brought Smeed back, and produced a paper. I said it was a paper on which the lowest pair of ear-rings were. He turned to Smeed, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now where are the ear-rings?" He then took a handkerchief from her hand, and in one corner were both pair tied up. Edwards was brought back by Glasborough, but nothing was found on her. We afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210011"></xptr>missed three more pair of ear-rings, which have never been found.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Jefferson. I went after the prisoners; they turned into Castle-street, not towards the Minories - they turned back into Cecil-court. I stopped them in Cecil-court, and asked them to come back? they asked what for, and said they knew where they were going to, and went into Charles-street, stopped there, and one said to the other, that she had money, and could pay for the things if it was agreeable. They gave me 10 s. in the street, and said I might depend upon it they should come for the things. I followed them down Castle-street to the Admiralty Office; they went into the office, came out in a few minutes, and said the gentleman they was going to receive some money of, had been gone half an hour, and they could not receive it till Monday, and if I would bring them on Monday, they would pay for them. I said I should be much obliged to them to go back to the shop, which they did; and as I came up Castle-street, I saw Gook, the constable, and gave him a signal to follow me. I told him to wait at the door - the prisoners went into the shop.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoners go into the shop with Glover, and come out, I followed. They turned backwards and forwards, up different streets. They turned into a public-house in Green-street, and I left Glasborough to watch, while I returned to the prosecutor's to learn the particulars. As I returned I met Smeed alone; Glasborough was following her. He put a paper into my hand. I took hold of her, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now where are the ear-rings?" she said she had not got them, and knew nothing about them. She appeared to be shuffling with her left hand; I told her to hold it still. I took her back to the shop, and Loxley identified the paper - I found the ear-rings in the corner of her handkerchief. I sent Glasborough for Edwards - he brought her in five minutes.</p>

            . I was left to watch the prisoners at the public-house in Green-street - they called for half a pint of beer; Smeed came out in a minute, and I followed her. About the middle of Castle-street, she tore something from the middle of a paper, and threw the paper down. I picked it up, and gave it to Gook, whom I met.

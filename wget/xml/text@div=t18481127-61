                  </hi>. I am a lithographic printer, of 276, Strand. The prisoner has worked for me some years—in March last he brought me this bill for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 13th March—he asked me if I would give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, as it was a settlement of an account between him and Mr. Paul Bedford—I gave it him—the bill purports to be endorsed by Mr. Charles Manby—he said he had been to the theatre, and got Mr. Charles Manby to indorse it for him—I cannot say whose writing the acceptance or endorsement is—I received this letter by post in June (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the prisoner's writing.</p>

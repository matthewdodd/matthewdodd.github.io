I suspected them, and I asked the prisoner Nowland what I could serve her with; she said she would wait until I had served the people whom I was attending to. They were in the shop about twenty minutes before they were served. When the people went out, Nowland asked for some muslin, I server her with it, and some course cloth and cambric, they came to 3s. 1d. altogether. They left the shop in company - I did not perceive them take any thing. I followed them, and came up with M'Dougal, she had got my umbrella; I told her she had stolen it, and asked her to let me look in her apron, which she had up. I looked in, and there were some Irish and print, and a shawl, which I saw on Mrs. Nowland's arm when she came into the shop; I brought M'Dougal back to the shop; she said, Nowland had given her the things. I did not see Nowland afterwards. I had seen both the articles, I am sure, about an hour before in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. There were people in the shop when they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Nowland dressed - A. Not as she is now; she was dressed much better than the other prisoner. M'Dougal said, that the muslin was for her. Nowland had the shawl when they came in; I afterwards saw M'Dougal with it, and my umbrella.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040023"></xptr>Q. When you charged M'Dougal with the robbery, did she not say, if there is any thing wrong, Mrs. Nowland lives at such a place, she gave me the articles to carry-A. No; she said, God bless you, do not hurt me! the woman gave me one shilling to carry it for her. When she got to the shop she gave me Nowland's direction, which I afterwards found to be true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I did not know where Nowland lived. She dealt with me for the articles, M'Dougal was standing by, and said, that the muslin was for her. When I went out M'Dougal was standing up for the rain; she had no umbrella of her own with her. I officiate sometimes for my brother. I do not know whether Nowland was a frequent customer or not.</p>

               <p>(Produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Nowland has dealt four or five times at my shop; she once paid me a note and gave me the name of Martin, Barbican; she never gave me the name of Nowland. It was about a fortnight before this transaction. M'Dougal gave me Nowland's direction, and she was found there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. When she gave me the 1l. note, I offered to send the things home; M'Dougal was there, but she would not let me. I am sure that when she gave me the name of Martin, that it was not the name of the person from whom she received it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was M'Dougal in hearing when she gave you the name of Martin - A. She was; they would not let me put the goods in paper, which made me suspicious. The linen is worth a 1l.</p>
               <p>THOMAS VAN. I am an officer; I received the linen from Mr. Spooner; M'Dougal told me that Nowland lived in Gould-court, Stepney-green - I went and found her there; she said, if M'Dougal had property it was nothing to her. M'Dougal told Nowland that she gave her the property; Nowland denied it.</p>
               <p>Nowland's Defence. When I paid him the 1l. note he did not ask for the name; and when I bought the things the gentleman asked if I was in a hurry. I know nothing about the goods.</p>
               <p>M'Dougal's Defence. I certainly had the property, and received it from Nowland; she gave me them to carry, and said she would be after me directly, when the gentleman came and took me. I am sure she gave them to me; I went into the shop with her, I wanted nothing myself.</p>
               <p>Court to JOHN SPOONER. How far had M'Dougal got when you overtook her-A. About three hundred yards, she might have got farther if she had not stopped for the rain; I found her standing up, under cover; I am sure that Nowland had the shawl which I saw in M'Dougal's possession afterwards.</p>

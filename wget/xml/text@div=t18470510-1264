                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip Quinlan—we live in Brazier's-buildings, Whitechapel. On Wednesday evening, the 24th of March, I saw the prisoner and her husband beating and ill-using my husband—the prisoner took the poker to him, and I said, "Don't' strike him with that thing; you don't know what harm you may do him"—she said, "You had better mind what you are doing"—I went up stairs to my room to take off my bonnet and shawl—I returned to fetch my baby—the prisoner flew across the room, and struck me with the poker on the head—I had not struck any one, nor done anything—I had been out all day.</p>

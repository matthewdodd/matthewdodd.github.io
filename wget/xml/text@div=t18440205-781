                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Deptford. On the 31st of Jan., about eight o'clock in the evening, I went home with some meat, and when I returned I missed a piece of beef from the salting-tray, in the window—the prisoner came into the shop, after I had missed it, for half a pound of sausages—he said he had 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; coming to him, and he should be a good customer—I followed him about fifty yards up the street—he stooped, and took up something, near two uninhabited houses—he then ran—I ran and took him—he dropped this piece of beef out of his hand, and laid hold of me by the throat—I called a policeman, and gave him into custody—I am sure the beef he dropped was mine.</p>

            . I live at Stepney. I am a <rs id="t18160918-20-viclabel116" type="occupation">warehouse keeper</rs>

On the 18th of July this happened, at about a quarter before twelve at night; I had been to Perceval-street, Clerkewell; I had been with friends, but had not been drinking, I was perfectly sober. By <placeName id="t18160918-20-crimeloc117">Spitalfields church</placeName>

I recovered myself, and caught the cuff of one, which came off in my hand. The two ran away, and I immediately seized this man, and called watch; the other two did not run until I called the watchmen. When I called the watchmen, I gave this man in charge; my hat and cane were taken from me. At the time I received the blow, they took my hat off my head; one of the three, I dont know which. My cane was taken from my hand, but it was so suddenly done, that I hardly knew myself. The prisoner did not get out of my sight before I took him close by me. The blow was given, and the property was gone just at one, and the same time. The cane was brought back to the watchhouse, but the hat was completely gone.</p>
               <p>JAMES BILLET, I am a watchman. When I came up, I asked what was the matter. and this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180036"></xptr>gentleman said that some one or two more had robbed him of his hat and cane, and had nearly knocked him down. The prisoner said he was going home to Whitecross-street, and he said he was out of place, that is all. After I got the charge of the prisoner, Mr. Minster looked about, and found an old hat, but he said that was not his; the cane was brought back to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's. Defence. I had been at my uncles, at Mile-end, and coming home by the church, I heard a cry of watch; the gentleman seized me, and said. I was one of the three that robbed him, and he called the watchman, and I was taken into custody, which I am very innocent of the crime.</p>

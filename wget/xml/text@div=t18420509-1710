                  </hi>. I am clerk to Stephen Green, a manufacturer of stone-ware, at Lambeth—he has between sixty and seventy men in hit employ. The prisoner was one, and had been so five years, at different times—in consequence of property being missed, I was directed to watch the men who go to breakfast at eight o'clock, and return at half-past eight—the prisoner went at half-past eight, and came back at nine, that the premises might never be left—he would have the charge of the yard while the men went to breakfast—his business during that time was to try the bottles, to see if they were sound—I placed myself behind a wall with a hole in it, which commanded a view of the inner store-room, where we keep brass taps used for filtering machines—I went out of the counting-house at five minutes to eight, as if I was going to breakfast, and returned by a back<lb></lb>way, to the place in the wall—in about a quarter of an hour I saw the prisoner, through the window of the counting-house, enter the first count<lb></lb>ing-house, very cautiously—he then entered the second counting-house—I then got up to the hole in the wall, and saw him enter the store-room—he then procured something to stand on, to reach the brass cocks, which were</p>

               <p>in a cupboard over the door of the store-room—he first took down a quan<lb></lb>tity of taps from a broken parcel, placed them on his left arm, and then reached down a sound parcel, containing six taps—he closed the door with his right hand, removed what he stood on, and proceeded cautiously through the counting-house, with them on his arm—I then went from where I was, to the counting-house—be did not see me—when he got through the outer counting-house I opened the counting-house door which leads into the factory, and, with the noise of the door opening, he turned round to see who it was—I said nothing to him, nor he to me, but I took the taps from him, in a basket—I said, "This is quite sufficient, Eyles"—he then went down the counting-house stairs, without saying any thing—I went to speak to the foreman, and while doing so, he took his hat, walked out of the yard, and went out of the premises—it was not the time to leave, as the men had not returned—he never came back—I never saw him again till he was in custody, about a fortnight or three weeks after<lb></lb>find him before—these are the thirteen taps which I took from the basket in his hand, which belongs to master—they are of two different makers, seven made by Walker, marked, "No. 2" and six by Stevens, marked, "No. 267."</p>

On the 31st of March there was nineteen of No. 2 Walker's—I ascertained the quantity at half-past six o'clock the same morning, and there was 146 of Stevens', No. 267—a little before nine the same morn<lb></lb>ing when I came from breakfast I examined the stock again, and missed</p>

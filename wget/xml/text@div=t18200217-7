On the 27th of January, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise at the staircase window - I then heard a noise like somebody being in the house. I went to the back bedroom window, and saw a man with a jacket on crawling on the wall - I then called the watchmen. They searched the house, but found nobody there. Some victuals was taken from the safe in the back area - it was not taken away. The sash of the staircase window was broken down, and the Venetian blind taken away. The shutters do not go to the top - they were fast. There were footmarks on the shutter, as if some person had slidden down.</p>

The window-shutter was daubed with dirt, as if a person had been sliding down - the Venetian blind between the shutter and window was torn away; there was room for a person to get over the top of the shutter. A pane of glass was broken, and the bolts drawn aside. There were also dirty footmarks on the stairs and landing-place.</p>

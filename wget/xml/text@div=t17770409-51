               <p>I have the care of an uninhabited house of Mr. Grindell's in Myer's-court, Soho: on the 29th March I was informed that there was a man in the house; I went to the house and found two gentlemen standing at the door, who said, they believed there was a thief in the house; we went in and double-locked the door after us, and searched the house from the bottom to the top; I said then, there was no other place but a dark closet under the stairs; we went to search that; I poked with my stick in amongst some straw that was there and felt something; I struck several times with my stick and found he moved; then we proposed to go up and get a light; as we were going up, the prisoner came out and went up with us, and we secured him; we went and searched the place and found the locks and handles amongst the straw; the two locks were taken off the dining-room doors, and the handles off the two pair of stairs doors; he said, he was a mason and came to pave the yard.</p>

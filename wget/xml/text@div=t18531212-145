                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, G</hi>). In consequence of information which I received on Thursday, 24th Nov., I watched outside the house of Mr. Fowler, a furnishing ironmonger, in Barbican—About 12 o'clock in the day I saw the prisoner Cox leave the premises; he was alone; I followed him—the witness Bartram was with me, and pointed him out to me—I followed him into White Hart-court, Long-lane; I saw him knock at the door of No. 4 in that court—he turned round and saw me, and put his hand into his left hand breeches pocket—I said, "I belong to the police, what have you got there?"—I took from his hand four steel rings for keys, which I produce—I told him he was suspected of robbing his master, Mr. Fowler, an ironmonger, in Barbican—he said, "I know nothing about it, Sir"—we were standing at the house door at this time—we then proceeded up stairs, and in a room on the first floor I saw the two female prisoners—I addressed myself to Mrs. Johnson, and said, "I belong <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the police; I have got this man in custody, and I come to search this place; you answer the description which I received from a pawnbroker, as having pledged a quantity of brass taps—she said, "I am sure I don't know what you mean, Sir; I know nothing about it"—at that time I was searching Cox, and Mrs. Johnson went to a box which stood close to the fire, took from the box a paper parcel, made a hole in the top of the fire with the poker, and placed the parcel in it—at that time I had locked the door, and put the key in my pocket—I rushed to the fire—I was much obstructed by Smith—I took from the fire thirty-one duplicates; they were on the fire, and part of them blazing; Mrs. Johnson also attempted to prevent my getting them, and I believe Cox, but I cannot say, in consequence of the struggle which took place; I felt myself overpowered among the three—after taking the duplicates from the fire, I rose the window up, and called the assistance of an officer; a female went and procured the officer Fancett—the prisoners were very violent—on Fancett's arrival we found it necessary to send for another constable—we then placed the prisoners in a part of the room, and <hi rend="italic">commenced</hi> making a search—before that I said to Mrs. Johnson, "You are very active—she said, "They were left with me by a person to burn"—I said, "Pray, who might that person me?—she said, "I don't know"—at that time I saw Smith with her hand in the split of her dress; I got her hand out, and in it was this ring, and this little instrument called an eylet hole borer (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—the ring is of the same description as those I found on Cox—I also observed Mrs. Johnson with something in her hand</p>

               <p>in the fold of her dress; I found it was a glove, which contained sixty-three pawnbroker's duplicates—she said, "They all relate to my own things"—on a shelf in a cupboard in the same room I found this brown paper parcel, which contains a dozen plane-irons, without handles—I also found a table bell, with a spring (an alarum bell), and a paper parcel containing brass nails—that was all I found—we took the three prisoners into custody.</p>

I was with Brannan on this occasion—I was called to his assistance at No. 4, White Hart court—I found Cox, Martha Johnson, and Smith there, and took them into custody—I found five duplicates in a box—I have been with those duplicates to the pawnbroker's, and with them obtained certain property, which I produce—I also produce some other property which I obtained; some at Johnson's lodging, and some at Cox's—I took Henry Johnson into custody on 1st Dec at No. 4, White Hart-court, in the same room—I told him I wished him to go with me down to Finsbury, for a person to see him, to see if he could be identified as pledging certain articles of ironmongery, which his wife and other persons were locked up for—he said he would go with me—I took him to Mr. Attenborough's, and the foreman saw him—I then took him into custody on this charge—he said in the pawnbroker's shop that he knew nothing about it—on the road to the station he said, "What that gentleman said was perfectly correct"—that was alluding to the foreman at the pawnbroker's—the foreman had said in his presence that he was the man who had pledged the goods—the goods were brought forward at the Hall—Johnson also said, on the way to the station, that he pledged them at Cox's request.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, at No. 30, Barbican. I have looked at ail the property that has been produced—the nail bags especially I can identify—a small portion of the property has been made for me—these plane irons I can identify by the writing on the paper; it is not a private mark, there is no private mark on them, but I know the handwriting, and I can swear these came from our premises—this bell is a peculiar pattern, and I know that we lost one of this pattern within ten days of its being taken—this frying pan comes from the same manufacturer that we receive ours from, I identify it from that cause, I cannot swear to it in particular; I do not know whether we have lost such a thing—I have the same remark to make as to this tea kettle, it comes from the foundry that we receive our cast iron goods from—this gridiron is of precisely the same manufacture as we sell—I can swear this bag is one of mine, by the mark upon it—the others do not appear to have any mark, they are of the same description—here are two that I can swear to—I cannot tell when they were lost, I cannot limit any time within which they must have been taken—the prisoner Cox has been in my employ about twelve months; he came in Nov. last year, and remained till he was apprehended—we have not missed property during that time; the first we knew of this was when our attention was called to it by the police; the rings produced are of the same kind as those we have in stock, I cannot tell them by any private mark, I cannot speak to losing any—this screw hammer is precisely the same as we have in stock—there is no mark on this parcel of nails by which I can identify them, they are the same as we keep in stock—these files or rasps are of a peculiar kind—we have missed them from our stock since the discovery of the robbery—we had them at Midsummer last—these fire irons I cannot tell by any mark, they are the same patterns as we keep in stock; I do not know that I missed them—these rules are of the same manufacture as mine; I buy of this maker, I cannot identify them beyond that—we have not taken stock since this occurrence; we have traced some articles, but it is a difficult matter to take stock—these brass taps are made by the same brass founder that we deal with; I cannot swear to them, they are precisely the same kind as we keep in stock, and have the same maker's name upon them—these screwdrivers are precisely the same as we keep in stock, there is no particular mark upon them, they have no maker's name upon them, I know them by the way they are made—this saw has the name of the maker on it that we buy from at Sheffield—Cox was a porter in my employ, he had to carry out goods, he had a very great opportunity of taking goods—these were kept in one side of the warehouse that we do not use except for storing goods; he had access to that part of the warehouse—I generally did the warehouse up at night, either myself or the senior young man did it—Cox usually left at 8 o'clock.</p>

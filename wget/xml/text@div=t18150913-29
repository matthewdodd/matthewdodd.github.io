When I awoke about five o'clock in the morning, I jumped out of bed to see what o'clock it was, but my watch was gone; both the prisoners were then in the room. I did not miss my money. The mistress of the house said, that she saw my watch chain hanging out when I came into the house, and the watch must be produced. I then dressed myself, and when I put my hand in my pocket, I found my pocket-book was gone. The prisoners denied knowing any thing about it. I then asked the landlady to give me a sheet of paper and pen and ink, that I might write for an officer. Elizabeth then ran away, and I after her, and secured her. I got my watch from the landlady.</p>

I was alarmed about five o'clock in the morning of the 9th, by hearing the prosecutor say he had been robbed of his watch, I had seen the chain hanging out of his fob the night before, and determined that he should not be robbed in my house; I told Elizabeth that the watch must be given up, but she denied all knowledge of it. The prosecutor then was writing for an officer, when she said to me, if he would remain there, she would get the watch. She took me down the Coal-yard, and called at the bottom of a pair of stairs, Sally, and then brought me the watch, which I delivered to the prosecutor. Afterwards she said, she had one pound twelve shillings, but it was her own. I went to the watchhouse, and fetched Furzeman. She delivered the one pound twelve shillings to me at the time she delivered the watch. When Furzeman came, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130014"></xptr>prosecutor discovered he had lost some money as well as the watch.</p>

Just as the supper came up, the prisoner came in; the other said she hoped I would excuse her; that she was a friend of her's come to eat a bit of supper. I said it was nothing to me. When the things were all taken away but the cloth, this woman got up and fastened the door. I said there should be no door fastened there, and immediately got up and unbolted it and rang for the waiter. I had a good deal of money in my pocket, and shutting the door rather alarmed me. When the waiter came I asked him what I had to pay. I told him I had no money in my pocket, but a two guinea piece, that he must keep that for the reckoning till I came again. I held it in my hand; the waiter went back to see what I had to pay; and while he was gone the prisoner got up and snatched it out of my hand; I rang for the waiter; he was on the stairs; he came back immediately. I told him the prisoner had stolen the two-guinea piece from me. The other woman sat by the chimney. The prisoner began to blast and swear, and box the waiter. The waiter went and got a constable, and she was taken to the round-house. She was searched in the round-house, but nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Why was not she searched in the room? - I suppose the constable forgot it. I was afraid of her. She swore she would swear my life away if I touched her.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor met me and the other young woman in Leicester-fields; he touched her on the shoulder, and they went together to the Star and Garter in Cecil-court. She came down stairs and desired me to come up. He ordered a supper and after supper, he called the waiter to bring his bill, and said he had no money, but if he would give him a direction where to call for it, he would leave his watch. If he had had a two-guinea piece; he would not have talked of leaving his watch. He stopped me and said I had taken the two-guinea piece. And he let the other woman go.</p>

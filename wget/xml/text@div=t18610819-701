I heard you were in trouble, and felt anxious about you"—a minute or two afterwards he said, "I have a place to be done, 62, Eaton-square; I have the key of it, and it is a seven cut Bramah"—he said that the servants would go to supper at about 9 o'clock, and the place must be done shortly afterwards—he was saying that they were to meet again at another place, the name of which I could not catch, with another man named Johnson—instead of finishing the appointment, he asked Leonard to go with him as for as Holborn-hill—they both went out together—I understood him that he got the key from one of the servants, but I cannot say for certain—I asked Simpson not to take him far, and asked Leonard to be quick back, on account of his dinner—my brother came back to his dinner, and left about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock—he did not return home at all after that—Simpson returned about half-past 11 that night—I was in bed—he knocked several times, and I got up and let him in—he said, "They have got Jack, and you had better go down to Rochester-row at 10 o'clock next morning"—I asked him was it much, and he said they found him in the house—I did not ask what house—he said nothing else—next day I went down to Rochester-row station, and found Leonard there.</p>

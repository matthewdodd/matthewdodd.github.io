Lebeau &amp; Co. to bring them from Versailles and deliver them in Bury Street—I received a bill of lading, which I returned to Messrs. Lebeau &amp; Co., as they had entire charge of the coats—ultimately a number of bales, containing the coats, were delivered at my establishment—there were ninety-two bales delivered previous to my visit to Sufferance Wharf-my attention had been called to the bales, and I went over and inspected—I found there was some<lb></lb>thing wrong, in consequence of which I went to Sufferance Wharf, on 23rd November, and again on the 24th—I went with Mr. Hooper, but he left, and was not there during the examination—I found thirty-two bales of coats at the wharf—I had each bale examined, weighed, and counted, in my presence, and I found a very large deficiency, both in weight and quantity, according to my advices from France—the paper which Messrs. Lebeau received from Hewlett was not made out at that time—I found a number marked on each bale, with the exception of four bales, where the marks had been torn off—the number of coats in each bale were marked outside.</p>

Lebeau as he had some engagement, and could not stay—Hewlett said "Very well, all right"—he called a lad, who came with a book, and attended the scale, counted the coats, and took an account of them—after some four or five bales had been weighed and examined, I observed to Hewlett that it was a most extraordinary robbery, that the whole of my</p>

               <p>bales, to all appearances, had been plundered and repacked; and I remarked that I had never heard of such a thing as 124 bales being plundered and repacked, and I imagined it had occurred on the other Bide, as Messrs. Lebeau had not carried out the contract with me, and had entered my goods as rags when they were paid for as merchandize—Hewlett said "You are quite correct, we have had a great deal of difficulty about these coats, they were entered here as rags, and we have had some bother with the Customs, and we have also had the Insurance Company down here about them"—as we went on, I said it was a most disgraceful affair, and I was sure it could not have occurred in London—I did not think there could be facility enough to open and repack 124 bales of goods-Hewett said if they were carried as rags Lebeau would have to pay me—Mr. Watkins came down to the scale on the first or second day, and I told him I was convinced that the bales had been opened and plundered—I spoke to them both about it more than once—I don't recollect Watkins making any remark at all—neither Hewlett or Watkins said anything about an extra bale or any loose coats, or about selling coats and receiving the money, or anything of the kind—I have seen the coats that were found at Meyer's establishment—they were some of the coats I bought—there were several sorts, mixed French uniforms—I told both Hewlett and Watkins that I thought there would be something like 500 or 600 short.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shipping clerk to Messrs. Lebeau &amp; Co.—I received instructions about the delivery of 124 bales of coats, to Mr. Hart, and I gave instructions to Mr. Watkins about the delivery at Thames Suf<lb></lb>ferance Wharf, on 18th November—I arranged for the landing of the bales there, and from the wharf they were to be delivered to Mr. Hart—I told Watkins that no bales were to be delivered unless they were perfectly sound—those which were sound were to be delivered to Mr. Hart, by vans, and he was to retain the remainder for examination—thirty-seven bales were delivered at the Gun and Shot Wharf, and eighty-seven at Sufferance Wharf—I first knew of their being landed when I was there on 18th Novem<lb></lb>ber, and saw them there—I afterwards received a report, from Hewlett, of fifty-two bales—it is signed by him—it states that they were marked "SH L," and the numbers and the weight in cwts. and quarters, varying a little, and the quantities of coats, fifty, fifty-six, sixty-one, and so on—there was a slight difference at that time, according to his report—I went to the wharf, after receiving that report, with Mr. Hart, to introduce him, for the purpose of making his examination—I examined some bales, which had been delivered at Mr. Hart's, and found them deficient, more or less.</p>

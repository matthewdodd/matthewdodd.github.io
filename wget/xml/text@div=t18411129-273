                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich. I went to the station at Green-wich, and the policeman told me something—I came with the policeman to my shop, and said to the prisoner, who was my shopman, "The more I go into this business, the more I see you are implicated; the policeman stopped a man with coffee and ginger-wine, and you stated you were the master of the shop, and caused the man to be discharged"—we searched the prisoner's box, and found nothing there but a document in his waist-coat pocket, which corresponded with the things the man had the day be<lb></lb>fore—here is the document, it is in his own handwriting—I came down, and showed him the document, and said, "Is not this your handwriting?"—he said it was—I said, "Is not the man that I saw in the cell at the station, your brother?"—he said, "No—he is my brother-in-law, and the woman in the shop is my mother"—he said he was very sorry, and it should be made up to me if I would let him off—I was talking about the goods that had been given to the man—I asked him what customer had been four or five days before, and paid for these goods—he did not offer to deny it then—he said he was very sorry for it, and it should be made up to me if I would not have him locked up—he said the goods the man was let off for, had been bought and paid for by a regular customer in London—I asked what regular customer I served in London, who would tell their son to call four or five days afterwards for goods—I said I should have found an entry in my book, and there was no entry—I know the things were parted with from the evidence of the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Topley's shop on the 27th of October —the policeman came in, and asked the prisoner if he was master of the shop—he said he was—the policeman asked him if he had served any Per<lb></lb>son that morning with more than lib. of coffee—he said yes he bad served a young man with 2 1/2 lb. of coffee, a bottle of ginger wine, some bacon and sugar, and the policeman said he had not got the sugar when he was stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Hall, as silk-mercers and linen-drapers, in St. Paul's-churchyard. My brother, William Allan, is a merchant residing at Rotterdam—on the 29th of Jan. the prisoner came to my shop—he held out his hand and said, "Do you recollect me?"—I said, "No"—he said "Captain Smith, of Rotterdam"—I said, "Yes, I recollect that name"—he said, "I am a particular friend of your brother at Rotterdam"—he said he was his dear friend—he said, "I have an appointment with the Dutch Consul, who it with my wife, to meet him at a quarter past eleven o'clock, and will introduce my wife to you"—he went away, and came back in half an hour, and said he had made a mistake, that instead of a quarter-past eleven o'clock, it was a quarter before eleven that he was to have met the Dutch Consul—I stood with him some time, and as I wanted to get rid of him I said, "Will you take a glass of wine?"—he said, "No; but if you will give me a glass of water I will thank you"—I sat in the parlour with him till I was quite tired—he said he bad made 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the last voyage, and 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the voyage before—I then saw a lady, and said to her, "If you are quite ready I will attend to you"—she said, "Yes"—I was about going out of the parlour, when the prisoner rose up and said, "I wish to speak a word with you; I shall not see the Dutch Consul before the evening, would you let me have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "With much pleasure, if you will walk down to the warehouse," which he did, and I let him have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no other ground for lending him the money than that I thought he was Captain Smith—he said he was Captain Smith, and my brother was his dear friend, and I believing he might be Captain Smith, lent him the money—next day he called again—I was engaged with a gentleman, and said to him, "I beg you will not leave me, for this is a Dutch gentleman whom I cannot get rid of when he calls"—I went up with a box of goods in my hand, and said to the prisoner, "You must excuse me, I am very buay"—he said, "I will call again in an hour"—I said, "I shall be engaged all</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker, in Pickett-street. The prisoner came to our shop, and produced a pair of shoes; I was going to make the duplicate for them, when she produced another pair - I saw a lable of Mr. Clarke's in them; I said, "These are stolen, I am sure Mr. Clarke would not send them to pawn;" she said a woman outside gave her them to pawn - she went out, and said the woman was gone, but Mr. Clarke was her master, and she wondered how the woman should give her shoes that belonged to him; I took her to Mr. Clarke.</p>

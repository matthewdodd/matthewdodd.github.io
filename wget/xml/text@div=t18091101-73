On Sunday the 29th of October, the prisoner expressed a wish to go to bed? as usual, I offered him a candle to go to bed. A quarter before eleven o'clock he did go up stairs, as I supposed, to his own room. About half past eleven he came down stairs; I was sitting in the kitchen; I asked him what brought him down stairs at that time of the night, he said he had occasion to go the necessary. He unbolted the back door of the house; I had fastened it with three strong bolts. He went into the yard and into the privy; he stopped so long I took the candle to examine, and found he was gone; and he had opened the back-door that was bolted with one bolt. I directly suspected all was not right, his getting out in that clandestine manner. I fastened the door, and went up to the room allotted for him.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday morning last, in the county of Surry. I challenged him with stealing two watches and a coat, which he denied; he said the clothes he had on belonged to him. I told him, I thought the coat did not belong to him; he said if it was not his coat, it was one he put on instead of his own; he came away in a ltarry. I had no information of any thing but the coat and the watches. I asked him where he bought the breeches; he said he had not bought them lately, he had them some time. I did not take the breeches nor the stockings away, only the coat. I sent for the prosecutor, he identified the coat, and saw the prisoner with these breeches and stockings on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing of the watches - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gordon. Is that your coat - A. Yes, and the breeches and stockings are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave his own coat behind - A. No; he not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know whether I left my own coat behind or not. I was in liquor when I left the house, and the next morning I found them things <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> went to get a ship to go to sea at the West India Docks, not getting a ship there, I intended to go down to Portsmouth to get one. I know nothing of any watch at all.</p>

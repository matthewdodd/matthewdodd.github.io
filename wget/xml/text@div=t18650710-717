                  </hi>. I am a surveyor—at the time in question, I lived at Nunhead-lodge, Peckham Rye—I am now living at Gravesend—on 28th April last, about half-past 8 in the evening, I left home, and called at the Belvedere tavern about half-past 9—I was in conversation with the landlord for some considerable time, I should say nearly an hour—I had two three-pennyworths of brandy-and-water—I then heard skittles playing, and said, "Have you a skittle ground?"—he said, "Yes, a very nice one, would you like to see it?"—I said, "Yes"—I went in and saw several persons play<lb></lb>ing, amongst them the two prisoners—I sat some time watching them—I afterwards played a game with Harwood—the prisoners both betted on the game, I don't know what amount—they betted on my play—I lost the game—they abused me for losing their money, and Ray said, "What are you going to stand, now you have lost my money?"—I said, "You can have anything you like"—he called for two pots of cider, which I objected to—I said, "You can have a pot of stout if you like," and I called for it, and paid for it—I just drank about a quarter of a glass with them—Ray then said, "Come, I will toss you for a bottle of wine, to see what you are made of"—I said I was not in the habit of tossing for wine, but I did not mind—we tossed, and I lost, as they stated, but I don't consider it was a fair toss; I therefore objected to pay, and the landlord demanded 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the wine, which I considered an extravagant charge—upon that they very much abused me, and called me everything they could lay their tongue to, and the landlord seemed to acquiesce in everything they said—I said it was not because I had not the money to pay, and I took out six sovereigns to show him—eventually the landlord turned us all out, saying he would have no disturbance there—I am quite satisfied that I had the six sovereigns about me when I left the house—when I left the house I went towards my own residence—I had to go down Linden-grove—that is a very retired road, shaded by trees; you can see no lamps—I had got nearly half the distance down the grove when I was knocked down on my face by a violent blow from behind, on the back of my head, and was fallen upon immediately by more than one person—I received several other blows, and several very severe kicks—I was turned on to my back and knelt upon—they then com<lb></lb>menced</p>

               <p>rifling my pockets, and I distinctly felt them take out the different things—they searched every pocket I had, except the one where the six sovereigns were, they could not discover that—some silver was taken—they then held a sort of consultation over me—one said to the other, "I know the b----has got it somewhere"—the other replied—it was all in deep whispers, except when they knocked me down—I distinctly knew what two persons were over me from the observations which they made—one was abusing me when striking me on the ground—"I will see, you b----, why you shan't pay for the wine that you lost;" and the other said, "The b----has been losing my money at skittles"—they kept hitting me all the time with all the force they could—after holding the consultation over me, one said, "I know he has got it somewhere," and the other said, "Rip him up"—I struggled all I could—one knelt on my chest, and took me by my beard and dashed my head on the ground, saying, "Will you tell us where it is?"—my beard came out by handsfull—I several times begged them to let me get up and go home—they said, "No, you b----, you shall never go home again alive"—they then ripped up my waistcoat, trousers, and shirt from top to bottom, and felt all over my body—in doing so, I presume they heard the money rattie—it was in an old breast-pocket—I was again pulled on my side, my waistcoat overhauled, and I felt their fingers go in and take them out two or three at a time; they could not take them all out at once, it was a very small pocket—some jet studs were also taken from the same pocket—immediately afterwards I was released on one side—I then made an effort and partly got up, and grasped hold of Harwood, whom I succeeded in catching by the neckcloth—I held on to him—he dragged me some little distance—I was very weak, and my clothes were all torn and hanging down about my ancles—I could not call out, my mouth and eyes were closed—I could only hold on to him—I held him with one hand, and clung to a fence with the other, and he had me by my beard, and was hitting me in the face every time he could—besides the six sovereigns and the silver, I lost an eye-glass, a penknife, an ivory rule, 2 keys, an old Victoria penny, a lead pencil, a small canvas bag, a handkerchief, a tobacco-pouch, a fusee-box, a scarf, and breast-pin—some of them were afterwards shown to me at the station by the constable—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is my handker<lb></lb>chief, pouch, scarf, pin, knife, bag, and pencil, all of which I had safe when I left the public-house—the prisoners were perfect strangers to me—I had never been in that house before—I was confined to my bed eight days after this—my head and face were beaten to a perfect pulp—I have not recovered now—I am not able to attend to business.</p>

Q.</hi> At what hour did you leave home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half-past 8—I reached the Belvedere between 9 and half-past—my house is not more than five minutes' walk from the Belvedere—I was strolling from my house across Nunhead cemetery on my way home, and I called at this house to have threepenny worth of brandy-and-water—I passed one public-house in my stroll, I did not go in; I swear that—all I had at the bar, while talking to the landlord, was two threepenny worths of brandy-and-water—there were two or three other persons present; Ray was not there—there were five or six in the skittle-ground—I did not propose to play—I was asked if I should like to have a game—I only played one game—that was nearly at the end of the time, just upon 11 o'clock I should think—I played with the potman—there were two on each side—I did not bet with any person that I would knock the skittles down in twice—I did not throw the ball so wildly that the people were afraid of their shins—we all left</p>

               <p>the skittle-ground together—the lights were put out—I walked out with the rest—the wine was placed upon the counter immediately the toss was lest—the landlord fetched the bottle and drew the cork—I believe he had actually poured out a glass of it while the dispute was going on—Harwood had not taken up a glass—none of it was drunk—there was four, five, or six persons there; I did not count them—while I was in the skittle-ground I drank out of a pot of half-and-half, out of compliment, and I put down some money for them to get themselves some beer—I did not partake of it—it was at the bar that I had part of a glass of stout—I was not at all elevated—all the persons who were in front of the bar were turned out at the same time—the house stands back a little from the road—it was not on the space in front of the house that I was pushed down—I am quite sure of that—I never said that anything was done to me there by Harwood—I did not hear Ray say to Harwood, "Let the gentleman alone"—I think I had proceeded about 100 yards down the grove before I received the blow—I have seen the spot since—I did not seethe men that would be impossible—I am perfectly positive I was not in any degree affected or incapable from liquor.</p>

I five at 3, Nunhead-terrace, Peckham-rye, and am a labourer—I was at the Belvedere tavern on 28th April, at the same time as the prosecutor—I played in the game of skittles—there was some betting—when the prosecutor left the skittle-ground I left too, the gas was turned off—I went to the bar—I left before the wine was tossed for—I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor produce four, if not five sovereigns, and some silver in the skittle-ground—he paid for a pot of stout, and had a glass of it—I did not see him leave the tavern—I saw him leave the skittle-ground, he ran up the steps before me—I was right enough then, there was no appearance of intoxica<lb></lb>tion that I saw—I heard Ray say in the skittle-ground, "You have lost the game, and lost my shilling"—he bad betted on the game—the prosecutor refused to give it him—Kay said, "What are you going to stand?"—the prosecutor said, "What you like to call for?—he called for two pots of cider—the prosecutor said, "I never drink cider, and I don't suppose the others will, you can have some stout if you like," and that was called for and paid for—I had a glass of it, and then went over the way to a beer-shop where I generally go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed member of the Apothecaries' Com<lb></lb>pany, and live at Peckham—about half-past 2 on the morning of 29th April I was called to see the prosecutor; he was not intoxicated at that time—he was suffering from injuries in his head, and loss of blood—his head and face were very much injured, and his arms and legs bruised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot form an opinion as to that; he might have been taking drink—he acknowledged so at the time—he was under my care eight days; about six days confined to his bed.</p>

When he got up he caught hold of me, and I thought he would choke me if I had not caught hold of his beard. When the policeman came up he gave me in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Moyes, of 2, Nunhead-cottageg, Nunhead—Ray has lodged at my house near upon two yeans—his character has been sober and honest in every respect—I recollect the night of 28th April—Ray came home about a minute after 12 o'clock that night—I was examined before the Magistrate at the last examination—my memory is quite clear as to it's being the 28th—I was at needlework at the time; it was the day before he was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you remember calling at Mr. Reade's residence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on Saturday the 29th—I had known Mrs. Reade previously—my hus<lb></lb>band went round there first—she was in a great deal of trouble, and asked me to go round—she had previously sent for me to sit up one night with her—I did not state to Mrs. Reade that Ray came home at a quarter after one—I swear that—I told her he was at home at twelve o'clock—I have never said that he came home after one that night—I generally retire to rest at twelve or one o'clock, more often than not—my husband was in bed at this time—he went about bed at ten—I usually sit up for my lodgers—I have a good deal of needlework to do which very often keeps me up—I know it was twelve o'clock because my clock stood on the mantelpiece, and I looked at it as Ray was coming into the house—he bad not a latch-key—the key is mostly outside the door till I choose to take it in—they all let themselves in that way through the door until I go to bed.</p>

I am acting landlord of the Belvedere Tavern, Nun<lb></lb>head, and have been for three years—I recollect Mr. Reade coming to my house, he called for threepenny worth of hot brandy-and-water—I served him—he did not suit me very well—I had some gentlemen in the bar who I was conversing with—he called for another threepenny worth—I said, "I shall not serve you with another threepenny worth; but if you like to have fourpenny worth you can"—he was tipsy.</p>

               <p>half-and-half, which he paid for and partook of—after that a bottle of wine was served—I poured out four glasses of it—it was not paid for, and I took it away again—Mr. Reade took up a glass of it—I said it must be paid for before it was drunk—I do not remember whether any one else took up a glass—there was a dispute about the payment and I turned them out—the prosecutor was tipsy when he first came in—no money was shown at the bar except a two-shilling piece, with which he paid for the beer—no gold was shown—I have known Ray about two years and a half, merely as a casual customer—he is one of the most respectable young fellows as a working man in that locality.</p>

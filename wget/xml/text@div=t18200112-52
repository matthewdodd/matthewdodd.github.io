On the 18th of December, between seven and nine o'clock, the prisoner came, and bought tea and sugar, which came to 2 s. 2 d., and paid me a 1 l. note. I asked her her name? she said,</p>
               <p>"Hawkes, No. 59, Baldwin's-gardens," which I wrote on it. (Looks at one) - this is it. I had not sufficient change to give her, and went next door, to Mrs. Odel, who gave me the change, and put my name on it. I returned, gave the prisoner the change, and she went away. Mrs. Odell returned it to me on the Monday. I then went to No. 59, Baldwin's-gardens, which is a public-house. I found a Mrs. Hawkins, at a barber's shop, No. 56, they said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120026"></xptr>knew nothing of her - the publican had referred me there. I know her by her person and dress; she had a black bonnet with the red shawl she has now. I have seen the things found at her lodgings. The coffee appears to be the same I sold her. Our mill grinds much finer than others. The other parcels are exactly of the description and weight I sold her. I am positive she is the woman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the habit of giving liquor to ladies? A. No; I had not been out of my ship for a week before - this was done at their request, it was an accident; we went to a room in which there was no other person, but nothing passed between me and either of the prisoners before I went there - I did not say I wanted a wife for that night: my duty required me to go back to my ship, as I had twelve men to pay that night, and the ship was going away at four o'clock the next morning; Fitzgerald sat at a distance from me - I did not button up my pocket when I put my bag back into it; I rather think it was taken out of my pocket while I was reaching over the table to take my 2d.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I thought you said that they both said they were not guilty? - A.

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, living at 8, Thompson's-rents, Half Moon-street, Bishopsgate—I drive from Mr. Spencer's yard, 13, Great George-street, Bethnal-green—I had been driving for him on 12th April—I left the yard about half-past 1in the morning—about 3 o'clock I was at the Swan-yard in Shoreditch, which adjoins Slater-street, when I saw the prisoner in police uniform standing in a doorway, a kind of double doorway, next to the Swan public-house; there were two young men talking to him—they were the witnesses, John Fulligan and Mitchell—at that time I knew neither of them, or the policeman either—as I was passing on the left-hand side, on the other side of the street, Fulligan rolled or reeled across; I thought he was intoxicated, and, thinking he was going to fall, I held out my hand and said, "Hold up, old fellow! don't say down yet;" with that he turned round and said, "You be b—d"—I said, "The same compliment to you;" with that there was a scuffle between us—no blows were struck—we laid hands upon each other, and we both fell to the ground; Fulligan was underneath, and I was on the top—I was in the act of getting up when I saw the policeman come direct from the door—up to that time nothing had occurred but the struggle I speak of—there was no noise, or disturbance, or any blows struck by either of us—neither of us were injured by the tumble—the policeman came across and struck me on the head with his truncheon—I had three wounds—he said nothing to me, or I to him—I felt great pain from the blows for three or four days—it half <hi rend="italic">sillied</hi> me at the time—I put up my hands and found that I was bleeding—I was smothered in blood—I said, "For God in heaven's sake, man, don't ill-use me in that way; don't murder me;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090014"></xptr>
               <p>I never did you any harm; I have a wife and young family dependent upon me for support;" with that he struck me again on the forehead, and on the eye also, with the staff—another policemen then came up, and I turned round and gave Fulligan in charge—I said, "That is the young man that first assaulted me, but that is not the man that has done this; it is the police constable, <hi rend="italic">H</hi> 45, that has done it"—all the blows were struck with the truncheon—the blood flowed from my eye and my head—we all went to the station together—on the way I met three of my fellow servants—they said to me, "Hollo, Joe! what is the matter?—I said, "This man has done this"—that is the policeman—they are not here to-day—when we got to the station I had recovered my senses, and I liberated Fulligan; I would not press the charge against him; and I accused the policeman of it in the station—I told the acting-inspector that he had done it, and pointed out my wounds to him—he saw me bleeding—the prisoner said that he did not do it, it was done in the fight—I said I should apply to the magistrate for a summons against him—the acting-inspector sent for a surgeon, and one of the dressers came and dressed my wounds—I was perfectly sober—I left my master's yard between 1 and o'clock—the horsekeeper who saw me there is here—between that time and my seeing the prisoner, I was standing at the corner of Eyre-street, waiting for my two fellow-servants coming out of the yard—I have only worked for five days within the last month—I tried to go to work on the Sunday following, but I was forced to go home early—I could not stand the day's work—I do not feel much effects now—the effects did continue for a considerable time.</p>

I am a painter, and live at 4, Park-place, Haggerstone—on 12th April, near upon 3 o'clock in the morning, I was with Charles Mitchell, standing talking to the prisoner at the corner of Swan-yard, Slater-street—I was in liquor, but not so very much; I knew what took I place—while we were talking, Arundel came by on the opposite side of the street—he said something to me; I can't say what the words were—I crossed the road, and asked what he meant by it—a scuffle immediately ensued between us, and we fell, I undermost—I got up, and was standing in the middle of the road, and my friend too—I did not see the prisoner come across the road, but I saw him lay hold of Arundel by the left hand, and strike him two or three times over the head with his truncheon—Arundel was then standing where we had the scuffle—he never said a word—the blows were struck heavily—his head bled a good deal—the blows took effect upon the head and the eye—I cannot tell whether Arundel was sober—we all went down to the station together, and he charged me with the first assault—after Arundel was struck, I ran away about the distance of fifteen yards—the prisoner struck at me with his staff, after he had struck Arundel—my friend came after me, and said, "By God, I think he has hurt the man; let us come back"—we did so, and the second policeman came up within a yard before we got there—at the time I was given into custody, "Arundel said, "This is not the man that struck me in this way; <hi rend="italic">H</hi> 46 is the man that has done it"—I do not know what was said at the station, I was so confused—I afterwards attended before the Magistrate—after the summons was taken out, the prisoner came to my place on the Wednesday or Thursday, another constable came with him—I should know him again; I believe I have seen him here to-day—the prisoner said to me, "We must all stick together; and if you are fined I will pay half the expenses"—he gave me his address on the morning after the occurrence, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he followed me after I left the station with ray friend, and said, "I want your address;" I gave it him; he wrote it down himself, and he gave me his own address; to meet him on the Tuesday after.</p>

On the night this matter hap<lb></lb>pened I was on duty—I first saw the prisoner with the cabman, Arundel, leaning against the wall; he had been in the act of picking him up; he was not beating him or ill-using him; he was asking where he lived; he had not got his staff out; the cabman did not make any reply—nothing passed between them while I was there—I went up and said to the prisoner, "What is the matter?" he said, that Arundel and other parties had been fight<lb></lb>ing—I said, "The man is bleeding from the head"—he said, "They fought and fell"—Arundel said then, "Policeman, I wish you would fetch me a cab;"—whilst he was saying that, the other two men came along on the other side, and said, "Policeman, I wish you would give me a light"—upon that, Arundel said to me, "That is the man that assaulted me," pointing to Fulligan—I said, "Are you sure of that?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "If you are sure of that, will you charge him?"—he said, "Yes"—I then took him into custody, and I left the prisoner to assist Arundel to the station—he did not suggest that the prisoner had struck him or ill-used him previous to going to the station—at the station I put Fulligan into the dock, and stated the charge to the acting-inspector—Arundel was then pre<lb></lb>sent, and the prisoner and Mitchell also—the prosecutor then said, "I don't charge that man; I don't wish to press the charge; the constable has done it with his truncheon"—the prisoner said, "It was no such thing, you were fighting with the men and fell"—Mr. Oliver, the acting-inspector, asked the prisoner for his truncheon, and he took it into the charge-room, and examined it by the gas-lamp; he afterwards returned it to him; he did not make any remark—the prosecutor did not give the prisoner in charge that night—Mr. Oliver asked both Fulligan and Mitchell whether they had seen the prisoner strike the prosecutor, and they each distinctly said "No," in, the presence of four or five constables.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw the man first leaning against the wall you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was bleeding very much at that time—I saw a deal of blood over his face and clothes—I did not see the cuts, but I saw the blood running down his face—he was bleeding from the right side of the head and the left eye—no charge was made against the prisoner before we got to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, H</hi> 19). I was acting-inspector at the station when Fulligan was brought there in custody by Hardley—the prosecutor, the prisoner, and Mitchell came in soon afterwards—it was about 3 in the morning of Tuesday, 12th April—Fulligan was charged by Arundel with committing an assault upon him—Arundel was bleeding very much from the head—I said, "What is this?"—he said, "I charge this man with assaulting me"—I stopped for a few minutes—"Well," I said, "I suppose you intend charging this man?"—he made no reply—he seemed to hesitate—I said, "Don't you intend charging this man"—he made no reply for a minute or two, and then he said, "This was done by the staff"—I said, "What staff?"—he said, "By the policeman's staff"—the prisoner was present, also Fulligan and Mitchell—I said, "Was Fulligan present, and</p>

               <p>was the other party present, the whole of the time?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then, if the policeman struck you with the staff they must have seen it?"—he said, "Yes"—I then asked Fulligan and Mitchell if they were there the whole of the time—they said "Yes"—I said, "Then, if the policeman had struck the complainant with the staff you must have seen it?"—they said "Yes, had he struck we must have seen it"—I said, "You mean to say he did not strike him?"—they said, "He did not"—that was the answer of each of them—I then said to Dale, "I should like to see your staff"—he took it from his pocket and showed it to me—the prosecutor was bleeding at the head very much at the time; and, I think, had he been struck with the staff there would have been some marks of blood upon it—I examined it, and there were none, nor any indication that it had been used—on leaving the station the prosecutor said, "The policeman will hear further of this."</p>

Q.</hi> I suppose you are the prisoner's superior officer. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one rank above—I have heard it stated before to-day that the prisoner was drinking with the two witnesses—I have not made any inquiries about that—several policemen were present at the station—Fulligan and Mitchell appeared as if they had been drinking, and Arundel also—I did not examine the wounds on his head—I sent for a surgeon; he examined and dressed them—I dare say he was nine or ten minutes attending to him—he was the assistant to the divisional surgeon—he is not here—he was not at the police court.</p>

               <p>- sworn. I am shopman to Mr. Gardener. On the 10th of November, between three and four in the afternoon I was called to the door by a neighbour in consequence of his information; I followed the prisoner at the bar; she was in the street; I saw the print hanging down under her coat; I took her by the arm and told her she must come back with me; I brought her back, and took the property from her.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it outside of the shop. - A. It was not, it was upon the counter, it is my master's property. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you are sure that it is your master's mark upon it. - A. Yes, we had two pieces of the same pattern before, and when we found we had lost this we had but one pattern of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always take your shop marks off. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that which you sold, and which you did not, you are not able to say. - A. No I am not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am in partnership with Mr. Aylwin; we received seventy-two casks of oil from Hamburgh (produces a book); these are the gauges which I took on the 14th of July, in our values under the Coal-exchange, the numbers were progressive from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110138"></xptr>one to seventy-two; there was a spade mark upon all the casks; the cask No. 66, was marked one hundred and forty-four gallons, and there was the mark of sixty-six on the opposite side of the bung; there was a brand-mark of C.K. with a C. underneath, and a large P on the other end; we received some information from Mr. Hubbock, upon which I missed the cask No. 66, it was an ullage cask, we only take the contents gauge, and not the ullage gauge; that cask is here, the mark is totally out, the spade mark is obliterated at both ends, and the middle remains, and the sixty-six and one hundred and forty four still remain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time you gauged these casks, was the prisoner in the warehouse? - A. No; his partner Thomas Cooke, was; he called me over the numbers and gauges.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever sold any of that oil since? - A. No; we have sent one cask into the country, to our correspondents at Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since examined how much oil remains in your cellar? - A. No; the quantity of casks are not yet filled up, they are not all delivered; we fill the casks up as they go away.</p>
               <p>Q. That operation is performed either by the prisoner or his partner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of oil has been sent out you cannot say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner and his two partners are answerable for any deficiency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, by way of securing yourselves, you hold a balance in your favour in your hands? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not at this time in your hands one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty pounds, belonging to the prisoners and his partners in your hands? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you not a very considerable balance in your hands now? - A. I don't know as to the exact sum, we have some money of theirs.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath is it not upwards of one hundred pounds? - A. I supposed it may.</p>
               <p>Q. The value of the oil supposed to be lost, is thirty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they not upon every occasion, regularly and honestly, paid every deficiency? - A. They have.</p>
               <p>Q. If even an umbrella was lost have you not made them pay for it? - A. My predecessor I believe did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, even now upon your oath, undertake to say that there is a single gallon of oil missing, out of the seventy-two casks? - A. We cannot say; the parcel is not filled up.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you prefer this bill of indictment against the prisoner? - A. I don't know the date, it was this sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not after you had found the bill take the man out of his business by a bench-warrant at mid-day? - A. I did not like to see the man lie long in jail before trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not suffer him to continue and carry on your business for six-weeks, after you had meditated a prosecution? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When accidents happen in the cellar, has it not been usual for the poor men to collect together, or wipe up with a fox's tail, the oil that is spilt? - A. Not Gallipoli oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, yourself, sold oil so collected for the benefit of the prisoner and his partners? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a jar of forty-four gallons being broke? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the prisoner and his partners paid fifteen pounds to Mr. Sheriff Price, for an accident that happened to the oil? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Patterson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A. It is my handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a bill making a charge upon you for nine guineas for a jar of oil, supposed to be missed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, is that your hand-writing? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that twenty-two pounds two-shillings and nine-pence, part of a loss of sixty odd pounds? - A. Yes; he had the care of the warehouse, and we never could trace it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before a Magistrate you know the prisoner would have been heard in his own defence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before a Grand Jury the poor man could not be heard in his defence you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was out of pure mercy that you did not take him before a Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was also out of pure mercy that you went behind his back before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since it was proposed to take your partner's brother into the business of the prisoner? - A. I know nothing of that transaction at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Accidents frequently happen in carrying out oil? - A. Yes, with jars of oil; but I never knew an accident with a cask of oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner informed you of his having had any accident, with any of these seventy-two casks? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Aylwin re-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Has there ever been any proposal, or plan, for putting your brother into the business of the prisoner? - A. Never; I never intended my brother as any thing else but un assistant, to superintend the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110139"></xptr>landing of the goods at the water-side, as well as to overlook those men that I might place as warehouse-men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you intend by that to supersede the prisoner and his partner's as oil-porters? - A. No such thing; it was my intention about two years ago, to have taken the oil-porters away, but upon some friends of theirs interceding for them, I continued them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Aylwin cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these people were not to be partially deprived of this business, but were completely to be turned away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this brother of your's, in the character of assistant, was to derive the profits which they derive? - A. By no means; I was to derive the profits to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. That of course begot no very great good will between you and the porters; did they not apply to your employers about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this scheme of yours for turning them away was rejected by the merchants? - A. No such thing; the oil-men spoke to us that they might continue.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you join with your partner in saying you cannot ascertain that you have lost a single gallon out of those seventy-two casks? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you agree with your partner that you call upon them to make up every deficiency in the warehouse? - A. No; I agree with him that if there were five jars in a hundred missing, I should charge them with it; but as to quantities, we never did charge them with it, because of the liability to leak.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that you have lost a single gallon of oil? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever call upon this man to explain this business before you indicted him? - A. I never spoke to him about it; had it been any other oil but Gallipoli oil I should not have done as I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I ask you, upon your oath, what was your reason for not taking him before a Magistrate? - A. For no other reason in the world but that he should not lie longer in prison than necessary, it was so clear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you not sold some oil for them? - A. I have: when they have had accidents, I have sold several jars.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you ever made them pay for the cask, as well as the oil? - A. No; nor for any cask-oil, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When there was an accident with a jar of oil, did you make them pay for the jar, as well as the oil? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HUBBOCK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. - I am an oil and colour-man in Re-lio n-street, Wapping. The prisoner called upon me on the 1st of August, for payment of a cask of Gallipoli oil which my brother had bought; I gauged the cask and settled his bill; he was satisfied with the contents, as I computed it. (Produces the bill.) It is read,"Messrs. Wm. and Thos. Hubbock,"Bought of Oil-Porters,"Gallipoli Oil, at 70 per ton, £31 9 0"</p>
               <p>Q. What was the market price of Gallipoli oil at that time? - A. Upwards of 90l. per ton; my brother acquainted Mr. Aylwin with the business, he is now in Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was done regularly in the course of trade, and the bill made out "Bought of Oil-Porters"? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew perfectly well that he worked at Aylwin and Chapman's warehouses? - A. Yes, I have received oil from him there.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no secret at all made of it? - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. These persons also work on the quays, do they not? - A. Yes, in Mr. Aylwin's service.</p>
               <p>Q. They purchase, do they not? - A. I never knew that they did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have, I believe, a sample of the oil? - A. Yes. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you suppose, when you were buying oil of the oil-porters, that they had a right to sell oil? - A. They have perquisites; the drainings of the casks, and the fox-tailings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Mr. Aylwin. Q. Are there such things as perquisites to the oil-porters from the draining of the casks? - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You missed a cask; do you not hold the porters responsible for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This was oil that we had collected at various times and various periods, by misfortunes with jars of oil, with the fox-tailings, and likewise a quantity of Gallipoli oil, part of a cargo that was stranded at Dice-quay, which we put into two casks; it leaked and refined itself, and we sold it to Mr. Hubbock.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you sent out No. 66? - A. No, I had not. I had sent all the forty-five casks to Bristol.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Myself, Lawrence, and the prisoner at the bar, are the only oil-porters in London; we are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110140"></xptr>responsible for every deficiency: if a cask or a jar was lost, or any spilt, we should be called upon to make it good; when oil is spilt, we always take an empty cask to put it in; we wipe it up with a fox's tail; we always take it for our own advantage, and whatever the gentlemen please to charge us for the article, we have always paid it. When it is put into a cask, it refines itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, some time ago, a ship being tranded? - A. Yes, it might be six months ago; I cannot say to a month: the oil that was on board was bought by different persons in the oil trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the oil that was sold to Mr. Hubbock? - A. Yes; it was accidents from jars, and the leakage of casks. It stood in the warehouse open to Mr. Aylwin or his partner, or any other person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I ask you, upon your oath, whether you were ever allowed by Mr. Aylwin or Mr. Chapman, the privilege of leakage? - A. No, I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever know of your taking any such perquisite? - A. I don't know that they ever knew of it; I never concealed it from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever allow it you? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You shared, with Gooden, the amount of the money that was received from Mr. Hubbock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that any part of that was from the ship that was stranded? - A. Yes, the oil was landed at Dice-quay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pay Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman a farthing towards that oil? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the whole of the oil landed from that ship perfectly congealed? - A. Some little of it was not; a part of the oil sold to Mr. Hubbock was oil that had been concealed, and melted again, which we had gathered off the ground; it was not fit to put in again: the cask entirely fell from the oil.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it did you take for yourselves, one gallon or ten? - A. It might be more than one or ten either; some part of that oil we had collected from accidents with jars; we had been two years and upwards collecting it.</p>
               <p>Q. What proportion of it came from the jars, one gallon or twenty? - A. More than twenty, or twice twenty, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did the rest come from? - A. From leakages, by fox's tails, from casks.</p>

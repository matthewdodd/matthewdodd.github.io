            From what part of the house did you lose them? - From a room in the back part.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you lose them? - I cannot tell precisely the day; it was on or about the twelfth; I imagine they were taken at different times. The principal witness is Mr. Ford. who knows more of it than I can tell you. The shoes are here; I cannot swear to them. I only know this, that there was a certain number of shoes in my back parlour on the eleventh or twelfth; I do not at all know precisely the day. The witness Ford came down with the prisoner, and said he had bought eighteen pair of shoes of the prisoner at such a price, and that he had that day brought him two more pair, and that gave him suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by? - He was in the house somewhere about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any shoes from this back parlour? - I knew there ought to be twenty-six pair more than I found there, and on comparing the shoes that Ford brought down, they corresponded. I think Ford brought them down Thursday the eleventh of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any before he brought the shoes to you? - I had not. I now find there are twenty-six pair missing.</p>

            How many did you discover were missing at the time? - At least to the number of twenty.</p>
               <p>- FORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a shop, No. 31, Swallow-street; I sell shoes, new and second hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you know him? - I know him perfectly well by seeing him very often. I believe it is about six weeks ago that he brought the first shoes that I bought; whether he brought one or two pair I am not certain, but I think it was two pair; I bought the shoes at four shillings per pair of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions? - I did not the first time; I did not know but he might have bought them for his own wear. When the second or third lot I am not positive which, came to me for sale; the second lot came to me two or three days after the first -</p>
               <p>Q. How many did he bring you in all? - Eighteen pair I purchased, and two pair I stopped, which have not been paid for yet. When he had brought six pair, I think it was, I then asked him how he came by these shoes; he said, that he had lent a man money, who lived in the country, and that he was in the shoe business in the country, that he had wrote for payment of this money that was owing to him; that the man had returned for an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010004"></xptr>swer that he could not pay him, but that if he chose to accept of a dozen or two of shoes for the payment of the money, and vend them in London, he was willing to send them; he said he had received a dozen pair for payment of part of the money he had lent to him; he told me that he lost eighteen-pence a pair by them, that the man charged him five shillings and sixpence a pair, and he received of me but four shillings; I bought a dozen of him, believing the story. Afterwards he brought me two pair more, and said, that he still wished to have his money, and he had sent him some more goods, six pair more, and then afterwards he brought me four pair more, and then when he had said he had but eighteen pair, he brought me two more pair, and when he brought these two pair, I says to him, it seems to me that you are continually bringing shoes on this head, of having them out of the country, I said, I suppose you have something to prove it, as far as letters, to testify that you were going to receive these goods, and you can have no objection to let me go and see these letters; he said he had not; I asked him where he lived? he said in Petty France, Westminster; and if I chose I might go with him. I went with him part of the road, and then he told me he had some business to communicate in Dean-street, Soho, I went with him; when he came there I said, as you are a foreigner to me, talk in a language that I can understand. When he came there he asked about a captain Morris, and there were shoes there; I looked over a great many dozen pair, and I could not see that any there corresponded to these sort of shoes that he had brought to me, and I told the man there my suspicions, and the man of the shop came to my shop to examine these shoes, and he could not tell nothing about them. Then I took him to Westminster, according as was proposed; when we came to Downing-street there he called on Mr. Beazley, he asked me to let him call, and begged that I would stop at the door while he went into the house to ask some question. That was in the direct road to where he told me he lived; I let him go, as I see it was a place that I was not afraid of his going into, and I stopped at the door while he went into the passage</p>
               <p>Q. And that house was Mr. Beazley's? - It was so; he received there some trowsers and some hats from Mrs. Beazley, for Mr. Beazley was not at home. He then begged the favour that I would go back again with him to deliver these things, or else he should get disgrace; I told him that I must go to his house, I insisted on it, and so at last he confessed that he had stole the shoes from this Mr. Beazley.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him it would be better for him to confess? - I told him that I imagined, and I was sure they were not his shoes, and I said, tell me whose they are, that the owner may have his property back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of any kind - Not the least in the world. I took him instantly back to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the shoes here? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Can you, or any body for you, speak to the shoes? - I cannot. This man had been backward and forward to my house three or four weeks; he is a soldier, and was servant to an officer that was at my house, who had enlisted him in the Loyal Tay Fencibles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the court.</p>

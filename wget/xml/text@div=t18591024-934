                  </hi>. I am a carman in the employment of Mr. Hanson, of Bo<lb></lb>tolph-lane—I live at 8, Sweet-apple-court, Bishopsgate-street, on the first floor, and the prisoner lives on the ground floor. On Saturday evening, 8th October, I went home to get a cup of tea, I had a slight quarrel with my wife, and she went downstairs—soon after I heard the prisoner abusing my wife, and I came down and said, "What are you abusing my wife for?"—I was standing two stairs from the passage—I said, "Talk to a man; don't abuse a woman"—he made no more to do, but <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand, and <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> me between the shirt and handkerchief, and pulled me down on the ground—he was in his shirt only; I laid hold of the tail of his shirt, and he kept on pulling me by the collar to get me in his room; I kept by his shirt, and when he pulled me into his room, his shirt gave way and he fell down on me—he then tried to get my ear in his mouth—I got my thumb in his mouth, and I <hi rend="italic">gagged</hi> him off me; he made no more to do, but turned round and got me by the windpipe, so that I was nearly choked, and I called out "Murder!"—a policeman came in and knocked his knuckles to get him off of me; he then took the poker out of the fire, and struck at the policeman first, and then struck me on the head with it—I was knocked senseless—I came to my senses in Guy's Hospital on Sunday.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 644). On Saturday evening, 8th October, I was called to the house in Sweet-apple-court—I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor there, lying on his back, and the prisoner standing over him, naked, with both his hands at the prosecutor's throat—I immediately took out my staff, and struck his knuckles several times till he left his hold; he imme<lb></lb>diately flew to the fire, where there was a red-hot poker; he took it out and struck at my head with it—it was red-hot as far as the end of the poker goes, I could discern that—he struck at me with the hot part of it; if he had hit me with the hot part, it would have killed me, it broke the parti<lb></lb>tion of the room in three places—he then made for me again, and I made my escape and sought further assistance—when I came back, I saw the prosecutor being conveyed to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cloth-worker, and live at 14, Sweet-apple-court—on this Saturday evening, 8th October, I heard a cry of "Murder!"—I went to see what it was, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, and the prisoner on the top of him, naked, except his shirt—I tried to get him off, but could not—the policeman came in and told him that if he did not leave go, he would hit him on the head with his truncheon—he said, "Will</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240042"></xptr>
               <p>you?" and he ran to the fire-place and picked up the poker, and made a blow at the policeman, and split the panel or the wainscoting; he missed the policeman—the policeman went for further assistance, and I followed him out—finding the prisoner did not follow, I went back; again, and caught hold of Aldis and dragged him out—I found him lying on the ground, bleeding from just above the eye; he was insensible—I dragged him out into the passage opposite, and he was afterwards taken to a hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital. On 8th October, Aldis was brought to the hospital between 7 and 8 o'clock—I examined him there—he was suffering from a clean cut over the left eye-brow, and a severe bruise round the left eye—the cut went quite to the bone; it was from an inch to an inch and a half in length—it could certainly have been produced by this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at first I thought there was a fracture of the skull, but it did not prove so—he is still suffering both from the cut and from the injury he received round the eye—I do not think that both might have been produced by the poker—I understood from him that he had a kick there, besides the hit from the poker—there were two distinct blows given—I think the wound was inflicted by the sharp part of the poker—I did not see the slightest signs of the poker having been red-hot; there would have been, unless it was a very rapid blow—it must have been a rapid blow to have produced a clean cut—if it was a very rapid blow, I conceive that a clean cut of that sort could be produced by a red-hot poker without showing any marks of the poker being red-hot—the rapidity of the blow would prevent the singeing that would otherwise take place—supposing the wound to have been produced by the poker, it must have been used with considerable force.</p>

I went to 8, Sweet-apple-court, and saw the prisoner on this night—he was on the ground floor, with only his shirt on; he was then pacing up and down the room, defying any one to come near him; he had nothing in his hand at that time; the prosecutor was lying in a house opposite; I directed his removal to the hospital—I went to the door to try to apprehend the prisoner; he flew to the fire-place and took the poker again from the fire, and used it in a threatening manner towards anyone who should come near him—it appeared to me that he took the poker out of the fire; it was partly hot then; it was not exactly red-hot—there was no other poker; I brought this away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot maker, living in Parson's-court, Bride-lane. On Saturday-night, 18th May, I was with my wife and some other persons in a pie-shop in Fleet-street—I was quite sober—the prisoner was in the shop, and two other persons—I and my wife were seated on on one side of a table, and the prisoner and his companions on the other—I believe the prisoner was quite sober—some vulgar word was used which was offensive to my wife—I told the prisoner he ought to know better than to use such language to a female; whereupon he got up and struck me in the mouth—upon that a police-constable was called in, and I gave him in charge; but the policeman would not take him, as he was not there to witness the assault—I and my wife then went out of the shop, leaving the others there, and when we had nearly got home I heard a run and a whistle behind me—I turned round and saw the prisoner—he said, "One at a time," and knocked me down—he struck me on the shoulder—there were several other persons round at the time; but he is the man that struck me—I got up again—he had his coat off—he struck me in the mouth, and knocked me down—it was a hard blow with his fist—whilst I was on the ground he kicked me in the ancle—I saw him raise his leg and kick me—I saw that distinctly—my leg was broken by it—I was not sure at the time that it was broken, but I felt very ill—I could not get up—I called out to my wife, "He has kicked me," and we gave him in charge—I was taken to the hospital, and there found that my leg was broken—I remained there three weeks and three days, and am now an out-patient—my leg is now going on very favourably—I had known nothing of the prisoner until that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was with my husband on Saturday-night, 18th May, in the pie-shop in Fleet-street—something was said to me by some person, and my husband interfered—the man struck my husband in the pie-shop—the shopman said he would not have any fighting there; they could go outside if they liked, and fight it out—as we were going home we heard a whistling, as of two or three parties, and when we got two or three doors from Bouverie-street the parties ran behind us—one of them said, "One at a time"—my husband turned round, and the prisoner struck him and knocked him down—I assisted my husband to rise to his feet, and the prisoner struck him and knocked him down again—Evans made an attitude to strike him in the face—I took hold of him, and held him off from striking my husband's face, but I do not know what he did with his feet—I was behind him, and did not see his feet—my husband commenced groaning, and saying he had been kicked, and said, "Oh, my leg!"—he was quite sober—I am quite sure he did not touch Evans before he was struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a book-binder, and live at 3, Falcon-court—I was in the pie-shop in Fleet-street on this Saturday-night, about half-past 12—there were not many persons there—Evans was there, no one else of his party—the prosecutor and his wife came in—we called for a pie, and were sitting eating it—I was speaking about a piece called the <hi rend="italic">Colleen Brawn</hi> that I had seen at the Adelphi theatre—I did not make use of any improper language—I was merely repeating "<hi rend="italic">Crema Crama Cromo</hi>"—the prosecutor asked if I was insulting his wife—I said I was not—he said he would put the pie in my eye—he got up to make a blow at me, and I got up to ask him what it was for, and Evans being near, to save me, struck him—then it was all settled—a policeman was called in—he said one was as bad as the other, and he would not take Evans in charge—while Evans was sitting down, the prosecutor made three punches across the box at his face—Evans did not hit him again—he called the policeman's attention, and said, "you see he has hit me again"—the policeman was still there—he said we had better all be off—we all went out—the prosecutor and his wife went across the other side of the way to go home—I and Evans walked on the other side—I bade Evans good-night, as he lived in Bouverie-street, and as soon as Evans got across the road I heard a scuffling—I ran across, and was just in time to hear Evans say, "One at a time"—I picked up his cap—the prosecutor and his wife were attacking him—the wife had hold of his coat and Evans and the prosecutor were punching—in about a second I saw them both fall, the prosecutor being underneath, and then he complained of his leg being broken—I did not see Evans kick the prosecutor—I will be on my oath that he was not kicked at all—I was so close that I must have seen—very likely he fell with his leg twisted underneath—there were a pretty good many people about there—when we heard the man had broken his leg we subscribed, and gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

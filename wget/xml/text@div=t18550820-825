                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in New-road, Woolwich. The prisoner has been in my employ for four or five months—it was his duty to take out bread, receive money, and to give me an account of it the moment he came home, and pay me the money—he has never paid me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he received of Mrs. Allen on 21st May, nor the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Elizabeth Riddell, nor the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Belchambers.</p>

               <p>customers may be 200 or 300—the prisoner goes out in the morning—he comes home to breakfast—he then goes out, and returns about 1 o'clock, and then it was his duty to give me an account—I told him it was his duty to give me an account when he first came to me, and it has always been his practice—he knew it was his duty without being informed, it was not necessary—I informed him that it was his duty to hand over to me all that he had taken—he has not on this occasion handed me more money than he could account for—on some occasions he has—I never take any money from him, but what I always put in his book—I have my book here—the prisoner is quite scholar enough for anything—his time to come was at 4 o'clock in the morning—he left when he got his work done—it might be at 7 or 8 o'clock, at other times he would make it 9 o'clock—he would stop by the way, and say he was delayed by the customers—he could always do his work and leave my place by half past 7 o'clock.</p>

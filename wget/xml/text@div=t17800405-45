I suspected the prisoner, who was in the house; I went in pursuit of her. We came up with her some where in Monmouth-street. She ran into a house where she was taken. This box and a part of my money was found upon her.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor's wife delivered to my care a box containing three pounds seventeen shillings. I am sure there was that money in the box, for I told it when she first delivered it into my care; I told it again after the fire when I returned, after having been obliged to move, it was safe then. In telling it then I happened to drop a receipt which was in this tin box. The next morning the prisoner was in Nash's room, singing; I had occasion to go into that room to light a candle, to make a fire. She followed me and offered to light my fire for me and came into my room. She went out again, and came in again and borrowed the light. After she went out again, I had occasion to go down to fill my tea-kettle with water. I suppose while I was down stairs the box was stolen, for when I returned, I observed the receipt which I had dropped over night, when I told the money, which I had not observed before; upon that I went to look at the box, to see if every thing was safe, and then the box was gone. As there had been nobody but the prisoner, we went in pursuit of her.</p>

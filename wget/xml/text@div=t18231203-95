The prisoner came into the shop, about three o'clock in the afternoon, of the 25th of October, and asked for change for a sovereign, and desired me to select all the thick edged shillings and sixpences, and all the large old halfpence. I selected some, and laid them aside on the counter, in two parcels of twenty-four shillings; it was two shillings, and the rest sixpences; some copper was also on the counter, in three parcels - while I turned my head to the window, to speak to somebody, I missed a parcel of silver, and said, "Where is the other parcel of silver" - he said, "Perhaps you have put it into the till, with the halfpence." I looked, and they were not there. I told him so, and said, there was nobody else in the shop, and he must have taken them - he made some excuse to go out, I followed him, and called for Crane, my neighbour, who came and detained him, and all the silver I missed, was found in his pocket, with some halfpence.</p>

            . I was fetched, and secured the prisoner; the prosecutrix said, he had taken a parcel of silver off the counter - he said he had not, but if he had, he had probably put it into his pocket by mistake. I said, if you have got it, give it up - he said, I "have not got it," and put his hand into his right hand pocket, took out some halfpence, and five sixpences, and placed them down to nineteen sixpences which were on the counter, and said, "Now, all is right" - she had said, she had missed twenty-four shillings. I said, "Give up the rest," and put my hand into his pocket, took out a quantity of halfpence and silver - there were twenty-five sixpences, and two shillings, including the five he took out himself. Mr. Valentine came in - he said, "I'll give you 1 s., and this man 2 s. 6 d., to let me go." Seven shillings more were found on him, but no sovereign.</p>

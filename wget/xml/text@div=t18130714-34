            . I am a City constable. On Friday, the 11th of June, about eleven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners follow two gentlemen up Ludgate-hill, towards St. Paul's; they returned back again to the picture shop: they then followed a gentleman part of the way up <placeName id="t18130714-34-crimeloc204">Fleet-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130714-34-crimeloc204" type="placeName" value="Fleet-street"></interp>
                  <interp inst="t18130714-34-crimeloc204" type="type" value="crimeLocation"></interp>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18130714-34-off202 t18130714-34-crimeloc204"></join>; I kept an eye upon them all the time; there were three in company: I saw Hall put his hand into the gentleman's right hand coat pocket; he pulled a handkerchief part of the way out; Hall tried again the second time at the handkerchief. I was of oneside of the way, and they were on the other; and when I came to the end of Fetter-lane I crossed over; at that time the handkerchief was three parts out; Hall tried at 
it the third time; there was a hackney coach coming past; I was at the horses head; I saw Hall take the handkerchief further out; on my going round to them I saw Hall pull it out of his breeches, and give it to Hannan; Hannan put it under his armpit, under his coat. I 
laid hold of them both, the third made his escape, and got off. I should know him again if I was to see him. I took the two prisoners into a fishmonger's shop; a mob collected. I could not find the owner of the handkerchief, I think the gentleman did not know that the handkerchief was taken from him; it was the fourth attempt that it was taken, it was taken a little at a time. Hannan said he never picked a gentleman's pocket in his life; he said so before the magistrate. This is the handkerchief; I have kept it ever since. It is a very good one; it is worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Hall's Defence. As I came from Mr. Milbourne's in the Strand, on Ludgate-hill I met with Hannan; I walked with him until we came to Fleet-street I felt something at my foot; I said here is a pretty handkerchief. I am quite innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Hannan's Defence. I know nothing about the handkerchief, nor which way it come.</p>
               <p>Hall called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

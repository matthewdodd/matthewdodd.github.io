                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Clapharn—the prisoner has been in my service nearly three years. On Wednesday last, in consequence of suspicion, I went into her bed-room—she was out at the time—no one was present—I found two boxes in the room—I gent for Moore, the officer—she had then come back, and I charged her with baring property of mine in her boxes—she went up stairs with Moore, who broke open one of her boxes—(when I went up before, one of her boxes were open, and the other nailed down)—a chest of drawers and two packages were examined in her room—among the articles found in her room I iden<lb></lb>tified this table-cloth, a china cup, and looking-glass—I believe she had the use of that glass in her room, but there was another in the room—I also found a linen and a cotton shirt, both clean—the drawers were open—she had charge of linen belonging to the surgery, but the nurse had charge of the house linen—she is not here—these cups, looking-glass, and table-cloth were locked up and concealed—she was going to leave the next week—my page had charge of the china, which was missed from the pantry—he is not here—the nurse did not go into that room—she gave no ex<lb></lb>planation how the things came there—the cups and saucers were in the box, which was nailed down—her name was on the box—the slop-pail was packed up in a wrapper, and contained some candles and soap, and there was a mattress under the bed wrapped in a drugget—she begged to have her feelings spared, and was willing to be taken into custody—she bad given my wife notice, and she said she was going to be married—she bore an excellent character up to this time.</p>

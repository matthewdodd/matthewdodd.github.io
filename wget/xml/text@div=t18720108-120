I told her several times I could not live with her. She said "Go, I don't care where you go, I don't want to have anything to do with you." I have been with this other party, and she swore she would do away with herself. If she hung herself I thought I should be on some wil<lb></lb>ful charge, and I thought I might as well be charged with one thing as the other.</p>

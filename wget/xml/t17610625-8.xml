            . I and a townsman of mine, had been at a house in Grub-street, drinking, and coming away in the morning, about one or two o'clock, as we were coming out, a piece of timber, on one of the prisoners shoulders, hit my companion, and beat his hat off, and words arose, and they put the timber down, and stripped to fight us.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces of timber did you see?</p>
               <p>Forster. I only saw one piece; it was my countryman that mentioned seeing two pieces: they put that in at the end of a court, and their cloaths, and charged my companion with stealing a guinea from out of one of their hands. They were ask'd where they had that timber; they said it was household furniture; and the landlord that they rented the room of, was going off, and so they would make sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said this?</p>
               <p>Forster. Both of them did. My companion and I were both carried to the watch-house upon their charge, about the guinea. When we came to the watch-house, I mentioned the timber which they had, they both denied having any, and said they never saw any. There were two men went and found it as we had said. We were carried to Bridewell the next morning. The constable went and told the prosecutor of it.</p>

               <p>We were coming home and heard murder cryed out in Grub-street; one of these men came and knocked Barton down directly, there were four of them; I hit him again, and took Barton's part. We never had any timber, nor never saw any.</p>
               <p>They called five witnesses to their characters, who spake well of each of them.</p>

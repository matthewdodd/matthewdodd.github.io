They hung up at the door for sale; they cost me five shillings.

            . I live in Wheeler-street, I am a porter. On the 20th of March, between four and five o'clock, I was going by Mr. Williams's shop, I saw the prisoner up against the side of Mr. Williams's door reaching something down; he dropped them; he stood a little time with his back to the door and put them under his coat, and walked away; I went after him and brought him back, I asked him what he was going to do with the boots; he said he was going to buy them; I told him that was not the way to buy them; I took him back, and the boots, and delivered him up in the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the man - A. Yes; I have attacked him once before; he is a cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time this took place I was so inebriated with liquor that I was not able to conduct myself; I took the boots down, and seeing some defect I attempted to hang them up again, but I was taken with a giddiness in my head.</p>

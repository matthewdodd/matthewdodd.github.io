               <p>I am a publican, keep the White Lion, St. Giles's. At half past nine in the evening, on the 22d of July, the prisoner at the bar came and called o a pint of beer at our house; during the time he was drinking of it, some other people came into the box; when he went out some of them informed me that he had got some pots about him, they thought they heard them rattle. I followed him out, and desired him to come back, and told him that he had some pots about him; he said he had, his wife scoured pots; I insisted on his coming back. He came back with me, and I found these pots on him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine; I believe he took one pint out of the tap room.</p>

I keep the Director-General public-house, at Wool<lb></lb>wich—on 29th August I was called up at a quarter before 5 o'clock—I saw the flap of my cellar had been raised and the cellar entered—I went in and missed two bottles of whiskey and one other bottle—these two bottles of whiskey are mine, they have my labels on them—it is Scotch whiskey—I had only these two bottles the night before, and they were gone—the other bottle was whiskey, but different to this—I had several more of that.</p>

On the morning of 29th August, I was on duty in Woolwich, within twenty yards of Mr. Turner's—I met the prisoner and another man at half-past 3 o'clock—when the prisoner saw me he separated from his companions—I followed the prisoner, and I met him about a quarter of an hour afterwards going towards where he had left his companions—when he saw me he put his hands behind his back—I ran to him and clasped him round—I secured these two bottles of whiskey, which were in his hands—I took him, and on the road he drew himself up and dropped one bottle of whiskey, which fell and broke—he then told me to draw one of the bottles of whiskey and give him a glass, and he would tell me all about it—I refused to do that—he then said he was a gay boy, and that he and two or three others were out, and he was a ticket-of-leave man—I asked him where he got the whiskey—he said from a cellar.</p>

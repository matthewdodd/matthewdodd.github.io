            . I am a watchman. On the 29th of May, I was crying half past nine in the evening, I saw two men lurking at No. 19, in Henrietta-street, I made over to them; one was outside the railing, and the other withinside, close up against the house; the prisoner was the man that was inside the railing, I saw him busy at the wall; as soon as the man outside espied me, he made off. I thought I could make sure of one. The prisoner had hold of the lead.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take him - A. Yes. When I came within three or four yards, he came out from under the rail, I seized hold of him by the collar with my left hand, and sprung my rattle; I took him to the watch-house, one of my fellow watchmen followed so close that he could not get away. The lead has been twisted off, not cut.</p>

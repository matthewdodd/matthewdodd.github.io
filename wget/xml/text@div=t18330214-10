            . I am coachman to Mr. Henry Valentine Stafford Jerningham, whose coach-house is in Grosvenor-mews. On Friday, the 18th of January, I padlocked the coach-house, and fastened it as usual, about three o'clock - master's chariot was in the coach-house; I left the property secure - I returned that evening about half-past six, or a quarter to seven, and found the padlock off the door, and it was tied inside with a pocket-handkerchief; I pulled it open, and on going in, I perceived the blinds of the chariot down - I opened the carriage, and the prisoner jumped out of the window (I had left the blinds up); he jumped off the box into the mews - I called to my son to stop him; I found one of the glasses of the sash of the carriage removed from its place, and put on the seat, and the top of the frame had been cut with a view to take it out - there are four glasses to the carriage; the first glass was taken out of the frame, and put on the seat inside - the frame was left in its place, but the glass taken out; the top of the frame was cut, and the glass taken out - the top of the other glass had been attempted to be cut off, but was not cut through; I had not the least knowledge of the prisoner - he had nothing to do with the premises.</p>

            . I am servant to a gentleman. I was near Grosvenor-mews on the night in question, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and both the Sharpes in pursuit of him; I went up to the prisoner, and told him to stop - he said,"Pray don't stop me;" I instantly caught him by the collar, and held him till Sharpe and his son came and caught hold of him - I saw something drop from his hand, and picked it up; it was this chisel - Plank took him to Marlborough-street.</p>

             was brought to me on the 18th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I found him with a severe cut in the arm - it had glanced across the arm; it was not a wound likely to endanger his life - it was within one-sixth of an inch of the blood vessels, which would have been serious - but in reality there was no material danger from the wound; a few fibres were divided, but not to interfere with the use of the arm - he can now use his arm as well as ever; it was such a wound as a knife or chisel might have inflicted - I think a knife a most likely instrument to have done it: I attended him eight or ten times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The knife is blunt at the point, is it sharp in other parts? A. It is sharper in the middle - it is not a knife likely to inflict a serious injury; the wound was nearly half an inch deep.</p>

             was one of my lodgers. On that day, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140004"></xptr>came to my house and made an agreement to lodge in my house that night. Massa went to bed about half past eleven. After that time, the prisoner came to me; I lent him three shillings. He was to come back about half past twelve in the morning; he did. I then shewed him up to bed; he slept in the same bed with Massa. After the prisoner went to bed, I locked the outer door myself, before one o'clock. About half after one, I heard somebody go down stairs; I did not see him. I heard the back door make a noise. I went down about half past one; the front door was then wide open. I went up to see who was in the house. I missed the prisoner, and nobody else. I afterwards went to the Black Horse, and had the prisoner taken into custody.</p>
               <p>LYON JONES. I live with Mr. Solomon, a watchmaker, in Nightingale-lane. On the 11th of August, in the morning, a little after five, he asked me whether I had a watch-ribbon to sell. I sold him a ribbon. I looked at his watch; I observed there was a glass wanting. I tried to fit it; he left the watch with me to fit a glass to it. The watch was a single cased watch; it opened both ways. I lent him a plain watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that watch again if you saw it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return it to you - A. No, he did not. I did not see him again until he was taken up.</p>

            Were had you taken the watch that he had left with you - A. To the glass-cutter; his name is Walters. I went with John Brown, the officer, to Walters.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I, and Butler, apprehended the prisoner I searched him, and found in his pocket this card of Mr. Solomons; that led me to Mr. Solomons, and I found this plain watch upon him.</p>
               <p>Jones. This is the watch. I lent the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the second watch; is that yours - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I took the watch I was in liquor. Mr. Wright shewed me up to bed; I laid myself down; I felt a watch in this man's pocket. About half past three, I went out; I met this man at the door; I asked this man if he had got any watch ribbon to sell. I broke the glass of the watch. I asked the man to put the glass of the watch in; he gave me another watch to put into my pocket. I did not intend to keep the watch. I told the prosecutor I was looking after him. When he came into Mr. Lee's, in New Gravel-lane, where I went to, he said, he was looking for me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Wright. Was he in liquor when he went to bed - A. No.</p>

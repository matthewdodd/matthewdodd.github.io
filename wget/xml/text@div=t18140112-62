            On the 23d of December were you in the shop - A. Yes, I was; I saw the prisoner in the back shop; she was being served, and when she was served by Mr. Philpot, the gentleman who is here, he stopped and talked to another lady in the back shop. I was going to open the door for her; as she was coming to the door she stared me very hard in the face. I saw under her shawl a piece which is now here; I suspected she stole it. I let her out, and shut the door; I went back, and asked Mr. Philpot if he had sold her the cloth; he answered he had not. I had let her go out of the shop; I went after her, and caught her about fifty yards from the shop; I laid held of her arm, and under her arm was a piece of Irish linen; I asked her what she had got, to go back with me. She said she had got nothing at all. I took her back to the door; she held the cloth to Mr. Philpot; she said, this is not yours. Mr. Philpot took the cloth from her, and then he charged a constable with her; she escaped from the constable. I went over to her lodgings at Lambeth with the officer, and there we found her bonnet and shawl that she had on when she committed the theft.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, what was this Irish linen that she had under her arm - A. Twenty-five yards, value one pound eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it that day before - A. Yes, not ten minutes before I took notice of it laying on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120033"></xptr>counter. I knew the piece of cloth myself, by taking that and another piece myself to Union-place, Lambeth; I left it with, the lady all night: I marked the prices, and left both pieces, and the young man fetched it back in the morning, and left it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen it on the counter ten minutes before the prisoner came in the shop, had you - A. Yes; it was the same piece that was found on her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is charged privately stealing; you saw it under her arm as you shut the door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was somebody else in the shop serving, who is not here to-day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was there any alarm given by any other person in the shop that saw her take it. Did any body see her take it - A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received charge of the prisoner of Mr. Mann; I was going to take her to prison, and I met Darvill, the constable: the woman said she wanted to go to her lodgings in Stratton-ground, Westminster. I told Darvill the circumstance; he said he would search her; he searched her, and took a ten pound note and a five pound note from her. She wanted to go into the yard; I let her go into the yard: she escaped. She was taken in about three quarters of an hour afterwards. That is all I know, except the linen I marked it when it was given to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my property; I value it at thirty-eight shillings; it is worth more than that.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel; called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

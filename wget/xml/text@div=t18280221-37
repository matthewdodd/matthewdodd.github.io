I saw them again between five and six o'clock that evening; they brought a man in with them, and forced the door - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210050"></xptr>fellow whom they brought in with them, sat down on the bed-side, where I was sitting, and put his hand round my waist - one woman stood by the fire-place; I found the man's hand coming from my jacket-pocket, and finding something was going on wrong, I got up, and insisted on their leaving the place, and then the candle was put out, by Madden; I was immediately struck, and knocked down on my back, by the man; my pocket had seven half-crowns in it, and when I got up the half-crowns were gone, and some small silver beside; I said to my wife, that they were murderers - she called out, Robbery and Murder! one of the girls ran away, with the man who knocked me down; I secured the other, which was Madden, and kept her till the street-keeper came, and I gave her to him - she is the woman who put the candle out; she was taken to the watch-house; I staid there till a street-keeper brought Collins in, which was in less than half an hour; I described her person to him - I knew her well before; I have not seen the man since; I should know him if I saw him; I never got my money back.</p>

On the day of the robbery, between half-past ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoners walked into my room - I asked what business they had there - they said they lived next door; I told them to go out - I was ill, having a bad cold; my husband turned them out, and between six and seven o'clock in the evening they came again, with a man; they burst the door right open; they blew the candle out, and knocked my husband down - he has never been well since; the man turned my husband's pocket out, and took every farthing he had got; my husband laid hold of Madden, who blew out the candle, and the other two got away - I am certain Collins was with her.</p>

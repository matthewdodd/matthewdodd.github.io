I received two 10 l. notes, Nos. 4131 and 4132, dated the 12th of March, 1825, from Mr. Hankin; I put them into my dressing-case, which I locked, and put into a drawer, which I also locked; I saw them safe at half-past two o'clock on the 8th of April, and left my chambers about three, leaving nobody there. I reside at the chambers - they have an outer door, which I double locked: I returned at six that evening, found all the drawers broken open, and the property stated in the indictment gone - the value, including the notes, is between 70 l. and 80 l. I found a crow bar in the chambers; the door-lock had not been forced - the locks of the drawers had been wrenched off, and the marks corresponded with the crow bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK, Q. Are yours double chambers? A. No, but a Mr. Nixon also lives in them and sleeps there; I am the tenant - he is to pay me rent - he has a key; there are only two keys: I would not have sworn to the numbers of the notes had I not since made inquiry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had Mr. Nixon any door that he could shut against you? A. No.</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and live at Bedford. On the 6th of April I received from Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co. six 10 l. Bank notes, Nos. 4127 tos 4132, inclusive, and paid Nos. 4131 and 4132 to Mr. Warneford directly: as soon as I got home I received a letter from Mr. Warneford, and referred to the rest of the notes, not having parted with any more of them, and found I had paid him those numbers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that memorandum made by yourself? A. I made it after I received information of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300010"></xptr>robbery, which was two or three days after I had paid him the notes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you lost a key lately? A. A key was lost a few days before the robbery - A new one was made. - I cannot say whether the lock was altered.</p>
               <p>MR. WARNEFORD. A boy, who was my servant, had lost my key while I was in the country: the lock was not altered.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in George-street, Shoreditch. I remember a person coming to my house to buy a pair of trowsers, on the Saturday in Easter week - the prisoner is that person: he asked for two pair of trowsers - I gave him some to look at - another man came in - they said</p>
               <p>"Good morning," to each other - nothing else passed between them; the prisoner bought some trowsers and paid me a 10 l. note, which I got changed at Perry's, the George public-house; the other man bought a pair of breeches which were in pledge - he gave me another 10 l. note, which I got changed at the pawnbroker's; the name of Nichol, No. 19, Provot street," was written on the back of it, during the time I went into the back room, but which of them wrote it I cannot say: I cannot read myself, but my wife, who was in the shop, read that to me, but not in the prisoner's presence - I cannot identify it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you see the prisoner in custody? A. It might be five or six weeks after Vann, and another officer, came and took me to the office in a coach, not as a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When Vann pointed the prisoner out to you did you not say</p>
               <p>"So help me God that is not the man?" A. I said it was not the man: I believe I said I was sure he was not the man - I said nothing to give strength to that declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Vann order you to be locked up till you said he was the man? A. Yes; when I was locked up I said I thought he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath were you not taken up for the robbery and examined, a fortnight before the prisoner was in custody? A. No; I was taken to the office a week or ten days after the robbery: I have seen two men since the prisoner was taken, who appeared to me a good deal like the men, and directly they saw me they ran away: I told a friend of it - I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you knew him, you knew his name? A. It was an attorney who came to me, Mr. Price - I could not recollect his name before; I think the prisoner is older than the man was.</p>

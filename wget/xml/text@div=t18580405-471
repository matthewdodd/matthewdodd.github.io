                  </hi>. I am a wheeler, working in the Royal Arsenal. The prisoner was employed in the same capacity—I have been employed there about two years; the prisoner came early in November last—I worked at a bench in the shop at first—I left that, and went to work at a machine—the prisoner suceeded me at my bench—my tools were left in a chest under the bench—Idid not, at any time, miss any of my tools—I had no occasion to use them when I went to the machine; and I continued to work there—on 24th March, from information I received from the foreman, I went where some tools were spread out—I there saw this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by a burn on the handle—I have no doubt about it, I have had it for seven years—Inever lent it to the prisoner, I am sure; I never lent him any tools—after I saw the chisel, I went and examined my chest—I found a chisel missing.</p>

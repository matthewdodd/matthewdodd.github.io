I brought him back some distance; he then begged I would not hold him by the collar; I told him I would not if he would go quietly along; he then threw the tools down and ran down the street and I after him; I catched him at the bottom of the street; I went back with him to take the tools up. The constable of the district was coming past at the time, he took the tools in his possession; he told me if I would let him go he would tell me where he took them from. It was the very same place I saw him coming from; I told him I could not let him go; we took him to the watch-house.</p>

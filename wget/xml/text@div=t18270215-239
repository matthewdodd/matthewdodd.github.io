On Saturday afternoon, I saw this property folded up in the tap-room; I had fetched them from a parcel, which had been sent to me from Rochester - the prisoner was in the tap-room - I put them down in a settle, which he afterwards went into - this was between four and five o'clock - I went out to get a penny loaf, and when I came back, they were gone - I did not know him before, but Corporal Baker was sitting in the same box, where the prisoner had been - about eleven o'clock next morning, a person came and tapped at the window - he said, "Here is the man that took your things away;" there was no other person in the tap-room but four soldiers.</p>

            . I am a corporal of the 56th regiment. I was in the tap-room when Knight brought his bundle, and saw him put it on the table, in the box on the side where the prisoner was, not the side I sat on - soon after Knight went out, I saw the prisoner take the bundle with his left-hand, and go out at the door; it did not strike me at the moment that it was not right, till Knight came in, and inquired for the bundle - I saw the prisoner next day when they sent for me to go down to the watch-house - I have never seen any part of the bundle since.</p>

I have seen the prisoner frequent at Mr. Grant's; about six months ago he was there getting a watch repaired, he said it was his fellow servant's watch; he then expressed a wish to have a watch made of Mr. Grant's make, and looked at some watches; I shewed him one in particular which he recollected on the 24th of last month when he called again; he said then he was come to buy the gold watch which he saw before; Mr. Grant shewed him the watch that he had before seen, about six months ago. On learning that the price of the watch was twenty eight guineas he said it was too much, and wished to have one at about twenty guineas price; Mr. Grant then shewed him two or three others; one of them was a particular watch which he objected to; Mr. Grant hung it up in the usual place, and Mr. Grant referred it to me to execute the prisoner's commands, and as I understood he wanted a twenty guinea one, I handed him down a watch, as he wished me to recommend him one, of the price of twenty three guineas; the prisoner objected to it, it being rather too much, and not of the kind he wished for; I left the watch on the counter with others, while I went to get one at rather less price, and the shape he wished for; on turning round I found that the prisoner had changed his mind, and he told me he would call in eight or ten days and bargain for the watch, he did not wish to take it now; I then observed to him that he might as well take it now as then, that I could recommend to him the one that I had in my hand. After this conversation he choosed the one that I had in my hand for eighteen guineas; he said he could pay ten pound of the money, the remainder he could pay in two or three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree he should have it - A. I agreed so far that I would mention it to Mr. Grant, and if he chose to consent to it; Mr. Grant was busy, he could not be spoke to; he left that watch behind him, I was to regulate it, he was to call for it in eight days. In the course of three hours, in the same day, the watch of twenty three guineas, that I mentioned before, was missed; the watch which I first took down to him, it is of particular dimensions; the watches were there hung up, and had not been shewed to any one person until the watch was missed, therefore I was clear in my own mind that it must be the prisoner that had stolen the watch. I went to Bow-street and returned again. The prisoner came back again according to his promise in the course of eight days; when he came into the shop Mr. Grant said to him in my presence, one of the watches that were shewn to you on such a day is missing, we missed it immediately after you were gone; perhaps you may have put it in your pocket in a mistake; if you have, it will be well to return it without farther trouble. The prisoner denied knowing any thing of the watch; he said he recollected all the other watches but that particular watch; I then turned round to the prisoner, and told him the watch must be between him and I, there was none but him and I upon it, and if it had been left in the shop it would have been there; at this instant I observed his face change three different colours, from a light red to a dark red, and then to a dead pale; it still made my mind stronger that he had the watch. The prisoner said that he had a good character, that he lived with Mr.

            , esq. 33, York-place, Baker-street. Mr. Grant said that if his master would sign a note for the remainder (the eight guineas) he would let him have the watch. It was then agreed that I should call on the Saturday following to know whether the master would sign it or not. I did not call on the Saturday, but I called on the Monday or Tuesday following, I saw the prisoner, I enquired of him if his master had signed the note, or if he would do so; he told me that he did not wish to trouble his master with it, that he had not signed it, he said, as he had a friend coming from Brighton, from whom he could get the remainder of the money, and he would call and pay Mr. Grant in a fortnight altogether for it; I then observed to him the strange and unaccountable circumstance of the other watch, and again told him it was between him and me; I remonstrated with him of the extreme difficulty it left me in in Mr. Grant's house; he said he knew it must, but he knew nothing of it; I then left him. He called on the 8th instant at Mr. Grant's shop, he changed his mind with respect to the eighteen guinea watch which he had before chose, and he chose one of twenty-five guineas or pounds, he left ten pound on account in part of payment and went away. We saw nothing more of him untill the night of the 14th; an officer and two men came to our house, they said they had apprehended a man with a watch which was suspicious. On this information Mr. Grant and I went to Mr. Morrat, a pawnbroker, No. 6, High-street, Marybone; we found the watch before mentioned, that was lost at Mr. Grant's; I had a description of the watch, name and number; I compared it to the watch. I have since sworn to the watch.</p>

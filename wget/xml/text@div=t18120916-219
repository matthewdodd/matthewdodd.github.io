I lost two pair of sheets. On the 6th of July I missed them. The prisoner lived up two pair of stairs in my house. She came to us as a married woman. She cohabited with a man we supposed to be her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man the same access to the house as the woman - A. Just the same. On the 6th of July I saw the prisoner going out with a bundle, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen the sheets - A. At ten o'clock the sheets were safe. One pair of sheets were in the next room to where the prisoner lodged. She lodged in a two pair of stairs room. The other pair were in the club room. The door was locked, but I had left the key in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of these sheets - A. Two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did the man go out to work - A. At five o'clock in the morning. He was not at home that day after I saw her go out with the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her go out with a parcel - A. Yes, I did. She stopped, and had a glass of gin at the bar . I did not suspect her then. It was large enough to have contained these articles. It was covered over with an apron. About twelve o'clock that day I went up stairs and missed the sheets. She did not return to my house. On the next morning she was apprehended.</p>

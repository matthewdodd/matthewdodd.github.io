               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. When were they pawned? A. Between the 17th of December, and the 24th of January; I have received part of them before, in the name of Tetsoll - I believe the prisoner is their aunt.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner, and got the duplicates from the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>MRS. BULL. These are my property; the prisoner had been upwards of three months with her nephew and niece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were these things never pawned to pay your rent? A. Not to my knowledge; I had seen the prisoner's husband come there, but not after these goods were gone - I said I had no wish to prosecute, if I could get my things, and I was offered the money - this is the letter I received (read.)</p>
               <p>MADAM, - It is with feelings of very great pain I now address you, but I can assure you it was distress and trouble made me leave your house, and induced me to act in the way I have done; but you may rely on it, as I hope to be saved, in a very short time, I will pay you, and make all things right. I cannot say more, but you shall hear from me again very soon.</p>
               <p>Your's, obediently, J. TETSOLL.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My niece was very ill, and I went there now and then; they were in great distress, and were in the habit of pawning the things the whole year round - they pawned these things to pay the rent, or Mrs. Bull said she would play the deuce with them; they expected 10l. of a gentleman, who owed them 30l. - I did not know of their going away.</p>

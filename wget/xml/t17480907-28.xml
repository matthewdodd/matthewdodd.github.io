On the 29th of July last I lost a silver tankard off the bar, which cost me 9 l. 15 s. it was 28 ounces and 5 pennyweights , but I can't say who took it. He at first denied it, and afterwards he said that his partner took the tankard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say his partner took it?</p>
               <p>Elliot . He said his partner took it, I can't think of his name, (who is not taken) took it off the bar, and that they melted it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was with the other person when he took it?</p>
               <p>Elliot. Yes he did?</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this?</p>
               <p>Elliot. It was on the Friday, and I advertis'd it on the Saturday, and on the Sunday the prisoner confessed it?</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take him up?</p>
               <p>Elliot . We had a suspicion of him from his being there the night before; I had a very bad character of him, and that made me take notice of it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday, 12th June, I was assisting my bro<lb></lb>ther, Mr. Stratford, at his shop, No. 12, Well-street, Mile End—on that evening the prisoner came and asked for half a quartern loaf—I served her—the price was 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., she gave me a shilling—I gave her change, and put the shilling into the till—there was a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece in the till, but no other shil<lb></lb>ling—about half an hour afterwards the prisoner came again and asked for a quartern of butter, it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I served her—she gave me a shilling, I gave her change, and put the shilling in the till—about half an hour afterwards she came again—I had put nothing in the till between the times of her coming—she came a third time and asked for something, I cannot call to mind what, and she gave me a shilling; I gave her change and put that shilling in the till; I had not put any money in the till but those three shillings—the prisoner then left, and in the course of the even<lb></lb>ing Mr. Smith came for some money that my sister owed him for butter—I took the three shillings out of the till, with the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece, and went in the parlour and put it on the window ledge to my sister-in-law, Eliza—from the time the prisoner first came till I took this money out of the till, no other money had been put in it—when Mr. Smith came I passed the money to my brother's hand, and saw him give it to Mr. Smith the butter man—the next day Mr. Smith came again, and brought three bad shillings; he said he thought I was playing a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with him to give him these three shilling—I took them and placed them in the window to my sister, and I gave Mr. Smith good money—I marked the bad shillings, and gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of a cheesemonger. On 12th June I saw the last witness, and Mr. Stratford gave me a florin and three shil<lb></lb>lings; I wrapped them in a bit of paper, and the next morning I found the three shillings were bad; but not the florin—I went to Mr. Stratford's in my dinner hour, and took the three shillings—I saw the last witness take them up.</p>

               <p>but I did not mix it with the other three—the prisoner came again about half an hour afterwards and bought something, and gave my husband a good shilling—she came again afterwards and had some coffee, and eggs, and milk—I knew her again—she brought me a bad shilling—I told her she had given my sister three bad shillings the day before, and that was the second she had given me that day, and I should give her in charge—she said, "Do so"—I gave the last shilling and the shilling that I had placed in the parlour window to the policeman, and the other three.</p>

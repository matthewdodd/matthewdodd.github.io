                  </hi>. I live at Upper Clapton, in the county of Middlesex. On the 18th of June, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my counting-house, opposite the Rose and Crown public-house, Cam<lb></lb>bridge Heath, and saw two coal wagons draw up to the door of the Rose and Crown—the horses of the first wagon had nose-bags on—there was a bag apparently full of horse's food in the second wagon—I saw the prisoner Ashton with a sack full of something on his back—he walked towards the Rose and Crown stable—I lost sight of him, and very soon after saw him come out of the stable without any thing—a little while after I saw the other prisoner bring what appeared to be the same sack, empty—he took it towards the second coal wagon, and threw it in—the sack I had first seen there was gone—I spoke to a policeman, and they were taken into custody—the name of "Anti-Coal Monopoly Company" was on the wagon.</p>

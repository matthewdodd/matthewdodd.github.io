                  </hi>. I am waiter at the North and South American Coffee house, Threadneedle-street. I remember the prisoner coming to me at the coffee house on 6th May—he had a basin of soup—after he had gone I missed a salt spoon and saltcellar—these are the articles I missed, I am quite certain—I was out of the room while I went for the soup, but I kept my eyes on the passage so that nobody could come in or out without my seeing him—he was in there alone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Down a few stairs, and the soup was handed to me across the banisters—there were two saltcellars on the table, one at each end—it was about five minutes after he left that I missed the saltcellar—it was in a different room where the saltcellars were—when he went away I remained in the room all the time; it was my duty to do so—we do not commence to have dinners till 1 o'clock—I know it was about 11 o'clock because I looked at the clock which was in the room—it might have been a few minutes later—the soup was kept ready—he was about five or ten minutes taking the soup—I had never seen him before that day—it was on 26th May that I saw him in custody—our's is a house into which foreigners come from time to time—in the course of a week more than a dozen foreigners come in—the plate passes through my hands several times in a day.</p>

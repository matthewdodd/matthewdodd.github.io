                  </hi>. I live at 63, Forston Street, Hoxton, and am a watch examiner and jobber to the trade, and have been in it something like 33 or 34 years—for between 12 and 13 years I was at Benson's on Ludga Hill—it is my constant practice to receive watches without bows, and with broken pendants, to repair—I have had some hundreds through my hands at Benson's, being foreman there to do the same work—it is not my praction to take the names and addresses of persons for these small jobs, but at Ben<lb></lb>son's they have a clerk for that purpose—I know the prisoners branch of trade, namely, spring case and jobbing, repairing cases, taking bruises out and putting now bows in—I have frequently had movements brought to me without cases, to because and to examine—I also have cases brought to me without the movements to put in new movements—the movements of watches are of different value—sometimes the movement of a watch is not worth a shilling, and sometimes it is worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know that watches are sold at public sales, and sales at private houses, and bought by dealers as well as jewellers—I know that sometimes the works are taken out, and the watches are bought for the value of the gold cases, and that watches are bought at sales for the purpose of making just what profit can be got, for people who are not in possession of shops or in regular trade business—it frequently happens that a watch is left to be repaired without the name and address of the owner of the watch being given—it might occur, if I were out, that my wife would take in two or three in the course of the day, and she might say "That belongs to a gentleman of such a description; I forget his name; you would know him again"—we consider that they will come for them—sometimes it is a family relic or something of that sort, and they may say "I wish you to put this into a gold or silver case," and we look at the appearance of the party who leaves it, and we think they would not leave the watch if it were not worth their while to recover it—I could bring you several jobs I have had left at home for say 10 years—I have a move<lb></lb>ment which was to be cased, and they have never come for it—I have new had cases left for movements to be put in without their being called for, but movements I have—the bows of a watch are not always solid, they are hollow for Swiss watches—the old bows are my perquisites—sometimes they are to be engine-turned, and if scratched, they are often brought to me to on done up—they go into stock, and you will find thousands of them at Benson's to do up, and they go into stock as new.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker out of business, and now live at Holloway—I was in business in a large way in Clerkenwell for rather more than 35 years, and regularly employed 70 to 100 men at a time; more at times—I have known the prisoner more than 40 years; I knew him as a lad at Mr. Dawkins's, a springer, and hare always con<lb></lb>sidered him a thoroughly honourable and upright man—I know his business to be that of a springer and jobber of cases—it is a common thing to have movements sent to persons carrying on that business for the purpose of having new cases put on—I have had it to the tune of many thousands—I have also had cases to put movements in, but that has been very limited—watchmakers and jewellers in the country would give me these jobs to do—my business with private people would be rather limited—it was more wholesale—I kept four travellers at one time to go round the country to collect business—the prisoner used to work for me—I sent almost the majority of my outdoor work to him—he has had 50 to 100 jobs at a time from me—it is very common to have almost new cases sent to be republished—the prisoner would charge us not more than 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if he had done it perhaps twelve months ago he would touch it off very likely gratuitously—more than 40 years ago I dealt at Debenham and Storr's—for 20 years I laid out between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month in watches at Debenham and Storr's at the hammer—I would have them examined by my own workmen—if I cleared 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of work we should look over them and say to the clerk, "Let this have a new bow," or "be new engine-turned," and so on, and the parcel would go off to Sharpe's with a piece of paper written for him to do the work arranged—sometimes the cases are old, and they break them up, and they are sold to refiners., and the movements are recased—we have gene<lb></lb>rally considered Mr. Sharpe to be one of the best jobbers in London—I used to give orders to my clerk always to send the jobbing to him—there is an aptitude with some men to do jobbing—I don't say new work, but in jobbing he had a knack of doing it to please my customers, and I sent him all my country jobbing-—I am certain it is as common as possible that things are left without name or address—I had always such faith in the prisoner that I trusted him implicitly—in auction rooms it frequently happens that after the goods are sold the parties will enter two or three times—I had the privilege of doing behind the bar at Debenham and Storr's, and they buy lots, and they pass hands three or four or six times—Debenham and Storr are respectable people, and they do all they can to repress it, and I have heard Mr. John Storr send the manager to stop them—inside the bar no dealing goes on.</p>

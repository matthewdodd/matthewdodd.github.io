               <p>I am assistant-elder; I searched the prisoner, and found two parcels of tea; I took some handkerchiefs out of his pocket; and Bell took this out of his other pocket, as soon as he came into the room, he said, he hoped I would not take his bread from him, and he would put the tea into the chests again; I told him it was too publick, I was likely to lose my own bread; I had not the least suspicion of him, he was a very well behaved civil man, and always very obedient to his orders.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you have not a man of better character in your warehouse? - No, he is a man of some property, and of a very creditable family.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of knowing what sort of a man he was when in liquor? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I am one of the Deputies of this City; I have known him about forty years, he is of a very respectable family, for whom I have a very great regard, and am very sorry to see him here; his character has been esteemed an honest one; I always thought him a weak man, but there was a degree of good nature about him.</p>
               <p>HENRY FOX sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner upwards of twenty years; he is a very honest hard working man; if he gets a little in liquor it touches his head, but he has distressed himself by good natured actions.</p>

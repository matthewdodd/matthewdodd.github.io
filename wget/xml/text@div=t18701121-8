                  </hi>. I live at 12, Dock Street, Wapping, and am watch-man to Edward Richardson and others, warehousemen, in Cinnamon Street, Wapping—I was on duty on the night of 25th October—about 8.30 I found one of the flaps of No. 3 warehouse open—I sent for the man to shut it; he did so, and we locked up No. 3 warehouse—we then went to No. 4, and as I was taking off the padlock one of the thieves came out of the loop-hole—I went in at the loop-hole and found the prisoner there, just abreast of the flap—I found some tallow packed in two baskets, and a bag—I sent for the police, and the prisoner was taken into custody—he had no business in the warehouse—he had been employed there about a week before.</p>

I was called to the warehouse and found the prisoner concealed in between some casks of tallow, with this lantern in his possession, and this iron bar lying near him—I found a cask turned down, the hoops knocked off, and the head taken out, and about 31/2 cwt. of tallow was taken out and put into some crates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. The prisoner was in my employ to carry out milk, and was to receive money for it—he went away on 11th Feb.—he used to bring money from Mrs. Nathan—about 16th Nov. he said Mrs. Nathan would not pay as she had done, but would pay weekly—before, he had been in the habit of bringing the money daily, or every other day—after that he did not bring me any money, and at the end of two or three weeks I asked him if they had paid—he said, "No"—at the end of seven weeks I asked him to name it to the servant, in case there should be a mistake—he said he had spoken to the servant, and she said it was all right—after ten weeks I asked him again, and he said he had named it to the servant, and she said she was very short, and did not like to name it to her mistress—on Monday, 11th Feb., I sent the servant round with him, and after that, I saw him no more—he did not pay me anything from Mrs. Nathan for twelve weeks—he did not pay me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received on the 9th.</p>

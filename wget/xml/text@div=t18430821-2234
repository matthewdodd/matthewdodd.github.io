                  </hi>. I am in the service of George Adams, a publican in Gray's Inn lane—on the 18th of July, I saw the prisoner in and out of the house from six o'clock in the morning till nine in the evening—I followed her when she left in the evening to Mrs. Andrews' door, a marine store shop, in Baldwin's Gardens—I heard Mrs. Andrews say to her—"Mind and look that there is nobody about"—I went into a house opposite and saw them go in doors together—I followed them, and saw Mrs. Andrews with her apron<lb></lb>on her arm, and the prisoner had just got the pint pot in her hand—I took it from her, and said I would lock her up—she begged of me not—I gave her into custody, and produce the pot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse-keeper to Reid and Co.'s bewery, and live in the same house as Birch. On Sunday, the 21st of April, I was in my room on the second floor front—I noticed the three prisoners on the other side, about thirty yards from Mr. Mullins's shop—I saw some money in Morton's hand—they were standing looking at it—the other two prisoners were stand<lb></lb>ing close to him—they all seemed to be looking at it—they then moved on from where they stood, and when they got about six yards, Morton stooped down and chinked what I think was a half-crown on the pavement—it was a large piece, white like silver—they then went on a few yards further, and then they made a stop together—Morton came away from the other two, and came back towards where I saw them at first—he stooped down and took up some dirt on one of his long fingers, then went back to the other two, and seemed to be in the act of rubbing it on something in his hand—the others were looking on at the time—they went on two or three yards, then came back to the part where they were looking at the money, opposite Mr. Mul<lb></lb>lins's shop—Ellis then left them, crossed the road, and went on the same side as Mr. Mullins's shop, only more to the left—Morton went over to look between the shutters of Mullins's shop—Fox went across into Mullins's shop—Ellis was standing about five or six yards above—she could not see what was doing inside the shop—after Fox had been a minute in the shop, Morton turned round and nodded to Ellis—Fox then came out and went towards Ellis; he passed by Morton, took no notice of him, but joined Ellis, and they both went on—Morton came away from the shutters, and when Fox got up to Ellis, he went up to them—he went on in the same direction—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to Birch—I saw the prisoners about a quarter of an hour after in custody—I am sure they are the persons.</p>

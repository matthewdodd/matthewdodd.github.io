                  </hi>. I am a tailor, at 18, Aldgate-street—the prisoner was in my service as cashier—I placed considerable reliance on him—it was his duty to receive money, and also to pay my work-people—on 17th June he gave me this account in his handwriting—there is a sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. put down as having been paid to a person named O'Brien—he also gave me this account of moneys received—I afterwards saw his book—it is here I find that he has made that account 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than it ought to be—the addition is 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it ought to be 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the sum in the cash-book is 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it should be 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the addition is wrong—I asked him for an explanation, and he said it was a mistake—I then called his attention to the amount paid to O'Brien—I said, "You have paid O'Brien 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and you have charged me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said that was a mistake also—that was on the same day—then he received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was not entered at all—he said they were all mistakes.</p>

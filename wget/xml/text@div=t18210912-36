On the 16th of July I received an order by letter, signed J. Tipper (I did not know him), to send a double-barrelled gun and a single one. I was then in London, and went to No. 1, Marlborough-street, to enquire for Mr. Tipper; I saw a woman in the house; I could get no information from her. I went in the afternoon; saw her again, and left my card for Mr. Tipper to call on me. I had not got far from the house before the two prisoners came to me, and asked if my name was Howell - I said it was. Pott asked me if I understood the order he sent, and said his name was Tipper. He fixed Friday, the 20th, to come and look at the patterns of some guns - this was Wednesday, the 18th - they both came on Friday, the 20th, and approved of the guns and pistols I shewed them, and wished to have them; I said they were sold. They desired me to send a single and a double barrelled gun according to their order, as soon as I could, and they promised to pay me a banker's bill. I agreed to allow them five per cent. I went home to Birmingham, and sent up a double and a single barrelled gun to Mr. Sherington, with an order to receive a banker's bill on the delivery of them - they came to 17 l. 2 s. 6 d. Mr. Sherington sent me this bill in a letter, dated the 27th of July; he sent me another letter on the 11th of August, with a bill for 26 l. 17 s.</p>
               <p>(Read. - See indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. You received that as a valid bill - A. Yes; I paid the bill of 17 l. 2 s. 6 d. into my banker's. I sent the one for 26 l. 17 s. to Mr. Jenns, in London, to see if it was Messrs. Williams' acceptance - it was afterwards returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you mark the letter in which you suppose the bill came to you from Sherington - A. Mr. Jenns returned the bill to me; I know the letter, but did not mark it. Both the prisoners were present when the guns were inspected. I am positive that Pott called himself Tipper.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not notice that at Marlborough-street - A. Until they came to Bow-street I did not know their names were false. When they saw me in the street Tipper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120018"></xptr>said himself that his name was Pool; they were both strangers to me. They came to me again on the 20th. I did not see them again, except at Bow-street.</p>

I received from Mr. Howell two guns, with instructions how to dispose of them. Pott came to me on the 11th of August, I think. The first time he came was on the 26th of July - he said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got some guns from Mr. Howell for me?" I said I had. We went together up into my club-room where the guns were - he said he had a letter from Mr. Howell, saying that he was to give me a banker's bill for these guns, he gave me the bill for 17 l. 2 s. 6 d. - I let him have the guns - I asked his name; he said it was Tipper.</p>
               <p>Q. Well; he came again on the 11th of August - A. Yes; I had received a box from Mr. Howell, with orders to deliver it for such a bill as the last. Pott said he came for the guns - I said, then I must have the bill. He presented another bill instantly. (Looks at one.) This is it. I gave him the box. I had no conversation with him about it. I saw it was accepted the same as the other, and took it. I called him Mr. Tipper - he answered to that name. I remitted the bill to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18210912-36-person360">Howell</persName>
             the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had another bill for the first guns - A. Yes; my orders were to get another bill just like the last. I made no enquiries about the bills, as I knew the house was respectable. Pott was the only person present when the bill was delivered. After he was in custody, he told me his name was Pott. I am not confounding one with the other. I did not see the other prisoner till he was in custody. I did not go to Birchin-lane. When I delivered the box, only Pott was present - somebody, who he called his man, was in the parlour. That man took the guns on his shoulder by his desire - it was not Tipper.</p>

            . I am a friend of Mr. Howell's. On the 15th of August he sent me a bill for 26 l. 17 s. I should know it again. (Looks at it.) This is it - it is accepted "Williams and Co." I was desired to present it, to see if it was a correct acceptance. I went first to No. 3, Birchin-lane, according to the direction, and saw a gentleman in a lower room, making up newspapers. I thought it a strange place, and asked if it was Williams', the bankers. I was answered it was Williams', but not Williams' the banker's.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house was it - A. I went into a narrow passage, and on the entrance-door of the passage was "Williams and Co." on a large brass plate also on the glass of the door, at the foot of the stairs - I passed up a narrow flight of stairs, turned to my right, and saw a lady in a small room, folding linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing like a house of business - A. Not at all. I rapped at a door up stairs, on the same landing where I saw the lady, and on the door were the words "Attendance from Ten till Four," and I think there was Williams and Co. on it. I then went to Williams and Co.'s banking-house, No. 20, presented the bill, shewed them the acceptance, and went away. I went to a house in Newgate-street and wrote a letter to Mr. Howell. I received one from him; and in consequence of that, and one written to the the prisoners, they called on me on Friday the 17th of August, at the Red Lion and Still, public-house, Drury-lane - they left a strip of paper, to say they would call again on the Saturday morning, as I was not at home, which they did, at twelve o'clock, and Pott introduced himself to me as Mr. Tipper - he introduced the other as his friend. He said he called at the request of Mr. Howell, to do business with me. I told him I was not prepared to transact business in the way Mr. Howell desired, and asked him to call on Monday. I wrote to Mr. Howell to come up himself, which he did; and when they called, we took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Pott represented himself as Tipper - A. Yes; I did not put down the words. After Pott was in custody he wished to send a friend to his uncle. I said, "Mr. Tipper, I will send for you" - he then said "My name is not Tipper, this is Mr. Tipper," pointing to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Pott say, "I am Mr. Tipper's agent, and this is Mr. Tipper" - A. No; the word "agent" never passed. I asked his name in the first conversation on Saturday morning, and he said it was Tipper. I said, Is your name Mr. Tipper? Pott said, "I am Mr. Tipper" - he did not point to Tipper. I went to Birchin-lane about half-past three o'clock - I went through a door into a passage. "Williams and Co. No. 3," was on the door, on a brass plate, in letters three inches long - the figures were distinct enough. I entered from Cornhill, and came to No. 3, before I came to No. 20. On the first floor I found the lady in one room, and one room was shut.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Birchin-lane. I know the prisoner Tipper; he had a counting house at our house, in the firm of Williams and Co. - it had been a counting house before; he took a counting house, a dining room, and a bed-room; on the 1st of November last. A man, who said his name was Williams, took it in the name of Williams and Co. - a ship insurance broker had it before him.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of its being taken, did any one reside there - A. Some time after it was taken, Mr. Williams sent for me, and said, he did not wish to occupy it till the 1st of February, and asked leave for a Mr. Jerman and his wife to occupy them for two months, they came, and when the two months was expired, I went into the office, and told Mr. Jerman, it was time for him to go, he refused - they did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any person being in the counting house when Jenns called - A. Yes, I do not know his name, he would never give it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Williams constantly reside there - A. He was never in the house - I never saw him in the house. Tipper was there constantly - I do not recollect whether I ever saw Pott there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was ever any banking business carried on there by Williams and Co. - A. There was at first, some exchanging of notes going forward; this went on till Tipper was taken into custody - Jerman assisted as clerk, Tipper was one of the firm; they were to pay me 80 l. per annum, they paid me a quarter in advance. I applied for the second quarter, they said they would not pay me. Jerman paid me the quarter in advance - I have received no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Birchin-lane is much used as a place of business, for merchants who do not reside there - A. It is, it was taken as a place of residence for Williams. I objected to his name being put up, but it was done. I saw notes presented there two or three times,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120019"></xptr>and paid. Tipper used to attend from ten o'clock till four. I never saw large notes presented.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Jerman was the only man who acted as clerk - A. No, there were several others after him, there was a man named Green, who appeared to be a clerk, and several other men at different times, they were frequently all together in the counting-house - there were books there; when they first came, they went on very regular.</p>

            , ESQ. I am in partnership with Williams and Co. bankers, No. 20, Birchin-lane, (looks at the bill) The acceptance is not the hand-writing of any body belonging to our house. We sometimes accept in red ink, and write across as this is - nobody accepts bills for us but the partners - the clerks never accept; this is not the hand-writing of any of my partners. I know of no other Williams and Co. bankers, besides ourselves, neither in Birchin-lane or elsewhere - we accept as Williams and Co. across as this is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is very common to write across bills - A. Yes, and common to accept in red ink. It is not the slightest resemblance to any hand-writing of our firm - it is Williams and Co., our house is No. 20. I know No. 3, and have seen the name written on the door. I never knew of letters directed to No. 3, coming to our house by mistake. I have frequently known bills directed to No. 3, come to our house, and have sent them to No. 3. If this bill had been brought to me, I should have said it was not our acceptance, and we had nothing to do with it.</p>

            , all residing at Swansea, in the county of Glamorganshire; it is not requisite for bankers to be licensed, except where they issue notes payable to bearer, upon demand. I do not know who applied for the licence - it continues until the 10th of October following, and should then be renewed, I have no recollection of the persons; when licences are applied for, it is requisite to give a copy of the bill of the house. (I produce it). It is the bill to be issued at Swansea. (The notes were made payable for Williams, Tipper, Williams, and Co. No. 3, Birchin-lane, London.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great North-street, Lisson-grove, and am a grocer. The prisoner lived with me—on Tuesday, the 30th of May, I was out, and returned at three o'clock in the afternoon—I had not seen the prisoner when I went, nor when I came back—he is my son-in-law, and his mother, who was my wife, was then on her death-bed—on my return home she gave me some account, and on the Friday afterwards she died—after her death I looked in a drawer, and missed a coat—on the Saturday the prisoner came to my house—I said he had taken the coat—he said, "Oh, it is very easy to get that back again, that was pawned for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he gave me the duplicate, and said he had got two others—I said, "You have not taken anything else, have you?"—he said, "Yes, a piece of velvet and a ring"—I said, "You are a bad young man, I shall never forgive you"—he brought me the tickets on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, and left them on the mantel-piece—I redeemed the coat—I have not redeemed the other things.</p>

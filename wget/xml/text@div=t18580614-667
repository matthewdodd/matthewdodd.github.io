                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Kaye, of Prospect House, near Woodford. He had three ducks and two drakes—I saw them safe on 26th May, in his field—I knew the ducks; they would follow me anywhere; when I went to feed them they would come and meet me—I missed two of them on 27th May—one was a light grey one, and one was milk white—they were worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see anybody take them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Are there not two come back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a dark one came back on the 30th; that was one that was lost—a white one came back on the 31st; that is not the same that was lost; I can swear it is not the one—this one is a dirty white; the one that was lost was pure white.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose that the one that came back was thoroughly cleaned, would it be quite white? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I mean it is a dirty white; there is no mud on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you examined at the Magistrate's office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the 28th, and the prisoner was then committed for trial—it was after that, that the two ducks came back—the grey one is the same we lost—I cannot swear the other is not the one we lost; it is smaller—it was away five days; it may have got smaller.</p>
               <p>?<hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS FEATHERSTONE</hi>. I am a gardener. On the morning of 27th May, I was near Mr. Kaye's place—I saw the prisoner, coming in a direction from Mr. Kaye's field—I knew him before—I saw he had something in his pocket which looked lite a duck—I think it was alive, I saw it move—I saw the neck of it, and the head—I cannot say it was the neck and head of a duck—it was very much like a duck—I was about twenty-seven yards from</p>

               <p>the prisoner—he had a dark coat on, like this coat produced—I could not swear to it, and this was in his right hand inside pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You saw me round the back road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you were not trespassing on any person's field—I could not see anything in your pocket that I could swear to—I do not swear to this coat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 439). On the morning of 27th May, I received information from the last witness, from half past 7 to a quarter before 8 o'clock—I went to the prisoner's house at 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I observed white feathers lying about the room—I picked up some of them—I could not say what they were—I searched the up stairs room, which is a bed room—I found some cooked duck in a dish behind the door—I examined it, and one piece had a white feather on it—that piece of duck was produced at the Police Court—I went with Gray to look for the prisoner—we found him on Buckhurst Hill, but his wife got there before we gut to him—when he saw us be started off, and ran nearly half a mile, and jumped over a hedge—I captured him—I saw some marks round the pond where the ducks had been—I took the prisoner's shoes off, and made an impression with them by the side of the marks—these are the shoes—here is a piece of leather nailed on the bottom of one of the shoes, which corresponded with the marks—the marks were round the pond, and for thirty yards up the lane spoken of by Featherstone—I counted the nail holes in the marks—they were seven, and there are seven nails in the shoe.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 332). I went with the last witness to the prisoner's house—I found this coat there—I searched the pockets, and in the right hand inside pocket I found a quantity of feathers, which, I believe, are duck's feathers, and here is a quill, which, I believe, is that of a duck—there were white feathers about the prisoner's bed room—I went with the last witness to the Forest—I saw the prisoner—he walked a little distance, and then ran the best part of half a mile—I was with the other constable when he compared the marks of the shoes.</p>

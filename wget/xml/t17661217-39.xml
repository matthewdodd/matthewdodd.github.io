            . On Wednesday the 12th of November, about seven in the evening, I was coming down Cheapside, turning down <placeName id="t17661217-39-crimeloc206">Charlotte-row by the Mansion-house, towards Dowgate-hill</placeName>

I took them both before my Lord-Mayor, who sent them to Newgate. They both denied it; they pulled me about ten yards from the place where my handkerchief was taken away, and a gentlewoman took that up and gave it to me. When I charged them, they asked me to go to a tavern and drink a pint of wine, and said it was the first time they had been accused of any thing of that sort.</p>

                  </hi> I am a book-keeper, and live in Wynd<lb></lb>ham-street, Camberwell. On the 18th of June, a little after twelve o'clock at night, I was going through the gate, opposite the Horns, to cross Kenning<lb></lb>ton-common—the prisoner came through immediately after me, and caught hold of me—I tried to get away—her arm was over my shoulder, and her hand passed under my waistcoat to find if there was anything there—I walked I suppose 100 paces, endeavouring to get rid of her, and she was pulling me about—all of a sudden she ceased, and I was surprised to see her go away so suddenly—I turned, and saw the policeman coming towards me—he told me to put my hand in my pocket, which I did, and I found two shillings had been abstracted from my purse—the purse was in my pocket, but it was not in the way I keep it—I always draw the rings down on the silver, but the rings were then in the centre, and the money was gone—I had had the money in the purse twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before—I had stopped no where—I was perfectly sober—I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant</hi> 85.) I was on duty at Kennigton<lb></lb>common at twelve o'clock that night—I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner scuffling together—I heard the prosecutor tell her several times to go away—I saw them part—I told the prosecutor to see whether he had lost anything—he put his hand into his pocket and said it was all right, but he pulled out his purse and said he had lost his money—I took the prisoner into custody about twenty yards off—she said the prosecutor promised her a shilling, and had not given it to her—as I was going to the station I asked her what money she had got—she said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that a gentleman had given her at a house—she then went on, and said she had got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some halfpence—I noticed her putting her hand under her clothes—I caught her hand, and a shilling fell from her—she then put her hand in her bosom and took out twopence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The officer told me to stop, and he called the prose<lb></lb>cutor and asked him if he had lost anything—he said, "No"—then he pulled out his purse and said he had lost 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; then he said half-a-crown, and then 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the officer said, "Will you give this woman in charge?"—he said, "Yes" and the officer took me—he said, "Have you any money?"—I said, "Yes, one shilling and twopence;" he said, "I am glad I have got you, if I have half a chance I will transport you"—it is a spite he has against me.</p>

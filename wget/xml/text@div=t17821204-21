               <p>I was at the play on the 13th of November, and left my mother at home, when I returned about eleven I knocked at the door, and she did not let me in; and I was going into Aldersgate-street to sleep, and the prisoner called me by my name, and asked me where I was going.</p>
               <p>Court. Did your mother lock you out so early as eleven? - Yes my Lord, she was gone to bed.</p>
               <p>In the street the prisoner met you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - No my Lord, but she called me by my name, and I looked to see who it was, but she did not know me, nor I her; she asked me where I was going, and I told her, and she said there was a fire near, and I might be taken up by the people, for they had been fighting, and I had better go along with her, and I did; I went with her into <placeName id="t17821204-21-crimeloc107">Blackboy-alley</placeName>

               <p>Court. Where is Blackboy-alley? - Somewhere in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Where does your mother live? - She lives in Water-lane, Black-friars No. 10.</p>
               <p>What street were you going to? - Aldersgate street, I went with her, and lay down with my clothes on, and she took a ring off my finger, and I asked her what she was going to do with it, and she said she wanted to try it on her finger; she did not return it again, but said she would give it me presently; she got up some time after that, I asked her where she was going, she said she was going to get some coals, and bid me lay still; she covered my face over, and got up; I fell asleep, and I waked about eight in the morning, and the woman was gone with my cloak and bonnet, and my shoes and stockings, and my ring; I staid there, for I could not go, because I had not my shoes, stockings, and bonnet and cloak; she returned home about ten, and I asked her what she had done with my things, she said they were at a neighbours, and I should have them again; after she returned home, she said she must have my gown and shaul to pay her rent, I told her I could not let her have them, but she said she would have them, and she took them from me; she went out and locked me in, and she came home some time after, and in the afternoon s he said she must have my stays, and she took them off from me; and after that, she took my under petticoat and my muslin apron; and my shoes she took in the morning, she did not take any more.</p>
               <p>What happened afterwards? - I wanted to go but she would not let me; and on the Saturday she asked me if I knew any friends that I could send to, to send me some clothes to go home in: I remained there from Wednesday till Sunday evening; on Sunday evening the gentlemen came and took me away, they are here.</p>
               <p>What gentlemen are they? - They are writers.</p>
               <p>What had they to do with you? - The prisoner asked me whether I had any acquaintance to send to, that would get me some clothes in order to go home, and I recollected this young person that is here, and she told me she would go to her if I would not tell her she had taken my cloaths; and I agreed not to tell her, for her to go, that I might get away from her; and she went to the young woman on the Saturday evening, and she was not at home; her name was

               <p>Court. You went to the play on the Wednesday evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did your mother know of your going to the play? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You came home about eleven? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And locked out of your father's house? - They had locked the door, they did not expect me I suppose.</p>
               <p>Why not? - Because I very often go to sleep at Mrs. Rumsey's in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Is she any relation of yours? - I lived with her once.</p>
               <p>What, as maid servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you are used to sleep out of your father's house whenever you please, and they took it for granted you were gone to Mrs. Rumsey's? - I tell them whenever I intend to sleep out.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them you intended to sleep out that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Then why should they suppose that you was gone to Mrs. Rumsey's to sleep, if you had not told them so? - I did not tell them so.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it strange to be locked out? - I do not know, I never used to sleep out of a night, any further than going there to sleep.</p>
               <p>Did you use to do that often? - As I am out of place, I am there for a fortnight together.</p>
               <p>Then your father and mother did not think it extraordinary that you should sleep out of nights? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>What time do they go to bed? - Nine o'clock; if I had knocked at the door I suppose I should have been let in, but I did not knock at the door, because I thought I should have anger if my mother got up.</p>
               <p>Why I thought you said your mother knew of your going to the play? - Yes she did.</p>
               <p>Then what should you have anger for young woman, because eleven is as early as you could well come from the play; why should you suppose she should be angry? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Then you did not knock for fear your mother should be angry? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You was afraid they should hear you, and let you in? - No, I thought they might not have been gone to bed when I knocked the first time, but when I found they were, I was loth to disturb them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner met you in Cheapside? - Yes, it was in Cheapside, between St. Paul's church yard and Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>She called you by your Christian name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say, Sarah, or Sally? - Sally.</p>
               <p>Very familiarly? - Yes, she asked me where I was going, and I told her, she said there was a fire there.</p>
               <p>Did you believe her that there was a fire in Aldersgate-street? - Yes I did, or I would not have gone with her.</p>
               <p>Was there a fire there that night? - I was confined there till Sunday.</p>
               <p>You had no curiosity to go and see whether your friend's house was on fire or not? - It might not be near them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040026"></xptr>Being told there was a fire where you was going to, you had no curiosity at all to go and see? - She over and above persuaded; to go home with her, and took me by the hand, and said I should go home in the morning.</p>
               <p>What, this stranger that you had never seen before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to let her take your ring off your finger? - She took it away by force in an instant.</p>
               <p>Did not you feel her? - Yes, but I could not help her taking it off.</p>
               <p>Did you shut your hand? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did she open it by force? - Yes she did.</p>
               <p>She forced your hand open, and you asked her what she was going to do with it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And she said she was going to try it on her own finger, and would give it you again presently? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After all this force and violence, then you rested satisfied? - I was obliged to do it.</p>
               <p>Soon after that she got up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She desired you to lay still, and covered up your face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to lay still after she had left you? - I was very sleepy.</p>
               <p>Then you was quite composed and easy, though this stranger had so forced your hand open, and taken away your ring? - I was rather tired.</p>
               <p>Rather tired, quite composed, no fear or apprehension on your mind, and lay quietly and slept till about eight in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in the house? - There was nobody else in the place where she lived.</p>
               <p>But in the house? - No, nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>When you waked in the morning you found she was gone with your cloak and bonnet, and shoes and stockings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I thought you laid down in your cloaths? - She took off my shoes and stockings, and said I should be better without them.</p>
               <p>Did you make no resistance? - I did not make any resistance against her taking them off.</p>
               <p>Then you liked to have your shoes and stockings taken off, did you? - I did not chuse to have them taken off, but she took them off.</p>
               <p>And you let her? - I did, I did not want her to take them away from me.</p>
               <p>Did she take them off before you went to sleep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So then this woman had taken your ring by force, and forced your hand open, and taken your shoes and stockings off against your will, and you lay quietly to sleep? - I did not sleep then.</p>
               <p>You never attempted to go away? - I could not go away without my clothes.</p>
               <p>You could have called the watch? - I did not see any watch.</p>
               <p>Did you open the window? - I did not, I did not call out for help, there was nobody but her sort of people in the place; she said my things were at a neighbour's and I should have them again; she told me if I cried, I should have none of my things again, or else I should never go from her no more, nor see any body any more.</p>
               <p>Then she tried to compose you? - No she did not, she told me to make myself easy, but I could not; she kept telling me so all the time I was with her, that I should have them again; but afterwards she said she must have more for her rent, and she would have them, I told her she should not, but she took them off by force.</p>
               <p>All this time did you see any body with her? - I saw two women, they came into the room.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them? - She desired I would not tell them my case, but one of the women, I told her when she was absent.</p>
               <p>Then having done all this to you, she left you in the room with one woman that she did not want to know the case, and desired you not to tell this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040027"></xptr>And then left you alone with her? - She did.</p>
               <p>Did you ask this woman to assist you in making your escape, and getting away? - The woman seemed to be my friend; I asked her where I was; she said it was a terrible place, and that it was Blackboy-alley.</p>
               <p>Then this woman told you it was a terrible place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Though she herself came to visit there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many rooms were in the house? - I do not know, I was only in one room.</p>
               <p>Was it a ground-floor, or up one pair of stairs? - Up one pair of stairs, the rest was uninhabited.</p>
               <p>Nobody else lived in this house but this woman? - Nobody, it is like a barn more than a house; there was no roof to it as I could see when I went out, I did not see that when I went in, there is no number to it.</p>
               <p>After all this she went to fetch your friends and relations, in order to take her her up? - She said, if I would promise to keep it secret, she would go and fetch a person, if she thought, she said, I would not tell my mother; she told me that I was to say, that I knew her very well, and that I had been so good as to give her my clothes to pay for the nursing of a child at Battle-bridge.</p>
               <p>How, for the nursing of a child? - Of her child; I was to tell the person she had an execution served on her for nursing that child, and I was so good to lend her my clothes to pay for it; and she said, if I did not say so, I should never see any body; and if I would make her that promise, I should see the young person I wanted to see, and I should go: she told the story to

            , and she would be glad to see me directly; I said, I could not come then, but I would come in the afternoon, if she would tell me where; she said, she could not give me a proper direction, but if I would appoint a time she would meet me; I met her about half after two; I asked her which way we were to go, and she said, towards Smithfield; I went with her; as we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040028"></xptr> went along I asked her the reason why Sally was from her friends so long; she said, she had been at the play, and was locked out that she came to her apartment to sleep with her, and she had not been in the room many minutes before a person came to trouble her for some money that was owing for nursing a child at Battle-bridge; so Sally seeing her distress, was so kind to let her have her clothes to satisfy it, and what she wanted was, to get her some clothes to come home in.</p>
               <p>Had you known that Sally was missing from her friends before? - Yes, I had been at her friends several times, but never heard heard any intelligence of her.</p>
               <p>Did not you think this was an odd story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That she should lend her clothes, and not leave herself clothes to come home in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her any particular questions about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she say how long she had known her? - She said she had known her a good while.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No, I never heard Sally speak of any such person; the prisoner said she knew her when she lived in Bell-yard, Doctors Commons; I went with her to the house, I saw but one room that I know of, and it was a kind of shed, like a slaughter-house underneath, a very deplorable situation.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether there were more rooms in the house, or any other people? - No, I did not; I did not see any more stairs than what I went up.</p>
               <p>Now relate what happened after you went there? - The young woman said, she should be obliged to me to go home, and speak to her friends to get her some clothes; the young woman sat on the bed, and the prisoner related over again the same story, and Sally did not deny a word of it.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing about it one way or the other? - No, she did not; only begged of me to go to her friends, and get her some clothes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her any questions then? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not you a curiosity to know how she came into such a place, and in such a condition? - No, I did not ask her any questions, the young woman was crying all the time; I left her then, and went to her father, I told him I had heard from her; she intreated me not to tell her father or mother till she came home, and I asked him for some clothes for her; her father asked me if she had been stripped; I told him I did not know; he said I must come in the evening; I called on an acquaintance of mine in Fetter-lane, there were three young men of my acquaintance there, they insisted on coming with me, they said, it did not look like a likely story that the young woman should strip herself; they went with me first to her father's, there was nobody at home but her father; her father said, she must stay till tomorrow; I said, then I would go home; they said no, let us go for the curiosity, and we went: there was no light nor no fire, and we found the young woman in the same distress; and when she saw I had got somebody with me, she then confessed how she had been stripped.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner was there, was not she? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - The prisoner asked her to stay all night, and the young men said she should not; the prisoner said she had not stripped her.</p>
               <p>What conversation passed between her and the prisoner on that occasion? - The young woman said, it was as she had said before, and one of the young men desired the prisoner to go with them, and she said she would; the prisoner readily agreed to go with us; we took them to St. Andrew's watch-house.</p>
               <p>What story did the young woman tell at that time in the presence of the prisoner, as near as you can recollect? - She said she had been at the play, and returned about eleven, that she had knocked several times at her father's door, and nobody answered, and that she was going to Mrs. Rumsey's, in Aldersgate-street, to sleep, this woman called to her by her name, and said there was a fire in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040029"></xptr> Aldersgate-street, and she had better go home with her, and she would take care of her; Sally said, she went with her, and laid down with her clothes on, and the woman waked her in pulling off her ring, and she asked her what she was going to do with it, and she said she was only going to try it on her own finger, and would give it her again presently; and that being weary, she fell asleep, and slept till eight or nine, and then the woman was gone with her cloak and bonnet and slippers; she came home at ten, much intoxicated, for her gown, and then for her stays; then afterwards she took her under-petticoat, her shaul and apron.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her how she came to stay there? - She said she was padlocked in, and the woman told her, if she offered to cry, or make the least resistance, she should never see any body again; I asked her if she knew the woman, she said she did not, and never saw her before in her life.</p>
               <p>She gave no reason for going home with this stranger? - No further than that the woman, by her motherly talk, enticed her to go with her.</p>
               <p>Is she a very weak, silly girl? - I really do not know that; she always appeared very sensible in my company.</p>
               <p>You never found any want of understanding in her? - No.</p>
               <p>What were the young men's names that went with you? -

               <p>Do you remember her being out three or four days from your house? - Yes, my lord, and in great trouble I was.</p>
               <p>When did she first go out? - On the Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>What time? - I cannot justly say to the hour, it might be two or three o'clock, or three or four.</p>
               <p>Where was she going to, did she say? - I cannot justly say where she said she was going, but she said she would not be a great while.</p>
               <p>Did you expect her home to tea? - I expected her home some time in the evening.</p>
               <p>Then you had no notion where she was gone to? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - I went to bed between nine and ten, I was very uneasy.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to bed then? - We lay very nigh the door, I thought I should hear her knock, my husband was at home.</p>
               <p>As you were uneasy in your mind about her not coming home, you probably did not go soon to rest? - I thought she was safe enough, I thought she might call at an acquaintance of mine, and I knew if she did she would be taken great care of.</p>
               <p>Who was that acquaintance that came into your mind? - One Mrs. Rumsey; I thought she might be there.</p>
               <p>If she had knocked loud and often, you probably would have heard her? - She did knock, because a neighbour came by and saw her when she was at the door; I did not hear her.</p>
               <p>When did the neighbour tell you this? - Since this all came out, then I heard of it.</p>
               <p>Who was that neighbour? - One Mrs. Godsall.</p>
               <p>The next morning did you enquire after her? - Oh yes! of the neighbours that I knew, but I heard nothing of her.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire at Mrs. Rumsey's? - I sent, but she had not been there; the first I heard of her was a Sunday night, she did not come home then, it was from this young woman,

               <p>of any acquaintance of Sally Cooper till this affair: I went to between eight and nine on Sunday morning in the middle of November, to recollection, when I came there, and it was very dark, there was no light at all in the room; I asked for the Cooper, and she spoke, I asked for a light, and the prisoner said she would get one; I believe Fitzpatrick gave her the money for it; then I saw Cooper sitting on the bed, with a petticoat and her shift only in her, I asked her, her situation, she said she had been without any victuals for two or three days, I told her I would bring her some clothes the next day, and she was very well pleased.</p>
               <p>Did she say how she came into that place? - She told me she had been to the play in the middle of the week, and knocked at her father's door, and did not care to knock any more; that she was going to some street in the city; I do not know the street, and the prisoner met her and called her Sally, and asked her where she was going to, and she told her; and the prisoner told her there was a fire where she was going, and that there had been a quarrell and she might be taken up, and that she was welcome to half her bed, and persuaded her to go home with her, and she went home with her; then she stripped her of her ring and clothes, and shoes, and her bonnet and cloak, they were all gone: I believe she took the ring off her finger; she told me this at the watch house, that the ring had been taken off her finger, and she asked her for it, and what she was going to do with it, and she said to try it on her own finger.</p>
               <p>Did she describe it as if the prisoner asked her for the ring? - She said the prisoner took it off her finger by force, and she made off with it and pawned it: the prisoner said that Cooper had given her the things of her own consent; she said it was very cruel to think of prosecuting her; I told her when I found her, if she would tell me where the things were, I would get them out, and give her no further trouble; but she said she could not do that, but she would get them out in the course of the week: her husband who was in the militia, would send her some money in the course of the week.</p>

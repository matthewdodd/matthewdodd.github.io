                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Green's-place, Bethnal-green. On the 16th of April I went to the Rose public-house, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in company with the prisoner's father—the prisoner came into the room—I offered his father a drink of beer out of my pot—his father did not give him any, and they began to quarrel—the prisoner sat down right opposite me—he began abusing his father for not asking him to drink, and his father threatened to <hi rend="italic">whop</hi> him for it—the prisoner then rose off his seat, and threatened to cut his father's throat—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself for using such language to his father—I got up, and shoved him down on the form—he then began abusing me, and I said I would give him a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>—he called me all manner of names, and I threatened to <hi rend="italic">whop</hi> him for it—he said if I came near him he would stick a knife into me—he had a knife on the table, which he had been eating his victuals with, but he had done eating his victuals, and it laid on the table—I got up off my seat, and was in the act of pulling off my coat, when he reached across the table, and struck me in the breast with the knife—it went into my breast—I hit him two or three times after that, not knowing I was stabbed till I felt the blood running down my side—I had not struck him before this, nor aimed any blow at him—when I found I was stabbed, I said to hit father,</p>

               <p>"Look here, Mr. Russell, your son has cut me with a knife"—I went out at the door, and the father followed me—there were two policemen against the door—his father spoke to them, and gave him in charge—I went over to the doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was coming by the house at the time, the prisoner's father and the prosecutor came out to me and showed me the wound where he had been stabbed—the father went into the beer-shop, and</p>

               <p>pointed out the prisoner—I asked him How he came to stab the prosecutor—he replied he could not tell through the confusion—I brought him out, and requested him to give me his knife, which he had open in his hand at the time—he said he would not, no b—policeman should take the knife from him—I took hold of him, and with the assistance of others succeeded in getting it from him with great difficulty—he exclaimed at the time we were getting it from him, "If I could get at the b—I would give it him worse," speaking of the prosecutor—we took him to the station-house—I produce the knife, it is a common pocket knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutor was brought to the hospital that night—I found a wound on the left side of the chest such as this knife would make—I examined it, and found it had penetrated the cavity of the chest between the fifth and sixth ribs—it was about two inches deep—I ordered him to be put to bed and bled—it was a very dangerous wound—inflammation came on, and he was in danger for more than a week—he continued in the hospital between a month or five weeks, I believe.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 9th of March, at seven o'clock, I was coming down the road, towards my master's house, and was about half a mile from the house - a man ran after me, and caught hold of me; I begged of him to let me alone; he said he would not - I said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't you may depend on it it will be worse for you;" he then let go - I went on a little way, and he laid hold of me again, and threw me down by the side of a ditch, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, if you speak again I'll murder you." He behaved very indecent to me; took up my clothes, and undid his own - I screamed out; he laid upon me, and endeavoured to posses himself of my person. Mr. Sandilands came up; he then got up and took my scarf, and ran away with it. I have seen him pass the house before, but never spoke to him. The prisoner is the man, I am certain of him. I saw him again on the Monday.</p>

            . I live at Southgate. On Sunday evening, the 9th of March, I was at home with my family - two young girls under fourteen years of age, came into the house about seven o'clock, and said there was a man murdering a woman below my house; I immediately went out with a candle, which I gave into their hands, and proceeded to the spot as fast as possible, and found the prisoner on the top of the prosecutrix in the ditch; I am sure it was him. I knew the prosecutrix before - I heard her cry in a faint voice, when I got within a short distance of her,</p>
               <p>"Oh! my father" - seeing him in that situation, I said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d rascal, what are you at," and in stooping down to lay hold of him he jumped up, stooped down, and took her scarf off the ground, and ran off; it lay close by her - she immediately jumped up, threw her arms round my neck, and cried,</p>
               <p>"Oh! my father," and fainted.

               <p>"You d - d<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090014"></xptr>rascal what do you do here;" he immediately jumped up, and I saw him take the scarf from her person - I am sure he took it from her person; he ran off, I pursued, and overtook him about a quarter of a mile off; he dropped the scarf in the way - I did not take it up.

I have nothing to say, but that I was drinking at the public-house all the afternoon, and got intoxicated - I could get no more beer at the house, and went to another, and stopped there till between seven and eight o'clock, came down the road, and met two lads, who said,</p>
               <p>"There is a woman going on before you, catch hold of her;" I went and caught hold of this woman, in a lark, not intending anything. My hat fell off, and my handkerchief fell out - I picked it up, and that is what they saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Robin Hood public-house, Church-lane. On the Monday before 4th November, the prisoner came with another person, who called for a pint of porter, and threw down half-a-crown—I took it up, bent it in a detector, found it was bad, and returned it to him, saying that I would forgive him that time, and he had better keep away for the future, as I was rather too good a judge for him—on Thursday, 4th November, he came alone, called for a pint of porter, and gave me a bad shilling; I bent it in two places, told him I had forgiven him once, but would not forgive him a second time; sent for a constable, and gave him in custody—he then offered me another shilling, but I would not take it.</p>

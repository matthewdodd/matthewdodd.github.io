            . I am a book-keeper to Mr. Wheeler, wine merchant, of Crutched Friar's. I was returning at a quarter-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 2d of January, and saw two men on a cart, which was loading in <placeName id="t18260112-40-crimeloc237">Cross-lane</placeName>

I watched them about three minutes, thinking they belonged to the cart - the prisoner was one of them; the carman came out and gave an alarm - one of them jumped out close before me, that was the prisoner, the other ran off - the carman stopped the prisoner; they were turning the hamper over in the cart, and putting it down; when he made the alarm, they had moved it about two yards towards the front of the cart; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house. I was within half a yard of them and cannot be mistaken.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. R. Cotton, of St. Mary's-hill, a cider and porter merchant. I hired a town cart to take some porter from my employer's - it was Thomas Clark's cart - Bailey drove it - the carman gave an alarm - I came up and found the prisoner in the carman's custody - he scuffled on the road to the watch-house; every thing in the cart was my master's; the prisoner was a stranger.</p>

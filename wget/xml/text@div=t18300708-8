On Monday, the 14th of June, I came home to dinner, and left the cottage at one o'clock; I locked my door, and put the key into my pocket - I fastened it with a padlock and chain, and left nobody at home: I left a fustian coat and a pair of breeches there - I came back about a quarter-past three o'clock, and found the chain down; the staple had been drawn: a person could then open the door and go in - I went in, and missed my coat and breeches; I saw the coat again a fortnight after: (examining it) this is my coat - it has a bit of green paint on it: I have had it twelve months - I am certain it is mine: I have not found the breeches.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WAKE. In June I was pot-boy at the Crown, in the parish of Hendon, about three miles and a half from Ewer's cottage. I saw the prisoner on Tuesday or Wednesday about the middle of June, in the tap-room; he and another man came into the tap-room about eleven o'clock: he had a fustian coat, which he offered to sell me for 1s. -I said it was of no use to me, but I did not mind giving him 1s. for it; I borrowed 1s., which I gave him for it, and afterwards sold it to Pepper; I am sure this is the one I bought of him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PEPPER. I am a sawyer, I was at work at the Crown, and bought a coat of Wake; I was afterwards taken up with it on my back - this is it.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARRINT. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner, and have the coat, which I got from Pepper; I asked the prisoner where he got it - he said a man gave it him to sell: I asked who the man was - he said he did not know him, and did not know where to find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it; I never saw the coat, and never sold it to the man in my life.[Monday, July 12.] <rs id="t18300708-8-verdict51" type="verdictDescription">

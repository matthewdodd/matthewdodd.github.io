                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Cottam and Hallen, in the stove and range-department. On 4th Nov., a man, who went by the name of James Nicholls, came and wished to look at a kitchen-range—I told him the price, and asked if he required fenders and fire-irons—he said, "Yes, you may as well send them"—he gave his address, Pigeon Mills, Stratford, and told me to send the range to the Old Bell, Holborn, the same afternoon—I ordered it to be sent—on 17th Nov. Rice came, and brought me this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Stratford Mills, 17th Nov.

I am, yours respectfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES NICHOLLS</hi>, Stratford Mills.")—I handed the letter over to Mr. Harrison, the manager of the department, knowing that it was a swindling transaction—I had heard something before—I kept Rice in conversation while a police<lb></lb>fire-irons to Stratford—he said, "Yes"—I had not read the letter at that time—he said he had a cart at the Old Bell, and he was going to take them there on the omnibus, and from thence home, in a covered cart—I supposed he meant Nicholls's cart—he was speaking of himself—I do not remember that he said anything about Nicholls—I did not open the letter—I handed it over to Mr. Harrison—he went back to the other part of the house with it, and left me with the prisoner—he was gone three quarters of an hour, I think, altogether—Rice went out, and said he would get a cup of coffee, as we said the fenders would take some little time to get ready—he went away, and came back in about ten minutes, and I kept him in conversation about the weather, and where he was going, as the police were not ready—I do not remember that he said for whom he was to take them—I understood they were for Nicholls, because he came from Mr. Nicholls—he said, when he first came in, that he had brought the note from Mr. Nicholls, of Stratford—I do not exactly recollect whether he said of Stratford, but I knew the man he meant—he said he brought the letter from Mr. Nicholls.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, a green-grocer, in Brewer-street, Somers-town. On 16th Nov. I went with him and Nicholls to the Loan-office in the New-road, and found a weighing-machine there—we bought it; I do not know for how much—I have the bill and receipt—I have not opened it—my father made the bargain—the machine was to weigh patatoes—my father is not here; he is ill.</p>

On Wednesday, 17th Nov., I packed up two fenders in a mat and delivered them to Rice at the door—he got upon the omnibus, and I put them up to him—I heard him say he was going as far as the City by that omnibus, and then by the mail to Ilford, and if the mail was gone he should go on by the <hi rend="italic">bus.</hi>

Cottam and Hallen—I did not find Rice there—I saw him afterwards—he went away by an omnibus, and took the fenders with him—I was in my uniform, but had clothing over it to conceal it—I went by the same omnibus—he got down at the bottom of Holborn Hill, ar the corner of Farringdon-street, and took the parcel of fenders to a public-house in Farringdon-street—it was then soon after seven o'clock—I waited outside for three hours—he came out about ten o'clock, brought the parcel, called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, put the parcel in, and he sat outside with the driver—I got another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and followed it—he went to 9, Charlton-street' Fitsroy-square—a female answered the door—he put the parcel inside—she took it away, and he went to a public-house at the corner of the street with the cabman—he stayed there more than an hour I think—the cabman went away—after some time Rice came out, and went into the house No. 9—I went away, and returned about seven o'clock in the morning—Rice came out about eight o'clock—I followed him to King's Cross—he had nothing with him—the prisoner Brown was waiting there—Rice joined him, and they returned to 9, Charlton-street—they remained there a short time, came out again toge<lb></lb>ther, and I followed them to Knightsbridge—they went into a public-house there—Brown came out alone—I followed him to Solane-square—he ran so fast there that I lost sight of Him—I do not think he saw me—I went back to the public-house, and watched outside—some tome afterwards Brown returned—they afterwards both came out together, and I followed them to Oxford-street—they went into a public-house at the corner of South Moulton-street—they came out, and crossed the road—I got assistance, and took them in charge about two o'clock—I told them they were given into my charge by Messrs. Cottam and Hallen, for obtaining goods under false pretences—they said nothing—I afterwards went to 9, Charlton-street, and found a fender, which I have shown to Cottom and Hallen's people—there is a Charlton-street, Somers-town, besides the one I speak of—I did not know either of the prisoners before—I did not see either of them about Charlton-street—I do not know who lived there.</p>

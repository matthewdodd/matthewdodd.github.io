This watch, chain, and key are mine (<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—I purchased the watch in May last at Mr. Thomas Hawley's, in the Strand—the whole cost me about fourteen guineas—I met the prisoner in Leicester-square about three weeks ago—I think it was three weeks last Saturday—he was at that time a stranger to me—he did not speak to me in the street, nor did I speak to him—he gave me to understand that I was to go home and he would follow me, but he did not speak—we did not speak till we got to the house together, which is on the other side of the square—</p>

               <p>we went to No. 3, Little St. Martin-street—I went in first—he followed me—I had never been there before—I suppose it was a house of ill fame—I knew by the appearance that it was a house of that description—the pri<lb></lb>soner went in at the door with me—he first spoke to me in the passage of the house—he spoke in French—I do not know what he said—I knew enough to know that it was French—we went up stairs—I believe we went up together, to the first floor front-room—it was a bed-room—it was then the middle of the day, about one or two o'clock—I had my watch at the time, and I laid it on the table—we remained in the room together about twenty minutes—there was not much conversation passed between us—he did not speak very much at all, but the little I said to him in English he understood, and in reply he could say, in English, "Yes," and "No," and "Very well"—these appeared to be proper answers, such as a person un<lb></lb>derstanding English would make—they appeared to be natural answers to my questions—from the manner in which he answered I understood that he was aware of the meaning of the words I used—he seemed to understand me—I do not remember that he said any thing particular in parting from me and leaving the room—I do not remember particularly what he did or said at the time he took leave of me—he said something in French and went down stairs—as soon as he had quitted the room I missed my watch, and called to the woman of the house to stop him, but he escaped—I gave in<lb></lb>formation, and a description of my watch and of the person, at the police-office at Scotland-yard—I also went to Mr. Hawley's house in the Strand, and stated that I had lost my watch—the next time I saw my watch was when the policeman brought it to me last Friday afternoon.</p>

I am the manager of the business of Mr. Smith, a watchmaker, No. 75, Strand—that is the shop known as Hawley's—the name is still up—I know this gold watch—I sold it to the prosecutrix in May last, and the key—this chain was bought subsequently—the price of the whole was about fourteen guineas—the prisoner called at the shop on the 13th of December, about half-past one o'clock, and from the descrip<lb></lb>tion I had had of him from Cambie, I noticed him—when he came in, he said in English, "Will you buy a watch?"—I said, "Yes," in my ordi<lb></lb>nary tone of voice—he had this watch in his hand, and on my saying so he</p>

               <p>laid it on the glass case—I asked him how much—he laid in English, "Twelve guineas"—in consequence of the information I had received, I opened the watch, looked at the number of it, and saw it was the one I had sold to the prosecutrix—I shut it, put it into my pocket, and went round and shut the shop-door—the prisoner immediately began to talk French very loudly, and attempted to get away—I stood behind the door—he spoke a great deal of French, and used his hands—he came to me, and tried to get me away from the door—I had no one in the shop, but I stamped my foot, and called for assistance, and two men came from the kitchen—I, sent one of them for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

               <p>"Whatever may be the system of the legislation of a country, the object of the law, as well as that of humanity, is the discovery of truth,—punish<lb></lb>ment to the guilty, acquittal for the innocent. In seeing a stranger appear before you, you will naturally inquire, and he himself feels the necessity of informing you, who he is, whence be comes, and what purpose brings him to a strange land. Who am I? I am the son of a Madame Ainot, a widow living with honour upon her own estate. I am the grandson of M. de la Mittaine, an old man of eighty, conducting for upwards of forty years, with credit to himself and his family, a manufactory of China. I am brother-in-law of M. Hebert, Deputy for the department of the Louvre, in the French parliament, Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, Advocate-ge<lb></lb>neral of the Court of Cassation.</p>
               <p>"The object of my coming to England was to embark with my wife and her cousin for the United States, where I am possessed of 3341 acres of land, in Virginia. During the last two months I have re<lb></lb>sided</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160084"></xptr>
               <p>in London, and lived there with the most rigid economy, never leav<lb></lb>ing my wife. I know of no balls, I frequent no taverns, I never even entered a place of theatrical entertainment. How comes it, then, Gentle-men, that I am brought before you? What fatality has placed me in this position? A person unknown to me causes my arrest, and throws me into a criminal court. A watch, a valuable watch is found in my possession, Is it for that reason I am to be considered a thief? No, gentlemen, I am the legitimate owner of that watch. My wife's cousin was detained in Germany, on account of some money transactions; she was anxiously ex<lb></lb>pected by us, day after day, for six weeks; every Thursday, every Sun<lb></lb>day found me at the place where the packet-boat from Rotterdam lands her passengers. Being one Sunday, about three weeks ago, as usual, at the Custom-house, waiting for the boat, I was accosted by a man who first of all showed me two razors; and after having in vain followed me in the hopes of persuading me to purchase them from him, he went away. The boat arrived, my cousin, alas! was not a passenger in it. I left the Custom-house. Again I was addressed by the same individual who had in one hand the two razors, and in the other a chain; he followed me, but my sole answer to his offers for sale was, 'No.' At last he drew forth this watch. I, struck by its beauty, asked, 'How much?' Not under<lb></lb>standing his answer, and unable to make him comprehend that I was deaf, I took from my pocket a sovereign, and said to him, "How much;" he lifted up both his hands. I answered, 'Five.' In directing his attention to the piece of money I held in my hand—to place in my hand the watch,—to demand the money I offered him—to possess himself of it, was the work of an instant. The celerity of his movements, the violence of his action, induced me to think myself duped; the examination of the watch, however, convinced me of the contrary, and then, indeed, the idea that it was the result of a theft came into my mind. However, strong in my own honesty, and relying upon my own credit, I kept the watch three weeks. The jeweller in his evidence has declared to you, that though the shop is kept by other persons, yet that the name over the door is the same as that ob<lb></lb>served on the watch; therefore a person conversant with the usual custom of jewellers could not have presented himself at the shop ignorant that he was with the maker of the stolen object. What was my conduct? I took the watch in my hand, and with the address inscribed upon it before me, I walked down the Strand, looking out for the maker. The name on a door attracted my attention, it is the same as that on the watch: I enter the shop, and handing him the watch, say, 'Will you buy?' Gentlemen, is this the conduct of a thief? Is this the manner in which a guilty man acts? I appeal to your consciences. During this time the jeweller tells you he was on the other side of the counter; during the time he examined the watch the door was open. I see the man who made the watch examine it anxiously; I see him examine it closely. Do I seize this opportunity to avail myself of the open door? Gentlemen, I attempt not to fly; yet you say I am the thief? Had I been guilty, my conduct would have been that of a madman; had I been the thief my actions must have been those of a fool. What! get into a snare, see myself entrapped, an escape open to me, make no attempt to escape; it is contrary to reason, it is at variance with common sense. Gentlemen, I attempt not to fly. Why? because I was not the thief. Who then presents herself before you to bring guilt home to me. You Charlotte Cambie; you who being with a man for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160085"></xptr>
               <p>twenty minutes, who having him in your arras, talking to him, perceive not that he is not deaf. He says no more to you than 'Yes'—'No'—'Very well'—and each answer appearing apropos. Gentlemen, is this credible? Has this the appearance of credibility? But, Gentlemen, for the space of five years I have been deaf. Here are the names of the medical gentlemen who have at<lb></lb>tended me: M. Haubert, prinipal surgeon to the hospital at Rouen, my native town; M. Ydard, of the Deaf Hospital, at Paris; M. de Larue, sur<lb></lb>geon, No. 8, Rue Blanch, Paris; Dr. Connut, physician, Paris; Dr. Wil<lb></lb>liski, Paris. These have been my medical men, yet I am thought not deaf, You have imagined that I have answered some remarks which you thought I had heard. Gentlemen, there is an evident mistake somewhere. Charlotte Camble says the man with whom she was, appeared to understand her; had him in her arms, she pressed him to her bosom, and she says he was not deaf. Can I then be that man?</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, does this woman swear I am he? Try her credibility. Tell her, under penalty of the loss of her goods, of the loss of her liberty, must take any number of men with whom she has been three weeks ago, and order her to declare the precise moment she was with each, the precise conversation she held, the exact position she was in. Could you, Gentlemen, if your property, your liberty were at stake, do this? Can you believe that it is possible for her to do it? No, Gentlemen, she cannot—she dare not. But to me more than property—more than liberty is at stake—my honour is in danger of being wounded—the honour of my family is in danger of being tarnished for ever—that which is dearer to me than property—that which is dearer to me than liberty—that which is dearer to me than life. Can she identify me as the person with whom she was? No, Gentlemen, you will not believe she can;—no, Gentlemen, I am not that man—I am no thief."</p>

I am a merchant, and live at Old Swan, On the 7th of April I came up from Gravesend by the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> steam-boat—when I went into the steam-boat I had a pocket-book with me, which contained a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the pocket-book had my address on it, "Mr. Thornton, 9, Old Swan"—soon after leaving the steam-boat, when I arrived in London, I missed the pocket-book and its contents—I went the next morning, and inquired, and offered 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for the book—I advertised it, and caused hand-bills to be put up, and stopped the notes at the Bank—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I caused to be traced to the prisoner.</p>

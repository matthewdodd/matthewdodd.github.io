                  </hi>. I am a collector, in the brewery of Messrs. Barclay and Perkins. On 10th Jan., I received an order from Mr. Gaman for a certain amount of copper—it is frequently the case that a man has a large quantity of copper which we cannot take away, and therefore we take a memorandum which it is my duty to deliver to Mr. Nash every Thursday—on 10th Jan., I received an order from Mr. Gaman for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 12th Jan., an order from Mr. Huggeth for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 17th Jan., one from Mr. Roberts for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I delivered them to Mr. Nash on the following Thursday.</p>

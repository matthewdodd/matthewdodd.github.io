On the 27th of February last, about twelve at night, I was going home; near Shoreditch turnpike I was accosted by a female; she requested me to give her something to drink. I went with her to the Robin Hood and Little John, Webb-square. The prisoner was in the room when I went in. She was not the person that I went there with. I treated them with a glass of gin and water. I then came away with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070081"></xptr>the young woman that accosted me. The prisoner followed me; she pressed me to go to her apartment.

As soon as I went into the room, I felt myself alarmed; I found it was an uninhabited place. I felt my watch go out of my pocket. The prisoner put the candle out. I said, you have robbed me of my watch and my handkerchief. I catched hold of the prisoner; she knocked the light out. She said, she did not care, the other woman had taken my watch. The other woman made her escape.</p>

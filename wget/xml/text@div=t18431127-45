                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at St. George's Hospital. On the 15th of Oct., at nine o'clock in the evening, I was called to a person named Hugh Riley, who had been brought into the hospital—his body was paralyzed—he continued under my care until the morning of the 28th, when he died—I examined the body, and found a fracture of the bones of the neck—the neck had been broken—it was impossible to say how it had been caused—it would be most likely from (he spine being doubled as it were, body bending on the head—a fall down stairs might occasion it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 29, Greenfield-street, Commercial-road. On Wednesday, 7th Jan., about 9 o'clock in the morning, I went to the house of Mary Ann Kirwin, 106, New Gravel-lane, Shadwell—I remained all day, and till 1 or 2 on next morning—Mary Ann Kirwin and her servant went to bed, and about 2 in the morning two Spaniards came to the house, and two young women with them—the prisoner is one of the men, the other man was taller and stouter than the prisoner—I did not know the two women—they did not remain with them, they left immediately—I did not hear them speak before they left—I knew the deceased, James Almon—I had seen him about a week before—he was sitting on a chair by the side of the fireplace, in the parlour, when the Spaniards came in, that was the room into which the Spaniards came—Mary Ann Kirwin and Ann Copans were in bed there—a woman named Mary Ann Smith, who lived in the house with the deceased, was there—Margaret Donovan was up stairs, and Emily Willis came up—a man named James Weipperman was up stairs—he came down after the circumstance took place—as soon as the two women who had accompanied the Spaniards went away, the Spaniards spoke together, and the prisoner's companion gave Emily Willis two sixpences, and said, "Drink"—pointing to a glass standing on the drawers—Willis did not go out, but she gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I went and fetched gin and beer, and placed it on the table—the prisoner's companion handed the gin out—he gave me a glass first, which I refused—it was banded to all who were in the room—it was offered to the deceased, but he did not drink any, he moved his hand and shook his head—the Spaniards drank some, and after that they got up and spoke together in their own language—they went into the passage, and remained there not above two minutes—I was in the parlour—the street door and parlour door</p>

               <p>were open—I heard some knives open—there had bees no quarrel or dis<lb></lb>turbance before that—I said, "They are opening knives"—they were stand<lb></lb>ing with their backs against the passage, with the knives In their hands, opposite the parlour door—they had each a knife—the prisoner's companion's knife was larger and broader—they spoke to themselves—the landlady told me to call "Police!"—I was then standing up in the parlour—I went out of the street door and called "Police!"once, and was going to Call again, when the prisoner came and dragged me in by the hair of the head, and held the knife in his other hand—I made a stoop, and got out of his hand into the parlour—it was in the passage that he had me by the hair—I said, "Good gracious, Mary, get out of bed, or they will stab you"—they were then both standing just by the parlour door—Mary Kirwin get out at the foot of the bed, and just as she came into the middle of the room, she was going to open the window—the window looks into the street—the deceased rose from his chair, I think he was going to the drawers, they were both standing against the door, and the prisoner went so, with his knife (<hi rend="italic">striking downwards</hi>) and struck it right into Mr. Almon's stomach—he cried out, and fell backwards—he rose again, turned over, and fell down again—he had nothing but a pipe in his hand at the time he was stabbed—the Spaniards ran away directly—I ran after them—I did not see the other one at all afterwards, but I saw the prisoner was turned the corner of Farmer-street—I cried out, "Stop that man, he has just stabbed another," and followed him, when another man joined in the pursuit—I saw him come back with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Mary Ann Smith trying to prevent the prisoner from going away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when they were standing up against the door she put her hand up, and he pushed her down between the table and drawers—I do not know what she was trying to do—I thought she was trying to prevent him from using the knife which he had in his hand—she stood up, I do not know what to do, and directly she stood up he put up his hand and she went back in the chair—she had her hand up—she was not between the prisoner and the door—Almon was in front of the door, between the prisoner and the door—Weipperman was with his back towards the fireplace—Willis and Smith were both in the room—Kirwin and Copas were in bed, and Margaret Donovan was sitting on the foot of the bed—Smith was trying to prevent the prisoner from doing something, and Almon was standing before the door; that was when they were calling "Police!"through the window—Smith was not swearing at them at all—I did not hear any bad words used, for I and Mary Ann Kirwin were calling "Police!" out of the window—I was not in the Com<lb></lb>mercial-road that night—I really do not recollect being there; I cannot swear I was not—I cannot recollect—I think I was in the Commercial-road that night about some clean clothes, but I really cannot recollect—I should have had to go to Mrs. Bagley's, 29, Greenfield-street, for the clothes—I should have to come out of the Highway down Cannon-street, and then into the Com<lb></lb>mercial-road—it is not very far down the Commercial-road—I really cannot recollect whether I went there that night or not; if I was, I was there and back before the stabbing—I really cannot recollect whether I went for the linen that night or not—if I went it was early in the evening, about 8 o'clock—I did not stop long—this occurred about half past 2 in the morning—I will swear I was not in the Commercial-road at 1; I am certain of that—I was not out of the house or in the streets, no further than next door—I was not out in the street at all at 1—I may have been to Roberts's, the chandler's shop, next door but one, but no further—I cannot say that I did go there—I</p>

                  </hi>. I did live at 106, New Gravel-lane; I have left it; I lived there at the commencement of Jan.; it is a brothel; I kept the house. I had some girls living in the house—they were Mary Ann Smith, Margaret Donovan, Emily Willis, and Sarah Slater, and Ann Copas, who was the servant—Slater was not a prostitute, nor yet Copas—Slater is my cousin—to the best of my recollection, Slater had been staying at my place about three weeks, since she left her place—I let her remain at my place till she got another situation—she had been living at my house three weeks prior to 8th Jan.—she slept there every night, in the same bed with me and Copas—I knew James Almon, he was a seafaring man—he came to my house on the Sunday night as this happened on the Thursday—he boarded at Mr. Bell's boarding house, but came to my house to sleep with Smith each night—on Thursday morning, 8th Jan!, about 2 o'clock, I was in bed with Copas—Mary Ann Smith, Slater, and Willis, were in the room, and Margaret Donovan came down into the room—I remember the time of the two foreigners coming into the house—I was then in bed with Copas—Slater was sitting on a stool close to the fireplace—Emily Willis was sitting on the side of the bed—Almon was sitting on the left hand side of the fireplace, and Smith was sitting opposite him—there was no other person in the room at the time the</p>

               <p>two Spaniards came in—I did not see them come in till I beard the two young girls come into the parlour along with them—I saw the girls who came into the parlour with them—I did not know them; neither of them were any of my girls—they wanted beds for the night—I said I had none; my beds were all engaged; I had only beds for my own lodgers—upon that the two girls went away—the Spaniards still stopped there—seeing other girls in the room, they were laughing at them—that was in the parlour—there were two candles burning on the table—one of the Spaniards, the one that is not here, took a candle off the table, turned round to the drawers, and took a glass off the drawers, and made motions to his mouth that he wanted some<lb></lb>thing to drink—he gave Emily Willis two sixpences—she gave them to Slater, and Slater went and fetched half a pint of gin and a pot of beer—after she was gone, the prisoner's companion went up stairs with Smith—the prisoner still remained in the parlour, talking to Emily Willis, by the side of the bed—Smith and the Spaniard were up stairs about three minutes, to the best of my recollection—nothing passed in the parlour after they left the room, further than the prisoner's speaking to Emily Willis, and the liquor and beer was placed on the parlour table, and the prisoner went up stairs to Mary Ann Smith—he was not above a minute up stairs before they came down—what was said up stairs, or what passed between them, I cannot say—he came down first, I believe, and his companion and Mary Ann Smith came down afterwards—Sarah Slater bad returned with the drink at this time, and it was standing on the table—there was no appearance of displeasure or anger at the time they came down stairs—they began to serve the gin out—it was handed all round to the persons who were in the room—we all partook of it, all but James Almon; he would not take the glass—it was offered to him by the prisoner's companion—he was a much taller man than the prisoner—Almon refused it, and the Spaniard turned the glass upside down on the table, and spilled what was in it on the table—it was a glass without a foot to it—he did it intentionally—Almon was then sitting in a chair by the parlour fire, where he first remained.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you observe whether any displeasure was expressed by either of the Spaniards at the time Almon refused the gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner was sitting on a chair by the bedside, and he got up and stamped his foot at the parlour door, and they both went out and said a word or two to them<lb></lb>selves in their Own language—I could not hear in what tone of voice they spoke, he seemed quite angry, he stamped his foot several times—to the best of my recollection they were talking in the passage outside the door about three minutes—at the lime the drink was handed round, Margaret Donovan was sitting on the side of the bed, she had come down stairs—after the Spaniards had been out in the passage they drew their knives, each of them opened a knife—Slater hallooed to me, and said, "Mary Ann, those men are opening their knives"—I said, "You run out of the door and get a police<lb></lb>man"—she went to the door, and she was pulled in by her hair, and thrown light into the middle of the room, I do not know by which of the Spaniards, I was in such a confusion; I was still in bed—the prisoner then came to the side of the bed, threw the bed curtain on one side, and held his knife over me—Slater said, "Mary, Mary, get out of bed, he has got his knife over you, get out of bed or else you will be stabbed, and I got out of bed and <hi rend="italic">creeped</hi> down by the side of the wall—I saw something in his hand, but he held it with the blade down so, Almon was still sitting by the fire in the same chair where he had been all along, be never moved off it at all; he had a small cane in his hand, and he kept burning it in the fire, playing with it,</p>

               <p>and never turned his head round to notice what anybody was doing in the room—when I got out of bed, I ran and threw open my window, and before I got to it to open it, Almon got up to go to the drawers to get a pipe off, and before I had time to get to the window, the prisoner stabbed Almon, just by the side of the bed—I did not see what he stabbed him with—the bed comes close up to the door, the foot of the bedstead comes over the doorway—he was not quite a yard from the door at the time he was stabbed—the prisoner stood on his left, and the other on his right—they were a deal nearer to the door than Almon—the drawers stand against the wall, about half a yard from the door—it is a small room—there had not been any quarrelling in my room that night, not a word occurred from any one of the parties—I did not hear the Spaniards talk at all in English to anybody—the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">romancing</hi> in his talk to Emily Willis—I could not understand it, she was laughing—she can talk German, and she kept talking a few words in her language, (German), but I do not think he could understand it—after Almon was stabbed he fell to the ground—I ran immediately to the window and pulled the Venetian blind down, and threw open the shutters—the prisoner's com<lb></lb>panion was nearest to the door, he ran first and the prisoner ran afterwards—Almon was taken from my house to the hospital—I did not go to the hospital to see him.</p>

               <p>assaulted her—that is the only thing since April—I was not tried on any other occasion, except in April, not since April—before that I was, eight years ago, that was the first time, that was on a charge of a gentleman's watch—I had six months for that, it was a charge of robbery—that was in the City—I was then on the streets—those are the only times; I was never convicted only those times—I have been in prison for assaults and <hi rend="italic">rows</hi>, and that like, I am sure I cannot tell you how many times.</p>

Early that morning the prisoner and another man came there with two girls—I had not known either of them before—I was standing at the door when they came in—there were a great many in the room—Mary Ann Kirwin, Ann Copas, Margaret Donovan, Mary Ann Smith, a German, and Sarah Slater—Almon was sitting by the fireplace in the same room—he was sitting there when they came in—the two girls asked for a bed—mistress told them she had no beds, and the two girls left the house directly—the prisoner and the other man remained—the other man gave me two sixpences to get some drink—I gave them to Slater, and she brought in the drink—the prisoner's companion went up stairs with Smith—he was not up there many minutes—the prisoner went up stairs after him, and they came down together, and Smith with them—they then poured the drink out, and we all drank except Almon—he refused taking the glass—I did not hear a word said by him or any one else at the time—Almon got up and offered the prisoner's companion a chair—he refused taking it—he said, "No," and nodded his head—I could not understand what they said, because they spoke in their own language—they then went out into the passage, and opened their knives—I could see into the passage—the room and the passage is very nearly in one—they were not many minutes in the passage—I think about five or ten minutes—I could not say how long, for I was so frightened—they then came into the parlour with the knives opened—Mary Ann Kirwin was in bed with Ann Copas—the prisoner held the bed curtains up, and held the knife over Kirwin—Slater said, "For God's sake get out of bed or you will be stabbed," and Mrs. Kirwin got out at the foot of the bed and said to Slater, "Go for a policeman, for they mean some mischief"—she went to go for a policeman, and the prisoner took her by the hair of her head, dragged her in, and held the knife over her—Almon was in the room when this took place—he did not do anything, he was a <hi rend="italic">sky-larking</hi> with Mary Ann Smith for the cane—he got up from his chair to get his pipe from off the drawers, and the prisoner stabbed him, and he immediately fell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had there been any previous quarrelling between Almon and the prisoner, or his companion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, there were no words, not in the least: to the best of my belief they were strangers to one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">sky-larking</hi>, as you call it, was between Mary Ann Smith and Almon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he had the cane, and was playing with it—the cane is not here—I have seen it since—it is burnt at the end—I believe they have got it at the house—it was not a cane that was occasionally used as a poker—he was playing with it in the fire, and <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with Mary Ann—Mary Ann had been up stairs to go to bed with the Spaniard, but he would not pay her beforehand—the prisoner asked me to go to bed with him, but I would not, for I was very ill; I had been very bad in the house for about two hours before—we did not go into the back room together—I did not move out of the front room—he asked me to go to bed with him—he could speak a little—he said, "Bed"—that was while his companion was up</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, if a man came in with one of you girls, and Mrs. Kirwin was there, would you let him go out without paying? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Let him go out without paying! certainly, the man could walk out, I could not hinder him, I should not try.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say you were not all trying to prevent him from going out before he had paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not try to go out till he had committed the murder—I did not get any money from either of them, except the shilling—I can swear that—I got that from the prisoner's companion—it was two sixpences—I had my gown off, I was going to my bed, as I was very bad, I had a shawl round me—I did not take my gown off while the prisoner was there, but before—I did not take my shawl off while the prisoner was there—I can swear that—I had my shawl on, and my petticoats on—I say that Almou got up to get his pipe, because I saw him do so—he went to reach his hand over to get at it, as the prisoner stabbed him—I cannot say whether he reached over with the hand that had the cane in it—he had the cane out of his hand then—I swear that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had your companion, Smith, been out that night at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she had been at home a good bit, I should say about an hour and a half—I saw Weipperman there—he came down after Margaret Donovan—that was before Almon was stabbed—I cannot say whether he had a poker in his hand—I believe he took the poker up—he was by the fireplace at the time—that was at about the same time that Almon was reaching his pipe—Weipperman put the poker down again, I believe—I did not see him take the poker at all.</p>

                  </hi>. On 8th Jan. I was at this house in Gravel-lane—I came home between twelve o'clock and half-past—I saw the two foreigners come to the house with two strange girls—I did not know either of the girls—I was sitting in the parlour on the right hand side of the drawers—there were no beds for the Spaniards—I was <hi rend="italic">sky-larking</hi> with Almon—I took his pipe from the table and placed it on the drawers—he was sitting by the fire, by the bedstead—he was doing nothing, only speaking—we were playing with one another—I put the pipe on the drawers—he asked me to give it him, and I would not—when the girls left the house the two Spaniards remained about half an hour in the parlour—I saw Slater go out for the drink—while she was gone I went up stairs, and the prisoner's companion followed me up—I went into a bed-room, and he agreed to give me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to stop with me for the night—he offered to pay me the money in the morning—he said, "No, not <hi rend="italic">fore</hi> morning"—he could talk better English than the prisoner—I said I would not go to bed with him—the prisoner then came up, and called him—the door was open—they spoke in a foreign language, and we then came down stairs together—the prisoner and his companion were very cross together—I came down to the parlour—I was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, at the furthest in the room with the prisoner's companion—no connection had taken</p>

               <p>THOMAS DAY. On the 14th of February, I took a coach at Charing-cross, the prisoner drove it. I sat on the box with him; he drove me to Westminster-bridge, I ordered him to turn and drive to Chandos-street. I was not sober. We got down at the wine vaults at the corner; but before this, we were in the Ship, public-house, and I felt a hand in my breeches pocket. We went again to the Ship and stopped there. I called for two half-pints of pearl. I asked his demand, he said a guinea, but as I had been good to him, a 1 l. note would satisfy him. I took three 1 l. notes from my breeches pocket, which I deposited with the landlady; she gave the prisoner 1 l., and returned them to me: she put them into my breeches-pocket. I went into the tap-room; I again found his hands in my pocket; I felt, and told the landlord my money was missing, he felt, and it was gone; the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"it cannot be gone, let me feel." He took the two notes from his own pocket, and put them into mine, then took them out, and put them on the table; the landlord put them again into my pocket, and went to look for a friend to take me home, and during that time, the prisoner went away. The landlord returned, I told him my notes were gone. When I first went out, I had eight 1 l. notes, and 18 s., I changed two notes, and lost six. I felt his hand in my pocket twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. - Q. Did not you give him two notes. - A. No, nor did he give change for a note. I took the coach at nine o'clock, and kept it till half-past ten. I recollect very well what passed, after I got to Chandos-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARKER. On the 14th of February, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner drove to my door, (the <placeName id="t18210214-122-crimeloc753">Ship, in Chandos-street</placeName>

I advised him to go home, as he was rather tipsy; he asked the prisoner his demand; he said it ought to be a guinea, but a pound would do. Day gave my wife three notes; she gave the prisoner one, and returned the rest - he put them in his pocket. I went out and took the number of his coach, as I thought he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140048"></xptr>charged more than he ought. When I returned, Day missed his notes: I also felt and missed them - the prisoner felt, and pretended to find them; he produced them; I put them into the prosecutor's pocket - he sent me for a friend - when I returned he missed them again.</p>

            . On the 14th of February, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Church-lane, Strand, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and found the prisoner in bed; and in his breeches pocket I found three 1 l. notes, which I produce.</p>

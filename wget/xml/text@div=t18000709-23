               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This pie she had left to be asked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she been a customer of your father's? - A. She never bought any bread; she has come with pies and puddings to bake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I said to Mrs. Dean, I have a great desire for a new loaf, and I took it; I was with child, and miscarried at Clerkenwell prison; I told her I should take it.</p>
               <p>Dean. I was within hearing all the while, and she said no such thing; she was talking to my mother about the expence of a gooseberry pie while she was taking the loaf; my mother was in the bake-house at the time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Wallis, a grocer in the Mint, on the 3d of June I went to the company's warehouse for two chests of hyson tea; Mr. Viney was the broker, and I believe about two in the day I got the two chests of tea, he shewed me the chests, and I put them in the cart, when I came to the corner of Fenchurch-street I asked Gregory if he would take his chest of tea, the prisoner was no accquaintance of mine; I took it up an alley by his desire, and put it in a room, I do not know what mark there was upon the chest, I objected to carry the chest of tea up the alley, because I did not know that I had any business to carry it, and he told me he would give me some beer, we drank a pot of beer, and I let him ride as far as Mr. Saxelby's in the Borough; I know nothing more.</p>

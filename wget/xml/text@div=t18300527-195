            . I am a broker, and live in Cumberland-street, Middlesex-hospital. On the 26th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered a quantity of linen for sale; I told her to take them away - she refused to leave the shop several times, and said if I would not have them the pawnbrokers should; she was quite drunk - I followed her from my shop to Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square, when I met a Police-man, and gave her into custody; he is too ill to come here - she said if I would give her money for refreshment or to get a lodging, she would come for the things next day.</p>

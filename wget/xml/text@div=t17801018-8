He said they had been offered for sale to him. I went with other officers to, I think it is, the Black Horse in Aldersgate-street. I went down the yard. I asked which stables the horses were in which were for sale; the stables were shewn me; there was a padlock upon the door. The horse-dealer took two men with him to go after Johnson; the prisoner Johnson's wife was in the yard. I asked where her husband was? She said she did not know rightly. I went with her to her lodgings; then she said her husband was in company with one

I went the next morning to look after the four-year-old horse; I booked him in Mr. Johnson's name. Mr. Brown gave me an order to book him at sixteen guineas; at Beaver's repository he wanted to book him at twenty pounds; I said he was not worth above sixteen pounds. I took him to the Repository.</p>
               <p>Was he sold there? - No. I had seen the hand-bill, so I sent a letter into the country to Mr. Crow; he came to London, and when he saw the horses he swore to them.</p>

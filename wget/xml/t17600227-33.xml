               <p>M. Savage. I saw what was in it yesterday; the man that was to bring it to me came and told me it was taken out of the cart as he was bringing it from the inn, and said that the man who took it was in custody.</p>

I went directly to inquire, and found that the trunk was retaken, and the prisoner sent to the compter.</p>

            . Mr. Wickham delivered this trunk to me, desiring me to take care of it, and deliver it safe to the lady.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you read the direction?</p>
               <p>Brown. I have [he reads it again.] This is the same trunk, it was pack'd up in the cart. There was some salmon brought up by the Gloucester coach as well as this trunk. I was sent to Billingsgate with the salmon, and then to carry this trunk to Bishopsgate Street. We put it up in the cart between two salmon baskets, so that it could not fall out. Going along Cheapside, at the hither end of the Poultry, on the left-hand side, a man came from the other side of the way, and look'd into the cart. My master's son was leading the horse, and I had a candle and lanthorn. I look'd at him with my light, but took no notice, looking very sharply after the cart. Just as we came opposite to Walbrook, or the Mansion-house, there stood a carriage. I kept along the path-way with my lanthorn in my hand, and going to look at the cart behind, I saw the same man pulling at the trunk; he gave three tugs at it, got it out, and carried it three or four yards. I hallow'd out, and he let it drop against my right leg, by which means I tumbled down, and the man ran away. I called out, Stop thief, and a young man who was coming by followed the man round the Mansion-house. The prisoner was stop'd somewhere by Lombard Street, and brought to me at the cart, and the people said it was the best way to lodge him in the compter till the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man who took the trunk out of your cart?</p>
               <p>Brown. To the best of my knowledge he is the man; I went with him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man's face when you saw him behind the cart?</p>
               <p>Brown. I did, and took notice of it, not only when I saw him pulling at the trunk, but also when he look'd into the cart; as soon as the prisoner was brought to me I said, this is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you believe this to be the man?</p>
               <p>Brown. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not doubt my being the man, when you first came among the people to see me?</p>
               <p>Brown. I went up to him directly, and laying hold of his collar said, this is the man that took the trunk out of the cart; I made no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. When I was before the alderman, had you no doubt then?</p>
               <p>Brown. No.</p>

            .

               <p>Q. How do you know they had hold of the right man?</p>

            . Last Tuesday night, about the hour of nine, as I turn'd the corner of Bearbinder Lane to come to the Mansion-house, I heard some people cry Stop thief, and saw them come running as fast as they could. The man that ran first went through Dove Court, and there they lost him. I followed him, crying Stop thief, stop thief, all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose fight of him?</p>
               <p>Cockeril. No, I did not; when we were both in Lonbard Street, he went to cross the way, and as he was crossing, a young man stop'd him, and I said hold of his coat; the people went by the end of the court when he ran up it, and so missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same man?</p>
               <p>Cockeril. He is; he cry'd, and in the Jews Ianguage said, Pray, pray let me go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That witness is the same man that laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nash, one of the Lord-mayor's marshal's men. I heard Mr. Harrison give a different account from what he has now; if you please to swear me, I will repeat it.</p>
               <p>He is sworn.</p>
               <p>Nash. Harrison declared on the prisoner's examination, that the prisoner was the very man, that he saw him taking the box out of the cart, and knew him to be the very man as soon as he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrison. Did you say as this witness has said?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I said before the alderman, I did not know whether he was the man or not, I believed he might be the man.</p>
               <p>Nash. He said he was the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrison. When he was taken, was he out of breath?</p>
               <p>Harrison. No, he was not; before the alderman I said I believed he was the man.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday morning I went out with my bag, I deal with several pawnbrokers, and coming home between five and six o'clock, I met one of our people* with a bag of cloaths over his shoulder; I asked him what he had got, and he said he had a parcel of cloaths that would suit me; he pitched them at the Bull and Gate in Holbourn, and I bought them of him for 3 l. I put some in his bag, and some in mine, and we walked to Snow Hill, where we met a person of our acquaintance. We tied the two bags together, and he carried them home. Then we went to the sign of the Cock on Snow Hill, I paid him, and we sat there about two hours. At a little after eight we were coming along the city, a little higher than the Mansion-house; I staid to buy something of a woman, and he walk'd along, thinking I should follow him. As I got to the Mansion-house I heard the cry of Stop thief. Several people ran, and I ran after them, and I saw my partner run as well as the rest. I ran round the Mansion-house, with several before and several behind me, there might be near 50 people. I was running up again, in order to go into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270031"></xptr> Lombard Street, thinking my partner might be there, and was not got a yard out of the alley when a gentleman laid hold of me and said I must stop you, there is a cry of Stop thief. I said, you are mistaken in the person, when up came several butchers and said, here is a Jew thief. They pulled me this way and that way, and when the man that had lost the box came up they said to him, that is the man; said he, I believe he is, and they would not let me say one word more. One of them swore I had a blue coat on, and I had a brown one. I have been an industrious young fellow ever since I was twelve years of age. I return about 50 l. every week, and sometimes 300 l. a month; there is never a dealer in London but what knows me.</p>

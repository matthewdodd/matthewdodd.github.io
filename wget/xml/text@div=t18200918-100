            . I bought the mare of the prisoner about the middle of May; he brought her to me in Euston-mews, Euston-square, and asked for a man named Moore. I asked if the mare was for sale, he said Yes; and asked 6 l. for her, which I gave him after I had been to Jenkins to see if he would buy her. I am sure the prisoner is the person. He said he was a cow-keeper, and lived in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. When was it - A. I think it was on the 24th of May, it was about a week before Epsom Races. I believe after he was taken, the Magistrate allowed him two days liberty to find the man he said he bought it of.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of September, in Sweet Apple-court. I told him not to hurry himself, but to say how he became possessed of the mare. He said he swapped a poney for her at Blackheath-fair. He said he did not think he should know the man again. I then asked him if any witness was by. I told him not to hurry himself; he said he believed not; No. He said Slaughter sold her for him. He was examined next day, and told the Magistrate two Jews were present when he bought her.</p>

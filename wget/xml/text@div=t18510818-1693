                  </hi>. I am a firewood-cutter, and live at 4, King's Head-court, Shoreditch. I have known the prisoner nine or ten years—there had been quarrels between us, and I had been bound over to keep the peace—on Sunday, 27th July, I saw the prisoner in Red Lion-court—I asked him whether his wife would give me the handkerchief that she had of mine—he said, "No, instead of having the handkerchief he would have my life, that I was his victim, and before two days went over my head he would have my life"—on the Tuesday following, 29th, I was sitting in the court in a chair with my hands on my knees, and he came and struck me in the breast; I did not see him till he struck me—I could not say what he struck me with—I saw a pair of scissors taken out of his hand—he said that I was his victim—he took hold of the hair of my head, dragged me across the court, and struck me two or three times in the back—the people surrounded him—I was taken away.</p>

On 29th July, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in Red Lion-court and saw Jones with a pair of scissors in his hand, having hold of Bates by his hair—I took the scissors out of his hand and threw them away—they were like these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not see him strike Bates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of New North-road Hoxton. I was sent for, and examined Bates—I found considerable hemorrhage from a punctured wound at the angle of the left scapula, it was about a quarter of an inch deep—the back of his shirt was completely wetted with blood—I also found a slight scratch on the breast—the wounds were not dangerous—these scissors would inflict them.

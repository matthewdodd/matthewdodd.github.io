                  </hi> I am the wife of Timothy Tormey, of No. 1, Glass-house-fields, Shadwell. On the 29th of May I and my husband slept at the prisoner's father's, at No. 8, Charles-place, Shadwell—we went to bed about eleven o'clock at night—the prisoner's father and mother came home after twelve—their room was next mine—I heard them quarrelling—I and my husband spoke about it to one another—my husband asked me what was the matter—on that the prisoner's mother came to the door—the prisoner then came to the door—he did not usually sleep in the house—he called for my husband to go outside the door, and called him a cowardly rascal—I fastened the door to prevent my husband going out, or the prisoner coming in—on that the prisoner went out into the front of the house—I raised up my win<lb></lb>dow and begged him to go and have peace—he <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> up a brick and struck me in the forehead, and I was stunned—I fell senseless—I do not know what happened afterwards—he threw it at me—I was taken to the London Hospital, and stopped there six months—the wound has not healed at present—there were two flower-pots on the window-sill—I did not throw them at the prisoner—I never offended him in my life, nor has my husband that I know of—he was in the room all the time—while I was at the hospital, there was a piece of brick taken from my forehead—I have it in my pocket—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital when the prosecutrix was brought there on the 30th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon—she had a wound in her forehead—it might have been made by a brick—it was a lacerated wound, and a very severe one—some pieces of brick were taken out of the external surface—the frontal bone was driven into the cells of the bone itself—it was a dangerous wound—she was in great danger for some time, and is not well yet—I think it is likely to do permanent injury to her brain—her memory is very bad now—the prisoner's father was very much injured also, and was in great danger—I scarcely knew which patient I should lose first, the prisoner's father or the prosecutrix—his scalp was lacerated six or seven inches—I have heard that it was done with a sauce<lb></lb>pan, or something of that kind—we have a great many of these cases at our hospital.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put it a written defence, stating that the present charge was preferred by the prosecutrix's husband in revenge for having been committed for two months for an assault on the prisoner's father, whom he had dangerously injured, as well as himself.</hi>)</p>

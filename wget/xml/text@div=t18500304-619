                  </hi>. I am a laundress at Kensal New Town. I have employed the prisoner between two and three years—I discharged her about a month before I was before the Magistrate—on 5th March, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I went to her house with Crittall, and there found one of my customer's chemises, and a pair of sugar-tongs, three collars, a plate, and a handkerchief, my own property—I had sent the shift with some other linen, belonging to the same person, home in the cart by the prisoner.</p>

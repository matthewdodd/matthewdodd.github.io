             was convicted at the last Sessions of stealing them; I was present at the trial: On the 29th I went to Ducking-pond-lane, and looked through a hole into the stable, we saw the two pigs immediately; the stable belonged to the prisoner, as I understood; I knew them to be my pigs; I went off immediately to the Public-office, Lambeth-street, leaving two persons that were with me there; I thought two officers back with me, Nowland and Osmand; before I came back, Mr. Special had let these two persons in to see the pigs; the officers took the pigs into their care.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any difficulty in getting into the premises? - A. No.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WATKINS sworn. - I live in New Gravel-lane; I saw Allen going up the lane with two pigs; I told him he had stole the pigs: Next morning, Sunday, the 29th, I went to Mr. Blackling, and asked him if he had lost them, and he said, yes; after dinner I went with him to Ducking-pond-lane, to Mr. Special's premises; there was a stable with a boarded partition, and there was a small hole about seven feet high that I could look over; I looked through the hole, and saw the same two pigs; Blackling then went for an officer; I staid by the premises walking backwards and for wards, and I saw Mr. Special throw up the window; I said, Mr. Special, you have got a couple of pigs upon your premises that are not your property; says he, how do you know they are not my property; says I, because I know the man that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200009"></xptr>belong to, the pigs were stolen last night; well, says he, I don't know, I have got a couple of pigs in my stable, I don't know who they belong to, a man brought them here last night; but, says he, you may go and look at the pigs if you like; we walked down the yard, and they were locked up; Mr. Special called to the girl to bring the key, and he unlocked the door; he asked me if I knew the pigs; I told him, yes; Mr. Blackling's man said, they were his master's pigs, he would swear to them: he said a man had brought them there last night; says he, I think I know where to find him, we will go and take him; I said, Mr. Blackling is gone for an officer; he said, I am an officer myself; then the officers came, and we went and took Allen.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know that he came before the Magistrate the next day, to give evidence against Allen? - A. I saw him there, I don't know how he got there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him into custody? - A. He promised the officer to appear the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Special give the same account before the Magistrate that you-have given of what he said then? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Allen brought two pigs to me on the Saturday night, and told me he had them from on board a ship, and said he should be very much obliged to me to let them stay upon my premises till be could build a stye for them, and being a neighbour, I let him.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN NOWLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was sent for to go to Mr. Special's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he offer to take up Allen? - A. He had him in custody at the Weavers' Arms when I went to take him; I took his word to appear the next day before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell the same story before the Justice that he told Mr. Blackling? - A. Yes.</p>

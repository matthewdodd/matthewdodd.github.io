               <p>Q. Well, but you say two men pinned Vickers against the shutters? A. Yes; but when they saw they were watched, the money dropped on the pavement, and one ran away, saying to the other, "Do not be a b-fool" - they were both pinning the prosecutor against the shutters - the other was brought back, who I believe to be the prisoner.</p>

On the night of Sunday, the 1st of June, I was in Brick-lane, coming from the Black Swan, Brown's-lane - I had been to two public-houses, and had something to drink - I was rather drunk; but I knew what I was about - on going down Brick-lane, between twelve and one o'clock, when I got to the corner of Spicer-street, I saw a man cross over from the other side of the way - he came up to me and struck me on my two hands - that was not the prisoner; it was the man who is gone away - I know him perfectly well by sight, but I have not seen him since - I should know him, if I saw him - the same man then struck me on my cheek-bone, near my eye - he then put his two hands in my waistcoat pockets - he was alone then - I called for the police, when his hands were in my pockets - a shilling dropped from me when he left me - some persons came up during the time the shilling dropped, as he was leaving me - soon after that I saw policeman, H 53 - I told him I had been robbed; and picked up a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only seen one man then? A. At the time I picked up the shilling, I saw several men running; but I saw nobody till I picked up the shilling - at the time the man put his hands in my pocket, there was only one man there - policeman H 53 conducted me back part of the way to the station-house, and the rest of the way I went by myself - I did not want assistance - he took me there as being the prosecutor - I had given him the shilling - I had 15s. in my right hand waistcoat pocket - I lost 10s. out of that sum - I had not put my hand in my pocket since I had received that money, which was a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning - I had 3s. paid me during the day, which I spent the greatest part of at a public-house, at the corner of Booth-street - that 3s. was in half-pence, and in my coat pocket - I had felt my money in my waistcoat pocket three quarters of an hour before I was robbed - I was at the bar of the Black Swan - I put my hand in my pocket, and heard the silver rattle - when I went to the station house, they asked if the prisoner was the man who robbed me - I said no - I never saw him with my eyes till I saw him at the station-house - I did not see him at all at the time I was robbed- they asked me what I had been robbed of - I told them I did not know; there was some money in my waistcoat pocket - I desired one of the officers to put his hand in my waistcoat pocket - he found 4s. and one was picked up - 4s. was all that remained in my pocket - I waited about during the night to see if I could recognise the man who had robbed me - soon afterwards I thought I saw him on the chapel steps, in Church-street - he was along with two females - I followed him down behind, at a very great distance, till I got to the station-house - he was going on towards the station-house - I went into the station-house, when he had passed to some distance, and said I thought I had seen the man; but I had not been up to him to recognise him - two officers went out after him, but, when I looked him in the face, I found he was not the man - I had not seen his face before - I should know the man well if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were against the shutter, was there more than one person with you? A. No; not at first - when I took up the shilling, persons were round me - when I got up, I saw several persons round me - no person struck or pushed me, but the man who robbed me.</p>

            . I am a policeman. Between twelve and one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 1st of June, I was on duty near Brick-lane - I came to the corner of Hanbury's new brewery - I saw the prisoner at the bar, the prosecutor and another man standing by the baker's shop opposite - I saw Vickers with his back up against the shutters, and saw the prisoner in a struggle with him - both were struggling together as if wrestling - I heard money drop on the pavement, and saw the prisoner run away - the prosecutor called out, "Stop thief, police" - I followed him - the other man disappeared before the prisoner ran away - he went away fast - I heard money drop, but did not pick it up, for I followed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the money fell on the pavement, was there one or two persons by the prosecutor? A. I saw a man standing just by - but just at the time the money dropped the prisoner ran off - he was struggling with the prosecutor just before - I saw another man close by, and he went off first - that man had disappeared before the money fell on the pavement - I pursued the prisoner, and took him in custody running - I am quite sure the prisoner was struggling with the prosecutor - the prosecutor cried"Stop thief" two or three times - I conveyed the prisoner back to where the robbery was committed, and the prosecutor said to me, "That is the man that robbed me" - in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030010"></xptr>way to the station-house another man came up close to the prisoner - I saw them talk together, and saw the prisoner reach his hand to the other man as if he was giving him something - I turned round and attempted to catch both the men's hands - the other man fell back, and in a moment after he came forward and gave me a violent blow in the mouth - both he and the prisoner struck me at different times - my brother officer McGovern came up, and I took the prisoner to the station-house - I searched him, and found on him 1s., a 6d., and 2d. in his waistcoat pocket - on the Sunday evening the prosecutor came to me, and told me something about the prisoner's friend - Vickers was three parts drunk - when I brought back the prisoner to where the robbery was committed, the prosecutor said he was the man - the prisoner denied it.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I did not see the beginning of this - I heard the cry of police - I had noticed nothing before I heard the cry - I heard a noise, and when I came up I saw a crowd of people, and among the rest was the prosecutor - I came up to him - he told me he was robbed - I did not see Flany then - Vickers was almost drunk, just able to walk a little - he gave me a shilling which he said he had picked up, of what he was robbed of - I asked him what became of the robber - somebody said my brother officer was in pursuit, and presently afterwards I saw him come back with the prisoner - he was shown to the prosecutor, who said "That is one of them," and asked me to protect him to the station-house, as the prisoner was going there - he took hold of my arm going along - as we went along a little distance, my brother officer was before with the prisoner - I saw a struggle - the prisoner and another man were struggling with the officer - the prisoner struck the officer - I let go of the prosecutor's arm, and ran up and laid hold of the prisoner, who was struggling to get away - I secured him, and stopped behind close to watch him - he was taken to the station-house, and there the prosecutor said he was not the man who robbed him - in the mean time, while I went up to assist my brother officer, I left the prosecutor behind, and when I came back I found a great many people talking to him; whether they persuaded him to say so, I cannot tell</p>

No; I was but five or six yards from him - I did not lose sight of him till I got him in custody - I did not lose sight of him till I caught him - I could not describe the other person - the man who ran away wore a long coat, and the prisoner had a jacket.</p>

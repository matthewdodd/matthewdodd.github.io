             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you in the service of Mr. Appleton? - A. Yes; I put the bottle-rack to rights on the beginning of October; several times after that, I missed several dozens at once; the day after I missed them, I said to the prisoner, don't you think the bottle-rack shrinks; he said, no.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you lived in the service of Mr. Appleton? - A. Eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have lived with the prisoner on good terms? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never reckoned the number of bottles? - A. No; I put the bottle-rack to rights; after I found there was a great number gone, I mentioned it to the gardener, and the gardener told my master.</p>
               <p>- HOLT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you happen to go by the back part of the premises of Mr. Appleton? - A. Yes, on the 15th of November, on my returning home on visiting some patients, going up the lane near Tottenham High-cross, I observed a man with an ass with two panniers, and a woman within side of the hedge in Mr. Appleton's fields; she was taking bottles from under the hedge, and giving them to the man in the lane; on my approaching, the woman squatted down under the hedge, to prevent my seeing her. I had occasion to stop in the course of a hundred and fifty yards to see another patient, from whose chamber-window I had a full view of the premises; I observed the prisoner to come back from Mr. Appleton's premises with bottles under his arm, and he gave them to the woman; she gave them to the man with the ass; he put them in his panniers, and then she gave something in return to the prisoner, which I saw him put in his left-hand waistcoat-pocket.</p>

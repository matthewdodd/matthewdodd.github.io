                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger, and live at Isleworth.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was in my service for nearly two years—on Tuesday, the 19th of February, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock at night, she came down stain to me in the parlour, and told me that there was a man up stairs under the bed—I caught up the poker, and ran to the door—she did not appear much affected by the alarm—I sent her to the public-house to get assist<lb></lb>ance—I did not go up stairs till five or six men came from the public-house, which was in about two minutes—Mr. Marsh was one of the men—the prisoner said the man was under the bed in the best bed-room—no<lb></lb>body had slept there for a fortnight—it was not her bed, but she told me afterwards that she was going to sleep in it to air it—when Marsh came in, four or five of us went up stain, bat could find no man at all—I ex<lb></lb>amined under the bed, crawled under it, and every thing, but could see no marks of any body having been there—the window was about fifteen inches up—it is about fifteen feet from the ground—a man could have dropped out, but he must have dropped on an iron grating or some stones—the prisoner went up with us to search the place—I said nothing to her that night—I did not miss any thing till I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock—I then looked in my drawer, and found my cash-box was gone—I had seen it the day before—there were two £10 country notes in it—the box was found, on the Wednesday morning, under the bed where the said the man had been—it was not there when I searched on the Tues<lb></lb>day night—there was a large square box there, and a muff-box, but nothing else—I have never seen the notes again—the prisoner was given into cus<lb></lb>tody on Wednesday—I found this instrument—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—in the kitchen window that morning, which, I think, opened the box—it is a nail or spike—I had seen it lying about the house before—there are marks on the box, which it appears to have made—(<hi rend="italic">pointing them out.</hi>)</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183903040050"></xptr>
               <p>hearing an alarm that a man was in the house, and went up stairs with the prisoner into the one-pair of stairs bed-room—she told me that was the bed the man had hid himself under—I did not examine under the bed then—other persons had been up previously, and examined it—I slept in the bed that night, and when I went to bed about one o'clock I examined, but could perceive no signs of any man's feet, or any thing of the sort—I saw a large box under the bed, and a muff or hat-box, but no cash-box—I looked very particularly, and am sure it was not there then—I could not see any foot-marks on the floor—the prisoner had said there would be dirt from feet, or something of that sort—I examined, but could see no parti<lb></lb>cular marks—there were no marks to make me suppose a man had been under the bed—the window had been shut before I got up—I looked at it, but perceived no marks about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter-in-law. I went to his house on Wednesday morning, the 20th, a little after nine o'clock, and went into the best bed-room, but did not look under the bed then—in consequence of something, I again went into the bed-room with the prisoner, about ten o'clock, and asked her to relate the particulars to me how she found the man—she said, about half-past ten o'clock at night she took a candle and went to turn down this bed—she put the candle on the table, and proceeded to turn down the bed—on going round the bed she perceived one curtain down, and the bed appeared low as if some one had been concealed in between the two beds, (being a spare-bed, one bed was placed upon another,) she went on the side of the bed, looked under the bed, and saw a man, but to satisfy herself, she turned back and looked again, and he was lying with his toes to the ground and his feet at the head of the bed—she then went down to apprise her master—she thought she heard the man follow her down stain, and kick his fool against a bedstead which was lying on the stairs, but she supposed he returned to the bed-room and jumped out of the window—after this I again went to the room, about eleven o'clock—I then for the first time looked under the bed in presence of the constable, and found this cash-box under the bed, by the side of the muff-box—it was plain to be seen when I got under the bed—the prisoner was not there then—I told her afterwards that I had found it—she said she was glad of it—I searched her, but found nothing.</p>

               <p>bed, or having got out of the window—there was a little grit between the two beds, where the prisoner represented the man to have been lying—there was not the least scratch or mark about the window, or window-sill—it is fourteen feet two inches from the ground, and there is an iron grating, beneath, on which he must have dropped—if he had dropped into the street, be must have dropped on some very rough pavement—I saw the cash-box found under the bed—I took the prisoner into custody, about two o'clock, the same day—I asked her if she had any suspicion of any person who committed the robbery—she said she could not think of any one, she had not the least idea of any one whatever—I asked her what sort of a man it was she saw under the bed—she hesitated, and gave no answer—I said, "Was it a labouring man, with half-boots, and tied up with laces; or did it appear as if they were a respectable man's feet"—she said she considered they were the feet of a respectable man, because he had straps under his boots—I said, "How do you know that?"—she said she looked back, and had another look, to satisfy herself—I charged her particularly not to tell me whether she was guilty, but if she was, and another person older than herself had persuaded her to do it, to tell me in mercy to herself whether she had any accomplice—she said she had none whatever—I applied this instrument to the marks on the cash-box, and they corresponded exactly—I have not the least doubt it was opened by that instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-fitter, and live at Plaistow Marsh; on Tuesday night, 22nd October, I met the prisoner and went with her to a public-house and treated her—I had with me a purse, a watch, and a stick—I had one sovereign, and I think nearly a pound's worth of silver—I was not exactly sober—I do not think was in the house ten minutes—I almost think she left first—some one asked me if I had lost my watch—I then found it gone, and my money and stick also—these produced are my I stick, watch, and purse—here is a foreign coin which I know I lost with my other money in my purse that night.</p>

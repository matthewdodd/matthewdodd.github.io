               <p>why the destruction of the jute by the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi> was not charged for; to which no reply was made—it had been set down as burnt in the June fire—Mr. Whiting said to Mr. Barry, "Why, you admit all this man says; it is not a very creditable proceeding; you must think the insurance-offices have a great deal of money"—it was then suggested that we should walk across the road and see the jute by the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi> in the warehouse—Fage said he had helped to load vans which carried wheat, for which the Messrs. Barry received payment—we all went across to the ground floor of N warehouse, and there Fage pointed out a stack of jute which contained 210 bales by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and said that if the stack were broken down the centre bales would be found without tallies, and that the front bales would be found with tallies of the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi> upon them. I asked Arnett if this were true, and he said it was—it was then proposed that we should take an account of the goods on the premises, and that Mr. Stanninought, one of Messrs. Barry's clerks, should be present—this was agreed upon, and we proceeded with the stock-taking the same day—I did not myself assist at it, but I afterwards received a report from Mr. Radmall—I saw Mr. John Barry at Meriton's-wharf, in his counting-house on the 13th January—he expressed regret that there should be such inaccuracies in their statements—I asked him how he accounted for the change of tallies on goods received by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and he said, "I have not heard of that"—I said, "Did not your brother tell you of it?"—he said, "No"—I proposed to go across to the warehouse and point out the goods—we went downstairs for that pur<lb></lb>pose, and met Arnett at the door—I said, "Arnett, is it true that the tallies were changed by the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi>?"—he said, "Yes"—we did not then go to the warehouse—I suggested to Mr. John Barry that the seed by the <hi rend="italic">Avoca</hi> should be measured, and he said it should be done next morning—I directed my clerk to attend to the measuring—I mentioned that I had to report to a meeting of the fire-offices the following morning the result of the stock<lb></lb>taking—Mr. Barry inquired at what time—I said if he were in the city at the time it might be well for him to call—he said in all probability be should call, and the next morning he came to the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Barry, when you saw him on the first occasion, say that the great object of furnishing the burnt list to the offices was that the offices might take them and come and check them for themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—to the best of my belief nothing of the kind was said—I have no recollection of anything of the sort—I believe he did not say so—I can't go further than that—I asked for the saved list; he at once offered to let me have it—it is the duty of the insurance offices to satisfy themselves as to the claims, before they pay them—it is not the custom to take the burnt list and check the goods by it, and it would not, in a case like this, enable them to do it; where the tallies have been changed you could not make a correct list—I did not know that the tallies had been changed when I went—we had no instructions to go; it is not usual to go—if we were to go and see the exact quantity of goods they had, we should have to take stock of all their other premises which were not burnt—there is no doubt that taking the burnt list and comparing it with the goods remaining on the premises would enable us to check claims and ascertain their correctness or incorrectness—I did not do it because it is not customary to do it—it is customary to take the wharfinger's certificate for things burnt; no questions are asked—we are paid for ascertaining the correctness of claims—we are not paid a per centage; we charge a fee according to the matter of business—our mode of ascertaining the correctness of a claim is not to take a list and pay upon it; we pay on the certificate of the wharfinger; he signs a printed certifi<lb></lb>cate that the goods are destroyed, and he writes across the warrant "de<lb></lb>stroyed by fire, "and on that we arrange with the merchant the price of the goods, and the amount is paid—we are paid to see that the merchant returns the proper quantity of goods at risk, because his goods are covered by floating policies, which cover goods elsewhere—the wharfinger's certificate represents on the face of it the quantity burnt, and on that we pay the merchant—we see that the price is right—that is what we are paid for—we do not pay without the wharfinger's certificate; one office did, but not an office for which I was concerned; it was a new office—when Mr. Alfred Barry called on me on 13th December, I asked him how the list of the goods not destroyed had been made out—he told me that Arnett had made out the list from the stock in the warehouses, and that Thorne had checked it—it was on Wednesday, 11th January, I went there with Fage—I do not recollect Mr. Alfred Barry saying to me at that time that he could not account for the mistake that had been made by Arnett and Thorne—he asked Arnett the question that Mr. Whiting put to him—he did not say to me, "I cannot account in the least for this mistake that Arnett has made"—he did not follow it up by asking me what I thought had better be done in the matter; I will swear that—I did not suggest that he had better put the matter in the hands of some independent accountant; nothing of the kind—on the 11th, Mr. Whiting, Mr. Radmall, Fage, Arnett, and I were present—I suggested that we should at once take the stock, and that was arranged to be done—that was not in consequence of Mr. Barry saying, "I cannot conceive how this has all happened; what had best be done?"—he never said so—I suggested taking the stock, because I thought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120053"></xptr>
               <p>it was requisite to do so, if there were these errors—I can't say what was the last thing that occurred immediately before I suggested taking stock—I had previously arranged with Mr. Whiting that if these charges were admitted we should at once take stock Mr. Barry was at once willing that I should do so—my clerks commenced taking stock on Wednesday, and it was finished on friday night, expect measuring a parcel of seed by the <hi rend="italic">Avoca</hi> I do not remember on that or any other occasion Mr. Barry saying they could see no objection to our going through the books, and ascertain<lb></lb>ing that everything was correct, for he thought the offices, where so large amounts were so large amounts were concerned, ought to have some check of their own; nothing of the kind; I have no recollection of it; most certainly nothing of the kind was said on the Wednesday, nor on the Friday; I have no recollection of it—I did not say to him, while taking stock, that he seemed to have no idea to what extent the inaccuracies in his lists had gone—I did not see him during the taking the stock—I saw Mr. John Barry on the Friday evening, that was all—I should say I did not say that to him—he knew it to the same extent as we did; his clerk was there—I have no recollection of saying so, I did not know the extent myself—he said he was very much surprised, that that was the first time he had heard of the movement of the tallies; that was on the Friday evening—when I met Arnett at the door I asked him the question about the tallies, and he admitted it—that was at the door just by the street, and we turned back to the counting-house at once—I have no recollection of Mr. Barry saying, "Well, Arnett, what did you do that for?"—I will not swear it; I did not hear it—Arnett did not say in answer, "I am very sorry, sir, that I did it, but when I broke down the stack I found I was so many bales in excess that I fancied I must have made some mistake in a former delivery of the same mark"—nothing of the sort was said in my hearing—I did not hear Mr. Barry at the same time, with an air of vexation, say "I should like to know how many other shipments you have been serving in the same way"—I never heard anything of the sort; I swear that; we returned immediately—Mr. Barry told me that was the first he had heard of it, and on Arnett saying it was true, my purpose was answered, and I returned at once—Mr. Barry did not remain behind; he went back with me to his counting-house—next day, or Monday, Mr. Godden, from Messrs. Tilleard's, called upon me; he showed me a letter that he was about to write to us, and he proposed to fill in the names of Messrs. Honey and Humphrys, I said they were very respectable persons, and I had done business with them satisfactorily—(The letter in question was as follows: "34, Old Jewry, London, E. C. Jan 16th, 1865. Messrs. Brown and Roberts, Throgmorton-street. Gentlemen—Messrs. Barry Brothers find with great surprise that serious inaccuracies have in fact occurred in their returns of goods, as destroyed at the fire on their premises on the 25th of November last. These returns were made out from the lists of stock prepared and checked by their servants in the usual way, and Messrs. Barry were at first incredulous that there could be any extensive errors, notwithstanding the great confusion and pressure which exist after fire; but they are now satisfied that it is so, and they have suspended the foreman, who is principally responsible to them, from any further interference with the goods; and they have, for their own satisfac<lb></lb>tion, also determined to call in Messrs. Honey, Humphrys, and Honey, of Ironmonger-lane, to take entire charge of their stock, and to investigate the discrepancies which have occurred, with a view to their readjustment, and to preclude the questions in the settlement of the remaining claims.

Tilleard, Son, Godden, and Holme.")—I cannot tell you whether Mr. Radmall's list is correct—I have had no means of testing its accuracy—I do not assume that it is possible to take an exactly accurate list—I have certainly assumed the substantial accuracy of it—he was not there for the express purpose of checking the list that was found to be in<lb></lb>accurate—he was there on the Wednesday to take a list of what remained; it was not checking the list at all—at that time the list of the goods saved had been ascertained to be incorrect—he was there for the purpose of taking a more correct list—it may be that his list is inaccurate to the extent of 300 bales, it would not surprise me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Cannot you give me anybody who was responsible for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not a lawyer—I cannot give you the name of any person who authorised it as a matter of fact; I must refer you to Mr. Humphreys—I don't know the exact time they were in prison—I can't say whether it was about five weeks; I don't know the time at all without referring to memoranda—I can't say whether they were in prison from 25th January to 4th March—I have no means of speaking as to dates—I was at the Mansion-honse a great many times—I should think those times ranged over a period between 25th January and 4th March, and later than that—I don't know whether they were in custody in Newgate the whole of that time—I can't say how long it was—Fage came to me—he has been paid by me ever since, the same wages he received at Meriton's Wharf, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week; no perquisites; I am not aware of any hopes or prospects; no retiring pension, no lodging or board—I do not know of the taking away of all Messrs. Barry's books and papers; I know some have been taken, I don't know what; I was not present—I don't know that all their books and papers were taken, and their drawers broken open—the first depositions were taken before the Lord Mayor, and the others before Alderman Stone—the Lord Mayor is a director of one of the offices concerned now—I have not read over Fage's deposition before the Lord Mayor; I heard part of it; most of it.</p>

I knew it before—I asked him that because Mr. John Barry was with me, and he said he had never heard of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was until lately in the employ of Messrs. Barry at Meriton's-wharf. I was with them about a year and nine months. Both the Messrs. Baity were very frequently at the wharf—they would merely just go through the place sometimes—they did not go much into the work<lb></lb>ing of the business—they merely used to walk through—Thorne was superin<lb></lb>tendent of the wharf, and Arnett was labour superintendent, and Sedgwick was a foreman, he attended principally to jute—my duty was to take the weights of the bales landed, and also to tally them—I took the weights of the jute lauded from the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and entered the weights in the landing-book—the marks were S. C. C. 4—tallies were placed upon the bales with that mark upon them—the tallies consisted of pieces of calico stiffly stitched, fastened by a piece of wire through an eyelet hole to the bale—each bale weighed between 2 cwt and. 3 cwt.—the greater part of those bales were stowed in the yard—there were 1,000 bales received by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> and they remained in the place where they were deposited until after the tire—I delivered 200 of them by order of Sedgwick after the fire—that stack was not in any way in<lb></lb>jured by the fire, it was too far away, a labourer named Burgess was present when Sedgwick gave me the order—Burgess asked Sedgwick if he wanted any particular weights, he said, "No"—he went into the office, came back, and said "Take those 200 and that will finish the ship, the rest are for us"—after I had delivered the 200 bales, about 300 remained, marked <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi>—a few days afterwards I heard Arnett say to Sedgwick, "Mr. John is in a very bad way about the stack by the Onward being over, and if it was found out, what a row, or bother, there would be I"—the man Callaghan is still in the employment of the Messrs. Barry—sedgwick gave Callaghan and myself orders to take off the tarpaulin from the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi> stuck, and to take off the tallies, and he brought a bag and told us to put the tallies carefully into it, and then he added, "When they are all collected we will burn them"—accordingly Callaghan and I tore off 350 of the tallies and put them into the bag, which, I believe, was taken away by Sedgwick—about fifteen hands were then employed in removing the bales into the N warehouse—it took them all day—I do not know whether they are still in the employment—while we were taking off the tallies Sedgwick name there two or three times—I saw Mr. Alfred Barry and Arnett together, and later in the day I saw Mr. John Barry, within two or three yards off whore we were at work—we-were then up-ending the bales, a part of the stack having fallen down—when the bales were removed to the N warehouse they were without any tallies, but a man of the name of Backett, in the employ of the Messrs. Hurry, was put to work to put fresh tallies on them containing the words <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi>—I left the service on the Saturday after Christmas—I went to the top of the N warehouse the Friday after Christmas, and there I saw the remainder of the bales by the <hi rend="italic">Onward,</hi> about 140 in number—they had no tallies on them, they had been removed up there two or three days after I had torn off the tallies—I had gone up for some papers I had left there, and on coming down Sedgwick was going away, and Burgess said to me, "What have you been upstairs for?"—I said, "Why?"—he said</p>

               <p>"Sedgwick told roe to ask"—Sedgwick was not then within hearing, he was on the wharf—we were turning from the new warehouse on to the wharf, and I asked Sedgwick what he meant by telling Burgess to speak to me about going up-stairs—he said "I merely said, 'What is Fage going up-stairs for?'"—before 8th December I had assisted in stowing on the top floor fifteen bales of jute from a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Botanist,</hi> marked S and CC3 in a diamond, and about thirty by the <hi rend="italic">Mary Stenhouse</hi>—I know it was some days after the 25th November when the fire occurred, and before the 8th December; it was after the stock-taking, also about twenty by the Jane porter, about thirty by the <hi rend="italic">Art Union,</hi> about fifty by the <hi rend="italic">Clyde,</hi> I think marked S and CC x 4—I had orders from Sedgwick to stow the tallies of those bales in, so that they should go against the wall—we did so—it was a fortnight after Christmas that I went to Messrs. Brown and Roberts—I don't know the date exactly—I made a communication to them, and on 11th January I went with Mr. Roberts to Meriton's-wharf, and saw Mr. Alfred Barry in his room, and Mr. Whiting and Mr. Radmall and Arnett—Mr. Whiting said, "You have something to tell us about some goods being kept back from the fire offices that have been reported to be burnt, which are not"—I said, "Yes, sir, I have;" and I asked for a piece of paper, which, I believe, Mr. Radmall banded to me, and I read out the items from it—I told them that they had about 100 bags of rice in No. 11, and that they had only given an account of 7 to the fire offices as being on hand; that in the fire before, they had charged 440 bales of jute of the <hi rend="italic">Almeida</hi> parcel as being burnt when there was only 413 burnt—I told them that I had delivered three loads of grain on 19th August, for which they got the money, and I said that was the check—I may say by way of explanation that Mr. Alfred Barry said, "Why, Arnett, we have got no check, "and I said, "You should call things by there right names, don't put the blame on Mr. Arnett; three loads I delivered on 9th August, for which you have got the money, that is the check"—I meant that he might have got a check for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or whatever it might have come to—I said they had kept a lot of bales of jute back from the June fire, and put them into a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Cat,</hi> and they were burnt in the November fire—that was about 300 bales; and I mentioned the ships names, the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi> 164 bales, the <hi rend="italic">William Cole</hi> 75, the <hi rend="italic">Almeida</hi> 10, and the quantity by the <hi rend="italic">Rollo</hi> I forgot, but it was 300 bales altogether—I said the <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi> had been knocking about the dock for two or three months, and the goods were then landed in Grove's-buildings or the new buildings known as Nos. 40 to 5 0, and destroyed by the November fire—on my saying that, Mr. Whiting said, "Why, Mr. Barry, this is not a very respectable transaction, you must think the fire offices have a great deal of money to spare"—I don't think that he made any answer—Arnett at first said it was not true, or something to that effect—I said "I will give you, Mr. Arnett, a fair chance: if you deny this, I challenge you to bring up the foreman's day books, and I will prove it"—Arnett then said it was true—Mr. Roberts said, "If these 164 bales by the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi> are burnt as you admit, why not charge us with them?"—I did not hear any answer was made to that—I told Arnett that I had heard him say that Mr. John was in a bad way about the stack by the <hi rend="italic">Onward</hi> being over, and if it was found out what a row there would be—upon which Arnett said, "I don't recollect using those words exactly, but I may have said something to that effect"—after this conversation Mr. Radmall, Mr. Gatehouse, Mr. Stanninought, and Mr. Field and I began taking the stock directly—Mr. Stanninought, Mr. Barry's clerk, was present nearly the whole</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120057"></xptr>
               <p>time—he had a gang of men to take the tarpaulins off the stack in the yard—I counted the bales, and Mr. Field and Mr. Gatehouse checked me—we were engaged in taking stock part of three days—I remember the stock being taken after the November fire by Arnett and Sedgwick first, and after that by Thorne and Arnett—when Arnett and Sedgwick were together, Arnett had the papers, and Sedgwick was calling out the stock—when Thorne and Arnett were together, Thorne had the papers, and Arnett was calling out the stock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to the North-British and Mer<lb></lb>cantile Insurance Company, No. 61, Threadneedle-street, City—on 11th January last, I went to Messrs. Barry's premises with Mr. Roberts, and there met Mr. Radmall, Fage, and Arnett, and Mr. Alfred Barry—I asked Fage, in his presence, to make a statement that he had made to me and Mr. Huberts, respecting circumstances relating to the fire—he commenced by stating that he had been engaged with others to remove tallies off certain bales of jute; I think he said somewhere about 250, and after they had done so to destroy the tallies—he went on to state that there had been other goods, saved in the June fire, put into a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Cat,</hi> which was knocking about the wharf for two or three months, and afterwards brought into the warehouse, and were burnt in the November fire—he said we should find those bales from which they removed the tallies that were substituted for the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin,</hi> in the N warehouse; and behind this stack, the front of which bore the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi> mark, we should find a great number of bales which bore no mark whatever—some more remarks took place and I then turned to Arnett and said, "You have heard this man's statement, are these facts true?" Arnett immediately said that it was true—I then turned to Mr. Alfred Barry and said, "How can you account for these circumstances, it seems a very extraordinary statement, I shall be glad of an explanation"—he then said to Arnett, "How is it, how does it occur? we seem to have no check"—Arnett made no remark, nor did anybody else—I think Fage gave the number of bales in the new building, but I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>

My brother has told me the cause of your visit, and although I shall be annoyed to learn that there are any inaccuracies in our wharf returns referring to goods burnt, I shall be glad for Mr. Roberts and yourself to check the returns in any way that may suggest itself. I am afraid, however, that as our remaining stock of goods in hand is still nearly 4,000 tons, we cannot arrive with absolute certainty at the correctness of the returns until such goods are actually delivered out of warehouse. We shall, therefore, of course, watch the future delivery of our remaining stock, and should we hereafter discover any discrepancies Mr. Roberts shall be apprised of it. In the meanwhile I think the plan you have suggested, of counting the several stacks of jute, will tend to confirm the correctness of the quantity of bales remaining in warehouse.—Yours truly,—<hi rend="italic">J.

The act for which I summarily dismissed him was the act of a madman, and my belief is that he is the writer of three anonymous letters written to ourselves, our solicitors, and the police, insinuating that the fire was done intentionally by one of our foremen, and evidently written simply in bad feeling and without one little of</p>

               <p>evidence. My own conviction is, after most careful consideration of all the acts, that it originated in an accident"—Mr. John Berry called upon me the day after I received that letter—I may mention that after we came away from the wharf, I thought it my duty to call at several of the fire-offices concerned in the loss, and to write to others to state to them what we had heard at the wharf, and next day we bad a meeting at my office, and at that meeting Mr. John Barry was present—I do not recollect his saying that when he had written that note of 11 Jan. he was not at all aware that there was a particular parcel of jute that turned out to be so very largely in excess as he had since found there was—I don't recollect anything of the sort passing—I said nothing to him about the jute—he came and sat in my room while we were in the board-room consulting about the matter—I did not say I could not help strongly suspecting the honesty of some of his men; I never made any such remark, nor can I recollect his answering, that he believed his servants to be most perfectly honest, and that from what he knew of them he thought it was mere careless<lb></lb>ness and the result of the immense confusion into which they had been thrown by the fire—I will undertake to say that nothing of the sort passed, as far as my memory goes; I do not remember any such conversation at all—I don't remember that he had any conversation with me before to came to the meeting; I avoided any conversation on the subject—I should say he was there two hours, but not with me more than five minutes; I said nothing to him during that time; I avoided saying anything—he said he had come there for the purpose of meeting the managers; he might have made some remarks, but not those certainly, nor anything to that effect—he sat down, and I gave him the paper to read; I asked him to wait while the insurance, people had their meeting—I think he did say that he was per<lb></lb>fectly willing to come and meet them, and offer any explanation in his power, and that is all I recollect his saying—when I returned to him, I told him that I was sorry he had been kept there so long, but the committee had not thought it desirable to see him, because the matter was under investigation, and the committee would meet again—I think he wrote to me to the effect that in consequence of the detection of these errors, he and his brother had given orders that there should be no further shipments made at the wharf, in order that all that was on the wharf should be kept by itself and care<lb></lb>fully examined—I do not know as a fact that no further shipments were made—I think Mr. John Barry took took an active part in endeavouring to get the premises on fire insurances reduced; he wrote pamphlets about it, and took a very active part; that must be two or three years ago; he has busied himself a good deal about it—I know the defendants were arrested; I suppose they were kept in gaol somewhere about five weeks, I don't know the exact time; the Barrys were three weeks, I think—I don't know any<lb></lb>thing about their books and things being seized—I don't know that their drawers were broken open and all their books of every kind taken; I never heard it before this—I was served with a writ in an action to recover them—I did hear of their books being taken, but not of locks being broken—I knew that their books were taken away; I don't know about all of them; a great number, every book we wanted; that was in the hands of the soli<lb></lb>citors—I do not recollect a gentleman coming up to me at the Mansion-house and asking me about the charge against the servants of the Barrys—I might have had some con<lb></lb>versation with a gentlemen; I have had con<lb></lb>versations with a great many gentleman—I never heard of a Mr. Delmar; I do not recollect his asking me what the charge was against the servants,</p>

               <p>and saying it was a great shame to keep them in prison; nor do I recollect saying that what we wanted was to get out of them something implicating their masters—I might,"in the course of conversation, have made some remark of that sort; that was not the object of imprisoning them for five weeks; we wanted to get at the truth of the matter—I did not imprison them; I don't know that my employers did, it was merely a matter advised that it should be so—I had only a single voice in the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Brown and Roberts—the red list, marked B, was banded to me after the November fire—I afterwards received a list of goods saved from the office of Messrs. Barry—having received the lists I went to the wharf to check them—I saw Arnett, and examined Messrs. Barry's books—the two lists, the goods destroyed and the goods saved, together represented substantially the quantity of goods entered in the books—I was present at the interview with Fage and Messrs. Barry at the wharf—after that interview I, with Field, a clerk of Messrs. Roberts, Gatehouse, a fireman, and Fage, took stock of the goods in the warehouse—we were three days taking stock—I had the saved list with me—I compared the list of goods received with the list of goods I found—I found 2,325 bales of jute in excess of the number represented in the saved list received from Messrs. Barry—the value of a bale of jute averages 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the excess of seed was 153 qrs. as regarded one shipment, the <hi rend="italic">Avoca</hi>—the average value of a quarter of rapeseed is about 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also found an excess in rice to the extent of about 80 bags—there was an excess in poppy seed to the extent of about 100 bags—as regarded the shipment of jute ex <hi rend="italic">Mary Sten-house</hi>, 313 bales were said to have been destroyed, and 100 saved—we, how<lb></lb>ever, found there were 262 bales saved from that shipment, instead 100—of the shipment ex <hi rend="italic">Avoca</hi>, 1,565 qrs. of rapeseed were alleged to have been burnt, and 300 qrs. represented to be saved; and I found 453 qrs.—846 bales ex <hi rend="italic">City of Sydney</hi> were alleged to have been burnt and 140 saved; I found 291 bales in excess of the return made to the offices—of the shipment by the Onward 800 bales were said to have been destroyed and 200 saved, and I found 578—I found them on different floors—210 marked <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi> and 168 City of Bombay, were pointed out to me as a portion of the <hi rend="italic">Onward cargo</hi>—we examined the cargoes by those two vessels, and I found they were accounted for without including the 210 and 168 bales—of the <hi rend="italic">Jane Potter's</hi> cargo, 270 bales were represented to have been destroyed and 220 saved. I found 255 bales on the premises, and 220 had been delivered previous to my visit and after the fire. Of the cargo ex <hi rend="italic">City of Canton</hi> there were 480 bales said to have been burned and 210 saved; I found on the wharf 283, leaving an excess of 73 bales. 900 bales per the <hi rend="italic">City of Cashmere</hi> were said to have been burnt and 100 saved, and I found 209 bales of that shipment on the premises. In all these shipments the two lists of "saved "and "destroyed "accounted for the whole cargo.</p>

               <p>warehouse appeared to be old—I think there were gangways left in all the warehouses—they were mostly piled up to the roof, but nearly all had gangways—I am not aware of any that had not—there wag plenty of room to pass—in some cases, from being piled against the windows, the place was dark—I am scarcely prepared to say, whether it would have taken a good deal of time and experience to have gone into anything like an accurate estimate of what was left—I believe there were not over 20,000 bales left; about 10,000—I could not say from the books whether we were dealing with the remains of a stock of 50,000 bales—I am aware that there are errors in my own, list—I was aware the black and red lists were erroneous, but I did not go for the purpose of correcting them—I went, because those lists had been found to be erroneous—I had every facility afforded me for taking the stock—I superintended the counting—they were counted lengthways and broadways, and we assumed the inside was the same—it is usual to pack jute in a certain way—I am not aware that my own list shows shipments to the extent of 50,000 bales—I did not find 210 <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin tallies</hi>; I took that from the statement made to me—I counted them round, to see, and I found them correct—I tallied the whole stack; it was stated that the outside were tallied and the inside not—I did not ascertain that at all—I can't say anything about the qualities of jute—I should not think there was much difference to the eye between one bale of jute and another—I believe they are much about the same size, and made up in the same way; except for the tally, one bale of jute might do very good duty for another, to me, it would not to another man—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct model of a bale, of jute—they all look just like that—there is first, second and third quality I believe—Mr. Stanninought was there, at the time I was—I am not aware that be complained that I was going too fast to do it accurately—I think he said, on out occasion, the quantity was not correct, and he gut up and counted it himself, and found it was correct—between the fire and our going over the stock about 1,700 bales had been delivered—I was told that no goods had been landed since the fire; I have not looked at the books to see—I should Bay 1,700 bales of jute would make a considerable difference, as to the crowded nature of the warehouse.</p>

               <p>no suspicion then of anything wrong—T went downstairs and met Mr. Alfred Barry on the wharf—after some conversation, he suggested that I should write to the insurance-offices to claim a pro rata share on the salvage, and also to write to them (Messrs. Barry) requesting them to set aside any portion of jute which might be identified as mine, and not let it form part of the salvage—I wrote those two letters—(<hi rend="italic">these were dated December</hi>, 1864)—I think Sedgwick was standing by during the conversation I had with Mr. Barry—I saw Alfred Barry several times after that, and asked him if any jute of mine had been recovered from the ruins—I also sent several times—I asked Sedgwick on one occasion to point out to me the warehouse it had been stacked in, and he pointed out a warehouse to me in the midst of the burning ruins, and said there was no chance of any more being recovered—my attention was first called again to the matter by seeing the proceedings against Sedgwick, Arnett, and Thorne, at the Mansion-house—I then had an interview with Mr. Roberts, and afterwards went to the wharf—I saw Mr. John Barry, and drew his attention to the fact of his men being at the Mansion-house, and that there were 2,000 more bales found than were repre<lb></lb>sented to have been saved—he said Mr. Roberts must have made a great miscalculation, and that in two or three instances he bad made mistakes to the extent of 20 to 25 per cent.—he had also said that stock was being taken, and in a few days he would be able to tell what was on the wharf—on that I left with my principal, who was with me—on the following morn<lb></lb>ing I saw Mr. Roberts, and in consequence of what he said I immediately went to the wharf—I saw Mr. J.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you communicated that to Messrs. Humphreys? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have seen the black list—the original entries in the ledger do not altogether correspond with that black list, nor do they substantially—I am not able to say, but I believe substantially they do—the corrections upon the erasure in that book substantially corre<lb></lb>spond with the revised or red list—the lists were not in my possession before I took my first note of that book; I had them very shortly before—indeed, some of these alterations were made in April—the list could not have been made out from this book—amongst the other books that are submitted to me, there was a delivery receipt-book—I do not know whether the entries on the erasures were copied from this book (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the date here seems to be an erasure—the next entry is the 21st of December—that appears in this book—the entry on the erasure would seem to be a copy from this delivery receipt-book—I have not traced all the entries—I assume the cargo-ledger to be correct—I have never seen these books before; they were there—I never asked how it was done—I have not asked a single question while I have been there—there is an entry of ten bales on 23d December by the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin</hi> to Howey's van—I should not be able to identify these bales, because they are not numbered—Howey's van is named, and the number of bales agree—the entry on the 7th of December is on an erasure—there are no other erasures; the entries go on one after the other—at page 40 of this cargo-book there appears to be an account of the <hi rend="italic">Naturalist</hi>, Captain Hyde, from Calcutta, reported 15th May, Chalizzi and Co.—this is corrected in the same way—that is also in the red list—these books were under my custody at the time they were at Messrs. Barry's wharf—they have had the constant use of them—it was agreed between all parries that I should be the custodian of them—I have had access to them from the 27th of March to the present time—I was called in by the prosecution as an independent person—the books that I asked for were produced to me, except the private ledger—I had the means of going through all the books—I have had several clerks engaged upon it for</p>

               <p>Upwards of two months—I was precluded from asking questions, or allow<lb></lb>ing them to do so; therefore a great deal of time was occupied which might perhaps have been saved—these erasures first came to my knowledge about the beginning of May—my attention was called to them by my clerk, who had more particularly to do with this ledger—I bad seen the ledger before, but had not noticed the erasures—I believe Still was the clerk who kept the book—I was at the Mansion House when he was examined, but I did not pay much attention to what he said—I am not sure about his being examined as to these erasures—on reflection, I do not think I heard him say anything about it—the examination of the books had reference principally to the cargoes, but generally with reference to Messrs. Barry's accounts—this is the private ledger—it is the first time I have seen it—it begins at 1851.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOVILL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the black list which was originally made out on the 30th November correspond with the book as it stood originally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I believe it did—as regards the <hi rend="italic">City of Dublin,</hi> it did not correspond with either list—the red list agrees substantially with the black as it is now altered, but it did not agree with it at the time—my attention has not been called to these other books with reference to this matter—if I had gone through all the books I should not have been here for twelve months—my attention has not been drawn to the other books until to-day—my attention having not been drawn to them makes the matter all the less explicable to me, because there is a variance between the entry and one of these books, the warehouse-book and the ledger of the same date; the two books are inconsistent—although the book now agrees with the red list, it did not on 15th December, when it was made out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In that very page you have been referring to, do the words "On hand" appear in pencil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do now; they did not when my attention was first drawn to the erasure, at least I believe not—I have no doubt it was not there then, but the writing is very faint.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and surveyor to the County Fire Office—I conducted the working of the salvage of the fire which took place at Meriton's-wharf on 25th November last—none of the salvage from the warehouses that were destroyed by fire was removed into the uninjured warehouses—there was not any confusion, that I observed, in the uninjured warehouses—while I was there Sedgwick was referred to repeatedly in my presence to know where jute had been stored—he told me he knew where every bale was on the premises—I asked him myself and he appeared to know directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the City police—on 25th January I took Arnett into custody at his own house—I read the warrant to him, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120066"></xptr>
               <p>told him he must go with me to Bow-lane police-station—he said, "Can't I be taken to-morrow, I wish to see some gentlemen at the wharf?"—I said, no, he must go with me—I took him to the police-station and searched him, and found on him a number of keys, which he said belonged to Meriton's-wharf——I was present with Haydon the same day when Thorne was taken into custody—I came up just after Haydon had read the warrant to him—he said, "Am I selected as one of the principals? "Haydon replied, "Yes"—he said, "Then I have nothing to say at present"—he was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody—I took Sedgwick into custody the same day, at his house—I read the warrant to him—he said, "Then I suppose I had better go with you, gentle<lb></lb>men."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You took Arnett away with you that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I got him to the station I searched him—I did not expect to find any bales of jute upon him—he was locked up in a cell that night—I took his money from him—I don't recollect how much he had, something like 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I handed it over to the inspector on duty, as in the usual course.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you present when the officers went down to take the books and papers of the Messrs. Barry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was only one lock forced, or rather the brown paper at the bot<lb></lb>tom of the drawer was broken, because we could not pick the lock—we took a locksmith with us, who picked two locks and attempted to pick a third—there was nothing in either of those drawers but dirty bits of paper—we got the books and papers from about the office, and an iron safe, of which I had the key—I took it from Mr. Barry when he was taken—we were ordered by the solicitors for the prosecution—I can't say how long the Messrs. Barry were in prison, several weeks—I was present at every examination at the Mansion-house—I don't remember bail to the amount of 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being offered and refused—I remember something being said that bail could be found for 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—bail was refused on more than one occasion, I think.</p>

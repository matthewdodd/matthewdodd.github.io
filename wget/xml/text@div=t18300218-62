On the 21st of January I lost two sheets and a table-cloth from a garden behind my house - they were hanging on a line to dry; they have my marks on them - the prisoner was brought back with them, and several persons charged him with taking them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What marks are on them? A. I. 
               <persName id="t18300218-62-person445">L, B. I</persName>
             only know them by the marks; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180034"></xptr>have been told they are mine - the witness, who could have identified them more particularly, is dangerously ill.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CULLUM. I am a carpenter, and live within a short distance of Mr. Brett. On Thursday, the 21st of January, I was going home about twenty minutes before six o'clock in the evening, and going down the hill two young men passed me; one of them had a bundle - I said to a person who was with me, "I think they have some linen, let's go after them;" we did so, and I saw one of them throw a bundle into a garden - they then ran off, and I pursued - I told the man with me to take care of the things; I called Stop thief! a gentleman's servant ran out and another person - I was out of breath, and I said to them, "There go the thieves! you go after them," and I stopped to get wind - they pursued; when I got wind I went on, and met a young man bringing the prisoner back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not dark? A. It was dark - the prisoner is one of the two who ran off - I cannot say which had the bundle; the person I saw with it was about ten yards from me, and the other was about five yards behind - when I lost my breath I think they were twenty yards from me; it is a straight road - when the other persons came out I lost sight of them; I suppose I lost sight of them for about ten minutes - it is a public road; it was at Crouch-hill, Horusey - I did not see any other persons on the road.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN WRIGHT. I was with the witness, and saw two men, one following the other - one had a bundle, which he flung over a hedge; I went after it - it contained the articles produced; I cannot tell how far that was from Mr. Brett's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who those persons were you cannot say? A. No; I gave the things to Applegate, and he gave them to the constable.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. St. John. I saw Cullum running up the hill after two men - I only saw Mr. Rogers' coachman on before me; I ran after the two men - I overtook the coachman at first, and then saw the two men; I overtook them, and took the prisoner, who was one of them - the other struck me on the head, and got away; the prisoner said to him, "Don't go without me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What happened previous to the cry of Stop thief! you do not know? A. No; when I first heard it I did not see the persons I intended to stop, but I saw the prisoner and another run, and followed - it is not a very populous neighbourhood; I saw no persons running before them - I might meet three or four.</p>
               <p>JOHN APPLEGATE. I heard Stop thief! called as I was at work in the stable - I did not go after any body, but saw Wright looking for the things; I said, "What are you looking for?" he said, "There are some things thrown over, and the thieves have run up here;" I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody - I took the things of Wright, and took them to Mr. Brett's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were the things till you took them to Mr. Brett's? A. I was at work at my horses - I locked them up in my master's saddle-room till I took them to Mr. Brett's.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BRETT. I am a headborough of Hornsey. I was sent for, and took the prisoner - I had not possession of the bundle till the 23rd, when they were given to me by Chambers, the beadle of Hornsey.</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. Rogers. I heard Stop thief! called, and ran out - I saw two men. whom I pursued; Mr. St. John's man overtook me, and ran after them - he took the prisoner, who was one of them; the other got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know who they were? A. The prisoner was one, for he turned round and looked at me - I only saw those two men running, and the man who pursued them; it was light, and the snow made it lighter - I mean it was not dark.</p>
               <p>JOHN LOWDHAM BRETT re-examined. Q. What was done with the bundle? A. It was left in my house, and delivered to the constable by a servant - I believe there was washing at my house on the 23rd; I believe I saw some articles hanging out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you take notice of every washing day? A. I took notice of that day - I only know these things by the mark; some things were stolen- if another table-cloth had been brought in with the same initials, I should not have sworn to that: I know these were set apart as those which had been stolen - I sent a servant to see if there were any missing from the garden, and there was.</p>

I live at 25, New-street, near the London Hospital—I know the prisoners, but did not know them before 21st March—on 21st March they came and applied for a furnished room—they both spoke—I had a room to let, and a bill in the window—Beecher said that she had a friend from the country—I said, "Oh, have you, indeed"—she said, "You have a room to let, I think"—I said, "Yes, I have"—she said, "My friend requires a room as I cannot accommodate her for a week"—I told her the price of it, and Knight agreed to take it for a week—I asked her in the parlour—she asked me for pen, ink, and paper—I gave them to her, and she took down my name and address—she said that was for her goods to be brought there that night, that she had to go to the Euston-square station to fetch them—she paid a shilling deposit—I asked Knight what time she would be back, as I would get her room in readiness; she said about 9, she thought, and then they left—they came again about 9 o'clock—a cart laden with goods was with them; that surprised me rather, as I expected luggage—I said, "Surely you are not going to deposit those goods in my room?"—I referred to the quantity when I asked that—they were packages done up in a sort of brown holland wrappers—they took them upstairs between them—they did not sleep there that night—in answer to my question they said, "Why, is it not a large room?"—I said, "Yes, for the size of the house, and being a back room, it is"—that was all that took place—they locked the door, took the key, and left, leaving the goods there—Mrs. Knight said she</p>

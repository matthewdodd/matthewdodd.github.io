             applied to me early in March, on account of ill-health - I gave him medicine, and attended him up to the time of his decease. On the 22d of April, I saw a mark under his left eye; it was a considerable bruise, apparently from a blow - leeches had been applied to it before I saw it. He complained of no other mark; there was no other external mark. Previous to this, he was under great debility, and indigestion. I continued to apply remedies until his death - I thought nothing serious whatever from the mark on his eye. On the 1st of May, about one o'clock, I was called in; he was then very ill and sick, and complained of pain in the region of the stomach; he made no complaint respecting his head - he died in a spasmodic fit while I was with him. I opened the body with Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Lake. The membrane of the brain, on the upper surface, had suffered inflammation - there were sufficient diseases in the head, to lead me to suppose it might occasion death. There was an adhesion of the outer membrane, and the outer surface of the scull. External violence would produce those appearances. I opened the body; the heart was in a very diseased state with a quantity of bloody serem; this might have produced all the appearances in the head. The heart had doubtless been diseased for a length of time, and might have produced the inflammatory appearance on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person was suffering from the disease in the heart, and received external violence, might it accelerate his death - A. Very probably. I think the wound under the eye had very little to do with it, for he made no complaint of it; it appeared no more than a common black eye - a blow on the head might have accelerated his death. I examined the back part of the scull - there did not appear any bruise there. I think the serem on the heart was not produced by violence. A person in this state would suffer more from a blow than another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he had received a blow, so as to produce inflammation, would it not have produced pain, which he would have complained of - A. I should certainly think so. The appearance in the head might arise entirely from the state of the heart.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Fore-street. I was present when the body was opened, and fully agree with Mr. Wadd's statement. A person in that state of body receiving a violent blow was likely to accelerate his death, and if he was intoxicated at the time, it would be more likely to be in a state of inflammation. Intoxication alone might have caused it.</p>

On the 20th or 21st of April, I was sitting at my table with Tate, who was a good deal in liquor - he had an altercation with one Barnstaple - in consequence of which the prisoner interfered. After some words had passed between them, Tate was removed by Smith to his own seat, and we prevailed on him to be quiet. Some conversation passed between the prisoner and somebody, and Tate said,</p>
               <p>"It's a d - d lie," or</p>
               <p>"It's a lie," I do not know which. The prisoner at that time was sitting on the opposite side - he immediately came across the ward, and struck Tate, who was sitting at the table with his arms folded; he struck him on the left cheek, and another blow on his head; immediately after Tate received the blow, his head fell on the table, as if he was stunned. The prisoner collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you come out, and face me like a man?" No more blows passed - Tate said nothing. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't strike a man who is sitting down, it is so unmanly;" I prevailed upon him to let him alone. I believe his nose bled but he was subject to that. The prisoner went to his own side of the ward. Tate sat as if in a stupor for four or five minutes - his face was swollen immediately after the blow. When he came down stairs next morning he complained of his head, and afterwards, and particularly on the day he died. We prevailed on him to go to the sick ward on the day he died; he had not complained of his head before the blow; but he had complained of being bilions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He complained of his head every day did he - A. Yes. I saw him drunk frequently after that.</p>

            . I was a prisoner at the time, and saw this quarrel. Tate was sitting down at the time the blow was given - he called Latham a liar, twice; he said if he called him a liar again, he would strike him; he did so, and Latham hit him on the side of his face - Tate said</p>
               <p>"Very well, Mr. Latham, I thank you." I went away in about half an hour, he was then sitting there.</p>

            . I was a prisoner at the time. I heard a quarrel between the deceased and Barnstaple - hasty words arose, and Latham said something to Tate, that he had no business to interfere; in consequence of which Tate went, and sat down in his own seat, with his arms crossed, leaning his head back. Something more passed. Tate called the prisoner a d - d liar; he instantly moved, and struck him, saying he would suffer no man to call him a liar; he struck him on the left eye - I did not see that it had any particular effect, except bruising his cheek. He sat up, and said it was unfair; he was intoxicated at the time - they were violent blows. I saw him next day with his face tied up. I was in the room for half an hour after; during that time Tate got up, and walked about as usual. I saw him intoxicated several times after that.</p>

            . I was in the prison, but was not present at the quarrel. After the death of the deceased, I went over to Latham's ward to see a friend; I told the prisoner it was a pity he had not conducted himself differently, in consequence of the death of the man; he said he did not see any reason why he should not play as usual; and that he had not caused the man's death; and if I had said the same to him, he should have served me the same.</p>
               <p>MR. E. LLOYD. I am a surgeon, and live in Falcon-square. I was present at the opening of the body; there were appearances of inflammation in the head, and of bruises under the left eye, but no appearance of any other external injury; the dura mater appeared of a darker colour than usual, and a greater adhesion than natural; this was produced by inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. Might the inflammation he produced by external injury - A. Certainly; the appearance might be occasioned by the state of the heart, but in my judgment no to that extent; there was a greater appearance of blood on the back of the head than usual. It was stated that the blow he received drove his head against the wall, which might have produced those appearances. When the brain is affected in consequence of the heart, the vessels easily become full, but in this case they were fuller than they would usually be from that. I think the inflammation was not wholly occasioned by the state of the heart; intoxication would produce the same effect as the influx of blood from the heart; the blow would have been a sufficient cause to produce it. Though I have no doubt but the blow accelerated his death, still I think it would not have happened had not disease previously existed; he might have lived some months under the disease.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are supposing a blow given which caused a counter-blow on the back of the head - A. Yes; the blow under the eye might have caused it; intoxication would not occasion such appearances. I never saw him before death, but can say he had not apoplexy, for appearances of that may be traced years afterwards. Intoxication in his state might occasion death.</p>

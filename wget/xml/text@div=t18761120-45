                  </hi>. I live at 1, Holloway Court, Whitechapel—on Sun day night, 12th November, I went to the door of prisoner's room, it was locked—I was talking to the deceased at the window—I went in by the door—she was alone—the prisoner went in at the same time—his brother-in-law and a man named Boyce were with him—he asked the deceased several times to go back to the christening from where they came—she refused, she said she was going to bed and would not go; she put her hand to take off her boot and the prisoner struck her in her mouth; she fell with her head on the floor, and the prisoner walked to the door—I picked her up in my arms and placed her head in my lap, and asked for a jug of water—tho prisoner got the water and gave it me—I gave her a drink and bathed her face and gave the jug back to the prisoner—I then stood her up on her feet—she said "Oh! Kitty, Kitty, Kitty," and dropped her head on my shoulder—then I found, her getting so heavy I was forced to let her go and her head struck the bedstead—the prisoner then said "Kitty, she is too heavy for you, let me get hold of her by the shoulders and you take her by the legs," and he helped me to put her in the bed—I said "For God's sake, go for a doctor"—he and Mary Ann Barry went, no doctor came whilst I was there—the woman died before I left the room, about half an hour after the blow was given—I cannot say whether it was before the prisoner went to the doctor—when she got so weighty in my arms I thought death was drawing nigh—she became weighty in my arms before her head struck the bedpost, she</p>

               <p>seemed as if in a faint—when I stood her up and she exclaimed "Oh! Kitty, Kitty, Kitty" and dropped her head on my shoulder I looked at her face and she seemed all right, only her eyes were fixed at me—I could not hold her longer and I let her fall, and her head struct the bedstead, I did not see what part; it was a wooden bedstead; I heard the sound of the blow on the bedstead; she fell very heavy—when I let her fall and her head struck the bedstead the prisoner said "Oh, good God!"—she was a big, heavy woman rather, not so-tall as myself, but bigger.</p>

Prisoner struck her in the mouth when she was taking off her boot; he only gave her the one blow; whether she raised her head or not I cannot say; it was an open-handed smack; I could not say whether it was with the back or the front of his hand; her head struck the floor; she was just by the bed side; there was no carpet.</p>

I live at Garden Court, Whitechapel, on the first floor—the prisoner and his wife lived on the second floor—last Sunday week I went into the prisoner's room about 10 o'clock—Catherine Brown, Sarah Withers, and the prisoner and his wife were there—I heard a few angry words between the prisoner, and his wife and I came downstairs; the quarrel was something about the christening—she came home and he wanted her to go back; she said she would not—she was going to take off her boots—she was standing up near the bed—he struck her on the face with his fist and she fell backwards on the ground and laid there a few minutes—Brown and the prisoner picked her up and she seemed to turn all sorts of colours—Brown then said to him "You had better run for a doctor"—the prisoner helped to pick her up—that was before she was put into bed—he and I went for a doctor—I did not see her put into bed—I was not in the room when they lifted her and did not hear her fall with her head against the bedstead—when I came back they had her in bed, and she was dead—I was only away a few minutes—I said "Polly, I think she is dead"—she seemed to turn all manner of colours—I was there when she died; it was about ten or twenty minutes after the blow.</p>

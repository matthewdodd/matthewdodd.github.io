               <p>THOMAS RADFORD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a servant to MR. Bold; On the Friday, the day before the property was lost, I saw the three prisoners on board the lighter; they were taking a few plumbs in their hands, that was all I saw them do; I had some suspicion taht there were some baskets concealed in the lighter, and, on Saturday night, I told Mr. Davis, and he got a key, and I went on board with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you observed them on board the lighter? - A.About a quarter of an hour; we found eleven baskets in the locker, we left them there, and locked them up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. Alley. Q. You saw these men tasting the plumbs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is thing you all do, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no key to this lock but the one that Davis had? - A. Yes, they all had keys.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis. I went on board the Cazinove with the last witness; I unlocked the locker, and found eleven baskets of raisins.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the place where raisins were likely to be found? - A. That place had nothing at all to do with the bulk of the raisins that ought to have been put into the lighter; I locked them up again, and left them exactly as they were; I set Mr. Wilson, another clerk of Mr. Blot's and three others, to watch the lighter; I was with them; we watched from the accompting-house window, where we could see the lighter, that was on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Then you might suppose that there was some robbery going forward? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Bolt: In consequence of information, I took my place upon the staircase of the accompting-house, about five o'clock in the afternoon, where I could see Mr. Bolt's Fghter; I was about eight or ten yards from it; Mr. Davis was with me, Mr. Penford; Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Reece; I saw the prisoner go down into the Cazinove; he walked all round the lighter, and then returned; very soon after, the three prisoners all came together; and went on board the Cazinove again, and loosened the headfast and sternfast, and got her away from the wharf into the stream; I desired Davis and Penfold to stop at Billingsgate; Wilson, Reecc, and I, got into a wherry, and followed as fast as we could to the stairs, and passed the lighter as she was at Ralph's quay; I saw the three men in her when I left Fresh wharf; I lost fight of her five or six minutes, while I was getting into the wherby.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Have your lighters business out of a night? - A.Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them at Ralph's quay; what did you see next? - A.They hauled her up to Dice quay, along-side the William of Aldborough, a Suffolk Vessel; I then desired Reece to row the ashore, for I thought they were then going to take the baskets on to the wharf; I then went on shore, and on to the wharf; I then went over the vessels to see if she was still by the side of the Aldborough vessel, I found she was gone; I then went over some other vessels, and found her along-side the Hawk, of Deal, the three prisoners were in her then; I then went to Smart's quay, and waited there some time, then Reece came to me, and I told him to row about till he found her; she was then gone from along-side the Hawke; I then went on board a Yarmouth vessel, called the Hope, of Deal; in three or four minutes, I saw Saunders hail the Cazinove lighter out of the dock; he then led her along-side the Hawke, of Deal, again; I then went to look for Mr. Bolt, to know what was to be done; I could not find him; I sent for an officer, and saw them coming out of the gun-tap; we followed Saunders and Cole, and took them in Salutation-court.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How long was this after you had seen them on the river? - A. I dare say half an hour; they said they did not know what they were taken for, they were delivered to Green; we did not apprehend Barton till last Monday, at Spice lslands; after we had apprehended the prisoners, we went out, and found ten baskets of raisins inside of the Hope of Deal, and one basket outside, the ten laid between the Hope of Deal, and the Hope of Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.There were five of you set to watch this evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were provided with arms, I take it for granted? - A. I took a pistol with me when I went on the water.</p>
               <p>Q. If the lighter had remained where she was, if they had not hauled her out, would not she have been a-ground? - A. No, she can never be a-ground there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that those men were the three prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180018"></xptr>Q. How do you know that? - A. I know them very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see their faces? - A. Yes; I can swear to their features.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a good many barges about at this time? - A. Yes; at one time I was so near to Saunders, that I turned round, and was afraid of being discovered; I have known Cole working for us for some years, and Saunders has worked five months with us.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Where was it that you last saw all the prisoners together on board? - A. While the Cazinove lay along-side the Hope, of deal.</p>
               <p>JACOB REECE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was with Mr. Johnson upon the watch at Freshwharf; I saw the Cazinove lay along-side the Hope, of Deal, at Billingsgate-dock; I afterwards saw her shoved out along-side the Hawke, it was dark, and I did not see any body on board her when she was at Billingsgate-dock; but when she was shoved out, I saw the prisoner, Saunders, on board; he shoved her out, and made her fast along-side the Hawke.</p>
               <p>JAMES CUTHBERT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was on board the Hawke, on Saturday night, the 7th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners? - A. I know one of them, Cole, he came on board our vessel, and enquired for the Hope, that was between nine and ten o'clock, there were two more with him, but I don't know them; they made the lighter fast to our vessel, and then came on board our vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Cazinove? - A. No; Cole asked me for my master, Thatcher; I told him my master was not Thatcher, but Hill; then I hailed the Hope, and Cole was going to throw me over-board, because I made such a noise; he called me a young b-r, and if I did not hold my tongue, he would knock me to hell.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. How long have you known Cole? - A.Ever since he failed in the Hawke.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that? - A.Six months.</p>
               <p>Q. You were before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked there to pick out the man that spoke to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember who you picked cut at that time? - A. Cole.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect yourself - Did you not point out Saunders as the man who spoke to you? - A.They all three spoke to me about making a noise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How came you to point out Saunders? - A. I knew him by his great coat.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to say just now, that the only one of the three that you knew was Cole? - A. I knew Saunders by his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, knowing that man's life is at stake, that Saunders was one of them? - A. Yes; he had on a fustian great coat; and when he was before the Lord-Mayor, he had the same coat on.</p>

On 7th September I was on duty in Plough-road, Rotherhithe—between 11 and 12 o'clock I heard cries of "police I" and "murder!"—I went to the spot, and saw Thomas struggling with the prosecutor, who was on his back—Thomas was in a stooping position, with this knife, and the prosecutor had hold of him by the shirt Thomas had the prosecutor by the neck—I caught Thomas's hand and pulled him back and took this knife from him—the prosecutor was sober—his eye was closed up, and he was bleeding from the side of the face; he was grently knocked about—he said, "Policeman, save my life"—when I took Thorns I heard the sound of two parties running away in an opposite direction—I picked up this cap—Cavanah saw me taking it to the station, and said, "That's my cap."</p>

When we left the public-house Calan asked us to go home and have some tea with him—I told him no, it was rather late—I saw he was rather tight, and I would not go home with him—he said, "Are you going aboard a ship?"—I said, "Yes, we are"—he said, "Come along with me my way, it is all in your way, it will make your way shorter," and I found that it did—we all three followed him—I was walking with Thomas, the prosecutor was walking with Cavanah—the pro<lb></lb>secutor blamed some one for putting their hand in his pocket, and Cavanah said, "It is not me, I hope you don't think it is me;" the prosecute said, "You are a liar," and then they had a fight—I do not know which struck first—</p>

He said he wanted to change a pound note, and he would give me something to drink. I told him not to change his pound note for the sake of a glass of liquor, for I would pay for one for him, and accordingly I did; I went to a wine-vaults with him, close by Duke's place; we had two glasses of gin, for which I paid.

I then saw the other prisoner, he was standing at the corner; I don't know where he came from; he called out is that Isaac; the prisoner who was with me answered it was. Then the other prisoner asked him what he had got, and he said it was all prime. He was leading me by my arm, and was undoing my shawl, which was wound round that arm; the shawl was round my neck, and he threw the end of it over my shoulder, and the other prisoner ran off with it; then he held me against the wall, and rifled my pockets; I found his hand in my pocket; I called out "watch! watch! stop thief!" I had a cotton shawl, a pair of new cotton stockings, and a three shilling piece, in my pocket, but I did not miss it (the three shilling piece) until I got to the watchhouse. When I called out."watch," Moss Jacobs called out, stamp her b'oody guts out, I held the shawl that was round my neck as long as ever I could. Davis said nothing at all, all the time, only he strived to get my pocket off. He had not time to take the stockings, by the watch coming to my assistance. I never saw either of them before, only one called the other Isaac. I followed Isaac, and saw the house he went into. It was very foggy at the beginning of the night; but at this time it was light. It was under a lamp where he held me against the wall. Two watchman went to the house where Davis went into, and another watchman and I went to Spitalfields watchhouse. I told them there, what had happened to me, and came back to the house where Davis had gone into, and where the watchman were standing sentry at the door. The watchman asked me to describe Davis, and I told him he had a longish nose, and a ring in his left ear, a dark coat, a light waistcoat, and pantaloons. They took him, but let him go, as one of them knew him. I went immediately with the watchmen to his father's house, up a court, not far off the place; he was not in bed; he had his coat off; I said that is the young man who assisted in taking my shawl, and rifled my pockets. He then said he had never seen me. I gave charge of him to the watchmen, and he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

I am the watchman who first came up to the last witness, on the alarm being given; between the hours of eleven and twelve, I heard "watch! watch! stop thief!" cried; upon that, I went in the direction I heard the voice; when I got up to the prosecutrix, I found her stoopping up against the wall; I took hold of her shoulder, and asked her what was the matter; she said, she had been robbed. I asked her which way they went; she said that one ran up the court, and one went into a house, which she pointed out to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060006"></xptr>me. She was frightened, and I afterwards found she pointed out the wrong house, I told her to go to Spitaltields watchhouse, and I would stop, and watch over the door, and see that nobody came either in or out. While she was gone, I heard the door of No. I, open quite gently. I instantly went to the door; I saw the prisoner Isaac Davis, there, whom I told if he offered to come out, I would knock him down. He said, why, watchman, you ought to know me. I told him I knew nobody in the execution of my duty. At this time there was a young woman came down stairs, with a shawl thrown carelessly over her shoulder. He then came again to the threshold, upon which I gave him a shove back again, the second time. This young woman that I have mentioned, seeing me shove him back, went up stairs again, and I saw no more of her. I heard u great deal of whispering in the house, and I called an Aldgate watchman to my assistance; his name is

            . I am a watchman of Aldgate parish. At a quarter before twelve o'clock, on the night in question, the last witness called me; he was talking to the woman, who was the prosecutrix, just by New court; I asked her which was the house the man went into, and she told me the first house, and pointed it out. I then persuaded her to go to Spitalfields watchhouse, to get the officers down, and I pursuaded the other watchman to stay at the door, while I went the hour of twelve. When I returned, I found Davis at the door, and the other watchman would not let him come out. He called to me by the name of Bill, and said, you know me; I said, I did know him, and then the other man let him go. I knew where to find him; after that, the woman returned from Spitalfields watchhouse; I asked her then, which was the house the man went into, and she pointed out the house that Davis had come out of. She gave me a description of him; which answered that on which I apprehended him. I took her and the watchman to the door where the prisoner lived, and knocked at it; Davis came down to open the door, with a light in his hand; he was half dressed. I put the light to his face, and asked the prosecutrix if that was the man? She replied, it was. I then took him up stairs, and made him dress himself, and afterwards took him to Aldgate watchhouse.</p>

            . I am an officer. I know that woman, who appears this day, as prosecutrix against the two prisoners. I went into Aldgate watchhouse, and saw them brought in and I thought they had been brought in as disorderly. I asked the prosecutrix what brought her there, and she said, she had been robbed. I said, robbed! who the deuce would rob you? I asked her to explain? She said, she had been into a wine-vaults with a young man to have a drop of gin. She did not tell me where she had come, whether from Greenwich or elsewhere. She said, she had asked the young fellow to shew her the way into Spitalfields. I said, she knew well enough without asking any one. I asked her what she was robbed of, and she said her shawl. I asked her if she had lost any money, and she said no, for a good reason, because she had none to lose; she had nothing but an old pocket handkerchief in her pocket. I asked her in what manner she was robbed, and she told me that they took her to a kind of puddle, and she had her shawl over her shoulder, and somebody whipped it off, and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. The reason I had all this conversation was because I knew her well. I have had a deal of trouble with her, when she gets a hold of some person to treat her to a glass of liquor. I am a street - keeper, and am often called to remove her from different public houses. I have no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060007"></xptr>cause to come here to-day. I never dreamed of coming here until I was subpoened.</p>

            . I am also a street-keeper, and have been so for ten years. I was examined before. I have travelled the streets up and down during that period, and never saw her drunk or disorderly in the streets in my life. I was in the watchhouse from the time the prisoners were brought in until five o'clock in the morning, and never heard any communication of the kind that the last witness has spoken of.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence for the considerstion of the Jury, informed them, that if they only believed the prisoner Jacobs snatched the shawl from her, that would not be a charge of sufficient consequence to effect his life; however, the subsequent conduct of the other prisoner, would effect his; but if the prosecutrix tried to prevent Jacobs from getting the shawl, by holding one end of it, and resisting the attempt, if he succeeded in getting it, that would be force and violence enough to constitute a highway robbery.</p>

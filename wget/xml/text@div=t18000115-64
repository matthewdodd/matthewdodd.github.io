               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been out in the morning to buy some articles, I met a man who asked me to carry it for him, which I did out of compassion; Eyre told me their master was a very severe one, and he should lose his place if he did not come forward against me; he was obliged to say what his master pleased, or he should be turned away.</p>
               <p>Eyre. I never said any such words; I never said any thing like it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

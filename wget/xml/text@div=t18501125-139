                  </hi>. I Jive in College-place, Camden-town. On 17th Oct., I lived at 73, Brewer-street, Somers-town—it was my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Pancras—the prisoner was my errand-boy—I am a cheesemonger—I had one maid-servant—I went out that day—the girl always went home on Sunday after dinner, and staid till next morn<lb></lb>ing, while the prisoner stopped at home—I had in a cupboard 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and silver—I am positive there was one sovereign—I came home about a quarter before ten o'clock in the evening—I found no one at home—I went next door, and got in through the window—my money was gone, and no one was there—I had put on some firing previous to going out, and told the prisoner to keep up a good fire—he had left his waistcoat with a sixpence, and some fancy coins in the pocket of it, and his blouse—I did not see him again for a month—he had then got a new suit of clothes; I am positive of that, because he had paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off a suit of clothes in Liquorpond-street—I asked him how he came to go away, and take my money—he said he had not robbed me—my servant was sent for that night—her parents live in the next street.</p>

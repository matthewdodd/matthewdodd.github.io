                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Smith-street, Northampton street, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. On the 28th of August the two prisoners came to my house to take a loding—they looked over the house with my niece, and after that they called me, they said they were satisfied with them, and gave me a reference to No. 13, Catherine-street, Strand—Thompson wrote it in my presence—they gave their names as Johnson, and said they were brothers—this is the address they gave me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>,) "Mr. Johnson, 13, Catherine-street, Strand; from John, a quarter before six"—I was to call at a quarter to six o'clock to see a brother of theirs, as they said—I showed them out of the house—I think it was a little after four o'clock when they left—I left my house to go to Catherine-street about twenty minutes after five o'clock—I left my watch hanging over the back parlour mantel-piece when I went away—I saw it hanging there not a minute before I went out—I returned a little after eight o'clock—I found no such person in Catherine-street as they referred to—about a quarter of an hour after I returned, I went into the parlour to wind up the watch, and it was gone—I do not know the value of it—my husband said he gave eight sovereigns for it—it was a silver double cased one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's niece, and live with her. On the 28th of August the two prisoners came about the lodging—I showed them about the house—they went up stairs and when they came down, I took them into the rooms on the ground-floor, and also called my aunt, when they wished to see her—she was on the top of the kitchen stairs when I called her—they saw her in the front-parlour—they did not go into the back-parlour at all—they afterwards left the house, and my aunt went out for a reference—she left about twenty minutes after five o'clock, and the prisoners returned about six o'clock—I cannot say which was the first that spoke to me, but they asked me if my aunt had re turned—I told them she had not—they then asked me if I was sure she was gone to the Strand—I said I was sure she was—Thompson then asked me to lend him a pen and ink to write a note with, as he had seen his brother since he called—I asked them into the front-parlour, and told him the pen and ink was there which he had had in the afternoon to write the address with—they went there, and the pen and ink had been taken away—I asked them to take seats, and went into the kitchen—I left them standing—when I came back with the pen and ink, one was standing on the front-parlour mat, and the other just inside the door—Thompson said he would not write now, he was going as far as Islington, and would return again in half an hour—he asked me if I thought my aunt would ride home, or whether she was sure to come straight home—I said I did not know whether she was sure to come straight home—I said I did not know whether she would ride, but she was sure to come straight home—he them said, if my aunt came back before they returned, and was satisfied with the reference, she might expect their trunks to-morrow morning by ten o'clock—they went away—no one else had been in the house after my aunt went away—I had opened the door to no one but the prisoners—my cousin was at tea with me, but he went out at a few minutes to six o'clock, and I was then alone in the house, and no one else came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house, at 3, Osborne-place, Whitechapel—on 7th March, about half-past 1 in the morning, the prisoner came in for a bed, the price of which was 3½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me a bad florin—I returned it to him, and told him to take it elsewhere—he said, "What am I to do? I shall have to walk the streets"—I asked him to let me look at the florin again—I took it, and said, "You shall never again tender this elsewhere, for I will destroy it"—I held it over the gas-burner, and the metal ran down my fingers—I then put it in a shovel, placed it over the fire, and it melted in less than a minute—I threw the refuse down on the oil<lb></lb>cloth, and told him to take his florin and leave my door—he left, but was rather noisy outside, and a constable brought him back, and asked if I would charge him, which I did—he said that he received it at, I think, the Bell in Thames-street—I picked up part of the metal, and the constable the rest—I saw the prisoner searched at the station, and another bad florin and 3½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper was found on him.</p>

               <p>money elsewhere, as he did not require to have him looked up—the prisoner said that he should have to walk the streets—I afterwards saw him outside the door—I took him back to Mr. Davis, who gave him in custody—I picked up some of the melted metal—when the prisoner got outside the door, he put his hands in his pockets—I took one hand, and Mr. Davis the other, and we went towards the station—going along, the prisoner said that if he had known it was bad, he would not have uttered it there, but elsewhere—I found on him a bad florin and 3½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him it was bad—he said that I might have put what I liked into his pocket while searching him.</p>

                  </hi>. This florin is bad—this metal is the same kind that the florin is made of—there is more tin in it than usual; but the make is not so good, because the metal is rather hard; the coin would not be so likely to deceive the eye, but it would be harder to bite, and it would sound sharper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. This is nothing but spite on the part of the prosecutor towards me. On the Saturday previous, I was at the Old Cranes with a brush and broom hawker, who I recommended to the prosecutor, and he bought two brooms of him, thinking they were hair; but when he got them home, he found they were only made of grass, or fibre, and were of little or no use. I saw them next day in the prosecutor's parlour, and laughed heartily at his being taken in, though I had no ill-will against him, and he looked very hard at me. On the following Wednesday, he took the opportunity of being revenged on me. I gave him a florin; he took it on one side, and presently he returned, put a florin on the wicket, and said that it was bad. I said that I was sorry for it, and was not aware of it, and that I took it at the Bell. Being a little-the worse for liquor, I did not know that I had sufficient copper to pay for my lodging. He took it again, poured some liquid metal on the floor, and gave me in custody. There is no trace of a florin on it now, as it is destroyed, and the prosecution must be destroyed with it. When the policeman searched me, I asked him to allow me to look at his hands previous to his putting them into my pocket, but he would not. He said that the florin was bad before he tested it.</p>

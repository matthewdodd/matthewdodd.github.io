                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Wiggins, a tailor, and live in Peartree-street, Goswell-street. On the 12th of July, two days before this happened, I had lent one Morris a half-crown—on Saturday evening, at a quarter-past ten o'clock, Morris sent for me to the public-house, opposite our house—I went over to him, and he paid me the half-crown—I was quite sober—the prisoner came in about half an hour after I went in—I had been talking to Morris, his brother, and his brother's wife—the prisoner was quite a stranger—he came into the house with a pint of porter in his hand, and dashed it on the table-part of it went into my lap—I had a half-crown in my hand—I looked round at the prisoner, and rose out of the chair to shake the beer out of my lap—he said, "You b-w-, what do you here?"—he laid hold of my arm, and threw me out of my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chair-maker. I had borrowed a half-crown of Mrs. Wiggins, and sent for her on Saturday evening to pay her—she came over at half-past nine o'clock, and I paid her—my brother's wife came in, and we had something to drink—Mrs. Wiggins was sober—the prisoner came in at a quarter-past ten o'clock—he worked about the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood, but was no acquaintance of mine—he brought a pint of beer from the front of the bar into the tap-room, dashed it on the table, and said, "Well, Ma'am, what do you do here?"—she said, "What is that to you?"—he said, "You w-, I will let you see presently"—she said, "Will you?"—he said, "Yes"—he went to the other end of the room, took a chair, brought it across, put it down, put his legs between hers, threw her down, he took her up, and flung her right out on the curb-if she had pitched on her head, she must have been killed—she got up, and asked him to give her her half-crown—he said, "I shall not give it to you; if you come near me I will do for you"—I did not see him strike her then, as the door was in his hand, and it opened in our faces—she ran home and brought her husband—the policeman was behind her husband when he came in-to prisoner then off with his jacket and waistcoat, and said, "You see what I mean, I mean fighting, and I am the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> for you"—the prosecutrix did not complain of being pinched till she was before the Magistrate.</p>

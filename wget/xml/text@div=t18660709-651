                  </hi>. I am a tin<lb></lb>plate worker, and live at 7, Victory Place, Wall Street, Bermondsey—on Saturday night, 7th June last, I was going home—whilst passing under the railway arch in Bermondsey Street I was suddenly prounced upon by three men—they forced me against the wall, tore away my watch, and threw me down heavily on the pavement—I became partly unconscious from the violence with which they threw me down—I believe the prisoner was one of the men, but I can't swear posi<lb></lb>tively to him—from the time I had to look at him I should say he was the man—I only caught a very transitory view of his face—I couldn't see the features of any of them—when I recovered myself I found the. watch was gone—the chain was hanging on.</p>

Q.</hi> You had been drinking, and were the worse for liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is right—I had been to the city on business—I was walking from Tooley Street, straight up Bermondsey Street, in the direc<lb></lb>tion of Bermondsey Old Church—this was under the railway arch—it is very wide, and very dark underneath—I believe the men came up behind me, and seized me behind—they got in front of me before I was thrown on the ground—I might have said, before to-day, under the sense of excite<lb></lb>ment, that I didn't see any of them, but I don't think I did—I had never seen prisoner before—I saw him next at the police-station on the Sunday morning—I was sent for, I don't know whether it was by the officer in this case—the policeman asked me if he was the man who robbed me—I can't swear to him—he is like him—the robbery was be<lb></lb>tween eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 50, Under Street, Dover Road—on Saturday night, 16th June, I was in Bermondsey Street—I saw the prosecutor, and I saw the prisoner drag him down, snatch his watch, and run away with it in his hand—there were several other men with him—they struck the prosecutor and knocked his hat off—he fell down—he was on the ground when the watch was taken from him—the prisoner was standing in front of him—the prisoner ran away first—the others didn't follow directly—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I can swear to him—it was underneath the gas—I helped the prosecutor up, and took him to the station—another man, who was going by, helped me to take him to the station.</p>

            . I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your stand near Doyle's stall - A. Yes, it is part of my beat. On the 8th of February, I was calling half after four, I saw a basket between Doyle's stall and another stall; I called Sheene, another watchman. I said there were thieves there; as we went round we found fifteen basons deposited in a place not far from there, and four salt cellars; they were about sixty or seventy yards from Mr. Doyle's place; I left my brother watchman to keep watch for who should come for this earthenware; while I went and called Mr. Doyle to let him know that his place was broken open; as I was going away my partner called to me and told me that he had stopped a woman towards the earthenware; when I came up to Sheene I found it was the prisoner; my partner asked her where she was going at that time of the night; she said she came from Charles court in the Strand, she was going out to wash in Hatton garden; he asked her to shew her hands; her hands looked dirty, not like a washerwoman's hands; I told my partner to keep her in custody till I brought Mr. Doyle; we took her in the watchhouse and searched her; in her pocket we found two salt cellars and a knife; Mr. Doyle believed the salt cellars to be his. The prisoner said she was going through the market she picked them up. The padlock had been forced off Mr. Doyle's shop.</p>


               <p>- SHEENE. I am a watchman in the Piazzas, Covent garden; as I was calling half past four, the last witness told me had he found some earthen ware, when I came to him he said there was an empty basket, he believed the people had been robbed; looking further we found these basons; a quarter before before five the prisoner was coming round Mr. Bailey's shop in the road; I observed her turn back when she saw me. I followed her and took her in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her meddle with the earthenware - A. I did not; before she altered her direction, she was coming towards the earthenware; when I stopped her I asked her to go with me; she entreated me to let her go, she was going to washing in Hatton garden, and she came from Charles court in the Strand; I asked her to shew me her hand, her hand was quite dirty; we took her to the watchhouse and searched her; these two salt cellars was in her pocket and a knife; she first said she lived at No. 14, and then No. 7; we went to Charles court, we could not find what part of the court she lived in.</p>
               <p>Wren. Before I called Sheene I heard a foot go through the market; I went after him, he was about twenty yards from me; he got towards James street; I did not know of any depredation being done at that time; I thought I had no right to stop him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through the market, I picked up the two salts; the knife is what my boy cleans the shoes with; I have four children.</p>

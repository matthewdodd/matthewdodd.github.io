                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, at 11, Greek Street, Soho—on 26th July last, the prisoner came and wished to borrow some money on some furs—he brought forty-three sables, a gold watch, and a ring—I asked who he was, and he produced this bill head; I then asked him as to the value of the property—he produced this invoice and said it represented forty of the forty-three sables that he brought—I remarked that the invoice purported that the sables had tails, and those he produced had no tails—he said he had cut off the tails and used them in his business for muffs, &amp;c.—I said that the invoice represented forty, whereas the goods offered were forty-three sables—he said he had brought three sables from his stock—I then lent him 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this agreement note; I lent the money, believing that the forty skins cost 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before I lent the money he signed this agreement note. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 26th July</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">signed "M. Bernard Co.</hi>, 3, <hi rend="italic">Princes Street, Finsbury"</hi>) He showed me a letter or telegram and stated that he had to take up an acceptance which had been dishonoured—I am a judge of the value of jewellery—the value of the watch and ring is from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after he had got the money the skins were done up in a parcel and sent, upstairs into the warehouse, the. jewellery was done up with the invoice and sent downstairs into the plate-room, and the ticket No. 802 was pinned on to the skins, which number corresponded with the number of the agreement which the prisoner signed—at the expiration of the term the goods were sent to public sale; but there was no bid for them—I went to Mr. Davis, and afterwards went to the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I advanced the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., believing the skins cost 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have a good many establishments at the West-end—I have not a good deal of experience in furs—the prisoner came to me three times—he pledged furs on two occasions, this was the first transaction: he came and. had</p>

               <p>another loan of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have four assistants on the premises; I advanced the money without inquiring as to the value of the furs, that is not the way I generally do business, but my manager was away on his holiday, and therefore I had nobody I could send out—I thought I had a good property from the representations made—"Bernard Co." I presume means a partner; I don't know it of my own actual knowledge that he had a p partner—I have not tried to find out, or inquired—I found out that the invoice was a fraudulent one after I had sent the goods to sale, I first found out that the furs were not of the value, I supposed—he did not leave some of the goods with me first of all for me to look at—he came into my private office—he was there from fifteen to twenty minutes—from three to five days elapsed between the first and second time of his coming—I believe he brought all the 120 skins together to me on the second occasion—perhaps I said before the Magistrate that he first brought eighty and forty subsequently; if it is put down I presume I did say so—any fool would know that the tails were gone from the furs—the skins are all here—I will not say that this was the first transaction in skins that I ever had, but it was the first one I can remember, certainly the first to this amount, I may have had a skin for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something of that sort—shortly before this I had a great quantify of sealskins left, but I did not lend any money on them, they had been in the house ten years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He produced an invoice on the second occasion—I have not got back my 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the third time he came I believe was on 3rd August, and he wanted some more money lent; I did not see him then; I implicitly believed in this document, without such a document I would not have parted with the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not advance anything on the third parcel of skins; I kept them—they were perhaps of the value of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have kept them up to this time and refused to give them up—I may have said that his partner brought the third lot.</p>

               <p>ornamental fire-papers—one was brought up stairs, and I would not have it—I went down stairs to see if my cloak and coat were in the passage, and the coat was gone—I looked out, and saw the prisoner running along the square with something under her arm, and bulging out by the side of her basket—she ran as fast as she could, and got round the corner to White Horse-lane, and down towards Trafalgar-square—when I got round I lost sight of her—I made inquiries of a man, and then saw her walking down a street—she saw me, and ran, and I ran too—she got round the corner, and when I got round she was stopping—I accused her of taking the coat—she said she had not—I looked into her basket, and there was nothing about her—a man on the opposite side pointed to some rails—I looked, and there was the coat—it was about a quarter of a mile from my house—I took her to the station—she first denied taking the coat, and then wished me to look over it, and let her go.</p>

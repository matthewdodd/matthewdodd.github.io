            . I am one of the patrols belonging to the police office, in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020035"></xptr>Q. How long have you been employed in that capacity - A. About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any directions that you received, did you see the prisoner on or about the 19th of November last - A. That is the first time I saw him. I met him at Harris's, Kings Arms-court, Whitechapel. I went to the house alone. I met with the prisoner. I was with him some time. We drank together in Harris's house. In the course of ten minutes the prisoner went out, and called me after him. I followed him. We walked up Whitechapel, and our discourse was talking about horses. I told him I was a dealer in horses. I asked him if he had got any one's. He said, no; he had got two's. I said, that will do. We walked on to the Queen's Head. He left me there for two hours. He told me the people in the house they were his partners. He told me, if I could find any place out, where there was plenty of property, to break into, that was worth breaking into, to let him know, I should have my regular share, and I need not be seen in it myself. Then he left me in the tap room for near two hours. He came back, and beckoned me out. We drank some gin together. He took me about forty yards from the public-house, under some palings, and there he gave me four two-pound notes. I gave him four one-pound bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the price - A. I was to give him four pounds seven shillings, for the four two-pound notes. That was agreed upon before; we made that agreement going along.</p>

               <p>Q. Then pursuant to that agreement you gave him four bank of England one pound notes - A. Yes, and then I gave him one more. I gave him five altogether. He went and got change of the one pound note, and brought me the change. He gave me thirteen shillings; then we walked together to Harris's house, and I was to have some more notes in a day or two. It was so agreed between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark the notes that you received of the prisoner - A. I did, before I parted with them to any body.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these - A. These are the four notes, with my name upon them.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18121202-48-person541">Q. </persName>
            How soon after this did you see him again - A. I saw him on the 21st in Whitechapel-road.</p>
               <p>Q. You first saw him on the 19th - A. Yes, and on the 21st I passed him. He came back, and overtook me. He asked me, if I had got shot of them. I told him, only two. I asked him if he had any more. He said, he had got plenty of all sorts. I told him, I would meet him on the Sunday morning, at eleven o'clock. I was rather beyond the time, and he was gone. I was to meet him at Harris's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see him on that day - A. No. On the 25th I saw him again. I saw him then in Whitechapel-road. I asked him if he had any notes. He said, he had plenty of all sorts. He told me, I might have them then. I gave the signal to my brother officer, and he was that moment taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your telling him you were a horse dealer he sold you these things - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you introduced to him by any body - A. I was, by a person of the name of Harris; by the person at whose house I met him.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes, at the Bank of England, and have been for twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you are perfectly conversant with bank notes - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these notes into your hand. Now, Mr. Glover, looking at the first note, a part of the four, is that a genuine note or counterfeit - A. It is a counterfeit note, forged in every respect; plate, signature, paper, and ink; all is forged. The whole throughout, in every respect, is forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, looking at all the rast of them, are they of the same manufactory, and the same plate - A. They are, even in every respect, the same as the first, a forgery. The signatures appears to be filled up by the same person, though different names. They are all the same hand writing. (The note read.)</p>

            . I am one of the Bow-street office patrols also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for the purpose of apprehending the prisoner, in consequence of any direction from any person - A. Yes. The apprehension I took upon myself. I received the information from the officer of the Bank, Mr. Westwood. I went part of the way with Dickens, and kept an eye upon Dickens all the way. I got into a public-house to hide myself, the King's Arms. I had a good sight of the court to watch Dickens.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you agreed upon any signal - A. Yes. I waited along time before the prisoner came. As soon as I saw Dickens in company with him. I got the signal in a minute or two; and as soon as I got the signal I got out of the house as fast as I could, and took him. They walked some distance, and were shewing some penny pieces, or pieces of coin to each other. I got the signal, and apprehended the prisoner. I searched the prisoner, and found on him one bank-note, and a knife. I was told the bank-note was a good one, when I showed it to the people of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. That is the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>COURT. Prisoner at the bar, you have heard the evidence against you; what have you to say in your defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>JURY, Q. to Dickens. What language did Harris introduce you to the prisoner - A. He introduced me, and said that I should have notes of Long Jack. I was introduced to the prisoner by Harris, and Harris's wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He would swear my life away falsely. I never had the notes, nor could any body say it of me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Prisoner, that is quite irregular: you have been called upon for your defence.</p>

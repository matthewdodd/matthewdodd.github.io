On Saturday evening, the 15th of last month, the shop was full of customers, my wife, son and daughter were serving as well as myself; I had just cut off a loin of pork for a customer which weighed three pound and a half, but not having that, he wished to have a piece that was larger, I cut him off one of five pound and when I turned to the scale to weigh it I heard the watchman call out stop thief, I turned round and missed this piece of pork which I had cut off before; the prisoner was stopped, taken and brought back with the pork immediately; I knew the pork.</p>

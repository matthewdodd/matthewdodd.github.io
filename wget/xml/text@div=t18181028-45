On the 12th of September my apprentice gave me information, and I desired him to watch the prisoner; he told me something, I fetched the prisoner into the parlour, and told him I understood he had robbed me; and if he had not, if he would turn his pockets out it would satisfy me. He refused. I observed him shifting gold from one pocket to another. I searched him, and found the property stated in the indictment on him, which is mine, and worth above 40s.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ORTON. I am the prosecutor's apprentice. On the 12th of September I saw the prisoner take some gold out of the pan, and put it in his pocket. I informed my master, and afterward watched the prisoner, and saw him put more gold into his pocket. My master brought him into the parlour, and found it on him.</p>

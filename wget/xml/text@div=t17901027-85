               <p>I live in Botolph-lane; I am a fruiterer. I know Levy; he came to my house the 16th of August; he bought a hundred and a half of lemons, which he paid me four and six-pence for; and I put the money into my pocket without looking at it; in a few minutes after another Jew bought some lemons, and in giving him change, I found his money was bad; the one and six-pence I had in my pocket was good to the best of my knowledge; but I did not notice it at all; the first time I did not observe them; about three or four in the afternoon, he came again; I then sent for the constable; and when he came, I ordered him to search him, which he did, and found some more bad money; the constable has it.</p>

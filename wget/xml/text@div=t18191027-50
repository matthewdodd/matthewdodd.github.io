I was all of a sudden stopped and hustled by a gang of fellows; they shoved me up against the palings - there was an immense crowd waiting to see an air-balloon go off. I was not among the crowd, but was surrounded in a moment, and felt a tug at my watch. I then went back to my chaise, which I had left in the road at a little distance, and inquired for a constable, who came. I told him I had lost my watch, which I at first thought I had; soon after I found my watch was left behind, but my chain and seals gone - I have no distinct recollection of any of the men. I gave the officer my address, and a few days after I was sent for to Worship-street Office.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'MURDO. On the 2d of October, between two and three o'clock, I was standing by some palings by the Belvidere, and saw a gang of fellows hustling every gentleman that passed. As soon as the prosecutor got out of his chaise, before he could hardly get on the pavement, the prisoner, Green, gave him a shove. Some more fellows came round him, and I saw Green snatch something from the prosecutor's fob, and go away - I cannot say what it was. The prosecutor thought at that moment that he had lost his watch, and said so; the rest of the gang kept the prosecutor in conversation, and said he was gone that way, but I saw him go the other way. As soon as the prosecutor got from the gang, I got down and said, if I saw the man I should know him again - I went down the road a little way, but could not see him. When I came back to where I was before, I saw the prisoner return to the gang. The officer then came to me, and I went with him to point the prisoners out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the other man - A. I saw him in the gang. Green held up his finger to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here, Bill." I had been on the palings, watching them, for about half an hour, and am sure they are the men - I suppose there were about twenty in the gang. When Green beckoned to Farmer, immediately turned and went to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. There were a great many collected to see the balloon - A. Yes. Green beckoned to Farmer before he took the chain - he stood close to Farmer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he need not have beckoned to him - A. His head was turned another way. It was done in an instant.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of October I and Gleed were in Pentonville-road; the prosecutor was in his chaise - some persons told him we were officers. He then said he had lost his watch-chain and seals. I told him to give me his address, and if I heard any thing of it, I would let him know. Just after that, M'Murdo came up, and said he would show me the two men who had robbed this gentleman. We went about eight or ten yards into the crowd, and he pointed the prisoners out. We took them and searched them, but found nothing on them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their case to their counsel.</p>

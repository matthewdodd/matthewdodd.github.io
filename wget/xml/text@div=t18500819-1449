                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Hunt, of Whitechapel-road, a cheesemonger; the prisoner was also a shopman. On the day this charge was made (I do not recollect the date) the prisoner asked me if I had a mind to make a couple of shillings—I asked what he meant—I do not recollect the exact words he used, but he wished me to take 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the till, and said he would make it right in the book, meaning the cash-book which he kept—he said he was to have a part of it, but I do not recollect the words he used—I said I would not do it—he asked me again if I would not do it, and then I thought perhaps the governor was trying me, and had set him to do it, and that made me say, "Is it a catch?" and he said, "No, by God! it is not"—he asked me once more—I considered, and said I would—I took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the till, and put it into my waistcoat-pocket—he afterwards asked me if I had got it—I touched my pocket, and said I had—the first opportunity I had 1 told young Mr. Hunt, and he marked the shillings, and gave them me again—after that the prisoner asked me to lend him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I gave him two shillings that were marked—in the evening Mr. Hunt came home, and I was called into the kitchen, where the prisoner and a policeman were—the governor asked me what I had to say, and I told him Wollard had persuaded me to take 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the till—the two shillings marked were lying on the table—these</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Thomas Willomatt Hunt, at 141, Whitechapel-road. On 16th July, Russell produced 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me, and made a communication; in consequence of which I marked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., returned them to him, and kept the other—in the evening the prisoner was called into the kitchen, a policeman came, and my father told the prisoner he had reason to believe he had been robbing him, or exciting a fellow-servant to rob him—he said he merely asked George to lend him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he threw the two marked shillings on the table—George is the last witness.</p>

Q.</hi> Was any one present when you marked them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only Russell, my father had gone into the country at six o'clock that morning—Russell told me of this when I came out from tea—I arranged that he should hand the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. over when the prisoner asked for it—I saw him hand something to the prisoner, but cannot say what it was—I was within two yards of them, on the same side of the counter as the prisoner—I did not hear him say anything—we only allow one man to go to the till—the prisoner could not go to the till without the others seeing him—the prisoner had given as notice to quit two or three times, but we took no notice of it—I have never been accused of any dishonesty by my father—he once men<lb></lb>tioned that a sovereign had been found in my room, but it turned out to be from my brother's pocket—my father did not accuse me of stealing it—that is near six years ago—I will swear it was not within six months—I made no inquiry about it—I and my father and mother have not been on bad terms more than is usual in large families—the prisoner had interfered with us about a fortnight or three weeks before this charge—I was <hi rend="italic">making away</hi> from my mother, and had hold of her hand—he interfered and separated us.</p>

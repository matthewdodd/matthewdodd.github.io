I returned to the Bull inn, about seven o'clock, and found him in the passage; he said, he had been waiting for me an hour; I said, I should be ready in five minutes; he said, he had got one of my great coats, because I should not go off without him, he was an entire stranger to me; I harnessed the horses in five minutes, and when I returned from the stable, he was gone, also both the coats and the matt; next morning, I went to the Bethnal-green, and saw the prisoner going by, and told him he was the man who robbed me last night; he said, he never saw me in his life. I dragged him into a pawnbroker's, and sent for an officer, he then gave up his keys, and Dyer found the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Was he not intoxicated - A. No; I never said, I believed he did not intend to steal them; he never told me where he lived; I had information, which led me to Bethnal-green. When I took him, he said, he would give them up, if I would pardon him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to a pawnbroker's shop, and found the prisoner there, he said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dyer, you know me very well, I am a respectable man in this parish, I know nothing of this concern at all, don't collar me." I said,</p>
               <p>"I would not;" I was taking him along the street, he said,</p>
               <p>"I will deliver up the keys of my stable, where you will find the coats, and in my house you will find the matt;" he then asked me to let him go, I refused. After locking him up; I went to his house, and found them, as he stated; he at first said, he knew nothing of the prosecutor at all.</p>

I had been waiting for the man a long time, I was elevated in liquor, and what possessed me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090039"></xptr>go away with them, I cannot say, I did not intend it; but I got on the coach, and intended to return them.</p>

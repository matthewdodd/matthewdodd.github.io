                  </hi>. I am a rope mat-maker. On the 14th of March I was in Bird-cage-walk, Bethnal-green, with a horse and cart—I had this mat rolled up, and a piece of bacon tied up in brown paper—I left my cart for a short time, and when I returned the bacon and mat were gone—this is the mat (<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

On the 14th of March, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in Bird-cage-walk, and fell in with the prisoner, who had a long cape on—I opened hit cape, and found this mat rolled up—he said he had bought it of a man a little higher up—I went with him to see who it was—he took me a long way, till he came to a person standing at a door, and said that was the man he bought it of, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—the man denied all knowledge of him, and said he had not seen him—the prisoner then said he should answer no more questions, and threw the mat down—I took him to the station-house.</p>

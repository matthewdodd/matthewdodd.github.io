               <p>Heley. The prisoner was tried along with one Williams, who has since returned and been executed. It was for a burglary in June 1767. I have known him these eighteen years. Upon the thirteenth of January, I think it was on the Sunday before last sessions, I took the prisoner.</p>

            . On the 13th of January, the day after Mr. Stratford's house was broke open in Grosvenor Square, I dispatched several persons different ways in order to look after the things stolen. I went into Gravel Lane, Houndsditch. I had been at several houses before I went there; to the house of one Valentine, who is a receiver of stolen goods. I saw the prisoner sitting by the fire; Heley and my brother was with me. I said, What Peak, are you here, I am sorry to find you here. He was then standing by the fire, he stood very much confused, and desired we would take him to his father's; he has often been desired to keep out of the way. I insisted upon their taking him to Whitechapel immediately.</p>

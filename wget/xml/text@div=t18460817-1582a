                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Frederick-place, Old Jewry—I was sent for last Saturday—I ran and found the deceased lying dead at the foot of the stairs, with a knife in her hand and a cloth over her neck, where the wound had been inflicted—there was a good deal of blood on the knife—the officer took charge of it—there was so much blood on it, it is impossible to distinguish whether that arose from blood dripping on it in. coming from the wound—I removed the cloth from her face, and found a large cut, about four inches, across the centre of, her neck, and about: two' inches deep, dividing the carotid artery and the jugular vein—the separatiow of that artery would cause almost instantaneous 'death—this black-handled</p>

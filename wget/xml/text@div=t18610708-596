               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My motive for giving a false address was that my wife had been confined with twin boys, and her old mother, upwards of eighty, came up to see her, and was at the house at the time. I have not been in that shop. I did not pass the florin there, whatever they may say. I changed half a sovereign the day before, and that is the only way I can account for it. It is not likely I should have acknowledged it to be bad if I meant wilfully to pass it. I said I did not know it was, I was very sorry it was.</p>

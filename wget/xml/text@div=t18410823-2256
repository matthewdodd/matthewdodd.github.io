                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper and haberdasher, and live in Church-street, Hackney. On Friday, the 16th of July, I had some boxes of ribbon on the counter—there was a blue box of ribbon, and also a white one—there was a common sort of ribbon in the blue box, which was soiled, remnants and short lengths—in the white box there was this description of ribbon now produced—a great many of them had never been cut, but some were shorter lengths—I was in the shop early on the morning of the 17th, when two men came in—I did not see the ribbons in the morning—I did not notice the boxes—the ribbons were missed on that Saturday—on the following Saturday I was passing along Shoreditch, and in the pri<lb></lb>soner's shop window I saw a blue box full of ribbons, which I recognised as mine—I called a policeman, and we went into the shop—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there, and asked to look at the ribbons in the window—he showed me two boxes of ribbons, before I asked to see the blue one—when he produced that, I took up one of the pieces, looked at it, and found my private mark on the card, inside the ribbon, partly erased—I told the pri<lb></lb>soner they were my ribbons, and asked where he bought them—he said he bought them of Cheaper and Co., of Wood-street, three months before, and he could show the invoice—he went and fetched some invoices—the policeman looked over part of them, but could not find any invoice to answer to that—I did not notice the date of them—he was then given into custody—the policeman took possession of the blue box and ribbons—this produced is it—a few days after the prisoner had been taken the policeman showed me some other ribbons, among which I recognised some of mine.</p>

On the 4th of December, my husband being in the country, my landlady asked me to let the prisoner sleep with me a few nights till she could give her a place. She slept with me on the 4th and 5th of December; on the morning of the 6th she went out for two hours, and returned about six o'clock at night. I was ill - She persuaded me to lay a-bed. She went out about six; she told me if I would lay down she would do my ironing for me. I slept-when I awoke I missed her and the property stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I lodge in the house. On the 7th of January I saw the prisoner in Drury-lane, with a large work-bag of things and a basket. I followed her down White Hart-yard, took hold of her arm, and said, "Caroline!" which was the name she went by at our house. She said, her name was not Caroline. I said she was the person who robbed Mrs. Bunting; she said I was mistaken, and wished me to go home with her. I took her into two shops, and begged of them to get an officer - They would not. I took her to Bow-street myself, and gave her in charge. There was a cap and a pair of stockings in her bag, which Mrs. Bunting claimed.</p>

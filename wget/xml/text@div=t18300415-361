            . I am a porter at the tavern. On the 30th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, my fellow-servant in the kitchen told me he saw a spoon and a fork behind the dresser; I said, "We will not take them away till we see who goes out;" and the first that went out was the prisoner - then we looked, and saw they were removed; I went, and found the prisoner in the street, and brought him back - the fork dropped from him in the passage, and I found the spoon up his trousers.</p>

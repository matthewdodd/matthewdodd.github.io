            . I am between thirteen and fourteen years old. I have known the prisoner since Bow Fair last year - I do not know his trade. On the 9th of November last I met him in Whitechapel, about six o'clock in the evening, by appointment - I was to meet him and James Bennet at the prosecutor's. The prisoner said, when we got to Keys's we were to go in and take the notes out of the till. Bennet went in with Munroe's hat on, and brought out a pocket-book, which the prisoner took away from him, and took it to his house-we all went there; when we got there we divided it-his house was in George-street - They both told the money out. The prisoner, I, Bennet, and Munroe-Munroe is a boy who was with us at Key's shop. We were together when the money was divided.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he divide it - A.We each had some. The prisoner took my money away, and bought me some clothes with it. The next morning he gave me some notes and a 3s. piece for my share - I do not know how many. There was some gold, which the prisoner had. There were two 7s. pieces, a half-guinea, and three guineas. The prisoner threw the pocket-book away in the backfield near Wentworth-street, by a sugar-baker's. He stood at the door, and said he would knock the gentleman down if he came out. About an hour after he gave me the money he took it away again. He made me stay with him that night. The next day he took me out about seven o'clock in the morning; he ordered a coach from a public-house in the Whitechapel-road, by Great Garden-street, and we went near Black Lion-yard, where he bought me a fustian jacket and breeches, a small striped waistcoat, and a hat; he paid for them, and bought himself a velvet jacket and breeches, and a striped waistcoat like mine-he paid for them in notes. We then went and bought a great coat for each of us, and a pair of stockings and a shirt for me, by Whitechapel watch-house-he paid for them in notes. We then went down Whitechapel-road, and bought two silk handkerchiefs, which he paid for in silver, and afterwards went back and changed a note for another. We went to a batter's in Whitechapel-road, and bought a hat for each of us - He gave 18s. for the two, and changed a note for them.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you take the coach - A. About one o'clock, after we bought the things. I do not know where I was taken to - We went to some of his relations; his mother went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Dolphin public-house, in Whitechapel-road - A. I know it by name, and was there in the course of that Monday, between one and two o'clock. The prisoner's relations lived in Black Lion-yard. We went to the Dolphin to have something to drink-it is near Black Lion-yard; he went first, and I followed him. He gave me a 3s. piece there. We were taken up on that night. I never got any of the money from him. I have been confined ever since. There was some reading at the end of the pocket-book - I should know it again if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not at home in bed when you brought me the money - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known him - A.Ever since Bow Fair, which, I believe, was this summer, but am not sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not have the money all night, and give it to me in the morning - A. No; you took it away from me in the morning.</p>

            . I keep a sale-shop in Whitechapel-road, next door to the corner of Black Lion-yard. On Monday, the 10th of November, about eight o'clock in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030015"></xptr>the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, alone, and bought a jacket for 18s., and a shirt for 5s. He went away, and returned again in half an hour with Duproy, the last witness, and bought him a fustian jacket and trowsers and a waistcoat - I believe Duproy has got jacket and trowsers on now - He paid me 16s., in silver, for them. I am sure he is the man - I knew him before.</p>

            . I live in Whitechapel-road. On the 10th of November I remember seeing the prisoner at my house between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, with a boy, whom I believe to be Duproy. He asked to see some silk handkerchiefs, asked the price, and went out; he returned again, bought two, and two pieces of ribbon to tie round their hats. The prisoner paid for them in half-crown pieces. In about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, he returned again, and bought another silk handkerchief cut off, and offered me a 1l. note. I told him I did not think I had change - He said I had taken some money of him, and could not want much to make up the change. When he gave me the note I asked his name and address; he gave the name of Johnston, Thomas-street, Whitechapel-road. I said, I did not know Thomas-street, Whitechapel-road - He then said, Thomas-street, Brick-lane, opposite Bacon-street-there is no such a street. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MOREHOUSE. I live in Whitechapel-road. I know the prisoner. On Monday morning, the 10th of November, he came to my house with a boy. The prisoner asked for a hat for the boy; I tried one on, and charged him 8s. for it. He came back again and had one for himself, which I charged 10s. for - He offered 17s. for the two, which I took - He produced a 1l. note; he gave me the name of William Seymour to put on it.</p>
               <p>HARRIET STEVENTON. I live at the Dolphin public-house, in Whitechapel-road. I knew the prisoner and Duproy. The prisoner came to my house alone, at seven o'clock in the morning of the 10th of November, and asked for change for a 1l. note - I refused it, not having it. Between ten and eleven o'clock he came again with his father - I believe he wanted change for a sovereign, I gave it to him. In the course of that morning I saw him in company with Duproy, and saw some money pass between them. I did not pay any attention to it, being busy. I did not know what money it was.</p>

               <p>On Monday night about nine o'clock, two lads came to me, and I went to the door; they asked me if I would buy a horse, and I told them yes; I live in Sharp's alley, Cow-cross; several horse-boilers live there; they said they had a horse; I asked them where it was; they said it was just by Bow, and said they would fetch it by two in the morning; the one nudged the other against the arm and said, you may as well tell him what it is, for it was a pegged one, that is, a stolen one, they said it was hurt in coming from Chelmsford, and must be killed; I knew one of the lads again, the prisoner Hornsby, I am sure he was one, the other was taller, but he kept at a distance and ran away; I did not see him so well; the watchman never gave me any assistance at all; I said I could say nothing to it without I saw it, and they went away; and as soon as they were out of my sight, I went and informed our inspector of the parish, Mr. Raffle, I told him word for word what had passed, and he told me to stop them; they came about one o'clock, and knocked at the door as if they would knock the door down; I looked out of the window, and they said, we thought you were dead; I came down and asked them where the horse was; they said it was at a distance; the watchman was come down the alley; a new cord was tied round the jaw of the horse; I said to the watch, take this lad to the watch-house; the watchman let him go; says I, where is he? says he, there he goes; I caught him; now, says I, I will take you myself; the other man got clear away; I pursued him to Mr. Chapman's back-window, on Saffron-hill; the watchman gave me no assistance; I begged him to tell me who the horse belonged to; the lad cried and said it was his first crime, and the horse belonged to Mr. Shirley, of Old-Ford.</p>

               <p>Do you know, with any degree of certainty,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100048"></xptr>whether the other is the same person that came with him or not? - The other was taller than him, but I cannot say with certainty, whether the prisoner, Harman, is him or not; I went the next day, and had the watchman turned out; I locked up the horse in my own stable; that was the same horse that the lad brought.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to justice Staples; Mr. Shirley came to me, and said, he had lost a horse; I went down to New Prison, to the prisoner, Hornsby, and I asked him a question or two, and he told me; and sent me to the house where the tall prisoner was locked up; I found him in a garret on Saltpetre-bank; says I, I want you for horse-stealing; he came quiet enough along with me; he owned it to me.</p>
               <p>What passed? - I asked him where he lived; says he, at Stratford, down by Bow; and he said, one Hornsby was along with him; and he was taken from Mr. Smith's in Cow-cross, at the time they took the horse on Tuesday morning; I asked him if he had not stole a horse; says I, do not you know one Hornsby; I took him before a magistrate; he owned it; I told him, says I, your pell is in New Prison; he said no more to me; he owned about taking the horse.</p>

               <p>What did you say, and what did he say? - he said, he was persuaded by his pell; I asked him if he did not know one Mr. Shirley, when I took him; he said, he did; then I asked him where he lived; he said at Old Ford; I said nothing about the horse till he came before the justice; then he said, him and his pell was together when they took the horse out of the Field; he said, he bought a penny cord; he said, he did not care, they could not hurt him; they did not catch it upon him.</p>
               <p>Did you or he say any thing else? - Nothing more till we came before the magistrate, there w he said, was taken in writing; there is no examination returned; I know nothing more.</p>

               <p>How long have you had it? - Ever since December; it is a black short tail horse; I am quite positive of it.</p>

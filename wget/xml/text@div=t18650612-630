                  </hi>. I live at 7, Plough-alley, Wapping, and am a coal porter—on Saturday night, 6th May, about half-past 11 o'clock, I was on a barge off Dublin Wharf—the prisoner came to work drunk—he was half an hour back of his time—one of his mates put him in the bottom of the barge for fear he should fall overboard—he went to work there, filling coals—he first quarrelled with Timothy Donovan, who then left the barge, and for<lb></lb>feited his night's work; after that he quarrelled with Jerry Sullivan, and then Dennis Driscoll came down off the ship's deck, and said, "Finn, you will not work, and you will not let anybody else work"—they both met amidships in the barge and had some words, laid hold of one another, and had a tussle or two—some man came up and stopped them, and they shook hands with one another, but five or ten minutes afterwards they went along the coals from the midships of the barge to the stern sheets, and we did not expect they would fight or quarrel any more, but they had a fall or two there, and before we were able to get to them the two went overboard</p>

I live at 6, Plough-alley, Wapping—I was on board the barge on this night—the prisoner was intoxicated—he quarrelled with some of the men, and Driscoll said, "You are quarrelling with the men; you will not work yourself, and will not let them work; if you want boxing I will box you"—Finn Raid, You are not man enough for that"—they laid hold of one another and had a fall or two in the bottom of the barge on the coals, and then they went on top of the coals, and had a fall or two more—they then went to the head-sheets of the barge and grappled, and I saw them go overboard, and saw the prisoner come up swimming from under<lb></lb>neath the ship—Driscoll was drowned—I saw his corpse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector.</hi>) On the 16th of Sept., about twelve o'clock, I was searching the house of Pickle, a marine store dealer, at Green-bank, Wapping—the prisoner came there with twenty empty sacks—he said, "Let me leave these things here till I come back"—he threw them down—I asked how he got them, and he ran away—I fetched him back, and asked how he got them—he said a man named Newman gave them to him—I went to the prosecutor, and then to Newman—I took him to the station, and in the prisoner's presence, asked if he knew any thing about the sacks—he said they were some of their sacks—I understood that Newman was in the service of Mr. Hinkley—the prisoner said that Newman gave him the sacks—Newman denied it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a coal-whipper, and live in Dyer-street, Gravel-lane. Between twelve and one o'clock I was passing Mr. Hinkley's house—I saw the prisoner sitting on the step of the door, and three or four men round him—I stopped, and asked if he had any work—he said, not at present;</p>

               <p>he expected some in an hour or two—Newman then came to the door, and asked him to carry a bundle of sacks and go towards Howard's wharf—the sacks were very much like these—I went part of the way with him, and then left him.</p>

               <p>Had you left it in charge of anybody? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was you gone? - About ten minutes, or not a quarter of a hour, and the basket was gone; there were eight quartern loaves in it, and in a little time after a gentleman came with the prisoner and the bread which I left in the basket; our shop is in Berner's-street; I can pick my own loaves out from five hundred, I work it; every man can know his own workmanship.</p>
               <p>Court. What in a quartern loaf? - Yes, I think so, we put a W upon it.</p>
               <p>Do not other bakers do so? - I cannot inform you, there is no particular mark further, but I can swear to my own workmanship.</p>
               <p>- WINTER sworn.</p>
               <p>I detected the prisoner with a basket of bread on his back, containing eight quartern loaves, in New Ormond-street, about a quarter past twelve; I suspected him to be a thief from the over hurry, and he seemed to be very much flurried; we stopped him, and he said he lived with Mr. Smith, in Baldwin's-gardens, I immediately replied, my lad, the very worst man you can pitch upon, he is a near neighbour of mine, I am sure you are not his man, nor it is not his basket, I am a baker and we will take you there; he consented to go till we came to John-street, then he objected to going, observing he had married a niece of Mr. Smith's, and it would ruin him; I took him there, and Mr. Smith said he knew nothing of him; Mr. Smith said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070158"></xptr> I have heard of a baker that did marry a niece of mine, but whether this is the man or no I cannot tell; he consented to go to the top of Berner's-street, where he declared he took this property from, I told him the best way for him would be to tell where he stole it, and he said -</p>
               <p>Court. Then stop a little; you went there? - Yes, we went there with some of the bread, and took him to Mr. Fisher's, and he owned the basket and bread, and the foreman likewise.</p>
               <p>Can you tell a loaf of your own making from another loaf? - Yes, I hope so.</p>
               <p>Does not it change in the oven? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>If you were to see them at another place how could you know them? - I could tell my own bread from one hundred, I do not imagine you understand it.</p>
               <p>If there is nothing but a W how can you know your own baking? - From the mode of working it.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw him carrying it down Ormond-street, and stopped him with the basket and eight quartern loaves, we took the basket to Mr. Smith's, in Baldwin's-gardens, the basket and bread were fetched away to Mr. Fisher's, and left there, the basket is here at the door; the account was as he has told you; I am a baker, and work for Mr. Simpson, in New North-street; every baker has a different way of working his bread.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose every baker could tell his own bread if he saw it twenty miles off? - I could tell my own workmanship, I should think it very hard if I could not.</p>
               <p>One of the London Jury. My Lord, every man can tell his own workmanship.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A man offered to give me sixpence to carry this basket, I went over the fields and down this street, and they stopped me, he told me he lived at Mr. Smith's, in Baldwin's-gardens, and when they went there, they found it was not the place, and I told them where I got it: they could only swear to one loaf.</p>

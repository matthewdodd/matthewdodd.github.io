               <p>Witness. He ought to have paid this in on the same day, but it is not down in the cash-book, but about a year and a half after this date, he paid 50l., which he stated was paid on account of this money, and I have no doubt he gave me a written memorandum of it - here is the entry of it in the cash-book, in the prisoner's hand-writing, "Nelson, Adam, and Nelson, 50l,"; the other 15l. 12s. has not been paid - there were particular periods at which he used to render a balance-sheet; here is his balance-sheet to Midsummer, 1826, and in this he has entered the sum of 65l. 12s., as due from them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where did you get this receipt from? A. From Mr. Stevens - I cannot tell whether they paid the money or not, but by the receipt- Mr. Weston has been dead about sixteen years; the prisoner was about two years in his service - I do not know on what terms he was engaged by him or by Mrs. Weston; he has been active in their service certainly - I did not ask him to make up his account, and to bring forward any sum of money which might be deficient, but there was an opportunity about Midsummer last, when Mr. Heard the executor, asked him to settle, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q.Were you present when the prisoner was called upon to explain his accounts? A. I have no recollection of it - I heard Mr. Stevens ask him respecting a deficiency in his accounts; he had then an opportunity of explaining any deficiency.</p>

            . The prisoner was a clerk in my house - he never accounted to me for this 65l. 12s., nor for any money; he should account to my brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any partner? A. No; the prisoner has been sixteen years in our service; he was engaged at 200l. a year - I never knew of any promise being made to him of his being one of the firm.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. SMITH. Q. Was the prisoner to make entries in the cash-book? A. No; he ought to account to me, and I entered it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his Defence, stated that the prosecutrix's husband had engaged him at a salary of 200l, to be advanced to 300l., which he had conceived himself entitled to, and had drawn at that rate - he also entered into a detail of business transactions which did not relate to the charge.</p>

            . I am a labourer at Edmonton. About two o'clock on Monday morning, the 10th of November, I was on duty as private watchman to Mr. Knight, at Edmonton - it was a dark dull morning - I observed a man driving what appeared to me to be a cow, very fast by my box. I spoke to him - he gave no answer. I went after him, and came up to the cow standing in the road alone. I went a little further, told the watchman, and the cow and man passed us - we followed - he and the cow were standing in the road. I said, "Halloo, my friend; where are you going to drive that cow?" He said, "To Smithfield." I asked where he brought her from? he said from Bury-street. I told the watchman to put up his lantern - I looked the man in the face, and knew him perfectly well - it was the prisoner. I said I knew him, that it was all right, and left him. I do not think that he keeps cows. He returned presently, running the cow back again - went a little way down the road, and passed us a third time, and went down a bye lane leading to Church-street - I did not particularly notice the cow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. BERNARD. - Q. It was a dark morning - A. Yes; I am not positive whether it was a cow or bullock - it had red sides, a white back, and white under the belly.</p>

            . I am watchman of Lower Edmonton. Between one and two o'clock in the morning I saw a bullock or cow, and man go by my box - I do not know him. I said, "You have got a short drove this morning;" and at two o'clock I was in Church-street, and heard something come down the Hyde-lane - I stopped; It appeared to me to be a man and a bullock, the same as I had seen before, and said, "What, has your bullock run from you?" He made no answer, but I took notice of the beast - it had two white spots under the horns, and a white stripe all down the back, red sides, white on the lower part of the tail and hock. I saw a cow in Fox's field three days after - it was the same, and had the same marks as the animal I saw in the lane. I only had a slight view of it, and do not know who the man was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had but a momentary view - A. No. I know the prisoner, but I do not know that he was the man - he turned his face towards the wall.</p>

            . I attend to cows and sheep. I was coming to town with some sheep, and met a cow at two o'clock in the morning, at Lower Edmonton - a man was close behind her. I do not know whether he was driving her. I saw by the lamps that she had two specks on the forehead, and two white horns, a white back and belly. I noticed her so much, because I mind one so much like her, but it was not mine - she passed me, and was running fast, but I made a step before her, and then she stopped. I am certain of the cow. I picked her out from the rest, in Mr. Fox's field, on the Saturday afterwards.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw her before that morning - A. No. I am sure it was a cow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Coker—we keep a beer-shop in Waterloo-terrace—the prisoner was in our service. On the night of the 21st of Sept., about half-past ten o'clock, I was in the yard at the back of the house—in crossing the yard I looked in at the back parlour</p>

               <p>window, from which I had a view of the bar, and saw the prisoner cross the bar-parlour, go to the till, and open it—I directly went in, and followed her into a little room—I heard the money jink—I asked what she was doing at the till—the denied being there—I had counted the money in the till about a quarter of an hour before—I went and looked into the till, and missed half-a-crown and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no money had been taken from or added to it in the interval—I told the prisoner what I missed—she denied it—I told her if she would give me the money she could go about her business—she would not, but strongly denied it till the police-man came in, and the money was found under where she sat—she asked me to search her—I found the half-crown and two shillings under the floor-cloth, near the chair where she sat—I saw her sit in that chair after leaving the till—she must have lifted up the edge of the floor-cloth—the chair stood quite at the edge—I got a constable, and gave her into cus<lb></lb>tody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was clearing away the supper things, and on coming out of the bar, I saw 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the floor; I took it up, and coming in again, I dropped the money; my mistress called me, and said I had been to the till, which I had not; she took up the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put it into the till, and took 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not; the policeman saw it there.</p>

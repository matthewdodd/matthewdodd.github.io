            . I am a beadle. On the 4th of November I was in Aldersgate-street, and saw the female prisoner, whom I knew before, standing at the corner of Falcon-street - she went towards St. Martin's-le-Grand, the other prisoner joined her; they walked together to the corner of Dean's-court - She left him, and turned up Angel-street into Mrs. Smart's shop, which is about twenty yards from where they separated - I was watching them - I saw her give Miss Smart a shilling; I went in and asked to see it - I found it was a bad one. I told the prisoner she had not left off her old tricks; she asked what old tricks? I told her I had her in custody before for offering a bad shilling - She then recollected me - I took her into custody, and went to look for the man, but could not find him; he could see me go into the shop. I took her to the Compter, returned and found the man standing at the corner of Angel-alley - I secured him. I told him he had sent a woman in to pass a bad shilling; he said, he knew no woman, and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket - I tried to keep it out. We had a great scuffle, during which five counterfeit shillings fell on the ground, I heard them fall. He would not say where he lived. He said the money was not his. The woman said her name was Smith. I knew him before by the name of Hughes.</p>

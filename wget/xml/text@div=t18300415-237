             At a quarter before twelve o'clock I heard a voice saying, "You rogue where is my watch?" -I ran and saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's hands; I took the watch from the prisoner's hand - the prosecutor said he did not know him, but the prisoner said it was given him to take care of; the prosecutor seemed quite sober - he said at the section-house that he took the watch from his pocket to take care of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never said I took it to take care of; I met the prosecutor, who was rather in liquor and fell down - I assisted him up, and the watch fell down; I took it up, and was in the act of giving it him, when the Policeman came up; he had the seals in his hand.</p>

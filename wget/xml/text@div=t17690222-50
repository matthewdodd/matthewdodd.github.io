On the last day of January, about two o'clock, he and I were in the warehouse at the Three Cranes by the water side, when Mr. Robinson came and gave us instructions what we were to do in the afternoon. I had taken some skins out of that warehouse, and carried them into another; coming in at the door, I heard something snap, and saw the prisoner at the farther part of the warehouse, where were four hundred martins skins. I saw him put something under his coat behind. I came up to him, and said, I believe you have been doing something you should not have done. I put my hand under his coat, and pulled out the martin's skin. (Produced in court.) I said, We have all of us been accused, things have been missing, and I am sorry you should behave in this manner; I will go and tell my master, and desire you would go out of the warehouse; he begged that I would not, and said that he never did such a thing before. I told him I could not nor would not conceal it. I got him out of the warehouse, and thought he would have come along with me, but he did not. I was by when he was before the Alderman; there he said he was never guilty of any such thing before; and he could not say but what I accused him with was right, and hoped they would take it into consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one skin missing of the number?</p>
               <p>Cowley. They were told over two or three times; there were but 399. This was broke from the string which went through the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he worked for Mr. Robinson?</p>
               <p>Cowley, He had been a servant there almost four years. I never saw him attempt such a thing before.</p>

               <p>I was the very person that counted these skins, and that strung them. Certainly, if I intended to steal them, I had better have stolen them when they were loose than when they were strung. I did not intend to steal it. I broke it with my foot, and upon hearing my fellow servant coming I put it under my waistcoat. I could not have worked with it there all the afternoon.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220035"></xptr> When my master went and rummaged my lodgings, he found nothing.</p>

               <p>J. Medwell. It is about five years since he married and settled in business, or he would not have left me. I took his brother when he went away, who has been with me ever since. I would find him employment, and trust him again, was he at liberty.</p>

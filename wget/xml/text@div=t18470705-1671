                  </hi> I am housekeeper to Mr. William Henry Greville, of No. 2, Herbert-place, Eaton-square, Pimlico—it is his dwelling-house—I came into his service on the 28th of Nov. last—I succeeded the prisoner, who was in the same capacity—I have never seen her but twice in the house since I have been there—she had no business to enter the house. On the morning of the 21st I came down a little after eight o'clock, and discovered that the house had been opened—I found the key of the area gate in the area, and the area door open; the scullery window was broken over the catch, and the window thrown up—I had left the area key on the kitchen table—the two doors were open—I missed a silver cash-box, a gold pencil.</p>

               <p>case, a pair of brass candlesticks, a bottle-jack, a shawl, and some white lining belonging to me—I had seen the cash-box the day before, and I believe the gold pencil-case also: I cannot say but I was the last person up the night before—I fastened the house at eleven o'clock—every thing was perfectly safe—I fastened the doors myself, which I found broken open in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> I am a widow, and live at the London-bridge tavern, Southwark—I think the prisoner first took a bed at our house about Nov. or Jan. last. On the 19th of May she came, changed her dress, and said she should not require a bed that night, but thought she should the next night; she did not come to sleep there till the 21st—I did not see her come into the house, but I saw her in the passage with three hampers, which she claimed as her property, and asked me to take care of them—they were not there before she came—I put them in the bar-parlour—I am quite certain nobody touched them—in consequence of something which happened, the policeman examined them on the 29th, eight days afterwards—they had been in the bar-parlour all the time—he found a bottle-jack, a pair of candlesticks, a spittoon, a copper coal-scuttle, and many other articles—I am quite sure the hamper had not been meddled with.</p>

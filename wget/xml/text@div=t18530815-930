On Saturday, 2nd July, about 12 o'clock at night, I was crossing Tower-hill—I was attacked by four men, and knocked down—Clarke was one of the men—I had a gold watch, a gold chain, and gold key in my possession—I had some struggling and fighting with the men, and knocked some down—shortly after they were gone, I missed my watch, the chain, and the seal—I had given 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch—I am certain Clarke was one of the men; he struck me—I saw the witness Hopkins there on that occasion—on 26th July I was at the Thames police court—that was the third occasion of my going—I recognised Clarke as one of the persons; I afterwards heard him speak—on the night of the robbery I heard him speak to his companions, and when I heard him speak I knew his voice again instantly.</p>

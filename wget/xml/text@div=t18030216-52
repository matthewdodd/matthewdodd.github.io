               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to you? - A. I cannot remember.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak to her first, or she to you? - A. I don't remember, we went to a house just by there.</p>
               <p>Q. A public-house? - A. No; I had my pocketbook in my pocket, when I parted with my friends, I took it out to pay my share of the reckoning, we had some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get supplied with that beer? - A. I don't know, and some gin; we were in a bed-room up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie down on the bed while you were there? - A. I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long you staid there? - A. No; going home, I missed my money, I returned back to the same house where I thought I had been in, I knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get in? - A. No; I went home, and went again immediately with my wife, and a man that lives just by, that I called up, and the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get in then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what you had in your pocketbook when you left your friends? - A. A two pound note, and a one pound note, a seven-shilling-piece, and, I believe, two shillings. We endeavoured to find the person that I thought robbed me, but we could not; I saw the pocket-book at the Justices.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there any notes in it at that time? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - I am beadle of St. John's, Wapping: On Tuesday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I was called out of bed to take charge of the prisoner; the prosecutor said he had lost a pocket-book; I asked him what it contained, he told me a one pound Bank-note, a two Bank-note, a seven-shilling piece, and some memorandums; the prisoner was getting change of a shilling for some liquor; she pulled out a purse that contained some silver and halfpence; I got the servant-maid and patrol to go with me into a back-room to search her; I felt something under her arm, I desired the patrol to take hold of her arm, and hold it out; I put my hand in her bosom, and found this pocket-book, and a one-pound note upon it on the outside; I went for the key of the watch-house, and while I was gone, the two-pound note was found; I received it from the landlady; I have kept them ever since; there are memorandums in the pocket-book, with bills of work done, and his name to them.</p>
               <p>Mason. I remember the two-pound note being torn in the middle as this is torn; I can swear to the papers and the pocket-book; some of the papers are my own hand-writing, and some other people's; they were in the pocket-book when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He dropped the pocket-book, I took it up, and wanted to go to him with it, but there was a drunken gang of people in the street, and I was afraid they would knock me down; I waited to give it to his wife, he was so drunk; he appointed a house to meet we with it; I went, and called for a shilling's-worth, and waited for him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mason.) Had you any conversation with her? - A. I don't remember any.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make any appointment? - A. I don't believe I did.</p>

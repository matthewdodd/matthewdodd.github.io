                  </hi>. I am treasurer of the parish of St. James, Clerken-well, and am one of the guardians of the poor—there are sixty-three guardians—I was one in 1838 and 39—I have been so ever since—the prisoner was a clerk in the office of Mr. Selby, the vestry-clerk, and was employed by the board to collect monies—the book now produced is the minute-book of the Board of guardians—here is the minute—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"31st August, 1830, Resolved that Mr. James Hill be collector of bastardy debts from Michaelmas-day next, for one year, at the usual commission, and that he pay over to the treasurer all monies he may receive when the same amounts to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he took on himself the duty of collecting those debts—on the 11th of October, 1831, there is the following minute—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)— "Resolved that Mr. Hill be collector of monies on orders of affiliation, and for boarders in the house, for the year ensuing"—he continued to act after this resolution in the same employ down to August in the pre<lb></lb>sent year without any fresh appointment—it was his duty to enter in the ledger produced, all monies due to the parish for the support of bastard children, on the debtor side, and of all he received on the creditor side—it is a debtor and creditor account—his accounts were occasionally audit<lb></lb>ed by members of the board—I believe the whole of the entries in the account of John Hard are in the prisoner's handwriting, except this entry of the balance due at the bottom—the last sum he admits to have received, is dated June, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it is entered in one sum in the column, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., September 10th, 1838—there is no other entry after 1838.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ascertained the prisoner's deficiency to be about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bastardy cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say some hundreds—I have no hesita<lb></lb>tion in swearing that my belief is, that it is more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Selby resigned the office of clerk to the guardians in July or August this year —it was about the time of this inquiry other cases were mentioned—that may not have been his inducement to resign—there were large sums in the poor-rates stated to have been paid by the broker to Hill, who denies receiving some of them—he admits a great portion.</p>

               <p>understood he had received it from the parties for them—I do not know who he received it from—they were not people who had order made on them by the Board—I know nothing of his receiving there money from putative fathers of children—I have seen women come to ask if he had received money from the fathers of their children—he has sometimes said he has received nothing for them, and at other times paid them money, but these were not monies received under orders of affiliation, or they should have been handed over to the guardians—this had nothing to do with the accounts—I heard from the prisoner of his debiting himself with money as received for a boarder, which he had not received—I believe Mr. Selby has since received that money—I have not desired him to retain it—he has reported that he has paid it to the parish bankers—I believe it was above 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had debited himself with money which he stated afterwards he had not received—money was sometimes received at the gate for bastardy cases—I did not direct Mountstevens the beadle to retain 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., said to be due to him from the prisoner—I did not know of his owing him money till recently—there are two entries to Cameron of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he credited the parish for—I afterwards un<lb></lb>derstood he had not received it—that is what I alluded to before—I asked the prisoner why he entered monies he never received—his answer was, he had been negligent in his duty, and thought proper to put those entries in to cloak any neglect—I gave the prisoner into custody in St. John-street-road on my own authority, conjointly with two or three acting as a committee—Mr. Bezley and Manton, two of the committee, were with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HILL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the circumstances of his paying women money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen females apply to him to know if the fathers have paid money which was due—he sometimes said he had received them, and sometimes not—when there are orders of affiliation, the weekly payments are entered in the pension-book—when the fathers neglect to pay, the committee lessen the amounts to be paid the women till the fathers pay up—Hill should report it, and then the full pension is paid, but whether it was these cases or others I do not know—men occasionally disagree with their wives, and pay money in for them—there is a regular debtor and creditor account with persons having orders of affiliation on them—I have seen him pay money—I do not know for what purpose—I should think the majority of those cases were women having disputes with their husbands, and the money paid in at the gate, not bastardy cases—I have seen him pay money to women—I cannot say whether they were cases of orders of affiliation or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he careless in business, or careful with his accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In all the accounts I have had to do with, he has been correct to a farthing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he to go to the sessions in the country, to attend legal cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, all over the country—his duties were heavy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HILL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you recommend him to this anointment in 1830? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was the spontaneous act of the board—I immediately said, "Gentlemen, I guarantee," I thought him strictly honourable—I knew the duties of the situation—since the change in the poor law, the bastardy cases have been fewer than formerly—it was never part of my duty to keep the accounts of the house—his accounts with me were kept accurately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they accurate in the other sense of the term? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very—there was no default in them—I am not aware of a single default in my accounts—the broker's account is not mine—I certainly know from him that he is a defaulter on the broker's account—I never could ascertain the amounts—I have heard him state it could not exceed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and at the same time he stated there were outstanding money he could receive to meet it, and there would not be any large defalcation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say you have never objected to pay the defalcations of the prisoner on the bastardy account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never been asked the question, that I am aware of, till a few days ago, when Mr. Pascall was in my office relative to the broker's account—then the question was put to me, whether I intended to pay the defalcation of the bastardy account, and I said I do not conceive I have any thing to do with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying you were ready to pay, &amp;c.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was what I intended at the time these observations were made, that any defal<lb></lb>cation of his I meant to be answerable for, and would have paid it—I have not changed my mind, but have been required to pay a large sum of money more than I believe he has received on the broker's account—I cannot say now that I intend to pay the bastardy account, but I always did till this course was taken, and I am required to pay about six times more than I am aware he has received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You got from the prisoner the fact that he was in arrear about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the broker's account, and there were outstanding claims to meet it nearly; was that part of the conversation you had with him, in consequence of directions to get answers from him in writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was before that—it was in the presence of Mr. Pascall and Mr. Lovel I entreated of him to give an account of every thing he had received—I stated over and over again I would be answerable to the board, and every<lb></lb>where else—Mr. Pascall came to me to know how much out of the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they said I ought to pay, I was disposed to pay, and then I stated I was disposed to pay a much larger sum than then it appears to me Hill re<lb></lb>ceived from the broker.</p>
               <p>(Several inhabitants of the parish deposed to the prisoner's previous good character.)</p>

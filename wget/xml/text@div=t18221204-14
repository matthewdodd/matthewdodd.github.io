            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. Three of the shirts were cotton, and one linen. My husband had only worn two of them. I was obliged to pledge almost every thing we had to maintain the prisoner. The house had not been broken into. They were missed on the morning of the 3d of November. Another man besides him lodged in the house - he was not absent. My husband charged him with it directly; but he denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you make the prisoner's shirts - A. No; I washed them. His were a different stripe and colour to my husbands - he slept three nights in the house after the robbery, and went before the Magistrate to complain of our detaining his things for what he owed us.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOHN. I am a watchman. On the 10th of November, I was called, and took the prisoner for breaking the windows, and on examining him Mrs. Simpson claimed the shirt on his back. He said he could prove he had had it made at Cumberland-gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not afterwards say he must have taken it by mistake for his own - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his Defence; stated that he took the shirt by mistake, for one of his own, which laid on the same table - that his things were detained, and he only owed them 16 s.</p>

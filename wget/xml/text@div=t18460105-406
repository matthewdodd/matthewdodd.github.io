                  </hi>. I am a furrier, and live at No. 101, Oxford-street. I had the prisoner in my service from March till July—he called on me in Dec, and I engaged him—he was to stop on Christmas-day, and to sleep there—on the following evening, when I went up stairs, I sent for the keys of my shop door and my side door—(if those doors were locked, no one could get into my shop without false keys)—I did not get those keys—they were usually kept on the boa-rack in front of the shop, where the boas were ex<lb></lb>posed—I was told the keys could not be found—I did not go down to ascer<lb></lb>tain whether they were there or not—I went to bed—anybody, by getting access to the shop, might get to the money-box—in the morning I went into the shop, and found the keys on the rack—I then went to the till, and missed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called my servants together, the prisoner, another porter, and Pemberton—I asked if they knew anything of the transaction, and who had dusted the desk, and so on—the prisoner lagged behind, and said he hoped I should find it out, it being very unpleasant to him, he being the only one in the house—"Yes," I said, "it is more unpleasant to me"—I went to where he lived, in Bentinck's-mews—I found his wife there—I did not find any money, but I saw a boa on the bed—I noticed it—I went back, looked over my stock, and missed a victorine, or boa—I had but one, and that was gone—the one I saw on the bed at the prisoner's, exactly corresponded in every respect with the one I missed—I knew it to be mine—I sent for the policeman, and about five minutes before he came I called my servants up separately—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050078"></xptr>
               <p>whether he had anything to say to me, and he stated that he had been persuading Joseph Pemberton all day long to confess to his guilt, as he had seen him put his hand into the till, and take out some money; and that he said at the same time, "So help me G—, it is only 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked the prisoner where he got the boa that was at his lodging—he stated that it was given to his wife by Joseph Pemberton—I gave both the prisoner and Pemberton into custody—Pemberton was discharged, and I still keep him in my service—after the prisoner was in custody I went with an officer to search the prisoner's lodg<lb></lb>ing more minutely—I found sundry pieces of ribbon, and this box, which I know is mine, I have a mark on it; and this little box, which is one of mine, and has my private mark on it—this is the victorine, or boa, and here is some ribbon of mine on the prisoner's wife's bonnet—I know it from its particular pattern—it is not soiled at all—here is about twelve yards of ribbon in this box, and here is an invoice among them, made out by my own wife—here is my own mark on the ribbon—this pencil-case is mine—it was not for sale, but was lying about my desk for some time—this yard measure and this fur cuff are mine—he had no authority to take any of them from my house—they were all found at his lodging.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this what you call a boa? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is called a victorine or boa—there is no difference in the articles, only in the name—it is stone martin—it would fetch perhaps two guineas, or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the style of lining is a private mark—we line all alike nearly, but we had not one like it in the shop—it was not made in my establishment—I am quite sure I had seen it before I missed it—I do not recollect having seen it since I ticked it off in the invoice on the 25th of July—I have got the invoice, and I find it here a victorine, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that is what I purchased it at—I sent my servant down for some keys which were supposed to be on the boa-horse, or boa-rack—she came back and told me they were not there—that servant is not here—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in the till—the keys had nothing to do with the till, but they had to do with letting any party out during the night—I sent the servant to where the till was—there was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till, and I missed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was given into custody on the 27th of Dec.—these other articles are not of great value—I went to the prisoner's house before I went with the policeman—I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> opposite my door, and went to the corner of the mews where the prisoner lives, and I thought I would take in the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to protect me—that was the first time I went—Pemberton had been in my service about twelve months—I cannot point out any time when I missed these articles—I did not miss the pencil-case—I saw it about July or Aug.—the prisoner was in my service in July, and left me in July, about the same time I saw the pencil-case—I do not recollect seeing it in Aug., nor since he left my employ—I can swear I did not see it or use it in Sept., or later than Sept.—it cost me, I believe, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had not seen the victorine after he left—I did not miss it at all till I found it on the bed—I did not know the prisoner was married—I saw a wife at his lodgings—she said this boa was hers—Pemberton had remained in my employ during the whole twelve months, with about two or three weeks' interval.</p>

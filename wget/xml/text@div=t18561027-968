                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 53, Flower and Dean street, Spitalfields. On Monday night, 13th Oct., I was going along Brick-lane with another man—I do not know his name, he was a Land Transport man, and he lodged in the same house as I did—I dare say he is now at work at the docks—as we were going along we came up to the prisoner and some women—the man that was with me struck one of the women with his elbow as he was passing, she turned and said, what did he do that for—he made some saucy answer, and she struck him—the prisoner then came up, hit the man, and hit me in the face with his fist—he made a second blow at me, and I kept it off with my hand—he put his hand towards his pocket, made a stroke at me, and cut me under the ear—it is now strapped up—I said, "Oh my God! I am done!" and fell against the pawnbroker's shutters—I put my hand to my head, and the blood came all over my person and my clothes—the people took me into a doctor's shop, and the doctor attended me—I do not know what became of the prisoner, I was senseless—I pointed out the prisoner to the policeman the next day in Keate-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said at first that when I struck him I had a knife in my hand. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not—I did not see what he had.</p>

The prosecutor pointed out the prisoner to me, at No. 12, Lower Keate-street—the prisoner said, "I shall not go out; you shall not take me"—two other constables came, and we took him—in going to the station, he said, "I own I struck him, but I did not stab him"—the prosecutor's clothes were cut through in the back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, a general practitioner. On Monday evening, 13th Oct., about half past 9 o'clock, I was called to the police station to see the prosecutor—I found a deep wound on his back, pene<lb></lb>trating to the rib, about half an inch long—it was a clean cut wound—under his right ear I found a flesh wound, about an inch long, only just penetrating through the skin, not to the bone—it was a very clean cut wound—it was not dangerous in itself, but it was in a dangerous neigh<lb></lb>bourhood, not far from the jugular vein—it might have been done with a knife—I do not think it possible that it could have been done with the fist—it might have been done by a ring on a finger, if the ring was very sharp—the edges of the wound were not jagged, it was a clean cut—I should think both the wounds had been done by a small penknife—I I dressed them both.</p>

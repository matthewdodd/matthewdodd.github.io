On the 3d of February, my watch (a silver one) was in a case over the chimney in the parlour, and about a quarter before one it was taken away. I advertised it on Saturday in the public paper, and on Monday in the Daily Advertiser.

I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050018"></xptr> went, and there saw the gut part of it, but no minute hand. The case, the chain, and seal were gone, and they had put two seals and another chain to it. The next day I went to Sir

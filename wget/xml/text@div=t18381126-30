                  </hi>. I work for the prosecutor. I was passing along the Minories on the evening of November the 17th, and I saw the two prisoners rolling a puncheon along Swan-street—I thought it be<lb></lb>longed to my master—I followed it to Mr. Chaplin's, in Cullum-street—I asked Mr. Chaplin if he knew those two men—he said he did by sight—I then asked the prisoners where they got it—the eldest said it belonged to him, he bought it—while we were looking at it, the eldest prisoner said he would go and fetch the man that he bought it of—he went off, and did not return—he was taken on the Monday—the younger prisoner, and the puncheon, were taken at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. About four o'clock, on the 17th, the two prisoners came to my residence, and said they had got a puncheon in a dilapidated state—I told them to bring it up—they returned in an hour or an hour and a half afterwards, and said they could not roll it there, but they wanted my truck—I would not lend it them, but said I would go with them—I went to the corner of Haydon-street, and saw the younger prisoner, but the puncheon was not there—I asked him if he knew where his father was—he said he did not—I told him to go and see for him—he went, and said he could not see his father—I went home and had some tea, and then the two prisoners came with the puncheon, and before I could look at it, Chapman came and recognised it—I took the candle out, and asked him to look at it particularly—I was to meet the prisoner at the corner of the street—I went to the public-house, and waited half an hour.</p>

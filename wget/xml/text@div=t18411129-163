                  </hi>. I lived in Jackson's-court, Long-alley.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday night, the 6th, on a charge of felony—I searched him at the sta<lb></lb>tion, and found no money about him—before I searched him I asked if he had any money—he said no—he was put into a cell by himself, and locked up—he remained there all night—some other persons were put into the cell afterwards—I saw the prosecutor in the cell on Sunday morning with five or six persons—I did not see the prisoner searched on Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was at the station on the Saturday night when the prisoner was brought in—I heard him tell Jenkinson he had no money—on the Sunday night I went into the cell in company with the Inspector, and Dunn was there, and six or seven prisoners—I heard the prosecutor say he was robbed of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the inspector asked the prisoner if he had any money—he said he had not—out the following morning I was present when the prisoners were called out, and saw the prisoner put something towards his mouth—I seized him by the neck, and took two half-crowns, four shillings, and two sixpences from his mouth—I told him he had said the night before that he had no money, and he said he had it in his shoes.</p>

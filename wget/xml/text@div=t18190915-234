On Saturday the 4th of September, a little girl brought these things to me to be mangled, about half-past four o'clock the prisoner came for them; I thought she was the child's mother - she said a girl brought them, and described them all; I gave them to her, and have never seen them since. On the Monday I saw her in Calmell-buildings, but did not know her. She was afterwards taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not say she was not the person - A. No, I said she was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You first saw her at Murphy's, did you then say she was the woman - A. I said she was like the woman, but she was dressed different then. Next morning I saw her dressed as she was at the time, and said she was the woman. She was let at large by the magistrate, because the person who owned the property did not wish her to be locked up.</p>
               <p>BRIDGET M'CARTY. I sent the things to Sands, to be mangled. The prisoner was often at our house. I never authorized her to fetch them</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Hyland came to Murphy's he said I was not the woman - on Wednesday he said I was the woman. They would not give me in charge; I gave myself up before the magistrate, knowing myself innocent.</p>

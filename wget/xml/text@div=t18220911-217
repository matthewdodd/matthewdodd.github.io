            . I was at Penman's on this evening, sitting in the yard; the prisoner went into an empty room, and came out with a great coat under his arm. I said,</p>
               <p>"That coat does not belong to you, you had better put it back again;" he said,</p>
               <p>"If it does not belong to me, it does to one of my companions;" and said to one of his companions,</p>
               <p>"It is your coat;" the man said he had not got one. I said he had better put it back, for it belonged to the servant, which he did. I heard he was in custody at eight o'clock; he must have stolen it twice.</p>

            . On the 8th of August, I saw the prisoner drinking in my back yard; and between eight and nine o'clock, the servant missed his coat; and in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's lodgings four or five doors off, and found him sitting by the fire side. I took my servant into the room; and then asked what he had done with the coat; he rose up, and it fell from his seat.</p>

I was at the house with three more drinking in the back parlour, and in the evening we went outside, and sat on the benches; one of the men who was with me got tipsy; and soon after, in going away, I saw the coat on the bench where he sat. I said, Bob had left his coat behind, and I took it to my lodgings; Penman came and asked what I had done with it; I said I had it there, and thought it belonged to my companion.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Thomas Bartlett Simpson. On the 20th of June I went to the prisoner's house—she keeps a shop in Drury-lane—I found there some bottles which I had lost an hour before—I only brought nine of them away, but there were several more which I knew—these are ale and beer and one wine bottle—I asked the prisoner who she bought them of—she said at first she could not tell, and then that she bought them of a little girl with a child in her arms.</p>

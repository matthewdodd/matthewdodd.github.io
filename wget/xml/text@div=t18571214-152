                  </hi>. I live in Howard Street, Wandsworth Road, and am a horse keeper. On the night of 19th Nov. I was in Wandsworth Road, about half past 6 o'clock—I saw the prisoner with another female—I watched them—the prisoner went into Mr. Newell's shop—the other woman remained outside—after the prisoner came out, I went in and spoke to the last witness—she took a shilling out of the till and gave it to me—there was another person there, but I did not lose sight of the shilling—I bent it, and went after the prisoner, who was in the Wandsworth Road, about 200 yards from the shop—the other woman was with her—when they saw me they ran down a dark street, and I went after them, and overtook them just at the back of Mr. Jones's stable, about forty yards down—I took hold of them—the prisoner said, "What do you want with me?"—I said, "To come back to the tobacco shop," and told her she had been passing a bad shilling—she said she had not—they both resisted, and the other woman got away, but I would not let the prisoner go—the prisoner put her hand into her right hand pocket, and took out a paper and threw it down by the side of her—as it fell, it broke open, and four shillings rolled out of it—I picked them up immediately, and bit them—I took the prisoner back to the shop—I gave the four shillings and the one I received in the shop to the constable.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Harlington, near Harmondsworth. On the 1st of April, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with a live duck in his apron, about 100 yards from Mr. Sadler's. I went after my brother's horse, and as I returned, I found him breaking the duck's neck; I passed him, looked back and saw him going towards the dung heap. I went home and told my brother, and told White; we went together to the dung-heap, and found the duck concealed there - it was the same I saw him with - it was not quite cold then. I had known the prisoner five or six years; he was taken up the same evening. I am certain it was the same sort of duck as that I saw him with.</p>

            . I saw the ducks safe on Saturday night, there were seven of them; about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was called and missed one. I went to the dung-hill, and saw the duck, and am sure it was my master's; they were kept in the poultry-house; the dunghill was about 700 yards from the house - the prisoner had no business on the premises.</p>

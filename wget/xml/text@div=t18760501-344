                  </hi>. I assist my father, a cement manufacturer, of 73, High Holborn—on 12th April about 8.30 I sold the prisoner a threepenny bottle of cement; he gave me a half-crown; Mr. Arden, who was in the shop, took hold of him and told me to bend it; I did so and gave it to Mr. Arden, and the prisoner was given in custody—he had been there the day before at 6 o'clock for a bottle of cement and given me a half-crown; I gave him the change, showed it to one of the lodgers and kept it separate—I saw "A" marked on it—I gave it to my "father about half an hour afterwards—the prisoner had also been there on 3rd April for a bottle of cement, when he gave me a half-crown, which I gave to my mother—I put it into the till first, but there was no other half-crown there—my mother showed me a bad half-crown nest day.</p>

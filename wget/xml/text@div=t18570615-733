                  </hi>. I keep the Southampton Arms, High Street, Camden Town, in the parish of St. Pancras. On 24th May, about 6 o'clock, I was called up, and found three policeman in the house—I found the top sash of the coffee room window down, and a desk broken open in the bar, and also some drawers in the back parlour—I did not miss anything then—I went to the station, and saw a bottle of brandy, a bottle of gin, and other articles—these two small bottles of sherry, have my name stamped on the glass—this umbrella is mine, but the handle has been broken since—these two pencil cases were in a desk which was broken open; some few things tied</p>

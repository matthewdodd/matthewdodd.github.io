             sworn. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do, he was in my employ from November 1803 till April 1806, as <rs id="t18060917-41-deflabel220" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

               <p>Q. What is that paper you have in your hand. - A. It is a bill dated 18th of March 1806, for twenty two pound fifteen shillings and seven-pence, that bill was produced to me by the prisoner, I cannot tell what day, it was in the latter part of last March.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he produce that bill to you. - A. He told me it would be doing his landlady a great favour if I would give him the money for it, she being a baker, it being drawn upon Mr. Savage, a customer of her's: accordingly I gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. It had some time to run. - A. Yes, he having deducted the discount, which was two or three shillings, I gave him the balance; I had very frequently bills of him before drawn upon Mr. Savage, therefore nothing passed at that time but what I have related.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this pass. - A. In the front office of my own house in <placeName id="t18060917-41-crimeloc221">Castle-street, Falcon Square, Aldersgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that bill you have in your hand is the bill that he gave you. - A. I am sure I kept it in my own custody till the 21st of May, when it became due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue still in your service. - A. No<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170026"></xptr>I had discharged him on the 10th April, in consequence of a bill that he had forged.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bill on the 21st of May. - A. On the 21st of May I sent a clerk with it for payment, I sent it this particular way, having reason to suspect, in consequence of what had previously passed; I sent a note with the bill and desired Mr. Savage to call; it was not paid; this is the same bill; I am sure that the same that I had sent by the clerk was returned by him to me; the whole of the bill is written by the prisoner himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner's hand writing. - A. Yes, he was writing under my own eye, he was an elegant writer, he was transcribing letters for me two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. From your own knowledge of his hand writing, do you believe it is his hand writing. - A. The body of the bill and the acceptance is his hand writing; the body of the bill I am certain is his hand writing, and the acceptance seems to be his hand writing seigned.</p>
               <p>Q. The body of the bill and the acceptance is his hand writing, you do not speak to any other part; the drawer you do not speak to. - A. No, the drawer has none of his hand writing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was it to be accepted by. - A. Mr. Savage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the hand writing of that person. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that this bill was discounted with you, had you done any thing with it. - A. No, I had frequently bills of him of Mr. Savage's.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore at that time you did not particularly examine it. - A. No, I had frequently bills from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q.(to prosecutor) I would wish to ask Mr. Atkinson whether he did not know, before the bill was presented for payment, that it was a bad and a forged bill. - A. I know to this extent, that he had forged one other to be paid on the 10th of April; in consequence of that I had every reason to suspect this was a forgery, that is all.</p>
               <p>LEVIT PIGOT sworn. Examined by Mr. Miers. Q. Do you know Mr. Savage. - A. I do, for seven years past.</p>

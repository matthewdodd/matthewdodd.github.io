                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Lynes—we now live at No. 3, Little Chapel-street, So ho—my husband is a servant—he has been in place about three weeks or a month—we were living at No. 29, Burton-street, Bur-ton-crescent. At Midsummer last we owed some rent for that house, and we were distrained on for that rent—the prisoner was put into possession—he con<lb></lb>tinued in possession thirteen or fourteen days—I afterwards made an arrange-ment with the landlord, Mr. Croxford, who is agent to Mr. Put tock, and the distress was taken out I think about the beginning of July—I afterwards saw the prisoner—he called once in a friendly way, and then I did not see him for some time—I remember his calling on the 17th of Sept.—I was very in-differently off at that time—I have seven children, two were away and five at home—when the prisoner called, my husband was not at home—he was not in a regular place, but was engaged at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the prisoner said, "How do you do?"—I said, "Pretty well"—he said, "How are you getting on?"—I said, "Very badly, I have bad an execution in for poor-rates, and for a security that we entered into for a person, and I expected an execution in for I my tuxes"—he said, "You may expect one again for your rent—I have seen I Puttock, and I shall have to come in"—he said Puttock had told him to get I ready to come into the house at quarter-da)—he said, "I would advise you to be in readiness, and clear off, or else you will not have a single thing left"—he</p>

I said, "Emma," meaning a servant that lived with me, named Emma Wood—the prisoner said, "I will go," and I gave him a shilling out of my pocket to fetch them—he went out and brought in three stamps—he put them in his pocket—there was nothing more done till the things were all packed—we went on packing, and the prisoner assisted—the went on pack<lb></lb>ing till three o'clock—that was three o'clock in the morning of Thursday, the 24th of Sept.—at three o'clock we had coffee, and the prisoner drew up the three receipts himself—my husband was asleep at the time—I said to him, "Business first, and sleep afterwards"—I awoke him up, and when he was awake he turned round and signed the three bills—I cannot tell you whether he looked at them—he put his name to the papers—when my husband awoke and signed them, the prisoner put them into his pocket, and I never saw them afterwards—the prisoner said, "We will sign them at different dates, or else they will look so like a fraud"—the prisoner wrote what he pleased—my husband said he did not understand them, he was not a man of business, and the prisoner wrote what he pleased—the receipts were not shown or read to me—the prisoner turned and showed them round to Emma Wood, and said, "I should think will do"—she said, "I should think it would"—the prison said he had engaged a van for five o'clock, and at five o'clock a van a two men came that the prison had engaged, and the prisoner, the two men, and my husband assisted to pack the things in—they would not all go into one one van, and the prisoner desired another van to be sent for—my hus<lb></lb>band's daughter went for one—the rest of the goods were loaded into that—the prisoner asked me for money to pay for the vans—I gave him half-a-sovereign, and he went away with the vans and the goods—he went without my husband—we had no goods left in the house—I and my husband went to look for a room for a lodging—in the afternoon I went out to look for a room, and I met the prisoner and my husband together—I applied to the</p>

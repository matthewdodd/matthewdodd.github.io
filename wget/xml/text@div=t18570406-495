                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at No. 93, Wood Street, Wal<lb></lb>thamstow. On 28th Feb. I was in London; between 9 and 10 o'clock that evening I went to the King's Head public house, in Dudley Street, which used to be Monmouth Street, St. Giles's—I left just as the house was shutting, at 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the house, and a lot more; I cannot say whether they left before or after me; I did not see them when I left—I went with my wife and mother-in-law to my mother-in-law's house, No. 53, Dudley Street; she lives up stairs—when we got to the passage, my mother-in-law was first, and was going up the stairs; I was about four paces behind her—when I got within about a step of the bottom of the stairs, I was collared, and held by the shoulders, and pressed up against the wall; and when I got loose, I called out to my wife, "Mary, are you there?"—she made answer as she was coming in at the door, and said, "Yes"—I said, "I am robbed of my watch;" my watch was gone, they had twisted it off—I could not see the faces of any of the persons that robbed me, at the time; it was dark at the end of the passage, but directly</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On Saturday, 28th Feb., I went with him and my mother to the King's Head, and left about 12 o'clock to go to my mother's house—I heard my husband call out, "Mary, are you there?"—I said yes, I was; and he said, "I am robbed of my watch"—at the same time I was pushed on one side of the door by the prisoner and another one with him—I distinctly saw the prisoner's face, and am positively sure it was him—on the following Monday, in consequence of a communication from my mother, I came up from Walthamstow, and went to the King's Head, about a quarter after 10 o'clock at night—I did not see the prisoner then—he was sent for, and came—he called me on one side, and said that he would do his beat endeavours to get the watch back, and he and another young man went after it to see if they could get it; they came back about 11 o'clock, and he said he could not see the man; and he asked me to wait until the Tuesday—I stopped all night, and in the morning I went to Bow Street, and gave information—I went again to the King's Head on the Tuesday, and saw the prisoner on the opposite tide of the road; my mother called him, and asked if he could get the watch—he said he would do his best, he would go and try if he could get it—he asked if I knew the number of the watch—I said I did not, but I did—he then said it was 592—that is the number.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of Mrs. Young, and live at No. 53, Dudley Street, St. Giles's. On 28th Feb. my son and daughter came up from the country; I went with them to the King's Head—we came out about 12 o'clock, and went home—there is a way backwards, down the back stairs I went up the stairs before them; I had only got half up; I thought he was following me, and I heard him say to his wife, "Mary, are you there? I have lost my watch"—I saw the prisoner the next evening, outside the King's Head—I said to him, "Oliver, did you hear of my son-in-law's loss last night?"—he said, "Yes, I did, and I am very sorry for it, for I hear he is a very respectable man; if I had known it was your son-in-law,</p>

               <p>he should not have lost his watch"—I have known the prisoner about nine months—he said the watch was sold that day for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him if he could get it back again for the 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I would not mind giving him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself rather than my son-in-law should be at the loss of it—he went away, and said he would do his endeavours—I then wrote to my daughter, and on the Monday evening she came, and the potman sent for the prisoner; his brother went and brought him to the King's Head—I asked him if he could get the watch; he said he would do the best he could—he went away, and came back in about half an hour, and said he thought the watch was broke up or something had happened to it—he said at first it was sold in St. Martin's Lane, and then he said it was sold to a fishmonger in some market—I saw him again on Tuesday, in the middle of the day—I called him from the corner of George Street to come over to the King's Head, and gave him a drop of gin, and said, "Oliver, did you go to get the watch for my son-in-law?"—he said if it cost him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of his own pocket, he would get it back again—he asked my daughter the number of the watch; she said she did not know, and he told her the number of it—she had got the number from the makers, and left it at Bow Street—I do not recollect what number it was that he men<lb></lb>tioned, but she said directly that was the number—she said, "What will you do, Oliver? will you go and see about the watch, whether you can get it or not?"—he went away with another young man, and in about half an hour he came up to my room, and said that the watch was taken out of the case, and put into another case, and sold over the water for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was on Tuesday or Wednesday—that was the last time I spoke to him about it.</p>

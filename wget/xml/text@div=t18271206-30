            . I am waiter at the White Hart public-house, Temple-mills, near Hackney-marsh - it joins the marsh; there is a road through our premises to the marsh, and a gate there. On Saturday, the 13th of October, I saw some persons in the marsh - the prisoner was one of them; I had seen him before, and am not mistaken in his person; Hilt, and another person, whom I knew by sight, and now understand to be John Holden, were with him; I knew them all three well; I knew the prisoner by name - they called him Crummy Newman; they had nothing with them, but were all three walking together on the marsh; I saw them all three together again on Monday morning, the 15th, at six o'clock; I saw them pass through master's yard; the prisoner was riding on a black mare, about fifteen hands high, with a white blaze, a white stripe down the nose, and a white fetlock on the off hindfoot; one of the others was riding another horse, and the third one opened the gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know what has become of Holden? A. No; he did not live in the neighourhood - he was very well dressed - better than the prisoner; I have not seen him since.</p>

            . I am an innkeeper and farmer, at Brickwall, Hatfield, Herts. On Thursday, the 18th of October, the prisoner Newman, and a person, who I have heard since goes by the name of Holden, came there, between two and three o'clock - they were the only two persons; they brought two mares and a gelding, all black; there was one young mare, fifteen hands high, which Mr. Mash afterwards claimed; Holden brought the two mares into my yard; the prisoner stood by the gelding, outside the gate; I believe he was within hearing; Holden asked me to take the mares in to grass till Saturday morning, when he would call again for them; they stopped to see the mares fed; I think the prisoner went into the stable, but am certain Holden went to see them fed; the prisoner mounted the gelding; Holden went away on foot, a little before the prisoner; Holden was to return on the Saturday; on the Sunday evening, about six o'clock, the prisoner came back alone; he said his master was detained late on Friday night at Smithfield market, and could not come on the Saturday as he proposed, but would come on Monday night, or Tuesday morning; he said he had come to see if the mares were taken care of, or how they were, or something to that effect; I had suspicions then; when they brought the mares to the stable, I asked Holden if the mares were for sale; I cannot say where the prisoner was then; he said he had some thoughts of asking 18l. for the mare, but it was in bad condition; I asked if it was the lowest, and he said he might take a little less; when the prisoner came on Sunday night, I persuaded him to stay all night with me, and, after having some refreshment, I asked him if he thought the mares could be sold; he said Yes; I said, "Your master talked of 18l.; I have a horse or two, and should have no objection to change with him; do you know whether she will go in chains?" he said No; I said, "Well, in the morning we will try her:" while he was having his refreshment, I sent for a constable, and in the morning I took him into custody myself; he was taken before the Magistrate, and discharged (this was on the 22d), as the owner of neither of the mares was there; the prosecutor came on the Friday following, and claimed this mare; she was delivered to him on the 11th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Holden at all? A. I thought I had seen him before, but am not positive; he was dressed more respectably than the prisoner; the prisoner called him his master all through, and I supposed him to be his master, as the prisoner himself gave no orders about the mares.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner offered 5l. for one of the horses? A. Not by me, nor in my presence, to my knowledge - several persons were present, and had a deal of conversation with him; he might have been offered money for it, without my bearing it - Holden did not come back.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner returned on the Sunday, had you made a noise about the neighbourhood? A. It struck me they were stolen, and I had been to a Magistrate, and I employed men to sit up, in case they should come and take the horses by force - Holden paid for the refreshment - I believe he was paymaster, but I was not the person who received the money.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. When did you make a stir about the horses? A. On the Saturday.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I apprehended the prisoner in his father's cottage, in Wick-lane, Hackney, and have endeavoured to find the other persons - I know Holden - I do not think he is a horse-dealer - I took the prisoner on Monday, the 12th of November, I think; I told him it was for felony, and asked what he had done with the horses; he said he took them to Enfield-highway; he said, "My intention was not to steal them - I gave my right name and address - I might have sold them over and over again."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Now tell us exactly what passed?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060024"></xptr>A. A good deal of conversation occurred; he said Hilt had accompanied him into one of the green lanes, riding one of the horses; that he then delivered him the other horse, and he took them both to Enfield-highway; that he had been bid money for the horses, but refused to sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had not the least intention of stealing them, and might have sold them over and over again? A. Yes, and that he had given his right name and address to the publican in Enfield-highway.</p>

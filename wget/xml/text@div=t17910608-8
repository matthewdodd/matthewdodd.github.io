               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Court and Jury: I was going down Rosemary-lane to an acquaintance of mine, where I retained and lodged, in Union-street; I happened to see this fire, I heard a great noise about it, which caused me to hurry down Rosemary-lane, where the fire was; when I saw this fire, opposite to the fire there was a great bustle, and in the mean time one of the gentlemen came and laid hold of me, and said, this is the young man; I believe he said, you took a handkerchief out of that gentleman's pocket; he laid hold of me and called for assistance, and searched me; I told him to examine me, the gentleman searched me, and nothing was found upon me; therefore gentlemen, I think it a hard thing that I should be bound into this disgrace, concerning a thing I know nothing about, and I am quite distant from any of my friends; all my friends live in Rotterdam, I lived some time at a shop in Houndsditch, No. 16, where any body may inquire my character; I served very honestly and truly, I never was out at bad hours, in my life. I am quite ignorant of the laws of this nation, I know not what to do at present, I am out of place, I am looking for a place; I have a mother in Rotterdam, I learned a kind of hatting-way, which I was able to perform at this gentleman's in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in this country? - I learned English in Holland, I have been here a twelvemonth; I was thinking about learning the painting business.</p>

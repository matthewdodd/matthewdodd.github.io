                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and live in Mansion-house-street, Kennington. On the 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> of August I was standing on the steps, on the north side of Westminster bridge—there was a rowing match—I felt my handkerchief taken, turned round, and found the prisoner close behind me with my handkerchief—I secured him and took it from him—he rather resisted and said it was thrown to him, but he had got it in his left hand, between his left hand and his thigh, and was holding it there—I turned round instantly, and he was as close to me as he could be.</p>

R. Hughes and Co. put up; I said, "Why do you use the name of Hughes?"—be said, "Keeling has a relative named Hughes, and that is the name we use "—he did not tell me he had relatives named Stanley or Burns—I said that I was astonished after what had happened that he should come into the City and use the name of Hughes, and asked him for Keeling—he said that he was not within, and asked me why I came; was it to give him some wholesome advice—I said, "Yes"—I met Keeling in Thames-street shortly afterwards, and made the same observation to him that I was astonished to find him trading in the name of Hughes and Co. after what had happened at Malborough-street—I advised him to alter his course, and we parted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Keeling. Q.</hi> You say they took the rooms; who took the rooms and made the arrangements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first instance my wife saw Sheen, and in the second I saw him—you were not present—you were not there quite five weeks—you were there a little more than a month—the bill of exchange is dated 3d January—you had been in my apartments not a week previous to that date—you were there after the bill was given—1 think you left just at the beginning of January—I made no demand on you for any rent on the day you left and gave me up your key—I did not consider you responsible for any rent: I considered that Sheen would pay the whole amount, as he took the rooms—I did not see Mr. Anderson when we went down to the office to get this bill of exchange—I saw a person named Smith, who said he would take care you did not come there again—I thought he was one of the principals in the firm at St Mary-axe—I saw a tall young man; but be told me his name was Page, not Anderson—I understood that you were dismissed from the employment—he said you should not come there again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Hampton—I recollect some carpets being tent to Martin, Anderson, and Co. 40, St. Mary-axe—Keeling came to me shortly afterwards to say that he had been very much abused by the firm; that he was their clerk, and they had turned him out—I asked him if there was any probability of getting the goods or the money—he said we might get the goods, but not the money; and if we saw Sergeant Joy he would be able to give us some information—he said they were a parcel of swindlers from top to bottom, tad the firm was a complete hoax—we did not get paid for the carpets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you supply them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 25th November 1861, and I was called on 6th or 7th December, about ten days after<lb></lb>wards—they were not in custody then—in consequence of what Keeling told me, I went to 40, St Mary Axe, and asked for the money—we had sent the bill with the goods, and requested a settlement—we sent a stamp which was either torn off or brought back—we did not exactly give them credit for the goods—the understanding was that they were to be paid for on delivery, but our man came back with another small order for mats, and said that the money would be paid—we did not take the carpets up again, because it would be a great loss to us—we were rather short-handed, so we let the matter stand over.</p>
               <p>Mr.<hi rend="smallCaps">LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You bettered that them was such a firm? Yes—I have since seen the carpets in pledge at Jones and Banner's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Keeling.

                  <hi rend="italic">Keeling's Defence.</hi> I took the office in Broad-street-buildings in my own name, and explained to the agent that I was doing business with my brother-in-law, Mr. Hughes, in Dublin, who had been in business with me previous to my leaving Dublin. Mr. Fox went down and had an interview with my brother at the West-end. I called on him a few days afterwards, and he expressed himself perfectly satisfied. I took the offices in June; my rent commenced at quarter day. Mr. Fox told me he would call on Dr. Hesse and tell him that he was satisfied of my respectability, and that I might have possession in a few days. I called afterwards and saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186203030010"></xptr>
               <p>Dr. Hesse and he told me the agent had seen him, and he was quite satisfied, and he gave me the key. I think Mrs. Hesse was then present; I explained to her that my brother-in-law was in Dublin; that his name was Hughes. I got an order from a gentleman in Ireland for some of those measures that have been spoken of I did not know much of the large manufacturing houses in London; and Mr. Sheen having longer experience than I, I happened to mention to him that I wanted some measures, I said a very small quantity at first, to see if they would suit. He happened to know Messrs. Pontifex, and I asked him to call and select some for me. He did so, and selected one set, amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. My brother-in-law was in London then. I had just before that told Mrs. Hesse that my brother-in-law was coming up, and he would arrange all the accounts; that is why, when the man brought those things up, he was told that Mr. Hughes was not at home. As regards the two firms with which they have endeavoured to identify my name, Leslie, in Fenchurch-street, and at Pudding-lane, I was not there at all. At the time of the existence of those two firms I was in Whitecross-street, till the end of April, 1861, when I passed through the court. Mr. Webbe has alluded to a firm called Monck, Keeling, and Co., and I asked him to produce the card which he saw; there was never an office of such a firm in existence. At that time, in May, 1860, I was clerk to a Mr. Smythe, who had offices in St. James'-street, and having some capital I invested it in the purchase of some wines. I knew a gentleman of the name of Monck, in Dublin, a spirit merchant, and he asked me if I would try and get him some orders here. I said I would, and he had some papers printed with the name of Monck, Keeling, and Co., on them, and sent them over to me. I sent them back, and said that it would not suit my purpose to carry on an agency of that sort, consequently there were never any cards printed, nor any names put up over the office, nor did I ever do any business or send out any circulars, or any business letters in such a name. With reference to the firm of Burns and Co., in Bush-lane, I had no con<lb></lb>nexion with it. I was engaged by them when the firm was first established there. I was never even seen in it; but I was offered a commission if I would dispose of some goods for them at certain prices. I endeavoured to do so, and I made a little money for two or three weeks while I was con<lb></lb>nected with them. Mr. Webbe came to me there. I told him I was engaged by Mr. Burns, doing commission business, and I wished him not to have me arrested at that time; but that I would pay him so much a week off his bill; that was in July. The firm of Stauley and Co. was in existence at the very time that I was doing business in King-street, St. James's ; I was only in that office twice altogether. I was engaged at St. Mary-axe as a clerk. It has been endeavoured to identify me there as a partner, which I was not. I was only there for three weeks altogether, and at Christmas, the housekeeper, according to her own statement, received instructions not to allow me into the office if I came there, and when I presented myself about 2d or 3d Jan<lb></lb>uary, and wanted to get some papers of mine which were there, and told her to come into the office with me, in order that I might get them, she told me that she had received instructions not to allow me in, and she did not; of course if I was a partner in the place I could have insisted on going in, but I did not do so, knowing that I had no right there unless the gentlemen were present and wished me to be so. I utterly repudiate any intention of defrauding Messrs. Pontifex of those goods. I did not assume any name. Mr. Hughes is my brother-in-law's name, and if I had had a little longer notice, I should have been prepared this day with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186203030011"></xptr>
               <p>witnesses to have proved the statements I have made. I have been in busi<lb></lb>ness many years, as one of the mart extensive booksellers and publishers in Ireland, where my name is well known. When Mrs. Hesse complained of the disturbances there had been, in consequence of people coming for small mounts, I ascertained that that had really takes place. I had been away for three weeks out of the six, for which that office was occupied; and while I was away other persons, who had been left in the office, had had trifling things in, such as dinners, and there had been noises upon the people com<lb></lb>ing for the payments for them. I settled all those when I came home. During the whole time I was there, there was not £5 credit obtained for anything. After I was dismissed from Anderson and Co's, I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to those gentlemen that they might obtain their goods or their money. When I called upon them they told me that they were perfectly satisfied and did not wish to take any steps whatever. When I was at Bow-street, I thought it was only a charge of fraud; I had no idea it was a charge of forgery, nor was I aware of it till to-day. I am perfectly innocent of any intention to defraud, and I have never gone into any place of business except in my own name. I never had any office except that in Broad-street-buildings; the other offices I had no connection with at all.</p>

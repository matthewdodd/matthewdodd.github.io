            . I live in Henrietta-court. The prisoner has been at my shop to buy some articles - one end of Mrs. Taylor's shop comes into the court; he came on the 24th of November and bought a penny article of me - and presently I saw him come by again with a pier table in his hand; he said he had made a purchase - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040094"></xptr>knew it had been Mrs. Taylor's - I do not know where the prisoner lived; he came by again in three quarters of an hour with another table which I also knew - and in about half an hour he came by with the third table; I am confident they were Mrs. Taylor's - I had seen them for about three weeks, and about half an hour before they were taken - I saw no oil-cloth or carpet.</p>

            . I was informed the prisoner had stolen the tables, and when he came out of a shoemaker's shop, next door to Mrs. Taylor's, I secured him - this was on the evening of Friday the 28th; I accused him of taking the tables - he denied it; I took him into a room and accused him again; he said he wanted to speak to his nephew, but I would not let him.</p>

I am a carpenter, and lodge with the prisoner at No. 3, George-street; he brought these three tables home one afternoon, and said he brought them from the Borough; I think it was on Monday week; I saw some carpet but no oil-cloth - I was at work when he brought them in, but I saw them in the evening; this was a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Taylor's.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and asked him for the key of the door - he denied having it, but I found a small key which unlocked a box; I then went and took his nephew, (the last witness) to the office; the prisoner there produced the key of the door -I found these tables, and in the box I found this carpet and floor-cloth.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I did not know, in my confusion, that I had the key; I bought the articles and paid for them.</p>

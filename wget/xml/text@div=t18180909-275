On the 2d of September, about half past nine at o'clock night, my children went up to bed. Suspecting the prisoner, I watched her, and saw her leave her room and go into my bed-room, where my money was. She had no business there. My little girl came down and went up again, I followed her half way up the stairs, and my little boy gave me some information. I had told him to watch; I then went into my room, and missed two papers of halfpence which had been safe half an hour before. I immediately went into the prisoner's room, and told her I was sorry to accuse her, but I missed two 5s. papers of copper, and nobody but her and my children had been in the room. She strongly denied it. I said I would send for an officer. She then gave me 10s. worth, and said my son gave them to her. She said she had two more papers, which her husband had given her. He was sitting in the room. He told her she must have spent all the money he gave her. I asked her to show them to me, which she did. I told her I could swear to them, and that she had taken all four that evening. I had marked them with a cross. She then said my niece gave them to her.</p>

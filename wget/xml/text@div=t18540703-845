                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Leyton, in Essex; the prisoner and her husband have been lodging in my house. On the first Tuesday in June, I searched the room that they occupied; I missed plates, dishes, knives, a variety of little things; pillows, a bolster, and a quantity of feathers out of the bed—I went to the house of Mr. Crane, a neighbour, and found an iron saucepan, some glasses, salts, plates, and a dish—I was sitting in my kitchen that evening, and saw the prisoner go to Mr. Crane's—these articles are all mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a crockery and tin wareshop, at Leyton. These glasses, salts, and saucepan, I received from the prisoner—she first sent a little girl with some things—she then came herself, and said she wanted to make up a little money for her work—she is a lint maker—I gave her a shilling for this saucepan, and glasses, and salts—these other things I took at different times.</p>

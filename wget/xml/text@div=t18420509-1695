I was desired to watch—I watched four days behind some casks—on the 18th I saw the prisoner come and take some pipe off the press, and take it as far as the door—he put it down by the door and walked into the middle of the yard, saw it was all clear, came in, took up the pipe, and went into a stoke-hole, at one corner of the yard—I followed, and heard him beating it up with a hammer—it was quite straight when he took it—when I came in sight he put it under the furnace belonging to the steam-boiler—I thanked him for coming, as I was tired of waiting for him—he asked what I meant—I said I had been watching the copper pipe which he had taken, and asked him where it was—he said under the dust-hole, and showed me where it was—he asked me to see if I could not rub it up with his master on his behalf—I said I could not.</p>

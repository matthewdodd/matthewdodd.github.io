That he never saw such times in his Life, Men were so poor. Then the said Roberts came by, and Pynes fell upon him, and drew his Sword, and kill'd him; after this he went to Tovey's House, and took a Bible, and made him swear, That he would never discover the Murder as long as he lived. Being asked, why she did not discover the Murder in all this time; she said, she was afraid that her Husband, or some of Pynes's Associates should Murder her; but he being Executed last Sessions, she thought fit now to divulge it.

Shooter and Roberts against him; he made her an Answer thus, You may if you will, for I have a Pardon in my Pocket, and I care not what you do, or to that effect; but then the Examination of Ann Tovey was read in Court, which set forth, that Pynes cofest to her, that he had kill'd one Roberts, a Taylor, in Lincolns-Inn Fields; and she swore in Court, that she saw him commit the Fact.

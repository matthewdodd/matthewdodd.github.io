            . I am street-keeper of Bethnal-green. On the 12th of October, I saw the prisoner with another man, who had a hide under his right arm; they were walking one after the other, close together. I went up to the other man, and asked what he had got; I thought it was a bundle of linen - he made no answer; but the prisoner came behind him, and pushed him on - the man then ran to the corner, by the public-house. Jones took him, and took him in there to know what he had got; then the prisoner came behind, 
               <persName id="t18231022-71-person668">drew</persName>
             the hide from under his arm, and ran away. I followed the prisoner; he fell down - I secured him with it under his arm. Gibbs came and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How far from the prosecutor's did you see him - A. In James-street, opposite the warehouse, about a hundred yards from the warehouse. I do not know whether he heard what I said to the other man.</p>

            . I am an officer. Cooper sent for me. I found two knives and a key on the prisoner, which will open an inner door where this property is kept when it is singly locked, but not when double locked. The other man escaped.</p>

            . I live at Bethnal-green, and have a warehouse in James-street. On Sunday, the 12th of October, this hide was brought to my house - I know it to be mine, by a mark on it; it was wrapped in one of my men's aprons, marked T. F. - he has absconded. I have known the prisoner some years; he used to be drinking with my men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any mark of your own on it - A. It is the dresser's mark. I bought all the man had at the fair. I have missed property to a great amount. The key will unlock the door when single locked, but will not turn it a second time - but they can easily pull the bolt aside then. I have often found it on the single lock when I had double locked it. I have been robbed almost every Sunday for the last three years, to the amount of 300 l. in all.</p>

            . I am a silk weaver. On Sunday evening, the 12th of October, I saw the prisoner talking with another man, and afterwards saw a man come down Granby-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220030"></xptr>opposite James-street, with u bundle, and the prisoner after him. I ran for an officer. They came in a direction from Freeland's premises, in company together; we were going to take the man into a public-house to search him - the prisoner came and snatched the bundle from under his arm.</p>

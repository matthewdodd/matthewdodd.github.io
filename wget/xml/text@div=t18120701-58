I did not get up before seven, on the Sunday morning. The maid-servant discovered the robbery. She found the bar-door open. She was alarmed. She came and apprized me of it. I came down stairs, and found the till was missing out of the bar. When I came I found the till was gone.</p>

            . I am beadle of St Giles's in the Fields. Going from the watchhouse, about fifteen minutes after five o'clock in the morning, in company with Mr. Brown, I saw these two girls in possession of something. I asked them, where they were going: they said, to number seven, Grafton-street, Tottenham-court-road. I asked them, where they came from. They said, one of their mothers kept a chandler's shop, close to Monmouth-street; but could not tell the name of the street where the mother lived; but they were going to number seven, Grafton-street. They had a fowl; I asked them, where they got that fowl from: she said, her mother had bought that fowl in Leadenhall-market the night before. I put my hand upon it, and found it quite warm, as if recently killed. I gave it into the hands of Mr. Brown, that he might feel it was quite warm. I told them, they must go down to the watchhouse, and if I found what they said was correct, they might proceed on their journey, and every thing would be returned to them; but I doubted it. While I was speaking to Mr. Brown, he lifted a check apron off the till; and he said, you don't see what is here. I looked in the till, and I took them down to the watchhouse. I believe there was in the till five pounds ten shillings in copper penny-pieces, halfpence and farthings. The chief part of them is here. All the things they had with them is mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am constable of St. Giles's. I know nothing more than what Bellamy has stated.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAXTER. I am the watchhouse-keeper. I have the property. I produce it. These things were brought in with the women about a quarter past five o'clock. They confessed, that they got in at the window, and staid in there until three o'clock, and went out at the back. Rogers got up, by the help of the other. When she got up to the window, she put the side of the shutter down; opened the window, and put her hand in it, and helped the other up. It is in consequence of their confession that we found out from where it was lost. We examined the premises where they got in. The window goes into a mews. The window is five feet from the ground; but there is a dunghill under it. They got in there. I never saw them before. The bread and cheese, I gave them myself at the watchhouse, to eat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost a fowl, and the fowl the prisoners had was mine; and that is my till; the saucepan, I believe, is mine; the till I can positively swear to. I do not know exactly the quantity of copper there was in the till.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at No. 3, Wilson-street, Wil<lb></lb>liam's-lane—the prisoner is a labourer, and lives in the same house—on the 12th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the landlord's little boy was playing in the passage—he came in to me crying, and said James had been pulling him by the hair of his head—I asked the prisoner what was the reason he had ill-treated the boy—he said he would do the same to myself—I said I would take care of that—I was stooping down to light my pipe by the fire, and he took the shovel and hit me a blow on the head with it—I had not done anything to him before that—I closed with him—it was a very severe blow—it bled—a policeman was sent for—I had given him no provocation only on account of the boy—we have lived in the same house eighteen months—he is generally a quiet, well-behaved man—he also gave me this wound over the eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Manley, and live in the same house—I heard Shea reprimanding the prisoner for hitting my little boy—he said he had no business to hit the boy—I said I knew Driscoll did not hit the boy</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on the 30th of April I was sent from the Thames police-court, and saw Shea's head—there was a lacerated wound on the scalp—I probed it—it went to the bone—it was a bad wound—there was another, half or three quarters of an inch from it, but not so deep—it was such a wound as might be done with this instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Shea wanted to know what I was doing to the child; I said I had not hurt him; he said, "I will give you what I have given you before," and hit me over the right eye; here are the signs of the cut; and he. pulled the hair off my head and gave me a pair of black eyes; he laid hold of my left ear with his mouth, and dragged me into the kitchen; a woman hal<lb></lb>looed out "Murder!" and he let my ear go; we caught one another and fell on the fender; he laid hold of a poker and made a blow at my head; I put up my hand, and he cut my three fingers across with the poker; neither of us would let the poker go until the policeman came in, and then I had it in my hand.</p>

I am a draper, of Hanover Place—on 4th January the last witness handed me a half-crown—I went up into the shop, and found the female prisoner—I told her it was bad, but to be certain I went to a chemist's next door, and had some acid put on it—she said that she would return it to her husband—I was away about three minutes—when I came back I met her about half-way between my door and the chemist's, coming from my shop—I told her it was bad, gave it to her, and she went away towards Park Place; I went into my shop, a constable spoke to me, and she was brought back with the male prisoner, whom I had not seen before—he produced a bag, I saw the contents emptied at the station.</p>

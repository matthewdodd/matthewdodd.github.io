                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Chingford. On 20th Dec; I saw the three prisoners in a cart at Chingford Hatch—they went by my house, between 1 and 2 o'clock—they went by Mr. William Mason's, and were hardly gone a minute before they turned back, I should not think they went above forty yards beyond his gate before they turned back—the female prisoner stopped in the cart and the two men got out, and got over some railings, went into the field, and ran to the lawn hedge and took this linen off—there was a variety of linen hanging on the hedge—each of them took some, and they were running back to the cart—I called to a young man to tell him—the prisoners did not get the linen to the cart, they lald it down by the side of the gate—I think they lald it down because they saw me, and another person ran up the road after them—they got into the cart, and I took hold of the bridle and sent for a constable—Sculthorp jumped out of the cart, I took him by the collar and told him he had better get in the cart till the officer came, which he did; and I gave the three prisoners to the officer.</p>

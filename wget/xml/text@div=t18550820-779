                  </hi>. I keep a grocer's shop at Billingford, in Norfolk. On 3rd March, 1854, the prisoner came, saying that he came from Burrell and Co., for orders for tea papers and paper bags; I said that I did not want any; he said that he bad got orders from the neighbours round—my neigh<lb></lb>bours' names were on the paper, and that induced me to give him an order by word of mouth for 28 lbs. of tea paper at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—14 lbs. was to be cut for half ounces, 10 lbs. for ounces, and the remainder for two ounces—he asked me if I would have them printed on; I said no, that printed papers were of no use to me; he said that I might as well have them printed as not, as there was no difference in price, but I said that I would have them plain—he wrote the order down with a pencil—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the paper on which he wrote, but it was larger than this—I saw the order after he wrote it, and wrote my name at the bottom—this is like my name on this paper, but the paper was a good deal larger, and was double—I wrote nothing but my name—the paper was ruled with pencil at the top—there was pencil writing at the top, and I wrote my name at the bottom, almost the length of the paper from the pencil writing at the top—there was then no pen and ink writing on it—the prisoner said, "Perhaps you will write your name yourself," pointing to the bottom of the paper, and I did so—I believe this to be my writing, unless it is copied very closely from it—I did not write it in pencil, but with pen and ink—my wife was present and another woman—about three weeks afterwards I received my papers, printed, and afterwards an invoice was sent down, but I would not pay it—I had an action brought against me in the Sheriff's Court, London, where the prisoner said that I owed him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the order I had given him only amounted to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The writ was here produced, and was for</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner show you a paper containing samples of printing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had a paper, but I did not look at it; I said that it was of no use; it was a card—he wanted me to have a specimen printed on my papers, but I objected, as they would have been of no use in my small shop—I first spoke to Mr. Miller on this matter, and he advised me to speak to Mr. Drake—I made my statement to the Judge in London, then before a Magistrate in London, then at Norwich before the Judge, and then I came up here—I did not wish to have printing on my papers; it was not that I did not want to pay for the printing, because he said that it was all the same price; the reason was because I had nothing in my shop—my returns are not 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I thought he was telling me the truth when he said that there would be no extra charge for printing—he said that there was no extra charge, but that he printed them for the sale of them—this is like my writing—I wrote with my own pen and ink—if Mr. Ballantine has said, in his opening, that I had no pen and ink, he is wrong—the paper on which I signed my name was two or three inches larger than this—I should think the pencil writing occupied four lines at the top, and I signed at the bottom—I signed where the prisoner told me—I do not sign receipts in the same way—this is not a receipt—I signed it as a direction—I am sure the writing was in pencil—it was a common piece of pencil, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">the end of a pen holder</hi>)—I do not know whether my wife or the other woman saw what was written on the paper, but one of them can-not read—I keep books—I made no memorandum of this order, or of the call</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had not heard that it was in ink, how came you to say to any-body that it was in pencil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was written in pencil—I was at Norwich at the trial—there were several prosecutions for forging this docu<lb></lb>ment—I was one of the prosecutors—the prisoner was acquitted—I do not know that the learned Judge said that it was a mere contract as to the bargain, or that it might have been a very good reason for resisting the pay<lb></lb>ment, but that it did not make a forgery—there was a conversation as to the quantity and the size into which the paper was to be cut—the price was to be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, which was put down according to my order—I was on one side of the counter, and the prisoner on the other—I think he wrote on a book in his hand—I cannot tell how long he was writing it—when he had written it, I wrote my name on it—I saw at the time that my name was a long way from the pencil writing—the direction was not in pencil at the top—I have not sworn, over and over again, that "R. Platten, grocer," was at the top—I did not put "Billingford," because I was not asked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Platten. I recollect the prisoner coming about some tea papers—he showed a large sheet of printed paper, and asked for an order—my husband refused, saying that we did not want such things; and after pressing us for a little time, and saying that the price was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, my husband gave an order for 28 lbs., at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was taken down in writing, with a cedar pencil, by the prisoner, who then asked what my husband would have printed—he said that he would have nothing, as in our little way of business it would not answer—the prisoner said that there was no further expense in printing; and then he asked my husband his name, and said, "Perhaps you will write it yourself?"—my husband took a pen and ink, and wrote his name at the bottom of the paper, where the prisoner pointed—this is my husband's writing (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the paper was longer than this—when doubled it was about this length—when my husband wrote his name, there was nothing on it in ink, except Eliza Capp'a name—I cannot say on which side that was, but he showed it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200048"></xptr>
               <p>to us before he put the order down—with the exception of Capp's name there was no writing at all; there was a blank place down to my husband's name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Howard, of Billingford—I know Mr. Platten's shop—I saw the prisoner there, and heard what passed (I have been out of Court)—the prisoner asked Mr. Platten if he wanted any papers—he said, "No"—the prisoner pressed him to take some, and after a few minutes he gave an order for 28 lbs. at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—the prisoner pulled out a pattern and placed it on the counter for him to choose a pattern to have them printed; Flatten said that his trade was too small, the pri<lb></lb>soner pressed him very much, but ho would not—I saw him write down the order with a piece of cedar pencil—I was close to him—this produced is like it, but I cannot read—the paper was much longer than that—the pri<lb></lb>soner asked him his name—he said, "Platten"—the prisoner said, "How do you spell it? perhaps you will be so good as to write it"—and he wrote it with his own pen and ink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of East Dereham, in Norfolk—the clergyman of the parish introduced these matters to my notice, and the action was compulsory—we forced them to trial—the action was brought in June, 1854, but was not brought to trial till 1855—I heard the prisoner's examination, I did not put any questions to him; Mr. Prentice was the counsel, and I took down some of his questions—I have a memorandum of what I took down—Mr. Prentice asked him, <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "Will you swear that</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Green Gate public-house, Regent Street, Vauxhall—on 27th October, about 8.20, the prisoner came and asked for a half-quartern of the best rum, and gave me a florin, which I put in the till, and he left—there were no other florins there—about eight minutes afterwards he came again for a half-quartern of the best port, and laid down another florin—I put it in the till, gave him the change, and he left—I looked at it again just as he went outside the door, and found both florins were bad—there were no other florins there; I bad taken none in the interval, and no one was taking money but myself—about five minutes afterwards the prisoner came again for a half-quartern of the best gin, and gave me a shilling—I examined it, and told him it was bad—he said that a gentleman outside sent him in to get the gin—I caught hold of him, and went to see if I could see any one, but could not, and took him back to the bar and sent for a policeman—I am quite certain he is the boy who came in on the previous occasions and gave me the two florins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coalheaver of 17, Neville Street—on the 27th October I was at the Green Gate public-house, and saw the prisoner when he came in the third time—I had also seen him the first and second time—he was taken the third time—I am sure he is the boy who came in the first and second time—he passed two florins on the former occasions, and a shilling the third time—I saw him pass them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant L</hi>). On the night of 17th October, I was on duty, and the prisoner was given into my custody—Boyton said that he should charge him with uttering two florins, and a shilling—the prisoner said that he had never been in the house, except on that occasion, passing the shilling, and that a man outside gave it to him to go in and get some liquor, and gave him a 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received two counterfeit florins from Boyton—no money was found on him—he gave his right address.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at the London Gas Light Company—I was in the house when the lad came in with the bad shilling—before that another boy, a smaller one, came in with a two-shilling piece; and the barman did not know whether it was good or bad—he said, "This is a queer one, is not it?"—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> said, I have not had so much money as you have through my hands "—the barman said, "It is rather a queer one; perhaps I may have some more of these"—he looked, and found another, and said, "This is <hi rend="italic">summut</hi> like this one"—in half an hour, or three quarters of an hour, the prisoner came in with one shilling, and he said, "You have been in here before, have not you?"—the prisoner said, "I have not; a man outside, with a <hi rend="italic">billycoek,</hi> gave me the shilling to come in and get a half quartern of gin"—the man who was with the carman said, "I will go and fetch the governor"—he did so, but the governor was not at home; but the mistress came, and brought a police sergeant, and took the boy into the parlour—I do not know what was said, because I was outside—the sergeant came out, and said to the camen, "Well, I cannot make any more of him, you may as well give me the bad coin, and I will take him to the station-house."</p>

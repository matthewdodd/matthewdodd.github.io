               <p>I am one of the constables belonging to the police office, Hatton-garden. On the 19th of November, Tuesday, I received information of this robbery; the person who told me said he would go and point out the person to me that had committed the robbery? I went with him to a public house in Salisbury-court, Fleet street; I took the prisoner, and brought him to the office; in searching of him I took from his person five guineas in gold, two half guineas, two half crown pieces, one shilling and some halfpence, a gold ring, a silk handkerchief and a neckcloth; the handkerchief, ring, and silver, were returned to the prisoner; the neckcloth and gold I have kept in my possession ever since, and the prosecutor swore to the neckcloth and one guinea, being particular bright to the rest, being a new one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any foreign coin on him? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the neck-cloth being my property, I had left it on my bed on Sunday morning; one of the guineas I can take my oath to it, being a particular new one.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was the door of the room or box either of them locked? - I had the key of the room and the box in my pocket; the room was left locked.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the door when you came home? - I came up to put the key in my door, and then I found it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of its being broke open? - I did not see any particular marks of violence on the door.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Pray what particular mark is there on the neckcloth? I bought it in the country the time I did this on my neck.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know it by a particular mark, it is mended like, darned, and there is a mark of paint on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said before the justice that he believed it was his own, but now I find he has learned a better story.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040012"></xptr>Court. What may be the value of this property altogether? - About 12l.</p>

               <p>Q. In what floor did the prisoner lodge? - In a garret up three pair of stairs; I see him go up and down that day, and saw him go out with a bundle.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. In the first place that is the gentleman that took me at the public house; ask him if he found any instrument about me; I am charged with breaking and entering.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not say that he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Or any other property whatever but what is my own; that neck-cloth is my own, it is the fellow of this that I have on my neck; in the second place I lodge at this landlord's up three pair of stairs, it is a house for the lodging of strangers, sometimes there is a man comes there for one night or two nights; now some time ago there was a robbery committed there of a sheet and a pair of shoes, they might as well have laid that to me as this, this robbery was committed on Monday night, why is not the same man as liable to commit this robbery as me? I have been in the house three months, or something better; the landlord of the house would give me a good character if he was here.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Parrott I have nothing to say but what he paid just, and honest, but how he got his bread I don't know. The lock of the door we have been obliged to have a smith to mend it, for it would neither lock nor unlock that room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This lady says that she saw me coming down with a bundle, ever since I have been there I have perhaps been in and out for two or three times a day; that day I went, I went up to get a few things for a washer woman, the contents of this bundle were my own things, and were found at the washerwoman's when she was sent for, she knows the same; I have been out of the country but three months, I have nobody in this part of the world, and what little money was taken from me was the remainder of what I brought from the country; before the justice my prosecutor did not pretend to say any further, than that he believed it was his handkerchief; he might as well swear to this I have got on my neck, I dare say the gentlemen of the jury can find no particular mark upon it, if you look firm into this my lord, you will find me an injured man.</p>

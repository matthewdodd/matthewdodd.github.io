I saw him a few minutes after, and knew him to be the boy who received it. Another boy took it and threw it down; the prisoner took a bag and put over it, and ran down the Green with it.</p>

            . I was on Clerkenwell-green, and saw the prisoner run down the Green with the carpet under his arm; I watched and followed him about three hundred yards, and saw him put it into a house, he just threw it inside the door, and walked away and joined another boy at the corner of the street, who was waiting for him; they walked away up the Green: several of them said to him,</p>
               <p>"Are you in it?" I found Miller had lost a carpet: Miller and I went to search the house; the carpet was gone, and has never been found. When we returned, the prisoner was taken: I am sure he is the boy.</p>

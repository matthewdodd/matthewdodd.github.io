               <p>Did they rob you of any thing? - They robbed me after they had knocked me down of a pocket, an apron, four shillings, a child's jamb, and a snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Did they produce a pistol? - No; they beat me terribly.</p>
               <p>What did they beat you with? - Their hands; they tore off the pocket-apron by force, and left the strings behind; the other things were in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you know the men before? - I never saw them in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of their persons? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040030"></xptr> Yes. As I was turning round to help myself, when I was down, I saw them coming to strike me, and had a full view of their faces.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing at the time they robbed you? - The blows came so fast, I was hardly sensible; I did not cry out while they were beating me, as I knew my life was in their hands. When I was able to get up, I went into the house, and said, gentlemen, you have robbed me; one of the gentlemen standing by the door showing something to another, said, has the old woman missed it; d - n the bitch, and were going to drive me out, on which I made my escape.</p>
               <p>Do you live at Islington? - No; I went to see my sister on the Sabbath-day, the 24th of January, and staid supper; my husband was to come for me; he did not; I set out by myself from my sister's to come to London at eleven o'clock at night. I live just by Drury-lane. I asked the watchman if it was safe for me to go across the fields by myself; he said he did not know, as the moon was very cloudy. I asked him where I could have a house to lie at; as I knew I had a trifle about me, all that I had in the world, I was afraid of loosing that; he said the Peacock would be up at one o'clock, and he would take me safe there; he took me there at one o'clock. I treated him for his kindness; he staid about twenty minutes, and then went away; he left me about half after one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you intend to lie there? - No; I intended to stay till daylight, in order to be safe.</p>
               <p>What time was you robbed? - About three o'clock. These people came about half after two.</p>
               <p>Were they drunk? - They did not seem to be drunk - they seemed very roguish.</p>
               <p>Was nobody up in the house? - Yes, two watchmen.</p>
               <p>Did not they take your part? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they see this ill-treatment? - Yes, and the landlord too.</p>
               <p>Did not they attempt to assist you? - No.</p>
               <p>How did you know they were watchmen?</p>
               <p>- I was told they were watchmen; they had great coats and caps on.</p>
               <p>What did you do after they had robbed you? - I went and sat down on a bench next door to my sister's, till she got up, then I told her what had happened, and she put me to bed as I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the the men afterwards?</p>
               <p>- No. I went the next day to Justice Blackborough. I was led by two women there. He sent for one of the men out of prison who was already taken up for house robbing.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he acknowledge any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>He seemed thunder-struck, and as he was going out called me an old bitch. and said if he could catch me out what he would do to me.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 30th of January, Dinmore, I, and the last witness, apprehended the prisoner Campbell coming to the Angel; he asked what was the information against him; I said he would know when he came before the magistrate; then he said, I know what it is, it is through that rogue Bell, he brought me to this. We took him to Justice Blackborough's; I do not remember his saying any thing these. I was not at the examination of Bell on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Did you understand him that Bell had brought him into a scrape by inviting him to partake of the crime, or brought a false charge against him? - No; I thought he meant Bell had invited him to do it. We were informed on Monday, that the woman was like to die; and had an order to take the men to her to the hospital. When we came into the ward, the curtains being drawn round the bed, Dinmore undrew the curtains, and asked if she knew any person in the house. She opened her eyes, and pointed to Campbell, and said she knew him; he said how could she say that, when she was in such a situation; she said I wish I had never seen you, then I should not have been in this situation, nor you in trouble. Her sister came to her and said, sister, you are in a dreadful situation, what will become of you if you should say a false thing against these men. She said if it was the last word she had to say, he was the man, that was with Bell.</p>
               <p>CAMPBELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When we came to the bedside, Redgrave undrew the curtains, and said, that is the young man in the brown coat that was along with Bell; she said I do not know the man; he said again, that is the man that was with Bell; she then said, I believe it is. I never saw the woman in my life till I saw her in the hospital. I never saw her at the Peacock. I came there about half past one o'clock for some beasts; the landlord of the Peacock (Mr. Baldwin) would not come; they kept him out of the way.</p>

               <p>All you saw was their preparation for the robbery? - Yes; that was all I saw. They went out of the White-Lyon about half after nine o'clock, but I do not know where they went to afterwards.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the tinder-box that the maid found in Mr. Bartholomew's house? - No; I have not seen the box.</p>
               <p>Should you know it? - No; they did not borrow one that night at the White-Lyon, they only asked for one.</p>

               <p>I am a wheeler. I live at Islington. John Green, who is my son, lives with me. I heard he borrowed the sack, before this happened, to carry home a lamb. I know nothing of the affair; but coming home, in Sadler's-wells fields, I heard something thrown away, and saw the light of a lantern; this was seven in the evening, the day after the robbery was committed. Coming along the field I looked by the side of the foot-path and saw a bundle; I went and kicked it; it was coppers and pans, and a tea-kettle, in a woman's apron; my wife took up the tea-kettle, and I took up the other things, and carried them to the Angel. Winter came by me just at the time with a blue apron about him, and there was a man, Casteldine I believe, was just by.</p>
               <p>Did some of them come and desire to hide things at your house? - Not to my knowledge. Casteldine is well acquainted with my ground; he has worked for me, and knows the way to every part of my ground.</p>
               <p>Did he never desire to hide something at your house? - Not to my knowledge; if he had I should have stopped them.</p>
               <p>To Casteldine. Did not you say you asked leave of John Green, the wheeler, to hide some of your things there? -

               <p>I am the wife of Thomas Green. I do not know any thing of the robbery. The 23d of January, my husband and I coming by Sadler's-wells fields, about five yards from the Wells, we heard something fall. He said there were thieves. I said it was nothing but milk-pails. I thought it was milk-pails. Immediately two men run by us; I do not know who they were; coming further I saw a bundle, and picked it up. I told my husband I had got a tea-kettle; he picked up another bundle with several other things; it was dark; it was seven in the evening. There were two men just by, one of them ran against me, but I do not know who they were.</p>

               <p>I was going home about seven in the evening on the 23d of January, and having a lantern and a candle in it, I saw somebody stop in a light waistcoat. I held my candle, and saw him move gently into the field. I held up my candle again, made towards him, and he ran away. I did not know who he was. I turned round, saw a sack, and found there was cheese in it. A man coming up, I asked him to help me to carry it to the Angel. There were seven cheeses and a half, a chissel, and a brass ladle in it with Mr. Bartholomew's name on it. I heard something rattle. I thought I had run against a milk-pail myself as I came over the field. (The things were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Cook. There was some of his property in the house of the late Captain livingstone, in Pelham-place, Brompton—I have seen some of it since this inquiry, at a house at Prospect-place, Old Brompton, which is occupied by Ayley—amongst the property were two candlesticks, a pair of snuffers, seven forks, a chimney orna<lb></lb>ment, two salt-cellars, two decanters, 300 newspapers, one feather-bed, 100 books, two yards of carpet, and other things—I also saw some things at Clark's, the auctioneer's—some of them were my husband's, and some Captain Living<lb></lb>stone's—I resided in the captain's house up to Feb. last, and then left—I have not been there since—I have only passed it once since—my husband's property was in the house when I left in Feb.—Trigg was in the captain's service when I was there. In consequence of information from Dr. Lynch, I went to the captain's house about eight at night, on the 11th of Oct., but did not go in—I saw Trigg assisting at the hall door, and several men—I do not know whether Charles Davis was there—they were removing printed books and papers from the house into a van—I caused some of the police to follow the van—on the following Friday I went to the first-floor front room of the house in Prospect-place—I saw the same papers and books there that I had seen placed in the van—some of them belonged to my husband—the others belonged to Captain Livingstone—I had seen them in his house—I found a bed and other things there—I then caused Trigg and Charles Davis to be taken into custody—a day or two after, I got a search-warrant, and went to the house of George Davis, in Pond-place, Chelsea, and saw some other pro<lb></lb>perty.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What does all this mean? "Whereas, my husband, Samuel Cook, being now a prisoner for debt, and being in want of money for the support of himself, and me, and his family, he authorized me, from time to time, to raise money on certain articles of furniture and books, and in consequence of Mr. Jeremiah Livingstone's having advanced to me various sums of money amount<lb></lb>ing to 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I do deposit with him the following books, manuscripts," &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These were the books belonging to my husband—Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not in the habit of breaking sealed letters addressed to Mr. Livingstone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not but by his desire—I opened a letter in his presence by his desire, and answered that same letter to the gentleman—I never was applied to for any keys of Mr. Livingstone's, which had been lost—I never had any keys—I had that bond in my possession which I was charged with having taken—Mr. Livingstone gave it me to take down to the Rev. Mr. Donald, at St. Alban's—I did not take it out of the scrutoire—Mr. Living-stone gave it me, and I brought it to him again—I took it for the purpose of obtaining some money on it, but I did not obtain it—I handed it back to Mr. Livingstone again, and after that Mr. Colville had it in his possession at the Court of Chancery—Mr. Colville told me himself that he got it from the hands of Mr. Livingstone, and the deed too—I never was ordered by Mr. Livingstone to leave the house—to the last moment he solicited me to remain, in the presence of Trigg—I had not been living upon Mr. Livingstone for above ten years—I was living on my own means, which he obtained upon my papers—he was not in a condition to lend me money but on my papers—I might write to him in 1835 to get money of him—I was then seeking to get money on our papers.</p>

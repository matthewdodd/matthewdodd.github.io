            . About Nine at Night my Apprentice sent for me from the Tavern, and told me the Prisoner, who was then in my Shop, had stole my Goods. I took the Prisoner backwards, and calling in two of my Workmen, I charged him with taking such Goods. After a long Hesitation, and often desiring me to go up Stairs, he gave me 16 Verges out of his Mouth (all of them were of no greater Bulk than a Chew of Tobacco) 17 Studs of Brass, 23 Ballances, 10 Setts of Steel Works, belonging to Watch - Movements, three Pounds and three Quarters of Brass, and a File, out of his Pockets. He said he was ashamed of and sorry for what he had done, and begged for Mercy, and that I would not send him to Jail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I deliver them to you the Minute you came in, and tell you that I intended to buy them, and not to defraud you?</p>

            . The Prisoner came into the Shop for some Brass, and bought a little. Then he wanted some Ballances. I shewed him a Parcel, but soon missing some of them, I watched him. Next he asked for Verges; I told out 32, and saw him put several into his Mouth, and I had but 27 back; and besides, I miss'd a Dozen out of the Box; and after that I miss'd ten Steel Works; upon which I made an Excuse to send for my Master, and when he came I spoke to him aside, and told him what the Prisoner had done - All that the Prisoner bought came but to Nine-pence Half-penny.</p>

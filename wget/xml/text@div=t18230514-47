            . I live at Messrs. Wells and Nevill's, in Fleet-street. I saw Mr. Barber in the street, and the prisoner behind him - he put his hand into Mr. Barber's pocket, and took out his handkerchief. I ran out and told Mr. Barber of it; he had got on two or three doors. We overtook him. The handkerchief was not found; I saw nobody with him. I am certain he took it - he was scarcely out of my sight. He stopped at a picture shop, where other persons were standing.</p>

            , he took hold of it in his hand, and heaved it on one shoulder, he took it from the outside quarter of our barge; the other person stood down in the hatch, and the other stood on the coat's swell, and heaved the sack to him, he received it on his back, he carried it off from the hatches, and delivered it into the boat's bottom of Mr. Keith's, their master's vessel; it was adjoining to our vessel the inside; Garrat said to the other, will that do? I went on the top of the bulk, and I said, it would not do; I said that is my master's property, you have no business with it; they looked up, but never a one answered; I told them that is my master's property, and the best way will be for to bring it back again, and put it in its place; they jumped down into their master's barge, and says to me, you get down and give us a heave; Garrat said so; with that I made reply, I will not, I am put here in trust to take care of my master's barge, and I will not stir from it, and Lawrence jumped down and lifted it on Garrett's back, and he brought it back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were the prisoners taken up afterwards? - Between ten and eleven the next day; the next day I gave information to Mr. Randal our master's factor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were they not takens at their master's boat? - No, neither of them.</p>
               <p>Q. They were close by? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. When you desired them to return the sack they did it? - They did.</p>

               <p>Court. What kind of terms are you upon, you and these men; Did you know them before? - Yes, this ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they know you was waiting in your barge? - I don't know that they did. Lawrence was watchman in another barge, he was on board of Keith's barge; they came from Abingdon loaded with malt.</p>
               <p>Q. You are all then brother bargemen; is it not customary for somebody to be on board of a night to watch? - It is always customary.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any quarrel with these men? - Never had a word with these men in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor your master? - No, never, all on good terms.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the sack here? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. They have been in prison ever since the 25th of April? - Yes, from the 26th. (The sack and malt produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Reading. Are both of these men Abingdon men? - Yes, and both married men.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called five witnesses who gave them an excellent character.</p>

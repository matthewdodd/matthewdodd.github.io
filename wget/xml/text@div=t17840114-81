             the maid? - Yes; she is my daughter.</p>
               <p>Then what is become of her? - She is not under my jurisdiction; she has been at service.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you any other evidence? - No, my Lord, that that is put of the way is the principal evidence.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this trick as it appears to me, has succeeded for the present, for there being no evidence you must acquit the defendants.</p>
               <p>Court. Take care of the recognizance.</p>

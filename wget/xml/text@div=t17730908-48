To try the truth of the story I went to Mr. Hewet's, a mercer, and enquired of him whether he had sold any silk to the prisoner; he said he had sold the prisoner some straw coloured silk, and it was sent to Nicholas-lane, to my house. I was satisfied with the account of the mercer, but as she said she had pawned some silk, I went with her to the pawnbroker's and the prisoner asked for my silk, pawned in the name of Ludlow; it is part of my silk.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Flude the pawnbroker. On the 12th of June the prisoner brought eighteen yards and a quarter of silk, and pawned in the name of Ludlow; the prisoner and her mistress came for the silk, and the prisoner said it was the lady's silk and she might have it.</p>

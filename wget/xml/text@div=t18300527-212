On the 20th of April I had left my shirt on a box at my lodging when I went out at seven o'clock in the morning; the prisoner lodged in the same house - when he came home at half-past twelve he told me he had pawned it, and said it must be a d-d good one, as he had got 4s. on it; I said I should get an officer, but, in consequence of some of his friends coming the next morning, I let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LEE. Q. Do not you know he had been out drinking the whole of that day? A. I do not know - he came to me while I was in bed and said he had pawned it; I had told him before this not to take any of my things - he did not say he took it by mistake; he said he would get it out - 4s. was put down, but I never accepted it; he was taken in bed on the 21st of April - I said if he got it out I did not care.</p>

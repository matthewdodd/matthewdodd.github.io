               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Hartley. No, it was moon light; it was a little cloudy, but gave a great deal of light; as soon as the man that seized me by my collar demanded my money, another on the other side put a cutlass to my throat, and said he would cut my throat, or cut my head off, if I made any resistance; the third rifled my pocket of a half crown and sixpence, and took my buckles out of my shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of the men that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Hartley. The prisoners are two of them; I could see their faces very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Which put the pistol to your head?</p>
               <p>Hartley. I cannot be positive which did the particular acts, but I am positive to their persons; I think Simmonds held the pistol, and Bishop the cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you?</p>
               <p>Hartley. About four minutes; when they had robbed me, they said God bless you, get home; two of them were taken up the night following.</p>

             were concerned with me in robbing the prosecutor; we met together that night at the White-horse in Lamb-alley, Bishopsgate-street; we went from there about eight o'clock with intent to commit a robbery; we met the prosecutor in Hackney fields; we turned back and I put a pistol to him, and asked him for his money; Simmonds held a cutlass to him, and Bishop rifled his pockets; he took from him a pair of buckles, a pair of buttons, and a half crown and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you committing the robbery?</p>
               <p>Darley. About five or six minutes, or not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of you say any thing when you left him?</p>
               <p>Darley. I think I bid him go about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say bless him, or blast him, or any thing like that?</p>
               <p>Darley. I never said any such thing; we divided the money among us; when I was taken up they sent me word in Newgate that they had thrown the buckles and buttons away; Bishop and I were taken up together the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hartley. Was you sober at the time?</p>
               <p>Hartley. Yes, as sober as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the same surprize that prevented your knowing the part each of them took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177401120036"></xptr> in robbing, prevent you from knowing their persons?</p>
               <p>Darley. No, I saw their faces distinctly; I challenged them the moment I saw them.</p>
               <p>Bishop's Defence.</p>
               <p>When Darley was first taken, the prosecutor swore that he rifled his pockets; after that he swore that he held the pistol to his head.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hartley. Did you swear differently?</p>
               <p>Hartley. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to identify their persons?</p>
               <p>Cole. It was dark when we were first together; but I was so long with them that I could not but know them by the light of the lamps, as I walked with them in Hackney road; I took particular notice of Simmonds; after they had robbed me, they said if I did not go on, they would blow my brains out; I found my clothes at one Delafore's in Norton-falgate; I went with the other young man that was robbed to several public-houses; we found Bishop and Darley together, at a public house near Nortonfalgate; as soon as I saw them, I told Flanagan, one of the people that went with me, that they were two of the persons that robbed me; I saw Simmonds afterwards at Justice Wilmot's, and was certain to his being one that robbed me.</p>

The prisoner came to me on 2nd Oct., at eleven o'clock in the morning, to look at some diamond rings; he had been to look at some on 26th and 27th Sept., and I had none to fit him; I told him to come again in the afternoon—he came between three and four, and I showed him eight diamond rings in a paper, and told him the price—he offered a price for them, but not so much as I wanted—we at last agreed for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and five per cent. discount for cash—he represented himself as a merchant—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be taken off, he being short of cash—he produced a box exactly similar to this (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I put the diamond rings in it, and put paper by the side of them—the prisoner said, "Make out three invoices," and I did—they were all alike—they were for the rings—he took some sealing-wax from his pocket and sealed the box—he afterwards produced three German silver watches, and gave them to me—I was to plate them, and he was to have them back the next afternoon—he also produced three small jeweller's gold rings, and wanted three dozen of them made—I told him I could make them for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece—he asked me to write a direction on the box, but he did not give me the direction, he said, "No, never mind"—he produced some notes that looked like Bank-notes—he said they were Scotch notes—I offered to get them cashed—he did not leave them—he was to call again in an hour, and pay me for the rings—he did not appear to take the box in which the rings were, it was left on the table and the watches; he told me not to go out—he did not come back at all—I did not open the box till the following Thursday; one of my journeymen was present—I then</p>

                  </hi>. My brother-in-law, Adolphus Green, works at Mr. Joseph's—he called on me on 5th Oct. and told me of something that had occurred—after that, I saw the witness Sherwinski—I have known him for a long time—my brother-in-law came to my house—he had not been there for eight months—I said, "What brought you here?"—he said, "I will tell you some news respecting two foreigners"—Sherwinski's brother was in my house—my brother-in-law told me something about the diamonds, and I and Sherwinski talked about the person who had committed the robbery—I did not go to Mr. Josephs; Sherwinski did, he went to get a job—he told me he did go there, and did get the job, to find out a person named Krakauer—I did not go to the lodging of this man—I did not know where he lived—I do not know whether there was a cap left at Mr. Joseph's—I have not seen a cap that was left at Mr. Joseph's—Mr. Barnett was in my house, and he said, "Did not you make a cap for Krakauer?"—I said, "No"—I said, "You want to get me to swear it; I would not swear a He for a room full of gold"—Mr. Barnett wanted to persuade me that I made a cap—I said, "No," and he went out of the room—I do not know why he wanted to persuade me that</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 19, Wenlock-street, City-road. I have been living with the prisoner—I remember 2nd Oct., I saw him on that day—I breakfasted with him between nine and ten o'clock—I remained at home, and he went out between nine and ten with Mr. Marks, and Mr. Cohen—he came back about a quarter past eleven with his brother—he remained at home about half an hour, and then went out with his brother—he came home alone at one o'clock—we dined together—Betsy Newland, the servant, waited at dinner—we were about half an hour at dinner—he had a carpet-bag—he put some jewellery in it—he had some sponge—he took some of it in a carpet-bag and a canvas-bag—it—was not this carpet-bag, not like it—it had leather on each side of it—I have known him about eight weeks—I never saw him with a carpet-bag like this—after he had done this, he went into his bed-room to pack some things in a small portmanteau—he was in the bed-room about a quarter of an hour—he wrote a note to his brother, which he gave to tie servant Betsy Newland—we had tea between three and four o'clock—Betsy Newland did not wait at tea, she went off with the note to his brother—she brought up the kettle and then went away with the note—when we had finished tea the prisoner went out—he came back in about five minutes in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I remained at home, and he went away with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I believe he went as far as Reading that night—he left me about four o'clock—I did not see him again till he was in custody—he was not out at all from the time we sat down to dinner at one o'clock, till the time he left after tea: he was not out of my sight.</p>

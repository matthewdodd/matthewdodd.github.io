               <p>Was you sober? - Yes; these men and another came and laid hold of me, and asked where I was going? I told them I was going home; and then Burrows asked me what I had got? I told him nothing; he put his hand into my pocket, the other two ran before him, and he knocked me down; I struggled for my money, but he got it before he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Had either of the other two spoken to you at all? - Yes, they were accusing me, and calling me all they could call me.</p>
               <p>What were they accusing you of? - They were calling me many names; it was the prisoner Burrows that asked where I was going; the other man did not speak; they were speaking to him; I do not know what they said, but they went off; none of them touched me but Burrows.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it, light or dark? - I think it was about twelve o'clock; it was a dark night; it was not very clear; I struggled with Burrows some time, till I got assistance, and he ran through a narrow passage; I called for the watch, and kept hold of him, he knocked me down and took my hat, and another man seized me by the collar directly; that was after we got down the passage; the passage was a thoroughfare, the street is called the Amby; it was so dark I could not distinguish the faces, except of the man that I caught hold of; the other went off; I held him by the coat till he knocked me down the second time, and I got help; I never missed him; he never was out of my reach or sight, till the watchman and another man came to my assistance; the prisoner was taken and carried to the watch-house; he was in soldiers clothes; the other was taken about a quarter of an hour after; that is the other lad in the red coat: I gave information of three; the prisoner was not searched till he came to the watch-house; the prisoner Burrows came and snatched the hat from the other prisoner, and ran off with it; I saw him; that was before we got him to the watch-house: I saw no money found on him when he was searched; the struggle was some time; they had all bayonets hung in their belts, but used no arms to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. M'Nally, Prisoner's Counsel. What business are you? - I am a porter.</p>
               <p>Are not you a waiter at a public house? - No.</p>
               <p>What house are you porter to? - A gentleman in Ely place.</p>
               <p>What gentleman? - Mr. Brodie.</p>
               <p>Were not you then, or are not you now waiter at a public house in Holborn? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>What is Mr Brodie? - A wine merchant: I was at a friend's that I have in Westminster, the soldier came up to me, and asked me directly where I was going.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you before this? Not much; they asked me where I was going? and I told them I was going home; and in the mean time they had their hands in my pocket; there was no conversation but them words; when this lad had his hand in my pocket; that was Stroud, I saw him putting his hand in my right hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>It was dark? - Yes, it was not moonlight; it was dark; I was a great deal frightened.</p>
               <p>Was you near a lamp? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Was there sufficient light for you to distinguish one man's countenance from another? - Yes; I recollect the countenance of the lad in brown; I do not swear to the countenance of the man in red; the one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090012"></xptr>that robbed me I never let him out of my sight or hands.</p>
               <p>Was not the blow by which you lost your hat a blow in the man's defence, when he was pursued? - He gave me a blow down, he took off my hat and knocked me down after taking it off.</p>
               <p>Was not you fighting at the time he took off your hat? - I was struggling to hold him, he was not struggling to get from me, he took off my hat and knocked me down and went forwards.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see these soldiers before? - I never saw them with my eyes before, we have so many soldiers, it was a dark night; I ran up and held my candle and lanthorn right in their faces to see whether I could swear to their faces again.</p>

               <p>But that is not calling you names? - No more; they were talking to themselves, but I do not know any thing more, the other men stopped and Stroud was behind, then they stood, and Stroud came and I laid hold of him, and says I give me my own; and he knocked me down, and I called for the watch.</p>

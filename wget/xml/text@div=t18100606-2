               <p>Q. Does your husband sell twine - A. He does; I shewed the prisoner some twine, I asked him eighteen shillings a dozen for them; he desired me to make out a bill of parcels in the name of Williams; I did: he purchased three dozen. He dropped his pocket book in our shop, my girl was gone out to get change of a pound note, when she returned she picked up the pocket book in the shop; she brought it to me; I said it belonged to that gentleman in the shop, I had seen it in his hand just before; the prisoner exclaimed, what a lucky thing it was that she picked it up, he had bills in it to a great amount, some hundreds, belonging to his captain and himself; he said he would reward the girl for picking it up; I told him there was no necessity for that: he asked me to change him a five pound note; I told him I was not certain whether I could; I took out my pocket book to see, I had not enough small notes to give him change for the five pound note; I had a ten pound note, it was the first note I took out of my pocket book; he asked me if I could give him change of a twenty pound note; I had the ten pound in my hand; he catched the ten pound note out of my hand very quick; he then went to the door in a very great hurry, and said, send your girl with me, my captain is waiting just above; he went away with the twine, saying, he would be back in a moment; my girl went with him; she did not return for several hours.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar and tell me whether you remember his coming to your mistress's house any time, and when - A. Yes; I cannot tell what day it was; it was about February; I never saw him before. When he was at my mistress's house I went out to get change for a pound note for my mistress, and when I returned I saw a pocket book lay upon the floor.</p>

I did not know what note it was, only my mistress told me; I saw something like a note in my mistress's hand; I am sure it was a note; I did not see it opened; he snatched it out of my mistress's hand and told her to send her servant with him, his captain was waiting just above; when he came out the door he told me he would give me a handsome present for picking the pocket book up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out of the door gently, or how - A. He went out very fast from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. He ran out did he - A. Yes, with the ten pound note in his hand; he took me to a corner of a street and told me to wait there till he came to me, if he did not come himself he would send his lad; I waited for him there from two o'clock till between six and seven at night; he did not return.

On the 5th of February, 1760, I went into the Royal Navy, on board captain Lockhart Ross's ship, and was turned over to his Majesty's ship Namur, and was at the taking of the Havannah in August, 1762; and when I returned to England was turned over, and remained on board the Royal George; after that I went on board the Princess Amelia; and when the war began with America I was sent out with Lord Howe; I received a wound and was sent on shore at Dublin's Island. After that I was sent on board the ship commanded by captain Keith, and remained on board untill I was sent home, and then I was sent on board the ship commanded by sir Hyde Parker, and when I came to Spithead I was drafted on board the Agammemnon, and when that ship arrived at Plymouth I was paid off; but as long as I could stand under British colours I was willing to serve his Majesty; I went on board again when lord Hood took the command; I was on board the Barfleur, and the Victory, and after Touton was taken in 1793, I was sent home with a French man-of-war, and was then drafted into sir

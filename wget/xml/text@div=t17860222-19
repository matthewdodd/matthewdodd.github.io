               <p>How is it fastened? - I believe it had been nailed sometime before, but I did not examine it to see whether it was nailed that evening, it had been nailed for four or five nights, it was usually kept bolted.</p>
               <p>Was there any shutter to it? - Yes, outside shutters.</p>
               <p>Nailed? - There was a bolt withinside to the shutters, I believe it was not fastened on account that they could not get into the room, at six o'clock, I did not examine whether the nail was in, but as I passed it, I saw there was a great deal of rubbish lay on the outside of the window, and the window shutters were both close, but whether nailed or not, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you observe at all after six till you went to bed? - Not to my knowledge; the next morning I was called up about seven, and informed of the robbery, I went to look at the window, and I saw the window broke open, it appeared that the bottom part of the shutter was wrenched open, and the top and bottom of the shutters were broken, and the sash was lifted up; I did not see that the window was broke.</p>

               <p>Was it necessary to remove the rubbish in order to open the shutters? - We could not get the shutter open before, that room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220050"></xptr> had been locked up for a week, but not the rest of the house.</p>

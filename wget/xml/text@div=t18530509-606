                  </hi>. I reside at No; 13, Bevis-marks. The prisoner was in my service—there was another servant named Margaret Floyd—I had missed money from the cash box since November last—in consequence of that I changed my lock, and bad a Chubb's patent and two keys—one key I kept myself, and one I gave to my wife—on April 3rd I deposited some notes, half-checks, and four half-sovereigns, which I marked, in the cash box, and locked it—I put it into the parlour cupboard, where it was usually kept—on Monday morning, 4th April, I went to the box—I missed the whole four half-sovereigns—I did not miss anything besides—on the 7th, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, I was called up by Margaret Floyd—she showed me a dirty rag—on the receipt of that, I felt in one corner, and found a small key; it was the old key that I had lost—there were four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in the dirty rag—one of those half-sovereigns was the one I had marked—this is the piece of rag, and this is the half-sovereign—the mark is on the head—I crossed it—this is the very half-sovereign I marked, and this is the old key—when the constable came to my house, he called me to go with him into the prisoner's room, and opened her box; and there we found several things—I had before missed out of the cash box sovereigns and Bank-notes—I found an umbrella at the bottom of the box—it was my own—I found a crochet collar—Mrs. Green can speak to that—one pair of gloves is mine—I can speak to the earrings—they are silver—I found two handkerchiefs marked with Mrs. Green's signature, and two knives—I would not swear to the knives, but they were taken from the warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I was fellow servant to the prisoner. We slept together—I recollect the morning of 7th April, the prisoner getting up—she left me in bed—she afterwards came up again—I asked her what she came up for—she was doing nothing—she then came, and began to pull the clothes about; and I said, "What are you after?" and she said, "A bit of white rag"—I said if it was of no more consequence than that, would not it do when I was up?—she said, "Yes"—she went down again—of course I was anxious to see what she was looking for so earnestly—I had a little boy lying with me, and between me and the child lay a bit of dirty rag—I took up the dirty rag, and opened it—there were three sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, and two keys in it—I sent down directly for my mistress; my master came up, and I handed it to him—the prisoner came up directly after my master was there—she claimed the money as her own—the box that was searched was the prisoner's box.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning. I was in Turnmill-street, and saw a quantity of lead - there were about three pieces in a cart, three on the pavement, and, I think, three in the prisoner's shop; I crossed over, and asked the prisoner if he had bought that lead - he said what business was it of mine - I said I was an officer, and would know - he then said he had bought it of two men; I asked if he had a bill and receipt; he went into the room, and began writing on the mantel-piece - he called me in, and said, "That is the person I bought it of, Mr. Thomas, of Walham-green - I have bought things of him before;" I said, "Where is the bill?" he then took down a file - I said they were old bills - he went out, and brought in a piece of paper - I said that would not do, I should take the lead and him too; his wife began crying, and hanging about him, and he said, "Here is a sovereign, go on;" I said, "I shall take it away," and said,"If you bought this honestly, you will go with me, and see if we can find the man;" we went to several places,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100074"></xptr>and in St. John-street saw two men with lead in a cart - the prisoner went up to them. and said, "Do you know the man who drove the grey pony, who brought some lead to my house this morning?" they said No, and ran away; I left Cohen, pursued, and took one of them - I then went home to the prisoner, and said, "I don't think I have done right in letting you go - I must take you;" he said he hoped not, on account of the situation of his wife; I said I would take his word, and he met me at the office - he told me there, he had bought the lead in the street, for 7l., and here is a book, which he produced as his entry-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you live near him? A. Yes, and have known him all his life; his wife was pregnant - I knew him and let him go; he came to me at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and we went to the office together; there is an officer and patrol live opposite his house; I have inquired at Walham-green, and find a man, named Cheeseman, answering the description of the man whom he said he bought it of, is out of the way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he not say he bought it of Thomas? A. Yes, and that he had bought a still of him before; the paper he gave me says, "Thomas, bought of Cohen," which made me think it was not right; I fitted the lead - it corresponded.</p>

            . On the 13th Terry, who lodges with me, came and said some lead was unloading at Cohen's; I went and stood at my door, talking to Terry - there were two men with the cart, and one stood at the head of the grey pony - there was one respectable looking man in the shop, and I saw some money, as if it was being paid for - the men went away; I thought it was all right, and went about my business.</p>

             re-examined. Part of the lead was in Emanuel's cart, who is Cohen's next door neighbour; it was not in the cart which had brought it - they were, apparently, loading it into Emanuel's cart, to go away again - there was no concealment.</p>

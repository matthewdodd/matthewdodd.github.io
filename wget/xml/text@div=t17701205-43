            . I belong to the Charming Betsy. The night this happened I was in the cabbin getting my supper, one of the boys came down and told me there was a dispute forward, and that there was a challenge to fight between the deceased and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Newton?</p>
               <p>Hewett. He was the <rs id="t17701205-43-deflabel192" type="occupation">Custom-house officer</rs>

They came upon the main deck and began to hustle one another about, but there was no blows; the deceased got the prisoner up against the main shrowds; I took hold of Atkinson's arm, but I could not pacify him. The prisoner got clear from him and ran from the quarter deck to the main deck, and took a capston bar out of the long-boat, which was standing upon the main deck, and held it up and swore he would knock down the first man that came near him. The deceased ran towards him and endeavoured to get a hand-spike out of the long-boat.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a dangerous weapon, is it not?</p>
               <p>Hewett. Yes. Before he got the handspike out of the boat, Newton struck him on the side of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the quarrel began about?</p>
               <p>Hewett. No, I was not there. Atkinson made a stagger towards the long-boat; he recovered and then made towards the prisoner again: Newton struck him the second time upon his head, and that knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner apprehensive that the deceased was going to strike him with the bar?</p>
               <p>Hewett. I apprehend so.</p>

               <p>Newlove. Atkinson and I left the ship in Yarmouth Roads; Atkinson and I went to get some gin and wine we had on board, the rest of the ship's company had had that favour granted them. We found the prisoner in my bed; we asked him to let us take our property on shore; he seemed to growl at it; the deceased told him to turn out, he had no business there; he said to him come upon deck and drink; they went upon deck; then Newton challenged the deceased to lick him; I was not upon deck when he received the blow.</p>

Atkinson that is dead said, d - n your blood you dog get off from that place, or I will kick your a - e. I said you are not able, my friend, to do that. Newlove said, d - n the dog, cut his liver out and throw him overboard: he run me up against the shrowds; he took hold of my thigh and attempted to throw me over-board; the captain came up; I desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050034"></xptr> his assistance. Newlove got me down and jumped upon me with his knees, he never struck me with his hands; I got from him; they run me into the quarter deck; I fell down upon my knees; the captain cried, you dogs do you want to murder the man, and laid hold of the deceased. I took hold of a piece of wood and swore I would knock down the first man that came nigh me: he flung himself from the captain and run up to me; I struck him over the arm; the boat is very high, it is in a bed they have made on purpose for it; there are hand-spikes lying there; he took hold of a hand-spike and had got it above his head; I struck at him immediately, and he fell with his head against the place. Newlove immediately made a blow at me: I had not power to strike; the mate came up; I cried out murder; there were two or three boats same along-side us, I suppose to take the liquor away, When Newlove found he could not get them away, he went next morning and gave an information of the liquor, and they came down from the Custom-house next morning and took away twenty-two half anchors. When Newlove had got into the boat a going from the ship, he said to the captain, d - n you, you dog, I will do for you: Newlove came back again to me, and said he would give me four guineas to let him have his liquor away. I said if he would give me fifty I would not take it.</p>

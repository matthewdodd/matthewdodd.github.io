                  </hi>. I am a chandelier manufacturer, carrying on business with my brothers in Commercial Street, Whitechapel—the prisoner was in our employment—it was his duty to keep the bought ledger, to receive the invoices from the cutters, to examine those invoices with the book in; which the goods were entered when received, to see that they corresponded; he would then bring me the ledger and the cutters' invoices—I should then see that the entry in the ledger corresponded with the invoices; he would also present me the order for payment, and if it corresponded with the entry in the ledger I put my initials across it; the order would then be presented to the pretty cashier, who would pay it—on 31st August the prisoner brought me this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he also showed me this cutters' ledger—at the time the prisoner brought me the order it was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was written in words and in figures—the letters "teen" have since been added, and the figure "I" has been prefixed to the 7.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe you prosecuted the prisoner last session? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did, upon two indictments—the facts were not of the same nature as in this case, he was acquitted—I was examined as a witness—this order is in the prisoner's writing, and the ledger also—the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the column is his writing—I believe the invoice has been lost—it would be handed to the prisoner by the cutter in the course of business—it would be copied into the book—I cannot tell whether the order would be copied from the invoice or the book—it would be from one or the other—Powell has been working for us a good many years—after crossing the order I gave it back to the prisoner—there was a junior clerk named Norden in the office with the prisoner—we have not discharged any clerks lately—we have discharged one man named Lazarus for selling goods on his own account when he was under an agreement for a certain number of years—no evidence as to this case was given before the Magistrate—we employ a great number of hands, but only about ten principal cutters, and they employ others under them, who work only for us—in cash between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would pass through the prisoner's hands in a year—there are great numbers of crossed cheques and cheques payable to order—about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week would be paid out on orders of this kind—we have employed a professional accountant to go through our books—he has been nearly two years doing that—this book remains in the prisoner's office—it would not be accessible to all the clerks—we could never get access to it—he almost always had it locked in his desk—I have asked Norden, the junior clerk, for it, and it has been locked in the prisoner's desk—whenever I have asked the prisoner himself for it he has always shown it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glasscutter—I have been in the habit of doing work for Messrs.

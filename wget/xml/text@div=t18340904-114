               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where had you been all the rest of that afternoon? A. We took a walk down Mile-end-road - we did not go to a dance - I knew Swash's husband had left her, and she asked me to lend her a pair of shoes, a pair of stockings, and a bonnet - she had the shoes on when I met her.</p>

             (police-constable K 135). I went with the prosecutrix, and met the prisoners at Mile-end Turnpike - they said they had not seen the watch; but they afterwards said they saw her lay it on the mantel-shelf - I could not find the watch.</p>

            . On the 24th of August, about nine o'clock at night, I was crossing <placeName id="t18210912-7-crimeloc37">Cavendish-square</placeName>

I turned round to look for some person to get some, and the moment I turned she put one hand into my breast, and the other into my pocket, and took my money out, which was loose in my pocket. I had a draft for 33 l. 15 s. there. She turned the corner, and ran off; I followed, got hold of her hand, and she called murder; I kept her hand clenched till the watchman came, he opened her hand, and took 9 s. out. I found the draft remained in my pocket.</p>

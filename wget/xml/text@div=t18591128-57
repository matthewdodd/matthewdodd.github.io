                  </hi> I am a wine merchant, and live in Miles-lane—I have been there about twelve months—I have a banking account at the Bank of London, and another at the County Bank—at the end of October I purchased 700 dozen of beer of Mr. Perks—I have known the prisoner about three years—he carried on business in Great St. Helen's, and he became a bankrupt—there had been no connexion whatever between him and me in business—on 26th October he came to me relative to this beer—he said, "You are aware that I served my apprenticeship in that line of business: I know perfectly well how to store it; if you like I will attend to it"—I said, "I have no objection to give you a job for a few days"—he asked me what he was to have a day—I said, "I give the men 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—we parted on the understanding that he was to come and attend to it the next morning—Eldridge, my boy, was present at that time—next morning, Thursday, I came down about ten o'clock; I found the prisoner there—I left about seven o'clock in the evening, just before the last load came in—I left the prisoner there going on with the last lot—Eldridge was there—it was his duty to lock the cellar, and take the key with him, and come the next morning and open the cellar—I went the next morning, Friday, about eleven o'clock—I found the warehouse closed and the place all closed—I did not go to the prisoner's house immediately—I went to inquire of the men and my boy—I went to the house where my boy left the key—I found the key at a public-house—I went to see if anybody had been in my place—I found the cellar-flap had been broken—I went to Broad-street to where the prisoner lived—I went to his place about one o'clock—I knocked at the door—I did not see the prisoner—I saw some beer there—I could not say how many bottles—a large quantity, fifty dozen perhaps—I could tell that it was my beer—I took a cab and went to Mr. Perks—I went again to the prisoner's place—I did not see the prisoner—I saw a woman who said, "Mr. McKennall is gone to your place"—I went back and he was not there—I afterwards went with two officers, and found him and gave him in custody—I got his address on Friday before one o'clock, in a court in Broad-street; there is no pawnbroker's there.</p>

I did not, on my solemn oath—I asked where was Mr. McKennall—she said, "He is down at your place"—I did not say, "I want some more money from him"—she did not say, "In the present state of affairs, I am sure he will not advance you more money"—on my solemn oath she did not—I called again in an hour or two, and she said, "He is gone down to your place"—I did not see him till I gave him in custody—the woman did not say to me, "<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> will not advance you any more money while matters stand as they are;" decidedly not—I saw him at his own place with the policeman—I did not ask him then whether he would</p>

                  </hi> I was in the employ of Mr. Reinham a day and a half—Mr. McKennall came and fetched me—Mr. Reinham told me to go to work—I have not been paid yet—on that Thursday there were some planks being got to put the beer on—while they were being got I saw the prisoner and Mr. Reinham together by the steps—Mr. Reinham said to Mr. McKennall, "Well. <hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> old boy, how are you getting on?"—Mr. McKennall said, "Very well, only I shall want more planks"—Mr. Reinham said, "What do you want more planks for?"—he said, "To put the beer on"—Mr. Reinham said to him, "I am very sorry that I did not take your advice and have it all sent to your place; it would have saved a good deal of expense"—the prisoner said, "It won't look well as we can only get one more load to night to take it there"—Mr. Reinham said, "You had better lower that into the cellar and take it away in the morning"—the prisoner said he would take it away in the morning, and Mr. Reinham said, "Very well," and then he should not want me to fetch any more planks—it could not be stowed without planks—he said, "I can go on moving it from Aldersgate-street to<lb></lb>morrow morning"—Mr. Reinham said, "Very well"—the prisoner said he would take that load out of the cellar on Friday morning down to Broad-street—Mr. Reinham said, "Very well"—the prisoner said the men had heard something, and they did not feel satisfied; they would want their money that night, and he said to Mr. Reinham, "And how about that that you owe me?"—Mr. Reinham said, "You can take that out of what you get for the beer"—when I was told I need not get any more planks I was in the cellar, and they were on the stairs—I had been employed by the prisoner some time back on a job or two—I pawned some gold chains of the prisoner's to get the money to buy the planks—I did not see the prosecutor present when I saw the chains—I was at the Mansion-house for the purpose of giving evidence.</p>

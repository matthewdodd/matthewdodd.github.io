               <p>I was robbed the 18th of November, 1789, at the end of Widegate-street, about eleven at night, of a watch and six shillings and six-pence; these three women robbed me, now under sentence; I got my watch again the same evening, in a house in Dillon's-court, or Gun-court, in the possession of the prisoner; he owned the room where it was found; these three women were at his room when I went; but I do not know who delivered the watch up; I said nothing to him; I do not think I ever saw him before; the women were women not ragged, but very coarse and homely; their dresses was tight, but that was all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stoker employed at the London Gas Factory, It Vauxhall. I had been for some time, previously to Saturday, 19th Sept., living with Welch and his wife as a lodger, at No. 4, Newmarket Buildings, Vauxhall—on the night of Sept 19th, I went with the prisoner to Brixton to see his daughter—I returned with him about half past 9 o'clock—we had left the house to go there about a quarter to 6 o'clock in the evening—the wife was then at home—nothing took place at that time between the hus<lb></lb>band and the wife—when we returned home at half past 9 o'clock, she was not there—the prisoner went into the factory, I went to bed; that was at half past 9 o'clock—the factory is not above twenty yards from where he lived, right opposite—I saw him again at the house, about half past 12 o'clock—I got up because I heard them quarrelling—I cannot tell when she came home—I did not go to sleep at once—I suppose it was somewhere about an hour before the came home—I can say that she did not come home for an hour after half past 9 o'clock—when I heard them quarrelling I got up and dressed, and went into their room—I heard the husband ask the wife where she had been to, and she told him that she went in search of him and the little boy—he said she knew very well where he was gone to—he told me he had found her outside a beer shop, in Vauxhall Walk; he had just come home—she appeared to be a little gone in liquor—he appeared to me per<lb></lb>fectly sober—I heard her keep on telling her husband that she had been in search of him, and he said she had not, she was out drinking with other people—she said she was not—at the time this altercation took place, she was sitting on a chair close against the door going into the bedroom—he</p>

               <p>was sitting on the opposite side close to the window—there was a table be<lb></lb>tween them—he then got up and struck her a blow, which caused her to fall—it was a round handed blow with his open hand—she fell against the door post—I do not recollect what was said by either of them immediately before that blow was struck—he had attempted to strike her once before, and I interfered and stopped him—that was five or ten minutes before he got up and went towards her—I interfered and prevented him, and he sat down again—when she fell against the door post, I went to pick her up—she appeared to be helpless—she was sensible, but it appeared to me that she could not stand—I do not think she could have got up without assist<lb></lb>ance—I put her on the chair—I noticed a slight bruise on the side of the cheek, by the eye—I cannot say which part of her head struck the door—her head did strike it—her husband ordered her to bed, and she went into the bed room—she could walk then—that was about ten minutes after I put her on the chair—the prisoner was sitting on a chair during that time—he was not doing anything—I went outside for about three minutes, and when I came in again I opened the room door where he was standing, went into my bedroom, and went to bed—I did not hear any noise from her when he struck her—she only hallooed, "Oh, Harry!"—I heard nothing of them in the night—I saw the prisoner next morning, about 20 minutes past 5 o'clock—he came out of his bedroom and called me—he generally gives me a call in the morning to go to work—this was Sunday morning—I work on Sunday—that was the usual time he called me—I asked him how his wife was—he said she was in the room asleep—I asked him if she was ill—he said, "No"—I looked into the room, and saw her lying down—there did not appear to be anything the matter with her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Bryan Jessie Hudson, a hatter. I live in High Street, Vauxhall, next door to Welch, the prisoner. On 20th Sept., about half past 10 o'clock in the morning, I was sent for by Welch—I went in, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Welch—she was in bed, and he was applying leeches to her temples—she appeared insensible—her face was much swollen on the left side, and discoloured—she was rather restless, and moved herself about, but I do not think she was conscious—I did not remain—I left imme<lb></lb>diately, without saying anything—at my husband's desire, I went in again in the evening, in consequence of what I heard—she was still in bed, and he was sitting down by her side—I then applied a blister to the back of her neck—he requested me to do so—she was still insensible, but rather restless—the prisoner said, "Mrs. Hudson, this is a bad job; she went out drink<lb></lb>ing, and I was very much exasperated, and when she returned home, I gave her an open handed blow, and she fell; and that was the cause of this"—I</p>

               <p>saw her again on the Monday—he was still attending on her—he was most attentive—she rallied a little on the 27th, and sat up in bed, and opened one of her eyes—she was attended by Mr. Thompson—she said to me, in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence, "Mrs. Hudson, you are here"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "I feel very curious; I feel <hi rend="italic">beery</hi>; I have been sadly used, but by whom I do not know"—the prisoner was standing at the right side of her, and he replied, "By me, my dear"—nothing more was said then—she relapsed into a sort of stupor—on 26th she was well enough to get up and dress herself; and she ate four eggs, a quarter of a pound of bacon, and drank seven cups of tea—she relapsed again on Monday, and died on 2nd Oct., at 12 o'clock at night—I saw her on 24th and 25th Sept.—on the 25th she was in a saner state of mind than she was on the 24th—she said to her husband, "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, come here and lie down by my bedside; what money did I bring you home on Satur<lb></lb>day night?"—he replied, "12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some odd halfpence"—she said, "My God! if you will say that, you will drive me mad"—he said, "Can you recollect where you went to on Saturday evening?"—she said "Yes; I went round the Potteries to look for the boy; I went round to the Distiller's Arms, and drank out of two or three pots of beer; and from there I went down Lambeth Walk, and called at the shoemaker's, and went over to the Feathers, and we had two half pints of gin; one I paid for, and the other was paid for; there were five in company; I returned from there up to the Jolly Gardeners, and had a small portion of rum; I returned from there to the John Bull, and insulted a man of the name of Hasley; I had a small portion of rum there; I then went again to the Distiller's Arms, and had a small drop of beer, and at ten minutes to 12 o'clock I looked in at Ward's to see if my husband was there; I then went home to get a saucer to get something in, and in Vauxhall Walk I had a glass of ale, and that is where Welch found me"—he said the cause of his beating her was, that he was so exasperated at her leaving the children crying so many hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 4, Model Buildings, Vauxhall, in the same house and on the same floor as the prisoner and his wife; our doors are just facing one another. On Sunday night, 20th Sept., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I heard Mrs. Welch screaming, and saying, "You will kill me"—I jumped out of bed, and went to the door in my night dress—I saw Welch just within his own door, making, as I thought, towards the landing—I returned into my own apartment, locked the door, and went to bed—I heard no more—I did not see Mrs. Welch—I heard no screams after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Vauxhall Walk. On Sunday morning, 20th Sept., I was called by the prisoner about 9 o'clock—I went with him to his lodgings, and found his wife lying in bed in a state of partial insensibility—I aroused her a little—she complained of pain in her</p>

               <p>head—I examined it, and discovered a contusion over the left eye, and one on the eye to some considerable extent, over the orbit, near the eyebrow—it was a black eye—there was also a superficial bruise on the left ear—there was no abrasion of the skin, or wound of any sort—she was not perfectly insensible—she could answer, but very incoherently—I consider the wounds I saw to be the result of violence; but in what way produced, of course, I could not say—I should say one blow would be sufficient to produce what I saw—a blow with the open hand, given to a person in a state of intoxication, and a fall of considerable force against a hard body, would be sufficient to account for it—I attended her continually, and had hopes of her ultimate recovery, but she subsequently relapsed, and died delirious; I may almost say maniacal—I opened the head after death—on removing the skull. I found a quantity of extravasated blood which had escaped from a ruptured vessel beneath the left lobe of the brain—that blood had coagulated and caused the pressure, paralysis, and death—in my judgment, that was caused by violence—the clot of blood under the brain was just above the orifice of the eye—I think such a blow and fall as she is described to have received. would be sufficient to produce death—I found the liver considerably harder than natural, and its structure was diseased—I should say that the deceased was evidently a woman of intemperate habits.</p>

On Sunday, the 28th of June, the prisoners came to our house, separately, and staid there an hour and a half, or two hours; I saw them come in and have dinner, and I believe they joined company, but I did not wait on them myself; I saw them again on each of the four following days, at the same place - they had refreshment together, and drank together, I believe. On the 1st of July Thomas requested me to give him four sovereigns for 4l.'s worth of silver, which I did - I went to the bed-room to get the sovereigns; I keep my money there; they sat in the club-room, close adjoining the bed-room, not and arm's length from the door. On Thursday, the 2nd, six or seven more persons came in and joined them, and while the prisoners were in the club-room the drays came with beer - it was between one and two o'clock, to the best of my knowledge; my husband and the barman had to go into the cellar to attend to the beer - I had to wait on the people myself, and my daughter was in the bar; I went into the bed-room twice that day, while they were in the clubroom; I went to take some money out to pay my servant's wages, which were appointed to be paid that day-the servant was down in the cellar with my husband; I found my box safe, and locked it, after taking out the money; I took the key, locked the room door, and carried the keys down stairs to the bar, where I keep them - in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the prisoners came down stairs to the bar, which is on the ground floor, in a hurried state, and requested two small glasses of brandy, which they drank very quick, and went out without paying for it - I called them back, and told them they had not paid for it; they begged pardon, and said they had forgot it - Thomas came back, and paid me 6d.; I went up stairs immediately to fetch down the glasses and things from the club-room; there was not any body there then; I went into my bed-room in about a quarter of an hour -I took the key off the chimney-piece, and when I tried to unlock the door the key would not enter the lock; I came down to the bar to look for another key, supposing I might have the wrong one - I went up again with the same key, which I found was the proper one; I could not open the door with it - I knelt down, looked, and saw something was in the key-hole; I tried again: I took the handle of the door, and found it was open - it was not locked; a skeleton-key fell out of the key-hole on to the floor: I saw my strong chest was burst open, and all the money was gone, all the bills and papers, and our licence - the cash-box was burst open also, and a crow-bar laid on the floor with it; I had counted my money that morning, and I had 97l. in gold, 40l. in silver, a cheque for 6l., and a 5l. Bank note, and several receipts and bills. I believe the prisoners had come there that morning between twelve and one o'clock - that is the usual time they came, and they went away, to the best of my knowledge, between three and four; it was before four - they came down occasionally during that time, and stood smoking at the door, looking at the drays; I spoke to them at the door - Thomas admired the situation of the house. At the time I took the money out to pay the servant only the two prisoners were in the club-room, and nobody went up stairs after that before I missed the money - I am positive of that; there is no other room up stairs for company besides the club-room - they are all bed-rooms; I have not seen any of my money or papers since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it nearer to there or four o'clock when the prisoners went away? A. I believe it was between three and four o'clock, and think it was nearer four than three; I think I paid my servant about three o'clock - I think there had been seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100004"></xptr>more persons in the club-room that day, but they were all gone; I had some knowledge of one of them, but the other six were strangers; when the prisoners left they came down stairs together - I am sure I saw them come down together - I cannot be mistaken; the other persons went away two or three at a time; we have not many customers - it is a new house: I was astonished at so many being there that day - I did not particularly notice what time the others left. While the beer was being brought in I was the only person who attended to the customers; my young man served them before - we have a tap-room opposite the bar; there might be five or six persons there during that day - I will not say there were not ten or twelve; I did not take an account of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the tap-room below stairs or above? A. Below, even with the bar; I am positive that when I went up to get the money only the prisoners were in the room.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's danghter. I saw the prisoners at my father's house in June and July; I saw them there on the 2nd of July, between the hours of one and four - I think they went away between three and four o'clock; I saw them drink the brandy - nobody went up stairs after they went out before my mother went up - she came down stairs before she missed the money; I was in the bar - nobody went up stairs then, or I must have seen them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a water-closet on the same floor as the bed-room? A. No, not exactly on the bed-room floor; it is nine or ten stairs below that, on the landing - there are nine or ten more stairs down to the ground floor; it is rather a small water-closet; I am not certain, but I consider it was not four o'clock when they left - there might have been seven, or perhaps eight persons in the club-room, not more; I saw them every one go out - there might have been three or four persons in the tap-room; I do not suppose there were more, but am not positive there might not have been twelve; the last person came down from the club-room a little before four o'clock, I think, but am not positive it was the prisoners - they were the last persons, and they left together; the last person besides them had left about half an hour previous, quite as long as that, I think - my mother was up stairs when that person came down; she came down before the prisoners: we have been in the house three years, but it was only licensed last Michaelmas twelvemonth: there were three or four persons in the taproom at four o'clock - I cannot say whether any of them were there when the loss was discovered; that was after four o'clock - I dare say it was half an hour after.</p>

            . I am servant and barman to Mr. Budden. I first saw the prisoners at my master's house on Sunday, the 28th of June; I saw them on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday - I waited on them on all those five days: they came on Thursday between twelve and one o'clock, as near as I can teil - I went into the cellar with master to receive the beer, and left Mrs. and Miss Budden to wait on them; I did not see any more of them that day: I heard of the robbery soon after I came out of the cellar - I went up to the room to bring down some pots and glasses; there was nobody there then - I went next day to Fairlop Fair, with Buckeridge, the officer, in search of the prisoners - we went into different booths, and saw

             walking along one of the booths, and as I came near him I thought he changed colour; he passed me, and changed countenance directly he saw me - I think he must have known me; I turned back, and asked how he did - he said very well: I asked if he knew me - he said very well; I asked if he had been at Mr. Budden's, at Paddington, Lisson-grove, yesterday; he said Yes - I then gave him into Buckeridge's custody, telling him he was one of the men, and to keep him while I went round the booth to look for the other prisoner - I went along the booth, and saw John smoking his pipe in the booth, with some tea things before him; I went and told the officer, who went down and took him - they both requested to be treated like men, and they would act so to us; in a few minutes Thomas called to a woman, whom he called his wife, and whispered to her for a length of time; I do not know what he said - she went off and spoke to some persons in the booth, not far from them; the men came forward - I cannot say how many there were; directly Thomas saw them come forward, he rushed through them, and said he would go and search for his umbrella - the men made way for him to go through; I followed him, calling Stop thief! they closed round me, and would not let me pass for a long time, till he had time to get a long way; I went after him at last, and got knocked down at different times by some persons unknown to me: I overtook and caught hold of him three or four times, but he got from me again - I followed him, calling Stop thief! a Bow-street patrol was passing, and took him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was that officer examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes; I do not know his name - I do not know the prisoner's brother William; I cannot say whether a person has occasionally been there, who is very like them; we are in the habit of seeing so many faces, but I have seen the prisoners so often I know them - I was not exceedingly busy that day; I had to attend the bar - I attended in the club-room between twelve and one o'clock; the man who took Thomas had a red waistcoat on - I saw him have hold of him; I suppose I was within ten or twelve yards of him - I got knocked down and beat about.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How often had you seen them before? A.

               <p>Q. Did you hear the Magistrate say, if the attorney did not call the witnesses he would? A. I heard something of that; I did not hear him say he could not go on with the examination for the prosecution till after the prisoner's witnesses were examined; I believe five witnesses were examined before me - I heard three witnesses called in and examined on the prisoners' behalf: I believe James Smith, Lewis, and another were examined - that was after me; they were examined a good deal and sworn.</p>

             out to me; I went and took him, told him he was charged with felony, and he must consider himself my prisoner - he asked what for: I told him for a robbery in Lisson-grove, and if he would step with me I would explain it more to him; he asked if I would allow him to go into the booth to pay his score; I said certainly I had no objection for him to go - he said he hoped I should not expose him; I said I should do nothing more than keep him safe; I went into the booth with him, and his brother John was sitting at a table there - he said to him, "I am going to town with this person;" Cockrane immediately said, "That is the other, take him as well;" I told him I should take him too - they paid their score, and then John got up; I got up, and moved to the same side as they were on - Thomas got up; I said, "Where are you going - I shall not permit you to go away from me;" he said he was going to his wife for his umbrella; we were immediately hustled, and he ran down to the bottom of the booth, pursued by Cockrane - I immediately closed on John, secured him, and handcuffed him immediately; I then proceeded down the booth towards Cockrane - John wanted to go out at the top of the booth; I said I should not permit that; I was still hustled by a parcel of persons - I told them I did not mean to leave him, and they might as well be quiet: at the bottom of the booth I saw Thomas taken by a Bow-street patrol; he closed in with him - the men turned round upon him, and prevented his striking him; Cockrane complained of having been ill-treated, but I did not see that done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the patrol who took Thomas here? A. No - he was at the office; the Magistrate did not deem his evidence necessary; I believe he was sworn and examined at the office, but cannot positively say - I have no doubt of it; if he was examined he was sworn; I believe I did administer the oath to him myself - I have no doubt of it, I think not; I know he was examined - three or four witnesses were examined for the prisoners; it was to prove an alibi for John.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not witnesses examined for the prosecution after those for the prisoners - for instance, King and Wakefield? A. Certainly, if they were examined at a subsequent examination; I think it was on the second examination.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many examinations were there before the Magistrate? A. I think three; the prisoners' witnesses, to the best of my belief, were examined some on the first or second examination; at the second or third examination I was desired to get more evidence, and Mrs. King came forward.</p>
               <p>Thomas Walker's Defence. You now behold before you an unfortunate individual, to be tried for an offence of which he is totally innocent; I acknowledge I was in the prosecutor's house on the afternoon in question, but solemnly declare I left the house five minutes after two o'clock. When I was apprehended Buckeridge and Cockrane came up to me, and directly I saw Cockrane I asked how he did - he answered very well, and asked if I remembered him; I said I could not be off remembering him, as he waited on me only the day before. Now I was in no place of secrecy when apprehended; Is it likely if I was concerned in so extensive a robbery I should have been in such a public place as a dancing booth? if I am found guilty of this offence, which I am innocent of, it will be the death of an aged parent and my wife, and bring me and my brother to an ignominous death.</p>
               <p>John Walker's Defence. I am innocent of this charge - I know nothing of it.</p>

            . Q. Was John in the habit of going out with his coach at half-past eight o'clock? A. No, he is in the habit of driving a night-coach - he went out this morning on account of keeping some horses at home that day for the fair; he does not usually drive a day coach - he brought me home the 10s. a little after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>MRS. BUDDEN re-examined.

               <p>Q. You put the key in the door, and it would not turn- did you try the handle at that time? A. No - I found it would not open, and knowing I had not unlocked it, I went down to see if I had the wrong key; the skeleton-key fell inside the room door - when I got the money for the servant the club-room door was open; the prisoners could see me lock the bed-room door - I am positive I locked it after me; there were thirty half-sovereigns among my money - I examined it all that day; I have no doubt of the prisoner John; it was not a stouter or shorter person - he is the man, I am certain; I have not the smallest doubt of it; I served him at the bar with brandy - I am satisfied I saw Thomas on the 2nd of July, and spoke to him at the bar before he went away - he said it was a beautiful situation, and he should have no objection to take a house himself in that situation.</p>

             re-examined. The bed-room door opens inward - the key will open and unlock the door; I have tried it - it will open it outside, and might be used to lock it inside again; I searched the prisoners - I found on Thomas five half-sovereigns, about 6s. or 7s. in silver, a watch, and some keys; they asked for the silver, and I gave it to them - I took the prisoners at half past six o'clock.</p>

            . Q. Are you quite certain of the identify of the prisoner John? A. Yes, I am confident I saw him there on the Thursday; it was not a stouter man - he is the man, I am confident; I waited on him every day for five days, and waited on him early on Thursday - I am confident of both of them.</p>

             was there? A. Yes - I have never seen William to my knowledge; I am sure it was John - it was not a shorter or stouter man; I had known them from the Sunday; I have not a doubt of John's face - I went up stairs three or four times on Thursday, and saw them sitting close to the club-room door.</p>

             re-examined. I am sure I saw Thomas on the 2nd of July - my reason for knowing the time and day so particularly is, on Saturday I went to Union-hall, which I generally do, and heard of their being apprehended at Fairlop Fair; I said, "If I had known Thomas was wanted, I could have taken him in my shop on the Thursday afternoon, between three and four o'clock"- I first became acquainted with him at Union-hall, in February, but I do not suppose I spoke twenty words to him from then till he came into my shop - I have met him four or five different times, and have met his brother several times since this occurrence.</p>
               <p>Q. What enabled you to speak to seeing him between three and four o'clock? A. I stopped at Union-hall till about three o'clock, when the prisoners leave there, then went straight home, and in about twenty minutes Walker passed; I said, "How do you do?" he came in, and a man named Seeley in my shop recognized him as having been to school with him; my shop is nearly opposite the Obelisk.</p>
               <p>One witness gave each of the prisoners a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You gave in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060052"></xptr>formation as fast as you could? A. Yes; I saw Mr. Hendry run out instantly, and pursued the persons; they were just in view before me - there were only two; I am quite sure there were not three; they were in Chapman-street, and they ran round Ann-street - there was nobody else in the street; Hendry ran after the two men, and I saw them running plainly before him, with the fire-irons in their hands - I am sure they had each of them a pair in their hands; it was broad day-light as it is now - any one could see the fire-irons in their hands; Hendry could not be off seeing them - Lazarus was in the shop afterwards, but I did not see him brought in.</p>

             what he had in his hand - he said a set of fire-irons belonging to his mother, who had sent him to sell them; I observed the other two run away when I went into the shop - I took Warner to the station-house, and then he told the inspector, who questioned him, that he had found them that morning in Whitechapel, at a quarter-past seven o'clock.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On that Wednesday morning I saw Bocken, Lazarus, and Townsend together; I went up to take Bocken's part, as I thought they were going to fight him - a person came up, and pointing to Townsend said, "That is the thief, collar him;" he turned his back to me and ran away - I followed, but lost sight of him; when I afterwards saw him at the lock-up house, he called me, and said, "Butcher, don't say any more than you can help to hurt me;" I said I should say nothing but the truth.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoemaker, and live at No. 10, Thornton-street, St. George's; Higley has been in my employ two years last November, as a journeyman; on Wednesday, the 22nd of December, he had been at work from seven o'clock in the morning - I sent him to a person named Jones for a pair of lasts; he was gone about three quarters of an hour - he then returned to his work, and worked all day; he had an honest character, and attended very regularly - I have known him to work for eighteen hours a day; he went out the same evening, to get some beef-steaks for supper.</p>

I remember the prisoner, James Alder, coming to me on the Friday night; he asked me if I had seen old Mrs. Wilson, for he wanted to see Sarah Wilson, the prisoner; it was a week after the robbery, all but one day. I asked him how his sister got on; he said, if there was no more property found on her than the seal, she would he turned up. On the Monday following he came to me and said,"Bush, I have seen Sal. Wilson, and she says there is a watch and a broach buried in your cellar, and Mrs. Brothers will not let me in." I said, "I am going down presently for some water, you shall go with me, and have a light." He went down, I went with him, and took a small shovel with me, from my own fireside - He dug in three different places, but found nothing. I do not think he ever went there again.</p>

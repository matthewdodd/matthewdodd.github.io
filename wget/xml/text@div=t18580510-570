The prisoner came to lodge with us in May, and left on 2d Nov.—on 21st Oct., after we had paid our rent to Mr. Richards, our landlord, he asked us if we could pay three sovereigns in ad<lb></lb>vance; my husband said "Yes," and gave him the money the same evening—onthe following morning, after my husband had gone to business, the pri<lb></lb>soner came down, and said, "Mrs. Dale, what a foolish woman you are to lend money without interest, when a friend of mine, the publisher of the 'Illustrated Inventor,' would give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the loan of three sovereigns for ten days"—on the following day, he said, "I am going to see my friend;"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100075"></xptr>
               <p>and on the following day, he said, "Mrs. Dale, I have seen my friend, Mr. Simpson, the publisher of the 'Illustrated Inventor;' he cannot afford to give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the loan of three sovereigns, as two days have gone by, but he will give you 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, as he has an invalid father to keep"—he went away at half past 9 o'clock on the 22nd, saying that he was going to tell Mr. Simpson that I would let him have the money—on the 23d, about half past 9 o'clock, he received the three sovereigns from me, and gave me an I O U—he told me that he had seen Mr. Simpson the day before—he said that Mr. Simpson would give me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 31st Oct., and had sent me the I O U—on the 22nd, he told me that if I would give him an I O U, Mr. Simpson would ad<lb></lb>vance me an I O U as security—I have never been paid my 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the pri<lb></lb>soner was going to leave, and on 2d Nov., he came down and said, "Mrs. Dale, I am not in circumstances to leave you for ten days longer;" I said, "Very well, how about my three sovereigns on the I O U;" he said, "I have not got the money, but I will pay you before I leave;" I said, "Very well" I went out for a walk with my husband, and when I came home he had re<lb></lb>moved his things.</p>

               <p>Court. What did he say? - He shewed me the bill and said it was drawn on the Ordnance Office, he said he would come the next morning and take the note up; he did not come any more, and I never saw him till I saw him before my Lord Mayor, at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>How long after was that? - I had the note till the Monday week following, and I presented it at Mr. Cox's Office, in Craig's Court; I presented it on the 8th of December.</p>

               <p>Did he say what he was? - No, I looked upon him to be an officer, he had a cockade, he said he was just come from Scotland.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was this? - The twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth of December, I am not sure which.</p>

               <p>I was at that time pay-master to the artillery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Macnally. When you was before Alderman Crosby, at Guildhall, and was asked where that note was, what was your answer? - I was at Guildhall once or twice with the note, and once or twice without it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that you said that note was either in the possession of the Alderman or the Alderman's clerk? - I cannot say, but it never was left at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Then do you remember saying, if it is not, perhaps it may be in the possession of my cashier? - Having been before the Lord Mayor on the same business, I did not recollect whether I had left the note at Guildhall or with Mr. Pinder, but certain I was, if not at the office at Guildhall, it was with Mr. Pinder.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that note. - This is the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Is it drawn in the usual form that the master of the ordnance draws bills on the pay office? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>How are bills generally drawn by the master of the ordnance? - The master of the ordnance seldom draws a bill, but I apprehend if he had occasion to draw a bill, he would address it to the Right Hon. the principal officers of his Majesty's Ordnance.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know my Lord Townsend's hand writing? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How is Lord Townsend appointed to this office? - He was master general of the ordnance at that time.</p>
               <p>Is not it a patent office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was he appointed by patent? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, I beg to observe before this witness goes on with his evidence, that the indictment has stated throughout, in every count, that My Lord Townsend is Master General of the Ordnance, therefore it is necessary for them to prove that fact, and also that there was such an office as the Pay-Office in the Ordnance-office, Whitehall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. Suppose there was no such office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. It says, purporting to be drawn by Lord Townsend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath, It all comes after purporting, it is no averment that it is so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Mr. Cox. Is there any such office as the Pay-office in the Ordnance-office, Whitehall? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. If it was intended to make him believe there was such an office.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140085"></xptr>Mr. Sylvester. My objection is that there is no such person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. Will you pretend to say, because a man forges a note on an officer, and he either wilfully or accidentally mistakes the name of the office, that that is not a forgery; how should it be drawn? here is no averment that he is the Master of the Ordnance; or suppose this note bore date the day after Lord Townsend had been dismissed from his office, and he had given it to an ignorant person, and said, this is a note drawn on the Ordnance Office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, the note itself does not import that Lord Townsend is Master General of the ordnance at all.</p>
               <p>Court. The jury must take upon themselves to determine what M. G. means.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. If they take upon themselves to prove that.</p>
               <p>Court. They are to prove that it was intended to mean that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. They say directed to the Pay-Office in the Ordnance-office at Whitehall, that is averring that there is such an office: why should they add the word in, in the office; the note says, Pay-office Ordnance-office Whitehall, the indictment says, the Pay-office in the Ordnance-office Whitehall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. Whatever comes after purporting is no averment that in fact exists, but pretends to exist. If the jury are of opinion that that does not purport to be paid at the Pay-office Whitehall, that is another thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, a man was indicted and tried before Lord Mansfield for forging a note, purporting to be a bank note, he uttered it as such, and he told the man to whom it was offered, that it was a very good note, he told the man it was a bank note; the man knew no difference: instead of the words the Bank of England, it was my Bank of England, and Lord Mansfield said the words purporting to be a bank note meant, that the note appeared upon the face of it to be a bank note, and the want of such appearance cannot be supplied; now here is a place called in the indictment the Pay-office in the ordnance-office Whitehall, and after this it appears that there is no such place.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a matter of evidence to be left to the jury; you see on presenting the bill the prisoner said it was drawn on the Ordnance-office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. This is not governed by the case you have just quoted of purporting to be a bank note, because that is governed by a precise form.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I understand Mr. Cox to say that there is a precise form to these bills.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. That is only in his opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Mr. Cox. Would you have paid this as an ordnance draft? - It is not drawn upon me.</p>
               <p>Is there such an office as the Pay-office in the Ordnance-office Whitehall? - There used to be I believe, before the new building at Whitehall was erected, formerly.</p>
               <p>Not in your memory and mine I am sure? - I cannot exactly say, but there is such an office in the Tower.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. There is no such place as the Ordnance-office at Whitehall, not ever was.</p>
               <p>Court to Cox. Are you sure there used to be one? - No, I will not say that.</p>
               <p>Do you know that Lord Townsend was then Master of the Ordnance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with his handwriting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him write? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Is that Lord Townsend's hand-writing? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Are you clear and certain of that? - Perfectly certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Have you frequently seen him write? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Court. You say at present there is no office at Whitehall, that you know of, for the payment of ordnance bills? - No.</p>
               <p>But they are paid in the Tower? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What, is Lord Townshend an officer? - Yes, he is Colonel of the Queen's regiment of dragoon guards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140086"></xptr>You are sure he is not Master General? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Is there any such person as Mr. Lee in the Ordnance-office? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Does my Lord Townsend draw upon the Pay-office, would he give me a draft or order, or warrant, to pay to my account? No, you would have an imprest.</p>
               <p>Then I should not have a draft to pay me any money on my own account? a draft therefore, even from Lord Townshend, would not be paid, to be placed to my account? - It is a thing that never happens; the bill says, and place it to his account of office, now John Lee has no business in the office of ordnance at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Macnally. Are there not many contractors belonging to the Ordnance-office? - There may.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to say that there is no

               <p>Have you seen him write? - I have.</p>
               <p>Look at that? - I do not think it Lord Townsend's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, it is my duty standing here as a council for a prisoner to take every objection that lays in my power, for a man standing in his unfortunate situation, therefore I shall make no apology for troubling your lordship with a further objection. By an act of parliament passed in the twenty-third year of his present Majesty's reign; it is enacted, that every piece of paper or parchment, called a note of hand, or sheet or piece of paper, called a bill of exchange, which shall be ingrossed, written, or printed for any sum under the sum of fifty pounds shall have a stamp duty of sixpence thereon; then the act goes on and says, that if any such note of hand, or bill of exchange shall not be marked or stamped with such stamp duty of sixpence thereon, the same shall not be pleaded on given in evidence in any Court. In a case, the King agaisnt Hawkins, which was reserved by Mr. Justice Buller, a person was indicted for forging a bill of exchange, which was not stamped according to the late act. The objection was taken by Mr. Baldwin at Worcester.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. It says, it shall not be given in evidence between the parties, it does not mean in a criminal prosecution; the meaning of the act of Parliament is, that the man who neglects to pay the duties shall derive no benefit from it, but it does not extend to criminal suits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester to Mr. Cox. Would you pay a draft unstamped that was drawn on sight? - Certainly I would if it was drawn on me.</p>
               <p>Do you know that all notes except those on Bankers are to pay certain duty? - No, Sir, I do not understand so, because we pay twenty every day that are drawn at sight, without stamps; what I understand by a Banker, is a person acting as a Banker, and if a man keeps can with me, I act as his Banker.</p>
               <p>If that bill had been presented to you would you have paid it? - No, I certainly would not, because it was not my Lord Townsend's hand writing, and in the next place it was not adressed to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know any body upon the face of God's earth that would have paid it? - Here is a person that advanced money upon it.</p>
               <p>Now, is that an answer Mr. Cox?</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you say any thing Sir, for yourself, or do you leave your defence to your Council?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I leave it to my Council, who are sufficiently able to defend my cause.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Sylvester. Have you any witnesses to call? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen: In this case upon one of these objections taken by council it must be left to you, whether, upon the face of this bill it does not purport to be directed to the Pay-office, and to be signed by Lord Townsend, as Master General of the Ordnance, if you think one or the other it not purported, then it would be a ground for an acquittal: If you think it does so purport, then the evidence goes to that part of the indictment. The uttering of this bill is proved by Cresdale, who relates the circumstance of the prisoner's coming to him, and it appears to be a forged bill; it is very difficult indeed to prove the very act of forgery; these matters are your consideration, first, whether you sufficiently give credit to the witnesses, and in the next place, whether you think it purports to be drawn by Lord Townsend, Master General of the Ordnance, and to be paid at the Pay-office, in the Ordnance-office: If you do not believe the evidence, or do not think it so purports, then there will be a ground for acquittal; If you believe the witnesses, and think it does so purport, in that case you will find the prisoner guilty.</p>

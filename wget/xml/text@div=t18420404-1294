                  </hi>. I live in Paradise-place, Westminster. On Tuesday, the 8th of March, I had two tame rabbits in separate hutches in my back-yard—one was black and white, and the other grey and white—I had had one about twenty months, and the other about ten months—I have seen one since in possession of a man in Hungerford-market.</p>

I live in Lewisham-street, Westminster, and am in the employ of Mr. Reeve, a live stock dealer—he has a place in Hun<lb></lb>gerford-market—on Tuesday, the 8th of March, I saw the prisoner there with another boy a little bigger than himself—the other boy had a basket with two rabbits in it—the other said he was offered 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the next place, but he would not take it—the prisoner asked me whether master would buy them, whether he wanted rabbits—I said I would go and see—I brought my master up—the prisoner asked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—master said he would give 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they went away, came back again, and took 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—master bought them—I kept them in the hutch till next morning, and then sold the grey and white doe for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the other one died, and I have got the skin I kept it till the prosecutor came, and said it was his—it was alive then. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>Sunday morning—it was quite well then—the Magistrate said the Police<lb></lb>man was to mind it, and not me—my master keeps all sorts of live animals—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of the persons who came with these rabbits—I had seen him once before walking in Westminster with another one—a long time before—I had seen the other boy several times in Hungerford-market—my master is not here—he cannot swear to the boy—he had as good an opportunity of seeing him as I had.</p>

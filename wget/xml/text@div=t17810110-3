               <p>I saw the prisoner going out of Daniel's shop, with a bag of green tea in his hand of 26 lb. weight, it was a little before seven in the evening of the 4th of this month.</p>
               <p>Where is the shop? - No. 3, Southampton-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Is it an open shop? - It is. He opened the door and came in.</p>
               <p>Was the door shut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come in? - No, but I saw the door shut not a minute before I saw him go out.</p>
               <p>Might any other person have opened the door and come in in the interval of time; it is a shop I suppose where people are continually going in and coming out? - It is.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot take upon you to be sure he opened the door; it might be opened by other persons? - It was shut not above a minute before.</p>
               <p>The tea was Mr. Daniel's property and it was Mr. Daniel's dwelling-house, was it? - Yes.</p>

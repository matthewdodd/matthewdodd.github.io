               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Had you known any thing of her before? A. No; we had not a character with her; she said she was in distress, and we took her out of charity - she said that afternoon that she should not stay.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOLTON (Police-constable H 87). On the night of the 13th of September I was on duty in Wentworth-street, about eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner, who had a plaid clock on, speaking to another person; I went up to her, and asked what she had - she said I was very curious, she had got her own property; she then said she had got a pair of trousers, if I must know, which she had taken out of pawn, and she was going to send them to a young man in Yorkshire - I found these overalls on her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

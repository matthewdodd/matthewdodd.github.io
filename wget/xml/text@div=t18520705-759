                  </hi>. I am a tallow melter, at Surrey-place, Old Kent-road. I have a factory in New-row, Rotherhithe, about fourteen feet from the Greenwich railway arch—Mr. Salmon has a store under one of the arches—the store these skins were taken from, is thirty or forty yards from my factory—on 3rd June, I was at my factory—in the course of the evening I saw the prisoner come through the arch with a van load of skins from Mr. Salmon's, through my place—there was no one with him—he turned towards the Jolly Gardeners, which was the proper road to go out—he suddenly stopped and turned round, and looked up the road—he saw an officer standing there, and I thought that was the cause; he turned back, and went up the green lane—the van was loaded with seal skins—I went to Mr. Salmon and asked if he had sent for any.</p>

I was at the store on the night of 3rd June; I received information from the last witness—I followed the van right from my place to Whitechapel church—the person who was driving it saw me—I was running alongside it in St. Helena Gardens, and when he saw me he hit the horse with the whip, and drove it in full gallop—I kept sight of him till I came to Mill Pond-bridge—he there turned toward London, and I told the policeman—I saw some of the skins fall from the van—they were seal skins.</p>

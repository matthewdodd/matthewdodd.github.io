                  </hi>. I am butler to Mrs. Wheeler, of Hyde-paik-gardens. On 3rd May some coals were brought to our house—my mistress opened the window, and asked Trueman, the carman, if he had three tons of coals, he said, "Yes"—she asked if he had thirty sacks, he said, "Yes"—my mistress and I watched them, and on shooting two or three sacks, an empty sack turned up—it was taken out by Trueman, and put on the others—in the course of shooting a few more, four more empty sacks turned up, and were put on the others—twenty-five full sacks were shot, and five empty sacks were placed by the side of them—Mrs. Wheeler opened the window, and said, "You have not brought thirty sacks of coals"—Trueman said, "Yes, I have"—she said, "You have not, twenty-five sacks were full, and five were empty"—Hough came into the house afterwards—I told him it was a serious affair, and Mrs. Wheeler would have to go to Mr. Freeman</p>

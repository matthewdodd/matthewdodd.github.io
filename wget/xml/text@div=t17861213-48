               <p>Why did not you go home? - It was too late.</p>
               <p>What at ten at night? - Yes; I never lodged there before nor since.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - I had had some beer, and been a little merry, but not drunk; I went to bed in a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the house alone? - The prisoner went with me, and the landlord and his wife, they were with me, but I did not know them before; they met with me at the Hare and Hound public house, and asked me to take a bed with them that night.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner lodge at Murphy's house at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many apartments had Murphy in that house? - There was but one room; they slept there; there were two beds joined together; we were to sleep there; this woman sat by the fire when I went to bed; and about eleven, she thrust herself along side of me, with her clothes on; and about a quarter past twelve she was gone; and I dreamed I had been robbed, and I jumped up, and I found my money was gone; she went and left the place a long while; at last I heard of her, and took her up; I called the man and his wife, and he and me pursued after her, but could not find her; she went to another country, when she heard the constable was after her: I lost five guineas, and a half, and three half crowns: I had been about my business that day; I had a wife and children in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. You had better have gone home to them.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking at any other public house? - No, I dined at a cook's shop; I am quite sure I had the money in my pocket when I went to bed.</p>

I am a builder, living in North-road—I employed Thomas Harvey to do some plumber's work for me at a house in Lower Seymour-street—I sent him two sheets of lead, about a ton weight—I had a foreman, but the lead was in a room which Thomas Harvey had the charge of for his work—Samuel Harvey was employed by him—I suppose this lead to be part of my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutors's forman, and was employed at Lower Seymour-street—Thomas Harvey was there and had charge of the lead to cut it up to the best advantage for his work—in the evening of the 31st August, about six o'clock, I was at work just over the entrance I hallooed "<hi rend="italic">plumber,</hi>" he did not answer—I hallooed "<hi rend="italic">Plumber,</hi>" again, he looked up and made no answer—I said, "Stop, I want you"—I ran down but he was out of sight—I turned down Seymour-mews, came up with him, and then Thomas was with him—I followed, and said, "Har<lb></lb>vey, you have got something which don't belong to you, I suspect you have got lead"—Thomas said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Come back"—he said. "I have nothing in my bag but some solder and my tools, and what belongs to me"—I brought them back and shot this lead out of the bag—I said, "Are you not ashamed?"—he said he was going to make a bell-trap and a sink or something—he said, "Put it by, and don't say anything more, for God's sake"—I said, "I must tell master"—I begged him to go away and come and see the master in the morning—I had to go home to Finchley I got wet and did not get back next morning until eight o'clock, and my master was there—Thomas came in with a bag of solder on his back—he went to the door which I had the key of—I went to open it and my master told me to get a policeman—Thomas went after him and begged of him not to do it, and said he would settle it—my master insisted on my going, and before I got back he was taken—this is my master's lead.</p>

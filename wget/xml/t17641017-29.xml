I was employed as a porter, and sold the things to the brother-in-law [to Lovell]; had he sold them, they would have found him out; he mentioned what things they were.

He stood at the end of the street, and never came up; his sister and he had some words. I sold a table, a bed, bedding, and joint-stool, Lovell paid me a shilling for my trouble: I know nothing of the robbery.

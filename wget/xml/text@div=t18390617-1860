                  </hi>. I live in St. Paul's Church-yard, and am a warehouseman. About ten o'clock in the evening, on the 27th of May, I was opposite the New Church, in Pickett-street, Strand—I felt a jerk at my pocket—I put my hand to my pocket—a little boy came to me, and said something—my handkerchief was then gone—I had used it about a minute before—I went forward, and collared the prisoner Adams—I ac<lb></lb>cused him of having my handkerchief—he denied it—I said, "Where is your friend?"—he said, "He is gone on before"—I made him walk a little quicker, and followed hit friend, but before I overtook him he had turned up a court—that was the prisoner Smith—the prisoners were taken, but my handkerchief was not found.</p>

I am fifteen years old—I live with my mother—I was standing in Pickett-street, waiting for my mother—I saw the prosecu<lb></lb>tor pass by, and the two prisoners close to him—I saw Adams tuck up his sleeves, and go to the prosecutor's coat pocket—the prosecutor then put his hand to his pocket, pulled out his handkerchief, and made use of it—he put it back, and Adams went to his pocket again, took the hankerchief out, and gave it to Smith, who went on, and turned up Ship-yard—I told the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>COURT. What are you - A. I am in the habit of purchasing of, and disposing of estates.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you ever authorise the prisoner to pawn any of your articles in your house - A. Never; I had never any occasion to do it. In the month of November last I was going in the country, I wished to take linen, waistcoats, and smallclothes to last me while I was out of town. I never went to the drawers myself, the prisoner always brought my things to me. I observed she put up certain things for me, and was rather confused; I asked her for the breeches, she said some of them were at the scowerers, and others were at the tailors, and the linen was at the washerwoman's; I said, the breeches that I wanted had not been worn for some months; she said she would go and look for them; I said I could not wait, I would go to the drawers and look myself; on searching my drawers I found they were completely stripped, I had not a second pair of small clothes left, and I saw no shirts; I then taxed her with having made away with my property; she cried and confessed it, and told me that I should not lose my things, they should all be forthcoming; I told her that she was walking about my chambers with a halter round her neck; she said she knew it; I told her that she was an extreme bad woman; to give me my property or tell me where they were; I supposed they were pawned; she promised to do that, but a great length of time elapsed before she would do that. She promised to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took no steps against her - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>HONOURED SIR. What can I do to atone in some degree for the crime I am guilty of in injuring you, my tender-hearted master. You have shewn mercy to others that have been in your service; I trust to God and your mercy. Oh, sir, did you know the torture that I feel, you would pity me; consider, for mercy sake, I am now far advanced in pregnancy; having been helping those that turn their backs, upon me, so much so I have a thing to put on my child when it comes; I do not think it possible to survive without you could be merciful for my unpardonable crime to you, and pray let me see the person at whose house your property is at, to convince them that it was not by your knowledge that they were put in. When, sir, can I make you amends for injuring your character; I do assure you, as I hope for mercy of God, I never meaned to wrong you, or any one; I would go all my life as I am at this moment, without a thing on my back; I pray you, sir, for God's sake forgive me; I know not what to say, but trust to you and my mistress for mercy, and own myself your greatest penitent.</p>

I hope, sir, you will have some regard to my humble petition; pray do not think the worse of me. You have been merciful to others that robbed you, but I never did. You know I am the only servant that has left you poor, so many have left you with fine clothes, and God, that knows the secrets of all hearts, knows I only left you with two shillings, and had not you been so good to me as you have been, I could not have gone to any one's house. I have not tasted one morsel of meat since I left your house. For God's sake let me inform you I am doing well, and next Saturday I shall go into business, and with the money I get I will pay you honestly. For God's sake; my dear sir, consider my wretched situation; my own mind is more adverse than the most dreadful punishment you can inflict upon me, which God forbid. I hope you will be merciful; I have many friends, although I am starving for want of assistance. I saw York on Saturday, he gave me two pence, that is all I had. I hope my good friends will be rewarded as they deserve. The night I left you my mistress gave me her hand.</p>

               <p>COURT, to prosecutor. Are you a married man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where is your wife - A. A little way out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you notice at the office that her attendance would be required here, and you engaged that she would come - A. No; upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Humphries tell you so - A. Mr. Humphries told me that he should want twenty other persons; he told me that he should want her; I said, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that she was subpoened, and that some person threw the subpoene out - A. She went out of town on Saturday afternoon, I think, to her mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Emden dictate this letter to that poor woman - A. She could not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did your wife or not dictate this letter - answer yes, or no - A. I believe she did not; and as a proof, the second letter was given me by the coachman as he was driving the carriage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You deny that your wife dictated that letter - A. Yes; to the best of my belief. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn at the office upon the New Testament - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a Jew do not like the New Testament - A. That I deny.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, whether you believe the New Testament - A. I believe it so much; I believe that a great part of the New Testament is made out of the Old Testament, and that I am bound upon oath to the Supreme God to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a Christian or a Jew - A. I am of the Jewish persuasion.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it the same thing to swear by the Holy Gospels as by the Old Testament - A. I answer, I swear by the Supreme Being, if I swear by either, or both the books, my oath is binding to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. You know the nature of an oath - if you swear by the New Testament, you swear believing the contents of that book, and that Christ is God; now as a Jew (if you are a Jew) that is inconsistent. - You are not a Christian - a man that does not believe the Godhead of Christ is not a Christian - A. If I have been in an error, I believe that in swearing, so help me God, I swear by the Supreme Being, my oath is binding to me.</p>
               <p>Q. If you are a Jew, do you believe it to be the same thing to swear upon the five books of Moses, as upon the Evangelists - A. I did answer that. I certainly do believe I am bound to speak the truth on one book as well as the other. I believe Jesus Christ to be a prophet.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe Jesus Christ to be a prophet, then you are a Mahometan; he believed in the New Testament; he did not believe Jesus Christ to be God - A. I believe him to be a great man - a very great prophet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Common Serjeant. You ought to recollect that this is not the first time you have been admonished upon that subject; when I was counsel you indicted for an assault, you were sworn upon the New Testament, and the answer that you gave to sir

             on that respect; he told you you were totally unworthy of belief, as a Jew you could not be believed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The things that you call stolen were pawned at Mr. Meachams, are not these things altogether of considerable value - A. They are of value, but they are not pledged to a large value.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why do not you get out of your old habits and answer the question pertinent; you are asked whether the things that are pawned are not of large value - A. They are; but it is necessary for me to say they are not pledged to a large value.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not necessary for you to answer - I know what you want - When were the things pawned - A. In November.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get the duplicates - A. In the middle of December. I took her up in January: I got the duplicates in November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not take her up till January. You live at Furnival's Inn, Mr. Meacham lives near you - A. Perhaps about five hundred yards from me; by Brook-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What office did you select to go to - A. To Worship-street office; I went to Bow-street first, they told me there, it was regular to go to the office nearest where the prisoner lived; she lived in Brick-lane, Spitalfields.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210060"></xptr>COURT. In January you took the prisoner up; there was one sessions in December and another in January - what day in November did you get the duplicates - A. I rather think I did not get the duplicates then, but in December. The reason I did not take her up, I had some business in Chancery; I did not mean to prosecute her, I meaned to pass it entirely over, but she went about the neighbourhood and said I was perfectly aware of her having pledged the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if she had held he tongue you would not have prosecuted her - A. I should not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. So far from consenting to her pawning your things, you did not know it, you never consented to it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never pawned your things in your life - A. There were some things that I pawned for a gentleman going in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. The things pawned, that you charge the prisoner with stealing, are worth fifty pound - A. More than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Two hundred pound - A. I do not really know. They are worth from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty pound; I can get them back for five and thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. It would be an easy thing to get them back by prosecuting the prisoner - A. I did not do it for that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know if you convict the prisoner you can get it back for nothing - A. I believe it is generally known.</p>
               <p>Q. His lordship asked you what you were, you answered that you bought and sold estates - Is that your only mode of getting a livelyhood - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a chariot and four horses - A. Yes, and two out-riders; I have two extra horses for that; I have race-horses besides, and a country-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you altogether - A. Sometimes three and sometimes four, only one maid servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you owe this woman fifty pound - A. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he know that you pawned these things - A. No, I don't think he did; she always charged me not to let the things fall for fear Mr. Goodey or Mr. Emden should see them.</p>

            . Q. You are the mother of the last witness - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been employed by the prisoner to pawn any things - A. Many times, at Mr. Meachams; I laid the money out under the direction of the prisoner. Mr. Emden certainly must know it, because he did not leave sufficient money in the house to support it. The prisoner told me so. I bought with the money, bread butter, cheese, eggs, candles, half a peck of coals, frequently, half an ounce of tea, a quartern of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the lady they call Mrs. Emden - A. There is many Mrs. Emden's there. I have known things pawned many mornings, when otherwise there was nothing to eat; even when Mr. Emden has been there, and a-bed with the lady. And I have met Mr. Emden when I have been carrying the things to pawn, he must have seen it, and frequenty I have seen him when I have come back with the things I have redeemed; and when they have not had coals I have lent them a shovel full of coals. I never shewed him the things when I met him, that I had in my lap for decency sake; he must know it, he could see the bulk, and I have left the duplicates at different parts of the kitchen; and I have pawned the prisoner's cloak to make a shilling to pay the postman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that he did not think of prosecuting the prisoner, but she had claimed a large debt as due from him - A. Yes. He told me more than that. In conversation he told me that he should not have taken her up if she had not stained his character.</p>

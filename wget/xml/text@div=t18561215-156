I am porter to Mr. Mott, jeweller, of Cheapside—on 13th Dec., I was in the shop at 25 minutes to 7 o'clock—I heard the window smashed—I rushed out of the shop, and took this necklet, with a circular ornament attached, from the prisoner's hand—the other necklet a gentleman picked up, and gave me—both are my master's property, and both were lying in that part of the window where the glass was broken—his hand was in the window—he had in his hand as many necklets as he could hold, but he could not pull them out, because he could not get them off the books—the two produced are the only ones which were pulled out—the house is in the parish of St. Mastthew, Friday-street—the prisoner's hand was bleeding.</p>

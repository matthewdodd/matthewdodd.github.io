                  </hi>. I am a riding master, and assistant to Mr. Mason, of No. 9, Onslow-terrace, Brompton. The prisoner took a lesson in riding, and inquired the terms for twelve lessons—I told him three guineas, and asked him to walk into the inner office, and he gave me this cheque—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "22nd Aug., 1856; Mr. Railton, No. 14, Princess-gate, Hyde-park; please to pay J. Mason and Co., riding masters, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; G. T. Thompson; accepted, G. T. Thompson")—the peculiarity of the form attracted my notice, and he had given the name of Brown in the school—I handed the cheque to Mr. Mason's son.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was not there anybody besides you that gave me the lesson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Mason's oldest son came in for a few minutes—it is often the case that persons who want to learn to ride, use another name, but in giving a cheque it is different—we keep books—I did not hand you a bill and receipt, because the cheque seemed spurious—I did not hand you a bill of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the lesson—it was your own suggestion to take twelve lessons—I did not consult Mr. Mason—I sent the cheque for payment very shortly affer you left—this is not a charge by me to recover 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the lesson I gave you; I heard no more of it till I was warned by the policeman to come to Marl borough-street, and found you in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. This cheque was put into my hands by Mr. Armstrong, on 23rd Aug., and I went to No. 14, Prince's-gate, Hyde-park, between 2 and 3 o'clock, but could find no person named Railton—I went back, and the prisoner was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was this cheque written in your presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the counting house—you wrote two or three lines of one cheque, and did not finish it, you were told to write a proper one—Mr. Armstrong asked you to do it; he did not put the words into your mouth—I saw a footman at No. 14, Prince's-gate.</p>

The prisoner began to write out another form, I think it was something of an I O U—it was destroyed with other papers—it was begun, and not finished—it was not signed—he did not complete it, because we never receive I O U's in payment, and I told him that form would not do, and then he gave me this.</p>

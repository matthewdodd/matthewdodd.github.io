            . I am a constable. I went with Annett, and found the tools at the prisoner's house - he acknowledged taking them, and said there was another chisel which he would send home. I do not remember his saying that he stole them. I believe he was a hard working man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On looking for my own tools behind the prosecutor's chest, I found these tools, and took them home to return them to him when I saw him; but as we lived five miles apart, I could not take them directly.</p>

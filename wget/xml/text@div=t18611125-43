                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter<lb></lb>carrier at the western district office—the prisoner was a sorter and letter carrier there—his walk on 3d October was the Tottenham Court-road district, and some of the adjoining streets—a letter arriving by the mail<lb></lb>bag from Arlesford shortly after 1 o'clock, should be delivered by the prisoner about twenty minutes or half-past 2—according to his own showing in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) he left the office for that delivery at a quarter to 2—this is in his writing.</p>

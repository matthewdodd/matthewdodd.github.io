I am a portmanteau maker, of 5, Star-place, Somers'-town—the prisoner is my brother-in-law—he came to my place on Tuesday evening, 11th March, and after we had been sitting there some little while he said that he had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and asked me whether I could get it changed for him—I told him it was a thing I so seldom changed, never having changed but one, and that was at Mr. Meadows', and very likely he might give me change for it—I asked him where he had it from—he said from a man named Phillips, that he was in partnership with, in hawking jewellery—I went with him to Mr. Meadows, who is a publican, and asked him if he would change a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for my brother-in-law—he told me to ask at the bar if they had sufficient change—I did so, and they changed it, but before that my brother-in-law endorsed it—I believe this "D. Riardon" to be his endorsement—Mr. Meadows afterwards sent for me, and I sent for the prisoner—that was seven or eight days afterwards—I told him I had heard that there was something wrong respecting the note, and he must come with me to Mr. Meadows—I took him there—we were taken into the back parlour, and a policeman who was there questioned him as to how he became possessed of the note—he said that he got it from a man named Phillips—we were both given in charge.</p>

On 11th March I was round Burton-crescent, and a man, who I knew by sight, came up to me and said, "Do you know where I can change a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note? I have had it given to me." I said, "I do not know, but perhaps my master will change it for you." I told him to meet me in the shop that night, and I asked my master to change it, who had not sufficient cash. I then thought of my brother-in-law, as being a respectable man. I asked him, and we went to Mr. Meadows, who changed it I brought out the money to the man, who gave me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out. I am quite innocent of knowing it was forged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-warder at Millbank Penitentiary—the prisoner was a convict confined there on 19th May—I was going into his cell about 8 o'clock in the evening, as he was in the act of leaving it with his day's work—I went in to remove it, but he was bringing it out into the corridor—I was entering the cell to see that it was safe, when I received a blow from some sharp instrument which the prisoner had in his left hand, and struck me with it on the left temple, inflicting a wound from which the blood gushed out—I then received a clenched-fist blow from the prisoner's right hand, which rendered me insensible for a few seconds—the prisoner closed on me, we fell, and he inflicted several cutting wounds on my neck when I was on the ground, one of which cut through my jacket collar, which was the most severe—I then partly regained my legs, but my right leg became entangled with my key-chain—I fell again, and the prisoner in<lb></lb>flicted a blow between my eyebrows, which extended nearly to my temple from my nose, and also a slight wound in the corner of my left eye—he also bit my left cheek, and bit the top of my finger, which deprived me of the use of it for some time, and I have lost the nail—the struggle lasted from five to seven minutes, and I received several other wounds not of a serious nature—Minchin, the warder, was there from the beginning—I had said nothing to irritate the prisoner—I spoke to him about an hour before, and said, "Smith, come, get on with your work," and he said, "All right master"—his work was preparing cord for making mats—he had no instru<lb></lb>ment to do it with—the surgeon dressed my wounds, and I was disabled for sixteen days.</p>

               <p>account given by Ives—that is correct—I interfered to prevent the prisoner striking Ives, but did not succeed in securing the prisoner till they had had a struggle of six or seven minutes—I got him by the collar to choke him off but it was impossible to get him off—after the struggle, the prisoner got on his legs, and made a violent blow at my head with something he had in his fist—I parried off the blow, and received a slight wound on the right wrist—after the struggle I endeavoured to get Ives away, and secure the prisoner in the cell; and when he was that in, he called out to another man, "Ryan, come, I have done for one of these b—s; come in, come in, I will do the same for you"—whether he meant Ryan or me to come in, I do not know—Ryan is a convict—I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to Millbank Penitentiary—Ives was brought into the infirmary, on 19th May, with his face covered with blood—I found several wounds about his face, head, and neck, all superficial but two, one of which extended from the inner angle of the right eye to near the ear—it was about three inches long, and under the brow—it was a little more than one-sixth of an inch deep—the other was on the left temple; it was less extensive, but it went deeper, and divided a small blood-vessel, from which a good deal of blood issued—there was a wound on the neck; it was not deep, but was in a dangerous situation over the artery—he was off duty from 19th May to 5th June—the wounds might be inflicted with this instrument.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, entered into his history from the time of the Crimean War. He stated that he was discharged at Chatham as unfit for service, and that he had received a medal and three bars from Her Majesty; that he had been in a lunatic asylum, and could not bear to be excited; that, when at Millbank, the officer on duty gave him three months on the dark side of the gaol, and three months on the light side; that an officer named Downs was always at him, and he could not get any sleep; that he tried to do his best, but the officers would not let him, but made his life miserable, so that he would as leave die as not; and that, if he had been treated at Millbank as kindly as he was at Newgate, he would have done everything to please.</hi>

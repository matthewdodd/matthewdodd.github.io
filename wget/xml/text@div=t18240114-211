I felt something hard at his side, and found a piece of opium on each side of him, under his shirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You told him he had something about him, which he had stolen - A. No. I did not mention his stealing it; he did not say it was given to him to carry out of the Docks, as smuggled. He expressed himself very sorry for it, and for the gentleman who had recommended him.</p>

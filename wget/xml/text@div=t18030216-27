             sworn. - I am an officer; on the prisoner Jonqua's being apprehended, I went to his house, No. 2, Pelham-street, and found in his apartment, part of a bed furniture, there was a window-curtain of the same quality, which the prosecutor said, was his property, as such, we brought it away; Jonqua's wife was in the apartment, he was apprehended the day before.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - In consequence of an information, I went to Jonqua's house, on the 21st of January, with the other officers, and took him into custody, Gale was then in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Gale lodge there? - A. No, but they were both in the same room with another man, Jellison and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Jellison and his wife lodge there? - A. No, only Jonqua; on the Saturday, I received information that Fich had lost some property; I took him to Jonqua's house, that he might see some bed-furniture there, he described the pattern, and I took a piece with me; as soon as he saw it, he said, it was his property; it was hung on the bedstead as the furniture of the bed; I took it to the Magistrate and he was committed; Jonqua was asked, how long he had had it, he said, some months; that he bought it in a shop, but did not mention where; this is the furniture, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.There was no concealment of this property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went the day before, and saw it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fich. I can swear with certainty to this being my property, this is what I saw in Jonqua's house, the lining is of two different qualities, the one is finer than the other, it corresponds with what I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it comprehend all you lost? - A. It does, there were four curtains.</p>
               <p>Q.There is no particular mark? - A. No, only the pattern of the binding corresponds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The lining is of two different sorts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is exactly like what it would be if bought at different times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Examine the binding, is that all alike? - A.One is wider than the other; one is hemmed, the other bound over.</p>
               <p>Jonqua's defence. I have some witnesses to call; the prosecutor said, before the Magistrate, it was of one quality; I can produce a person to prove I bought a part of the lining to finish them.</p>

               <p>For Jonqua.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SHORELEG sworn. - I am a weaver, I know Jonqua by working for her, I made her a set of bed-furniture, yellow and red stripes; there was only a part of the lining, and no binding; I sent a little girl to buy the lining, 10s. 6d. for twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q.How much of the calico lining was afterwards bought? - A. Four yards; this is the piece put on each side, I split it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who brought you the calico? - A. Mrs. Jonqua.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Look at the calico, is it all alike in quality? - A. I believe it is, there is one breadth looks a little coarser than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you made that furniture up? - A. Yes, I sent it home, and was paid five shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Fich.) How much was there of the coarse calico? - A.About ten or twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q.See if you can find so much, or more, or less? - A.This is the coarse.</p>
               <p>Q. It amounts to ten or twelve yards? - A. Yes.</p>

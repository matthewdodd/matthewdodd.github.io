                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker—about 2 o'clock in the afternoon of 21st February, I was passing through St. Paul's Churchyard—I stopped to look in a photographic shop, and while standing there, felt my watch chain drop and touch me—I immediately turned round and saw Hawkins, whom I had previously seen, leaning over my shoulder—I accused him of stealing my watch, and, he endeavoured to pass something to Cart-wright, whom I seized—an officer almost immediately came up and took him in custody—passing down Ludgate-hill, I saw them find the watch in Hawkins' hand.</p>

My attention was called to the prisoners by a postman who was passing by at the time—immediately I got behind the prisoners, I saw the prosecutor seize them both by the collar, and then I went and seized one myself—I made a search, but could not find anything on them, there being a great crowd at the time—a detective-sergeant came by and took one of them, and then a uniform constable came and took the other—on the road to the station Hawkins made several attempts to get up to the prosecutor—I could see he wanted to give him the watch, or something—I called Sergeant Packman's attention to it, and he went up, seized his right band, and found the watch there—I did not see any person come near Hawkins several times.</p>

I am a detective officer—I was passing through St. Paul's Churchyard about twenty minutes to 2 on this afternoon, and saw a number of persons assembled—I saw the prosecutor grasp two persons—an officer in uniform went up at that moment—I went up and asked what was the matter—the prosecutor said, "One of these persons has stolen my watch"—I said, "I will take charge of this man" (<hi rend="italic">Hawkins</hi>), and the</p>

I must have it"—I searched Hawkins; he held up his hands willingly—we found no watch—another constable came up, and we went towards the station—when we got to the bottom of Ludgate-hill, I saw another person shuffle towards Cartwright; I supposed it to be a companion—I went up, cleared the people away, and searched, but did not find the watch—I then grasped Hawkins's hand, which was under his cape, and found it clenched—I opened it and found the watch in his hand—a lad followed us, and said, in the prisoner's presence, "I picked up this ring" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found a pair of kid gloves on Hawkins.</p>

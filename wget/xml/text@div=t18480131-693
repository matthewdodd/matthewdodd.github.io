                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Thomas Burrows, who keeps a clothes shop in the Hampstead-road. On 8th Jan., Smith and Samuel Hurley came to the shop, and asked if I had a coat which she had left a deposit on twelve months ago, I had had a coat left in that way with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. deposit left on it—she was to have it when she paid the rest of the money, (she came three months after, and asked if her son had fetched the coat—I said he had not, and she went away) I looked and could not find it—Samuel tried on several coats—she found one to fit—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, and it was put aside—she was to call for it in two or three hours, but did not—on the following Saturday two officers came, and brought a coat, which I</p>

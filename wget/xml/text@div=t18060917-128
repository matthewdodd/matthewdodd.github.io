On the 13th of August, a quarter after two o'clock I was called, out of the bake-house into the shop by my daughter, to shew me the man who had stole a quartern loaf. She pointed to Mr. Lloyd's shop window, she says that is the man that is at Mr. Lloyd's door; the prisoner then stood at Mr. Lloyd's door, I saw him at the same time put his left foot in the shop, and with his right arm he put something into his apron, he doubled his apron up and came towards my shop on the other side of the street; I went over the way and took hold of him by the collar, and asked him to walk back with me; I took him to Mr. Lloyd's shop, and called Mrs. Lloyd to the door, I asked her if she had missed any thing from the door, she told me a pair of corderoy breeches; I found upon him a pair of corderoy breeches, these are them (producing them).</p>

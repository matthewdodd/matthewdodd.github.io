I was in Lisson-green-road, I am an milk woman. I went into a public-house to serve the milk. I put the handkerchief down; in that handkerchief was two flat irons. I asked for half a pint of beer. I went into the tap-room to warm it, and when I returned into the passage the bundle was gone.</p>

            . I am a painter. I was having a pint of beer while this man was there. When the prosecutrix was warming her beer this man went out; he came back again. They accused him of it. He denied it. I saw him pull the handkerchief out of his breeches pocket; he heaved the irons away. This is the handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a waiter in the public-house, I found the irons about an hundred yards off the house, near a bunch of stinging nettles. I went out and found them. The prisoner went out and returned. I was sure he had not gone far. These are the irons.</p>

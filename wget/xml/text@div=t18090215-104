On Monday the 13th, about eight o'clock at night, I told the boy to put up the door shutter; a woman immediately picked up a pair of sandals and brought them in; I went to the door to see if there was any thing else missing, I found there were a pair of stockings and two pair of sandals missing; at that time Mr. Ley brought in the prisoner with a pair of stockings and two pair of sandals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Have you any body in trade with you - A. No; no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the stockings and the sandals before you missed them - A. Hanging up inside of the door, I pinned them across a string. I had nobody in the shop for two hours, and I was watching the shop attentively; I dropped a bill down, and while I stooped to pick it up the stockings were taken.</p>
               <p>MR. LEY. I live next door to Mr. Book. On Monday the 13th of February I was standing in my own shop, about eight o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner looking in my window; I saw him go from thence to Mr. Book's shop window; I immediately went to the shop door; I saw the prisoner take one pair of stockings and two pair of sandals, he tore down three other pair with them; he ran away very fast; I pursued him and took him within an hundred yards; he was not more than four or five yards from me all the time.</p>

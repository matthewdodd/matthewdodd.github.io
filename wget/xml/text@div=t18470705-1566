                  </hi> I am a butcher, and live at Enfield-highway. The defendant is also a butcher, and lives at the same place—on Monday morning, the 24th of May, about four o'clock, I was coming up to Londan, to attend Newgate-market—the defendant asked me to take up a body of beef for him—I agreed to do so—he told me to give it to a porter in Newgate-street, to deliver to Mr. Cotterell, a meat-salesman, in Newgate-market—the meat was wrapped up in four cloths, in four parcels, which is the usual way with meat sent to market—I brought it up, gave it to a porter, and instructed him to take it to Mr. Cotterell's—it had taken me about an hour and a half to come up—I arrived in London a little after six o'clock—I heard something from Mr. Cotterell, and I went to him—I found a small portion of the cloth was opened from one of the parcels of beef in Mr. Cotterell's shop—the other three parcels were hanging up in his shop—I examined the parcel that was opened—I saw the meat was not sweet—it was green—it was bad, and unfit for human food—I did not tell the defendant of it when I got back, not till night—the clerk of the market had been down, and told him before I got there—when I told him, he said he was very sorry indeed that he had sent it, and that he had sent it by me—I am not certain whether there was any thunder and lightning that day—it was excessively hot—it was Whit-Monday—I saw a small portion of the beef perhaps about ten minutes after I brought it up—it could not have got into that state in an hour and a half, I think.</p>

                  </hi> I am a meat-salesman in Newgate-market. On Whit-Monday, the 24th of May, I received three parcels of beef from Paynter—he told me they came from a person named Belsham—I had had dealings with him about a year and a quarter before—I knew him to be a butcher, and he knew me to be a meat-salesman—the meat was in a very bad state—it was putrid, and not fit for human food—I would not allow it to come into the shop—Paynter said, "Will you allow me to fetch Mr. Price?"—I said "Yes"—I said to him, "What did you allow such meat to come into my shop for?"—he said, "I think it is only the hide"—I went, and found it was very bad—that could not have occurred on its journey from Enfield—in my judg<lb></lb>ment it was diseased before it was killed.</p>

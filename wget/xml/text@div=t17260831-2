The Goods were lost, and he not coming as usual to shut the Shop at Night, not to open it in the Morning, it made me Suspicious that it was he that had rob'd me, and thereupon, I spread a large number of Advertisements, wherein I describ'd his Person, by which means he was Apprehended the next Day.</p>

             thus depos'd. Having some of the Prosecutors Advertisements to disperse, I met the Prisoner in Red Cross Street, in the Park Southwark, and he appearing like an Undertakers Servant, I thought him a proper Person to deliver one of the Bills to, and was going to give him one accordingly, but upon observing him, I thought he very much answer'd the Description of the Person I wanted, and my Opinion was strengthen'd, by seeing him have a Silver Salver under his Arm. I have a great fancy Friend, says I, that you are the Man, that I have been looking for, - how came you by that Salver. He made but a shuffling Answer, which heightning my Suspicion, I search'd him farther, and found several Pair of Black Silk Gloves, 3 Silver Spoons, and other Goods about him, to the value of 4 or 5 l. which proved to be part of what was lost out of Mr. Say's House. <rs id="t17260831-2-verdict10" type="verdictDescription">

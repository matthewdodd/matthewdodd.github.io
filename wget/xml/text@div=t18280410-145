When I saw him at London Coney, he got over a gate and ran across a field - I pursued him, and when he found I gained upon him, he stopped and said, "I find you are the best runner, and it is of no use for me to run;" the key of my stable is kept at the Horse and Groom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He said he was innocent? A. Yes; he had lived a year or two at the Horse and Groom; my key hung in the bar, and he might have taken it if Mr. Simms was not there - this is the cloth- it would be very difficult for one man to carry it; two rather destitute men, who lived near the premises, have absconded; I understand they slept in Mr. Simm's stable; hand-bills were printed, and I did insert in them that the name of "Mead," maker, was on it, as I thought it was, as many makers do put their name on cloths; I now find that was not the case: one of the men who have absconded worked for me - we took them into custody, but could not bring any evidence against them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Nicholson; his stables join Mr. Vorley's. On the 5th of March, when I got to the stable, I found the yard door open, which I had done up on the inside; I went in and opened the stable door, and missed two young cocks - I went up into the loft to put some hay down, and there I saw a hole into Mr. Vorley's stable, and some feathers lying about; I looked through, and the stack-cloth, which used to lay under the manger, was then gone; I came down, and found Mr. Vorley's stable door locked as usual; I went to the Horse and Groom, and gave information - I did not see the prisoner; I then went to the stable of the Horse and Groom, and found the two men who usually slept there - they were up; I then went back to my own stable, and staid about half an hour; I then went to the Horse and Groom again, and saw Mr. Simms - I came out, and saw the prisoner; I told him what I had seen - he said he knew nothing about it; I saw him again in the afternoon, and I told him Mr. Vorley was going to send some of the Bow-street officers there; he said he knew nothing about it; at five o'clock I saw him going across the yard with a cart, towards the shed - I went over to the shed, and saw the cloth going into the cart; Samuel Veazey was in the cart, pulling the cloth in, and the prisoner was below, pushing it up - I came round from there to the Horse and Groom, and went into the stable; I spoke of it, but said nothing to the prisoner or to Veazey - I do not think they saw me; I then went and told Mrs. Simms - she came out and saw it; I then said to Veazey, "That is Mr. Vorley's cloth;" he said, "If it is a stolen cloth, I will have nothing to do with it," and he got up and threw it out of the cart: Mr. Simms then came, and made us put it into the cart again - I did not see the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you seen the cloth safe? A. It might be a week or a fortnight before; I do not know when I had seen the fowls before; I know one of the men very well who slept in the stable - I do not know that they have ran away - perhaps they are there still; I saw them on the 5th of March - they were taken up that evening - they were examined on the 6th of March; I have not seen them since; John Day (Mr. Vorley's man) and I had been in the place before the cloth was taken; he never told me the cloth was condemned - I never heard that mentioned; one man could carry it, but he could not get it up the yard; when I saw it in the cart, there was some hay covered over it.</p>

            . I am a carrier at Holloway. On the afternoon of the 5th of March, a man, who I do not know, came to me, and I went to the yard of the Horse and Groom. I found the prisoner at the door, and said to him, "George, I understand you have got a cloth for sale," and whether he said he had got a cloth, or got one for sale, I am not certain; but he took hold of my horse's head, and drew the cart to the stable-door: I followed him, and saw the cloth there: I said, "Well, George, open it out;" he said, "I can't open it:" I said, "I am not going to buy a pig-in-a-poke;" he said, "Take it, and if it don't suit you, bring it back again." I got it into the cart with the prisoner; I then stepped aside for a minute; Harrold and Mr. Simms came, and said it was Mr. Vorley's: I said, "If it is stolen, I will have nothing to do with it." I threw it out, and went to have a pint of beer; while I was there, they put it into the cart again - I had lost my cloth some time before, and told the prisoner if he heard of one, I should be glad to know of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you help to put it in? A. Yes; there was no hay covering it - there was a little hay in the cart; it was about four o'clock in the evening - it could not have been covered with hay without my seeing it; I did not put a single whisp of hay on it; two men were taken up on suspicion; I did not know either of them- I have lived for fourteen or fifteen years within three quarters of a mile of the Horse and Groom.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Vorley. On the 4th of March I saw this cloth safe in the loft; I locked up the stable door about eight o'clock that morning, and hung the key up in the bar; there is a fence round the yard, and a gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could not anybody get into the yard? A. Yes, but not into the stable without the key; when I went on the Wednesday morning the cloth was gone - I do not know whether it could be brought into the public yard without a person seeing it - it is a public yard; the Horse and Groom is an inn, but this stable is at the back of the Horse and Groom. The cloth would take two ablebodied men to lift it; I do not know the two men who went off - it is about five poles from Mr. Vorley's stable to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100083"></xptr>stable of the Horse and Groom; a person could not go therewithout crossing a fence - it is full one hundred yards to go round by the palings.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The last time you saw him was at half-past five o'clock? A.

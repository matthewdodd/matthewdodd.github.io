                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 6, Retreat Cottages, Pine<lb></lb>hill, Upper Clapton—on Monday, 12th May, I was engaged in repairing a wall in the Green Lanes opposite the Manor House about 7.40 a.m.—while I was taking some bricks off the wall I saw a brown paper parcel laid up against the wall, about 40 or 45 yards away from the road—there is a little roadway leading from the main road up to the wall—I went down to the parcel—the paper was lying open—I looked Under the paper and saw the dead body of a little child—a little flannel was wrapped over its feet—I had some mates working at a little distance from me—I went up to them and called them, and one of them came back with me—we did not move the parcel—my mate put his trowel and just pulled the paper on one side, and saw the child lying with its hand on the chest—I looked at the child and saw a bit of yellow stuff coming out of its mouth on to its chin—I put a mortar-board in front of the child and went for a policeman, and the constable Boittault came up, and he in my presence picked the child up and turned it over—I noticed a little hole on the head where it bad been dropped on a bit of brick—when I first saw it its head was lying on a bit of brick—I picked up the piece of brick and gave it to the constable—this is it (produced)—it has been burnt since—Finsbury Park is the nearest railway-station to the place where I found the child; that is about a mile—the wall was about 4 or 5 feet high before I commenced to take the bricks off—the parcel was lying close to the wall, leaning against it.</p>

There is a hedge all round the field where I found the child, but a gap to go through, and there are gates at the bottom of the wall—there were a number of small broken pieces of brick about the place where I found the body, but nothing to hurt like this—the hole on the back of the head appeared to be where it had dropped on the brick—there was hardly any blood except just on the brick, that was all—the place is in the immediate neighbourhood of Hornsey.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 276). On Monday morning, 12th May, about 8 o'clock, I was on duty in the Green Lanes, Hornsey Stocks came and spoke to me, and in consequence of what he said I went from the Green Lanes across a field, or piece of waste ground—there are some gates at the end—this rough plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) correctly represents the place—the Green Lane is the main road—I went through a gap across the field—the gap was about 100 yards down the Green Lanes from the Seven Sisters Road—the gap is marked on the plan—it leads to a brick wall at the end of the field—the brick wall goes along by the side of a private road—the gates at the end of the private road are boarded gates, what are called matchboard gates or frame gates—they were shut and locked at that time—I got from the gap into the field—I did not see the body of the child till I got to the wall—I found the body about 10 yards from the Green Lanes, on the private road aide of the wall—you would have to get over the wall from the field to get to where the body was lying—the wall was about 2ft. 6in. high when I saw it; that was where the men were at work pulling it down—the child was lying on some brown paper close to the wall—I picked it of and found it was quite dead—I noticed that there was some blood and stuff running from its nose and mouth—there was a small wound on the crown of the head—I noticed a lot of blood on a piece of brick that the head was lying on—this is the piece of brick—the child was lying on this flannel; it was round the bottom part of the body—the top part of the body was naked—this flannel was under its arms and round the back, and met in front, covering the legs—I think it was sewn on, but I am not certain about that—this linen swathe was rolled round the stomach—this apron was round the bottom part of the body, under the flannel, and fastened in the same way as the flannel—this was outside—this little shirt was on the body under the flannel—it seemed as if the flannel had slipped from the upper part of the body—there were some napkins under the whole of this clothing, and this was on the outside of one or two more—they were round its legs and the lower part of the body under the flannel—the child was cold—I took it to the station, and took charge of all these things—I sent for Mr. Berry the surgeon, and he came and examined the child—an inquest was held on Wednesday, the 14th—I gave evidence, also Mr. Berry and Stocks—the Coroner took possession of the brick—it was produced at the inquest; I saw it again at Clerkenwell Police-court.</p>

I am a physician and surgeon, and live at Woodbine House, Hornsey Road—on Monday morning, 12th May, I was sent for to the Hornsey Road Police-station between 8 and 10 o'clock—I was there shown the body of a female child—it was partly dressed, well nourished, about a month or six weeks old; it was not vaccinated—the</p>

               <p>pupils were contracted—I did not notice the head of the child at the station—I made a post-mortem examination the next evening—there were several contused wounds, two being lacerated and contused, at the back of the head, over the parietal bone—one was on the posterior portion of the parietal bone, about three-quarters of an inch long—there was a contused fracture—on removing the integuments of the posterior portion of the cranium a great deal of coagulated blood was found between the integu<lb></lb>ments and the brain, opposite the external seat of the wound—a quantity of blood was found extravasated between the arachnoid membranes and the brain—in the abdomen the peritoneum was healthy, the liver healthy, the kidneys healthy, the spleen healthy, the pan<lb></lb>creas healthy, the bladder healthy, containing no urine—the lungs and small intestines were healthy, full of flatus; the heart healthy; the lungs healthy, pale pink in colour—I removed the stomach for analysis, and found that it contained milk, having a perceptible odour of opium, that is laudanum—in my opinion the cause of death was injury to the brain whilst under the action of a narcotic—the skull was fractured right over this one particular wound—there were two wounds, one much smaller than the other—I believe the smaller wound was produced by the brick—I saw the brick at the inquest; there is a small drop of coagulated blood on it now—I saw several drops of blood on it at the inquest, just where it had percolated from the small wound, and also a few hairs just similar to those in the child's head—I believe the large wound was produced by something similar to this piece of brick where the notch is—I believe that the wound on the anterior superior portion of the parietal bone, not the small one that the brick was resting on, but I believe by the contusion of the parts and the amount of blood extravasated between the arachnoid membranes and the brain, that the child was stricken by something blunt; a piece of brick or something similar; that is my opinion—I believe the child was stricken on the head during the time it was alive and under the influence of the laudanum—the smaller wound, the lower wound, may have been produced by dropping the child on to the brick, but the upper one was in a position that could not have been so produced—I believe that the child was struck by something that produced the larger wound—I do not believe that would be done by falling on the brick; I believe it must have been done by some person taking something in the hand and striking the child on the head—I could not estimate the amount of laudanum that was given, but I believe the amount the child had got was sufficient to produce a soporific effect and cause death if they had waited a proper time—any preparation of laudanum is a very dangerous thing to give to a baby—I could not tell how recently before death the milk had been swallowed—all the organs were healthy; it was a very fine child; it had the appearance of about six or seven weeks old instead of three—it was consistent with what I saw that it may have been only three weeks old—I took off the clothes to perform the post<lb></lb>mortem, and there being nothing convenient at the mortuary to wipe my hands and instruments upon I used those, and some of the blood and mess upon the clothes have been so caused—I put the clothes under the child after performing the post-mortem.</p>

               <p>case—I examined the veins—I did not find them gorged with blood; one vein between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, right opposite the larger wound, had been ruptured by the wound, and there was a great deal of blood extravasated—none of the veins were gorged with blood that I saw—I examined them minutely—I looked over the whole of the veins and they were just in a normal state, except in the place I speak of—there was sufficient opium in the stomach to have caused death if time had been given; I don't say that it did cause death—sometimes death from laudanum is very quick, according to the dose, but very quick in a child—contraction of the pupils is indicative of the influence of laudanum, it may also be of concussion of the brain, of fracture at the base of the skull—a serous effusion in the ventricles is a cardinal point to ascertain in poisoning by laudanum—I did not examine the ventricles, because there was sufficient cause of death from the fracture of the skull from the lacerated wound, without the laudanum—I will take on myself to state that it was the superior wound that destroyed the child's life—I cannot say that if the wounds had not been there the child might have died from poisoning by laudanum—if there had been no wounds, I should have gone more par<lb></lb>ticularly into the minutiae and traced it from the mouth right down—I believe that the child had taken sufficient laudanum to produce death, but I believe it died from the effects of the large wound—I could not under<lb></lb>take to say that death was not caused by the laudanum—the second wound might have been caused by falling on the brick; I believe the larger wound was inflicted by somebody taking something in their hand—I notice the edges of the wound, they were not close, the wound was inverted and drawn in; there was a small coagula of blood right in between the lower and upper portions of the lip of the wound, and just round it there was a laceration somewhat similar in shape to the matrix in my nail—it is diffi<lb></lb>cult to say from the appearance of a wound whether it has been inflicted before or after death; it may be improbable, but not impossible; I only give my opinion, and I believe I am right—laudanum in cordials is a very wrong thing to give to any child; it is a very common thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. There. was enough laudanum in the body to account for death, if it had not been caused by violence—I went through the regular routine to test for laudanum—I removed the stomach and examined it in my surgery—I think the laudanum was given in the milk—it is possible that it might be given in a simple form, the milk might be given on one occasion and the laudanum on another—I did not examine to see whether the milk was the mother's, or the milk of an animal—I have heard that the woman suckled the child and that her breast became injured—I could not undertake to say that the milk I found mixed with the laudanum was not the mother's milk—I believe the laudanum was laudanum pure and simple, not in the shape of a cordial, but such as you would buy at a chemist's, tincture of opium—I could not tell how long it had been administered—I believe it had been given some short time prior to death, within 8 hours of my seeing the body, and within about 42 hours of my examination—I believe it was given before the infliction of the wound, I could not say how short a time before; it might be within half or quarter of an hour, it is possible.</p>

I am very happy to say we arrived home without catching any more cold, and this leaves us all quite well, and hope it will find you better. My breast is nearly well; remember us very kindly to Alfred. I hope he is still getting a little better; give my love to Betty, I hope she is well. I suppose she missed the baby, for I know she was very fond of nursing it I have thought about you all a great many times since I have been away; the country seems dull after London, but still it looks very nice, everything is looking so green; I think I shall rather like it this summer. Now, I must give over as I am rather in a hurry, so with kindest love to you, believe me to remain yours sincerely, M. Hull I will write again some time.

I attended to Mrs. Hull the first four or five days after her confinement, and after that my daughter principally, but I was up in the room two or three times every day—before leaving, the male prisoner said he was quite pleased to think I had been so kind to Mrs. Hull and the child.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. The female prisoner appeared to be a very nice, affectionate person—she took to the child immediately she was able after its birth—she could not nurse it very long; she took it to the breast in about three days, until she complained of great pain to the breast—I ascertained that she was in the family way about a week after she came—she then became very confidential to me, and spoke about the approaching birth—she seemed to look forward to it, and to be kind in every way—the first part of the time, being a stranger, she was mostly in her own room—I did not see her making things; we did not sit and work together at the baby's clothes—I made some of the things upstairs while she was ill in bed,—the first week's rent was paid in advance by the male prisoner.</p>

               <p>JOHN BENHAM. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long have you known me? A. Six or eight months; I should not have been afraid to have left my watch in your care; I did not give it you to take care of - when I saw you on the Wednesday I said"You know what I want," and you said, "You shall have it on Saturday;" I waited till Saturday; you did not say you had pawned it - I was to meet you at the Thornhill's Arms; I should not have known you had the watch, had not two men come, and told - I waited till the Saturday, and as it did not come I began to think rather serious about it; I was the worse for liquor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor - we went, and drank together: we then went to the Vine, and drank a great deal more - he was very tipsy, I was rather better; I advised him to go home, but he would go to the Pickled Egg; I said he had better allow me to take care of his watch, and he said very well - I took it, and went my way; that was about two o'clock in the morning - I did not go home; I took a lodging, and the next morning I was obliged to pawn the watch to pay for the lodging - I went to the Vine the next morning to say where he might come to me, and that his watch was all right; he came on the Wednesday, and said "Do you know where my watch is?" I told him.</p>

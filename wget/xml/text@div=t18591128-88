I am the wife of Thomas Duggen, a boot and shoe<lb></lb>maker—on new year's night of the present year I was in Blackman-street, with my husband, returning home—we went into a public-house, and had two glasses of ale—I saw the prisoner there—he followed me out across the street, and said, "I say, <hi rend="italic">Missus,</hi> you will lose your shawl"—my husband was at my elbow—I turned round, and received a box on the side of my head, and was knocked down—he took my shawl away, and was running across the street with it—my husband followed him, calling, "Police, police, stop the robber," but did not overtake him—I have never seen my shawl since—it was a Paisley green shawl—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I had had it nearly two years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—we came through the Borough a little after 11 o'clock, and went into a public-house in Blackman-street to have a glass of porter—I saw the prisoner there—I knew him by sight before—we came out and went across the street, and just as we got to the other side I heard somebody running after us, and a voice said, "Young woman, you will lose your scarf if you don't mind"—I turned round, and saw my wife get a box on the side of her head and fall down—I was a few steps in front of her, but almost by her side—he dragged her scarf off, and ran back with it, the same road—I ran after him as quick as I could—the prisoner is the man—I pursued him as far as the corner of the Dover-road, and lost sight of him by the cab-stand, having kept him in sight about half a quarter of a mile—about five nights afterwards I saw him again in Blackman-street, with a returned convict whom I knew very well—he had his back against the public-house window—I passed them and went to see if I could find a policeman, but could not; and just as he saw me turn back again, the other man said something to him, and he ran away—I pursued him, but could not overtake him—I lost him about the Queen's Bench Prison—I afterwards described him to Scammell the policeman—we were both sober; we only had a pint of beer between both of us—I did not see the prisoner again till 1st November, in custody at Stone's End police-station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 177). Soon after new years day last I received a description from Mrs. Duggen of a person, and have been look<lb></lb>ing out for him since then till 1st November—when I took the prisoner about 9 o'clock at night, he was in company with another man in Redcross-street.</p>

               <p>Borough—I went across the road, and asked him what his name was?—he I said, "Anderson"—I asked him where he lived?—he said, "In Tottenham—I court-road"—I said, "You are a long way from home; I have got some knowledge of you, I believe; I want you for something or other, but I cannot call to mind now what it is"—he said, "I am sure you don't know me; you don't want me for anything"—I walked by his side about three quarters of a mile, till we got to Union-street, Borough, and then asked him if he would have the kindness to take off his cap?—he said, "You are taking too much liberty, policeman"—I then took his cap off, and said, "You are Butcher Bill"—I knew that, because he had no hair at the back of his head—I told him I should take him in custody, and whatever answer he made to the charge, I should tell the Magistrate—he said, "Thank you," and went quietly with me to the station—he said, going along, "I do not know anything about that robbery; the person who committed that robbery is still in the Mint"—I had told him that it was for highway robbery—I said, "It is very strange if the person who committed such a daring robbery was still in the Mint, and that you should disappear up to the present night"—he said, "Well, I was in the-public house"—I said, "I mentioned nothing about the public-house"—he said "The prosecutor and prosecutrix were drunk in the public-house, which the potboy can prove"—he went quietly to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi>—I had only been home from Ireland for a week—I had been serving at Clonmel in the militia, which I joined on 5th November, 1857—I was ill with fever, and all my hair came off—I was left behind there in consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How came you to know me by my having no hair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By seeing you when you were previously convicted—you were tried at the police-court about November, 1858, for stealing a pair of boots; and you declined taking off your cap then—I took it off for you, and you then had no hair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Is it reasonable that I should knock a woman down in the street in the presence of her husband? I was in the public-house at the time; a bottle of whiskey was going to be raffled for; they were talking Irish, and I, having been in Ireland, I spoke Irish also. The prosecutrix went outside; she was intoxicated; she had been turned out of one public-house before; she came back afterwards, and said, "Where is my shawl, where is my scarf?" and then she said to me, "Do you know where my scarf is?" I said, "I do not; you had it when you went out." The bar<lb></lb>man said, "There is nobody here who has got your shawl; "her husband came in and took her arm, as she was very tipsy, and he was not much better: two days afterwards, I went to her room in Mint-street, and asked what was the meaning of it; she said, "I will lock you up for my shawl;" she went out to get a policeman; and while she was gone, her husband said, "Now, you go away, or else she will lock you up;" I said, "Why should I be locked up, if I am innocent?" I left his place, and got some work in the West India Docks. The reason I went to her room was, that a man told me I was suspected of stealing it by a young woman who found the prosecutrix drunk. Her husband made me go out over the boards in the back yard, and out at the back door.</p>

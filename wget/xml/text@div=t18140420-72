On the 1st of December, the housekeeper and I went out together, and left no one in the house about three o'clock in the day. I fastened all the shutters and locked the doors. I am sure all the street doors were fastened when I went out. We returned home about half past eight in the evening. I took the key out of my pocket, and went out to unlock the area gate; I found it shut, but unlocked. I went down the area steps to get into the house; the door was bolted inside; at last I got in at the stair window. I then found the closet in the pantry broken open, where I keep my plate; there were five plated candlesticks gone, and one silver table-spoon. I went up stairs into the drawing-room; there were two new hats lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property were they - A. Mr. Jackson's. In the wardrobe, a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of small-clothes were gone. In the next room to the bedroom, a new pair of stockings and a new pair of boots were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the owner of all these things - A. Me and my master what I lost in the pantry; the five candlesticks are master's; the table-spoon and two pair of boots are mine; the tea-caddy and sugar-tongs were mine. My things are worth more than forty shillings, and master's property I am sure is worth more than forty shillings. Master paid for his boots three pounds; they are very stout.</p>

             on Wednesday the 14th of February last. I searched him. I afterwards went to his lodging. He told me himself it was his lodging. I found two pick lock keys. I found none of the articles in this indictment. I afterwards went to the lodging of John Beckett Clements by the order of the magistrate; he lived at 24, North-street, Mary-le-bone. I first apprehended Clark. Clark told me he had these boots of a man of the name of Joseph, who is here as a witness. The next day after I took Clark I apprehended Joseph. Joseph said to the magistrate, if the magistrate would permit him he would disclose the man that did the robbery. Johnson took Joseph to shew us the person that he bought the boots of. We did not take Joseph into the house; we left him outside while we went in to search that place. We searched his lodgings; in a drawer of the prisoners we found forty-two picklock keys, a dark lanthorn, some phosphorus, wax tapers, and an iron crow, in North-street, Mary-le-bone; that is

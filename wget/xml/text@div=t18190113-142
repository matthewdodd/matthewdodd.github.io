On the 29th of December, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I went to shew the house to a gentleman. While he was gone for a light, I went to open the street-door, pulled the key out, and found I could not open it. When the light came I looked into the key-hole, and found there was a key inside. I knocked at the door three or four times very loud - several persons came round. Some of them said there were two persons running across the roof of the house. I went into the next house, got over the wall, and into my own yard - I found the yard-door open. When I got on the back-door landing-place, two men made their escape out of the street-door. I ran to the door, and called out Stop thief! the prisoner was brought back in about two minutes by Woodward and Smith. I went on the roof, and found the lead which covered the top of the door taken off, doubled up, and left on the party-wall. I saw it compared with the place, and am certain it is the lead - they had pulled the nails out, and taken it away. I found a sack on the garret landing-place.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130056"></xptr>The key in the lock was the key of the door; I had left it with Mrs. Johns to show the premises.</p>
               <p>JAMES WOODWARD. I am a tailor, and live in Fitzroy-place. I was going up Buckingham-place, and saw several people standing about the prosecutor's house - the prosecutor was knocking at the door - I looked up to the roof, and saw a person walking in the front gutter. I told the prosecutor, who went through the next house. Presently afterwards, the street-door opened rom within. I saw the prisoner, and Salmon, come out. I pursued and took the prisoner - I never lost sight of him - he ran very fast. I brought him back, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoners were given into my charge. In about a minute Salmon came to the watch-house door; I secured him, and found a pair of pincers on him - I also found a pen-knife and a pack of cards on the prisoner. I went to the house, found the nails had been drawn out, and the lead entirely moved away - it fitted exactly, and weighed 17 lbs. There had been an attempt to take more.</p>

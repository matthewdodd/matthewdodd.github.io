On Monday, the 7th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock, in the morning, I sold some meat to a lady, for which she paid me a sovereign. I put it in my till, the prisoner was in the shop at the time, my attention was called outside the shop to a customer, of whom I took a few half-pence, and on returning inside the shop, I put the half-pence in the till, and missed the sovereign; the prisoner being near the till, when I entered, I charged her with taking it, she denied it - I sent for an officer, and in about an hour she was taken to the watch-house, and searched, the sovereign was not found on her; the officer went home with her, and charged her with swallowing it, and caught her attempting to do it, the watch-house is next door to my house.</p>

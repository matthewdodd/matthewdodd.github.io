            .</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Clapham. My husband lives in Yorkshire, if he is alive.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear from him?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I have not heard from him this three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to think he is dead?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he on a journey there?</p>
               <p>Clapham. No, he is settled there.</p>
               <p>Q. In what business?</p>
               <p>Clapham. He keeps a farm there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you live with him?</p>
               <p>Clapham. No, we are parted.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been parted?</p>
               <p>Clapham. We have been parted five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I live in Holborn, by the bars.</p>
               <p>Q. What things have you lost ?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I lost as many things as come to about 3 l.</p>

               <p>Q. Name them?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I lost a shift that I bought at an old cloaths shop</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I had wore it a little, it cost me 5 s. I never had it on above three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you lose ?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I lost a pair of stuff shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them?</p>
               <p>Clapham. They were worth about 9 d. I wore them in a morning before I put on my better things; I lost also a swivel and a brush.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Clapham. They were not in my possession, because I was in Wood-street compter, at the time they were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your employment?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I was bar-keeper to Mr Hall, and when I was in the compter, the woman at the bar and a man, were put into the house instead of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hall put you in the compter?</p>
               <p>Clapham. No, he did not, but it was thro' him that I was put there.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain that?</p>
               <p>Clapham. They called me Mr. Hall's wife, and they took me instead of him; his house was indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Clapham. For a disorderly house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again?</p>
               <p>Clapham. Yes, I did, the prisoner had my shift and shoes on, and my swivel hanging by her side with three or four keys on it?</p>
               <p>Q. What pretence had Hall to put them into the house?</p>
               <p>Clapham. The house was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for Hall's wife?</p>
               <p>Clapham. People used to call me Hall, and I could not tell every body what my real name was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever advise Mr. Hall to remove his goods?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130049"></xptr>Q. Did you advise him to employ Bottle and his wife in so doing?</p>
               <p>Clapham. I really can't say.</p>

               <p>ROBERT WESTON. I live at Shipnell in Shropshire. I came to London on the 12th of December 1809.</p>
               <p>Q. What stay did you make. - A. Near a fortnight. On the evening I came to town I applied at the <placeName id="t18100411-54-crimeloc298">old Hummums Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Q. What part of the house had you apartments - A. In one of the first rooms on the first floor</p>
               <p>Q. Of course your trunk or portmanteau was there - A. Yes. On Monday night, January the 8th, returning to my lodgings, I was as usual lighted up into my room by the chamberlain; I immediately missed my trunk, I had left it on a hair in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not left your door locked I suppose - A. I had not; I had a coat and a pair of pantaloons hanging over the same chair that the trunk stood on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see any part of your property that you had lost - A. Yes, I did it might be the second day after this happened; this happened before I left town; I was upon the eve of leaving London, and after I had left I received notice from the Hummums that my watch had been stopped at a pawnbroker at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left your watch hanging up - A. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110038"></xptr>in my trunk, it was a silver hunting watch, my trunk was locked and I had the key in my pocket, my watch was out of repair I brought it up with me, my intention was to have it put in repair.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that watch - A. It cost me eight guineas and a half at Wigg and Moss's, Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had possession of your watch when you saw it again - A. I saw it at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you knew it - A. I knew it because I had been to the watch-makers to get the number, and it corresponded with the number; the watch is here, I have it in my possession. There was a coat and a pair of pantaloons were brought to Bow-street, I was confident they were mine; I could not swear to them, the buttons had been taken off, and coloured buttons put on, and having no private mark I could not swear to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him walk off. - A. I did not, I saw no more of him that night.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again. -

            . I live at 123, Swallow-street: I am a salesman, on the 10th of January, about four o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop with a coat and a pair of pantaloons, they were tied up in a handkerchief, and the watch he took out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before this time. - A. Oh yes, perfectly; he asked me five pound for the coat, pantaloons, and the watch altogether; first of all he said he wanted to sell the coat and the pantaloons, then he said I want a little money, I think I shall sell the watch, I do not fancy it. I gave him four pound for them all.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked him no questions about them - A. No, because I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him his name, or did you know it. - A. I did not ask him his name; it is not usual to ask a persons name that buy cloaths of us, it might affront them, I never asked him his name. He shewed me the duplicate of a watch pawned for two guineas and a half; he said, he liked that better then that one, and that was the reason that he was going to part with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that watch after you bought it. - A. I just happened to want a little cash a day or two afterwards; I went into Mr. Dobree's shop that I knew I am in the habit of pledging things when I want money, he shewed me a bill that it had been stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to pledge it then. - A. Exactly so, I told him that I had bought it with a coat and a pair of pantaloons; I was taken to Bow-street, and the next day I was liberated. I described the prisoner at Bow-street; I had dealings with him before in selling him clothes, but never bought of him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up. - A. About a fortnight after, that I believe; the officer came and let me know that they had a man of the description I had given of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch. - A. The magistrate made me give it over to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was apprehended in about a fortnight, you had notice given you from the office, you went there. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner is the man from whom you had the watch in the way you have described. - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other articles, the coat and pantaloons. - A. The other articles I had given me back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you altered them. - A. They were not altered by me, I only beat and brushed them and smoothed them with an iron, that is all I did.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street; from information, I went to the Dolphin public-house in the Haymarket, there I apprehended the prisoner in February, he lodged there; I searched him and found nothing upon him; I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Have you got that watch. - A. Yes, this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it. - A. Between five and six years.</p>
               <p>Q. The maker told you what number it was, independant of that did you know the watch. - A. Yes, independant of that I could swear to the watch, it cost me eight guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there a great many other things in the trunk. A. Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The watch that I sold to Myers in Swallow-street, I had it of captain Graham, of St. James's coffee house, and the pantaloons and the great coat belonged to him, they were his old ones that were thrown off; the watch I had in my possession a twelvemonth or better; I was short of money, I went and sold them; the watch I sold him was not a hunting watch. I asked him five pound for the coat, pantaloons, and the watch, he bid me three guineas; I said I would not take it; he afterwards said he would give me four pound; I took the money and left the watch, coat, and pantaloons; it was better than two months before I heard of this; I dressed my master and went to the Talbot Inn to dine, dinner was there always ready at two o'clock. After dinner was over the officers came in, I went to Bow-street with them, they said they had a detainer against me; I went before the magistrate, Myers without looking at me swore I sold the watch to him, and the person at the Hummums swore he saw me in the house; the magistrate asked if the gentleman was in town, this man said he was not, I was detained till Saturday, on Saturday I saw the gentleman, he swore the watch was his; I was turned over at the next sessions and remained till now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 51). On Wednesday night, 3rd Oct., I was on duty at Fulham-fields, and about a quarter past 8 o'clock saw Chandler picking some onions up in a market gardener's ground—I concealed myself in a dark place, and watched him—he came up through the gate out of the field, and when he came about five or six yards off the gate, I stopped him, and found about a peck of onions in his possession—he was carrying them in a sort of smock frock which he wore—I said, "What have you got here?" he let them drop, and I took him into custody, and told him it was for stealing onions—he was pretty quiet, and walked with me—I asked a man named Carter, who was coming along, to pick the onions up, and gave him a handkerchief to put them in—when we got to the Britannia public house, a quarter of a mile further on the Fulham-road, a man named Ward asked Chandler to have some beer—I said that I could not allow him to have any, while he was in my custody—six or eight men then came out of the public house and said, "Give it to him! give it to the b—y b—r? kill the b—r!"—Chandler then commenced kicking and striking, endeavouring to trip me up—I <hi rend="italic">hauled</hi> him to the ground, and as I did so he hit me on my knuckles—a man, not in custody, drew my staff from my pocket and struck me on the arm—a man who was looking on came between me and the man who had the staff, and knocked it out of his hand as he was coming to hit me on the head with it—his name is James Knight—Chandler was on the ground at that time—he had been drinking, but I should consider him sober—I lifted him up, and he commenced kicking and striking more furiously than he did on the first occasion, and I threw him down again, and he bit my left thumb, and then my right hand—it was a very severe bite, I have not got the use of my thumb properly yet—at this time, Mack stepped off the kerb stone and struck me on my face, which cut my lip very severely, and he hit me several times, and kicked me on the side as I was stooping to hold Chandler down—the man with the onions was then some little distance off, and I saw Mack make towards him with another man who had knocked the staff out of my hand, and he said, "Where is the b—y b—r with the box?"—(that was not the man</p>

               <p>who had had the onions previously)—Mack then came up and kicked me a severe blow on the cheek, so that I could not see for three nights and two days, and the sight is very thick now if I allow the light to fall on it—it did not make me unconscious—after that I was kicked several times about the body, but cannot say by whom—assistance came, and I helped to convey Chandler part of the way to the station house, till we got more assistance—I have not been able to attend to my duty, and have been under medical treatment ever since—I still suffer severely in the back and side.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw a tall man strike a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and when be struck him he left the crowd, and went across the field—Chandler was then on the ground, and the policeman over him—the man with the can was in the crowd, and Mack was standing by—I stayed in the crowd a few minutes after the tall man went, and I saw another man strike him after that, and kick him, and then I followed, and the first man that I overtook was the tall man—I followed the second man, and overtook the tall man—I left the police constable and Chandler and Mack; with the crowd.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Britannia on this evening, and saw Chandler and the constable struggling—Mack came up afterwards, but before he came up I saw a man draw the staff from Still's pocket and strike him on the arm with it, and another person gave him three violent blows on the face with his clenched fist, and kicked him also—that was before Mack came up—he was a tall dark man—I was as close to the constable as I could get, without interfering—no other blows were struck by any other person, before Mack came up—Mack came close to me, I did not see him till he got to me—I was close to the crowd as they stood round the con<lb></lb>stable—I waited till the whole affair was over—I also saw a short man come up, and kick Still—I saw the end of the struggle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the whole time you were there, did Mack touch the constable in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a gentleman stood by with a parcel, he had a can on his back, and a handkerchief in his hand—he was stooping down, putting down a bundle down by the side of the constable, and I saw Mack make a strike at him, but he missed him and struck the constable, though not wilfully that I know of—he struck no other blow, there was a crowd at that time which were taking part against the constable—Mack struck no other blow—I heard no expression about a fair fight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you the Ward who brought out some beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had reason to believe that Chandler was in custody—I brought out the beer to him but did not take it to him, as the constable told me that he should not have any—I did not inquire what he was in custody for.</p>

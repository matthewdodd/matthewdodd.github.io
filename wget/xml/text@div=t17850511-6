               <p>Court. How soon after was it you saw it at Tonks's? - I followed him up.</p>
               <p>Did he know you was present when it was taken? - Yes, he took it before me, and he laid it down in my presence; Mrs. Tonks was not at home; Mrs. Tonks desired me to bring it away four or five days before, but I would not; she said that the servant had promised to give it her.</p>
               <p>What capacity was you in at that time? - My master brought me a letter to go to St. Thomas's Hospital, and, as I was out of place, I was at Tonks's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Councel. Pray, this prisoner made a charge against you formerly, did he not? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Was not there an advertisement against you in the public papers for a robbery? - I do not know that there was.</p>

               <p>Then do not you look upon yourself a great deal worse than him? - I cannot say I am in the right of it; I told Mrs. Tonks many a time, that I would tell.</p>
               <p>What was you charged with taking? - A great many things.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is not a competent question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Did not you give up some of these things that were charged with being stolen?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must stop this.</p>

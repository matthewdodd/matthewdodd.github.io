I was in Dean-street, talking to a person, and heard Younger call out; the prisoner was running, and I pursued him, a man put his leg out, and he fell over it. I saw him throw the watch out of his hand against the area-window - I secured him; he was taken to the watch-house. A woman, who was in the kitchen, took the watch to the watch-house; I saw her pick it up. He broke a window as he threw it, and it cut his hand.</p>

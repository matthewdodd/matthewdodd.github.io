                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, he is a cigar maker, at 28, Bridgewater Gardens—we have been married about twenty-three years—on Monday, 20th June, I got up about 8.30, and my husband just before 9—he lit the fire and made the breakfast, but neither of us had any—after I got the children to school I finished dressing myself—my husband stopped by the fireplace, and I asked him if he was going into the Park, in the afternoon, with my little girl—he said "The flowers will last a long while yet"—I had no more conversation after that time—I turned to pull the blind up, and received a blow on the side of my head—before that he said he was going to work on the morrow—I thought it was a stranger in the</p>

               <p>room, I did not think it was my husband—I turned round to try and get the stick from him—I screamed, and after that I had two more blows—he laid me on the ground, put a pillow under my head, and stabbed me on my throat and on my face, with a penknife—this is the stick and this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he has had them for years—it was after he stabbed me that he put the pillow under my head—he then went straight across to the fireplace, took a razor from a bird cage in the cupboard, and cut his own throat—he had locked the door—I heard footsteps coming up stairs, and when the knocking was at the door he told them they could come in now—I had called out when he first hit me, or it would never have been known—a policeman came in.</p>

Q.</hi> Up to and before 20th June were you in the habit of getting drunk from day to day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have never pawned things in my life, only for food—my husband had been out of work about seven months and a week—he fell out of work about a fortnight in October—he had another fortnight's work before Christmas, and nothing since—I had five children all down with the fever at that time, and I lost one in October—I never saw anything wrong in his mind, he had nothing to cause it—the loss of the child, and the illness in the house, did not prey upon his mind more than on mine—I was laid on a sick bed three weeks, and not able to go down stairs—this was in November, and I fell bad afterwards through waiting on them—I suppose my husband felt it as any other father would, but he had no cause to be put out by it—we never quarrelled.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 167). I was called by a woman living next door, and went to 28, Bridgewater Gardens, I heard a scuffling in the first flour front room, I tried to open the door and found it locked—I said "Open this door"—I received no answer—I said "If you do not open this door I shall burst it open"—I received no answer, forced the lock of the door, and found the prosecutrix lying on the floor, and the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing up behind the door with a razor in his left hand, cutting his throat on the right side, he then changed the razor from his left to his right hand—I siezed him and put him down on the floor; he said "I know you very well, if you will let me alone and let me do it, I won't hurt you'—I still held him, he became very violent, got his right hand at liberty and inflicted a light wound on the left side of his throat with the razor—he then made a second attempt to cut his throat, which I prevented by securing his hand—I then culled out for assistance and a young man came up stairs; I sent him off immediately to fetch Dr. Mason, who sent his assistant—the prisoner then said again "I know you very well, if you will let me alone and let me do it, I will not hurt you"—I got hold of the razor, and asked him to let me have it, he said "I will not, I am determined to do it"—I drew the razor through his hand, which cut four fingers to the bone—a woman came into the room, and he said "Mrs. Jonah, this is all through you"—she is not the landlady—she went away and he repeated it a second time, and said to his</p>

               <p>wife, who was still on the ground, "I have warned you of this before, as you have been preparing your things to go and leave me; she has driven me to it, to cut her throat and then my own"—she was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and then I came back and took the prisoner on a stretcher to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—he was very week from loss of blood—the room was in a very clean and tidy state—there was nothing peculiar in the prisoner's manner, he seemed very calm; I have known him some time, that is why he made those remarks; I have also known his wife three years—I have not noticed anything in his manner to lead me to conclude that he is of unsound mind.</p>

I was house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on 20th June, Mrs. Duke was brought there, in a semi-uncon<lb></lb>scious state, and I found a wound on the left side of her throat and also a trifling scratch—the wound was in a very dangerous position, penetrating the gullet, it could be inflicted with a penknife; she also had a cut on the top of her head, on her eyebrow, and on her right temple, and a slight cut on her right forefinger—she was, I think, perfectly sober—she remained there till 15th July, and is now in a sound way to recovery, but rather weak—the prisoner was brought in a short time after her, and I found a wound on the right side of his throat, about 4 inches long, and half an inch <hi rend="italic">deep</hi>, and a slight incision on the left side of his throat; he was quite uncon<lb></lb>scious, and for a considerable time his life was in jeopardy; he did not appear to have been drinking.</p>

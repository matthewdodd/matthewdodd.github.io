                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. John Alexander Hankey, of Roe<lb></lb>hampton, in the parish of Putney; I reside with my family in the gar<lb></lb>dener's house, on Mr. Hankey'a premises; it is my dwelling-house. On Sunday morning, 20th Oct., about a quarter to eleven o'clock, I and my family left the Cottage, and went to Church—I locked up the house, and left no one in it—I returned from Church about a quarter to one—I put the key in the lock, but before I unlocked the door I discovered something the matter with the wash-house window—a stone bottle which I placed there the day before, instead of being on the ledge as I had left it, was standing on the ground—the casement had been forced out by some instru<lb></lb>ment, and was set down inside—I afterwards found a spud lying in the sitting-room with which it might have been done—to the best of my belief that spud had been in the cow-house where the tools are kept, sixty or seventy yards from the cottage, when I went to Church—the prisoner had formerly been under me as gardener in the service of Mr. Poulett Thomp<lb></lb>son, the proprietor of the premises, and would have an opportunity of knowing that the tools were kept there—when I got into the house, I found it in confusion, and things strewed about—I missed a watch, a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, a gold 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece, a rupee, a seal, two purses, some small silver and copper money, some handkerchiefs, a case of razors, and other things—in the spring of this year I had had some conversation with the prisoner about this rupee—he had lately returned from India, and I showed it to him, and asked him about Indian money—the value of the property I lost is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece, and this rupee is similar to the one I lost—mine was of the present reign—this is all the property I have found—I had been in the habit of seeing the prisoner up to Sept., but I have not seen him since—I believe he was employed on the railway—I cannot be certain whether I ever showed him the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece—when I showed him the rupee, I took it from my desk in the sitting-room, and the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece was there also, and they were taken from that desk on this occasion.</p>

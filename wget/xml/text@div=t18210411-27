            . I am fourteen years old, and live in Brewhouse-yard, Shoe-lane, with my father, who is an upholsterer. I have known the prisoner about three months; in February last, I saw him in Fetter-lane, he asked me to pawn a set of fire-irons for him - he had them with him; he did not direct me to any particular pawnbroker's, I took them to Flemming's in Fleet-market, and pawned them in my own name for 5 s., and took him the money - he gave me 3 d. for my trouble. I found him still in Fetter-lane, at the corner of Greystoke-place, where I left him - I had known him about a month before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is your employment. - A. I had no employ, I was charged with this, and put in prison. I now live with Mr. Burton - I never left him. I knew the prisoner lived with Mr. Denham, but did not know that he stole them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you did not know what you were about. - A. I knew I was pawning fire-irons - I did not know I was doing wrong. I know a boy named Spires, he was taken to gaol also.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get out of custody, - A. I was bound over to appear against the prisoner - I was imprisoned about four days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you suppose he came honestly by them. - A. I did not suppose any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. - Q. Where did you first become acquainted with him. - A. In Fetter-lane; there was a boy named Winston, who the prisoner knew, and he was acquainted with Spires - I have seen them together in Shoe-lane.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Denham, who lives at 102, Fetter-lane. I believe the irons to be the prosecutor's, there is no mark on them, but the paper has our<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110015"></xptr>private mark on it, in the hand-writing of Mr. Wiltshire, who was formerly in the employ of Mr. Carter, whom Mr. Denham succeeded in business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was shopman when Mr. Carter had the business. - A. Yes, he was never in partnership with Denham. I know the paper was once in the possession of Mr. Denham, or Mr. Carter, and was used to wrap irons in; if they have good paper round them, we probably send them out in it when we sell them, we perhaps sell fifty pair in a year - they may have been sold, I did not miss any, I cannot say what number the stock consists of. I never saw Smith in the shop - the shop joins Greystoke-place.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. Q. Have the irons been used at all. - A. They are quite new. The prisoner was in Mr. Denham's employ for about three months as errand boy, since Christmas, he had access to the stock - we have five servants.</p>

            . Mr. Denham succeeded me in the business, on the 19th of October, and took the whole of the stock. I believe I have seen these fire irons before, and there is a private mark on the paper, which I can swear to, it is the hand-writing of a former shopman of mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You only swear to the paper. - A. No, the irons are quite new; they may have been two or three years in the shop for what I know. I should think they must have been two years, as they are not modern.</p>

            . I am ward beadle. On the 15th of March, I was fetched, and took the prisoner in custody. He was called into his master's room, and charged with dishonesty, which he denied for a long time; I left the room with a friend of the prosecutor's to consult about it, the prosecutor then said he had confessed it - I heard no confession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. - Q. Why were you sent out of the room. - A. I was not sent out, I went out to consult about it, as the prisoner denied it. Mr. Denham told me, in the prisoner's hearing, that he had confessed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor tell you he was desirous of getting a confession, as he had no other means, not being able to swear to them - A. He said no such thing - he said he did not know he was robbed till he was told of it - the prisoner did not deny having confessed it.</p>

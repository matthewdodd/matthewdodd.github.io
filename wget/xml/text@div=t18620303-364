Barclay, tanners, of 13, Richardson-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey—I know the premises of a man named Boston, at the back of Mr. Barclay's; the premises join each other—I first saw the prisoner at Boston's house in the middle of last summer, but had no conversation with him then—I saw him again at his own house, and took him some skins which I stole from Mr. Barclay—I did not get any money for them, from the prisoner, the first time—he said that I might bring as many as I liked, and the next time I came he would settle with me, and would give me two shillings to half-a-crown a skin—he is a shoemaker, and lives at 2, Parker-street, Drury-lane—I took him skins at other times,</p>

               <p>sometimes two, sometimes three, and sometimes four, from sixteen to eighteen in all; and there were two to be off for a pair of boots, which made it eighteen or twenty—all those skins were obtained in the same way as the first—I have also delivered them to his apprentice—he said that be was going into the country, and there would be some one at home to receive them.</p>

Askew spoke to me at the station-house, and, in consequenoe of what he said, I took a cab and went with him to Parker-street, Drury-lane, where he pointed out the prisoner's house—the prisoner was not there, and I afterwards found him at a public-house in the same street—I told him we had got a youth, named Askew, in cutody for stealing skins from Mr. Barclay, who said that he had received a quantity of them, and asked him if he had any objection to my searching his house—he said he had not—I went to his house, and he said, "I will show you my cutting-room, and where I keep my leather"—I went up into the cutting-room and searched it, but found no skins there at all—I said, "Askew tells me I shall find those skins which he sold you last Saturday night in the middle room; which is your middle room?"—he said, "This if the middle room, but you will not find anything here"—I said, "Where is the key?"—he said, "My wife has it, and she is out—I said, "Well, I must have it, and search it"—after the lapse of five minutes he found the key in the bottom room, and I went into the room, and on a shelf I found five skins and a piece, which I produce—I said, "Where did you get there from?"—he said, "I bought them from the stout Mr. Barclay"—I told him I should take him in custody for receiving them, knowing them to be stolen—he said, "Very well, you will find that to be correct; that I bought them of Mr. Barclay, the stout one"—I waited about ten minutes in the bottom room for my brother constable to come, and during that time Boston's daughter came and said that she wanted to convey a message to Mr. Robin<lb></lb>son; but when she saw me she went away and did not say anything.</p>

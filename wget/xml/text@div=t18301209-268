               <p>SARAH ATKINS. I am not sure whether the shirt had been up stairs or down, but it was in my house. and in my possession; I think it was where the prisoner could have access to it - the duplicate produced to me by Mr Hunter enabled me to get the waistcoat out of pawn; the prisoner went with me.</p>

When I left Mr. Atkins' house, he said he was very sorry, and he would not say any thing about the business, provided I conducted myself better - I went to his house on the Wednesday following, to see how much I owed him, and if I could raise the money to pay him - he never offered to take me then; I went on the Saturday night, and he said there was a letter at his house for me, and if I would go all should be right - when I went the letter had no money in it, as I expected, and he gave charge of me.</p>

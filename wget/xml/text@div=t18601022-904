                  </hi>. I reside at Battersea, and am manager and foreman to Thomas Dives, a miller—his mill is situated in Church-road, Battersea; it abuts on the river Thames near Battersea church—the mill is separated from the churchyard by a malt-house, belonging to Messrs. Watley's—I last saw the premises safe about half-past 8 o'clock on the Saturday night—I think it was 1st September—I secured the doors myself—I was called up the next morning about 5 o'clock—I found the door broken, and the premises had been entered by breaking the padlock and undoing the bolt—there was a lock and bar to the door; they broke the counting-house open, and then came to the drawers—the counting-house desk was not locked, because there was nothing but halfpence in it—I missed from it twopence and a counterfeit half-crown that had been there for years; some receipt stamps, and inland revenue stamps—my attention was brought to the water-butt on the same morning—the carter came to the stable and found there a <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>, and diffe<lb></lb>rent things in the trough, and I went to it and took them out—I found the <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>, a kind of a small handspike, a boring bit, and a kind of life preserver, or whip with a large handle to it—I took them to the police-station—Sergeant Payne has them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>; this is the centre-bit, and this is the life preserver, or the handle of a whip it looks like—I had not seen these things on the premises before.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220138"></xptr>
               <p>on Sunday morning, 2d September—about half-past 1 o'clock in the morning, as I was "walking along Church-road, I saw four men—I see three of them now, Mahoney, Barton, and Hayward—they went in the direction of Battersea Old Church—I followed them, I should think about 100 yards, till I lost sight of them about the end of the church wall—they went down towards the dock which runs alongside the lower end of the church-yard—I went back to Phoenix Wharf, where I had a view of the river—I there saw five men in a boat—I believe that is the boat which I have since ascertained to be the Metropolis—they were just coming gently up towards the wall; not rowing—they had no oars or sculls in their hands, but were coming gently up towards the land—I went and met Sergeant Payne—I returned with him—when he and I got to the Phoenix Wharf we saw the five men close under the wall of Mr. Dives' mill, in the boat—there were seven or eight barges near the wharf, but not lying close up to the pre<lb></lb>mises—there was an open space between the barges and the wall, enough for a boat to go in between—Sergeant Payne then left me a little while to procure further assistance—while he was gone I kept watching the pro<lb></lb>ceedings—before he left me, four men out of the five got out of the boat on to the landing-place of the wharf, and went to a door at the rear of the mill—they stopped there a second or so, and I heard a slight noise-directly afterwards, the four entered the mill; the fifth remained in the boat—I supposed they entered through a door; it was in a line with me, and upon subsequent examination I found that it was a door into the mill—these four men remained in the mill, I should say, about five minutes; it may be a minute or two more, I will not say exactly—I observed the boat during the whole time they were in—the fifth man did not remain in the boat all the time they were in—one of the four came out again and assisted him in getting on to the landing, and he went in—after they had been in the mill some little time, the five men came out again, and stood on the landing-place outside the mill—two out of the five got into the boat, one was Barton, I cannot say who the other was—after those two had been in the boat a minute or two, Sergeant Payne came up in the boat, and directly got on to the barge, and called out to me by name "Stirling"—I said, "I am here"—and I called to the other two constables who had arrived, Baker and Gennery—the two men, of whom I said Barton was one, were in a situation where they could see the approach of Payne in the boat-directly Sergeant Payne sang out to me, they began to run away—Barton got on to the barge and made for Bridge's coal wharf, adjoining Mr. Dives' flour mill—I immediately followed after him up the wharf, and apprehended him on a heap of coals about half way up the yard—on seeing me he said, "For God's sake don't hit me; be a man; I will go quiet"—I said, "It is all I want of you if you will do so"—I had my staff out—I called out to a constable in the front of the house, to look out—I opened the front gates of Bridge's wharf and went out into the main road—Gennery assisted in taking him down the road to the old church—we remained there some few minutes till Sergeant Payne came ashore from the boat with the prisoner Hayward—Sergeant Payne and I held the two prisoners some few minute, and directed Baker and Gennery to go in search of the other prisoners—I did not see anything of the other prisoners at the time I had Barton in custody, and was taking him out of Bridge's yard—it was afterwards that I saw them, while I was standing against the old church, with Barton and Hayward in custody—while standing there with them, I saw Mahoney come from the church wall on to the shore—he ran across the drawing dock</p>

               <p>where they land goods; and just as ha got to the corner of Mr. Lintill's, the Swan public-house, he fell down by the water—he got up again and went to the rear of Mr. Lintill's premises and there I lost sight of him—I called Sergeant Payne's attention to that—I saw him again shortly afterwards in the custody of Sergeant Payne and Gennery—upon looking about at the spot where I seized Barton, I found a life preserver on the coals—Sergeant Payne has it—the same morning I searched the church-yard from which I saw Mahoney coming, and found this life preserver, and this other I found in Mr. Bridge's coal wharf—when I saw Mahoney come from the church-yard he was sitting on the wall; he jumped forward from the wall—I observed, when he was in custody afterwards, that he had a cut on the head—I examined it when we got to the station—it was a splendid night—the moon shone bright as any day.</p>

On Sunday, 2d September, about 2 o'clock, or a few minutes after, I saw Stirling at Phoenix-wharf—there was a boat there named the Metropolis, containing five men—they were rowing towards the back of Mr. Dives' mill, towards the head of some barges—it ultimately drew up between the barges and the wall—the man that was rowing stood up, and took hold of the chain fastening the barges to the shore—that was the prisoner Cecil—I saw Barton get out of the boat and ascend the bank towards the mill-door—he had something in his hand about two-feet long, which appeared like a stick—the others got out, one after the other—Mahoney and Hayward were two of them—I told Stirling to remain there till he saw me or heard from me again—I went away for assistance, and brought back a waterman named Coates in a boat—he rowed very fast, but very quietly, with his back towards the spot—I laid down in the boat, so that I should not be observed—I saw two men standing against the door—I could not say who they were, but Cecil was standing in the boat as when I left him before—I had a double opportunity of seeing his face, for the moon was shining brightly on it, and I turned my bull's-eye on him, not particularly to see him, but to look at the back of the mill—I saw him, at the same time I called out, "Look out, Stirling," because at that moment Barton ran in that direction—Sterling called out, "I am here"—I drove Cecil across the barges into the water—he went under the water, and I never saw anything more of him at that time—at that moment I heard Baker's voice from Mr. Dives' lawn calling out, "Look out, sergeant, here are two swimming in the water"—I called Coates, got into the boat, and said, "Row me to Mr. Watman's wall," that was in the direction of the voice—the tide was running so very fast, that I knew the men would not swim much against it—there are a number of piles which they might bring fast to, under the wall, and I saw Hayward hanging there, with part of his head above the post, dripping with water—he said, "For God's sake do not hurt us, sergeant, I am very nearly drowned"—in endeavouring to get him off the post the boat very nearly capsized, and I tumbled into the water with him—about six or ten minutes after, I landed again and saw Sterling standing in the churchyard with Barton in custody, but I was not in the churchyard—I heard somebody call out terrifically, at the back of the church as if they were being knocked about, and one of the prisoners, I believe Hayward, said, "What a b—shame to knock a man about like that," judging that it was a policeman knocking the prisoners about—I saw Dunnaway coming, and said, "Go and see what is the matter, Dunnaway" he jumped over the wall—about a minute or more afterwards I saw Mahoney running across the churchyard, and heard some voice say, "Come on"—I cannot say who it proceeded from—I saw Mahoney jump out of the churchyard into, the dock—I saw the constable Baker come out of the churchyard, bleeding very much from the head—his trousers were covered with blood—it was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that, that I took Mahoney—I could not leave my prisoners, and he had disappeared for five or six minutes—I called to Coates, and went to the back of the premises</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220141"></xptr>
               <p>and apprehended Mahoney in the coal-hole—after I had taken the prisoners to the station I examined Mr. Dives premises—the door was then shut, but the lock was lying down in the passage—I found one lucifer match before I went into the counting-house—the counting-house door was standing open.</p>

I live at Wharf Cottages, Battersea—On Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, 2d September last, I was called up by Sergeant Payne, about two o'clock, and rowed him in my boat towards Mr. Dives' mill—when we got to the mill I saw another boat, which I have since ascertained to be called the "Metropolis"—there was one man in it—it was under the mill when I and Sergeant Payne rowed up in my boat—I cannot recognise the man that was in the boat—there was one man on the wharf—Sergeant Payne got out for a moment from my boat, and then I afterwards rowed him towards Watley's wharf—I there saw Hayward—the sergeant himself fell into the water—I afterwards rowed the sergeant and another constable to the back of the Swan, in my boat—they took a man in custody there and brought him into my boat—I cannot say exactly who that was—I found a hat in the bottom of the "Metropolis"—I gave it to Inspector Lovely.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, 391 V</hi>). On Sunday, 2d September, I heard screams from the direction of the churchyard—I went in the direction of the screams—about 2 o'clook in the morning I was on duty in Bridge-road, Battersea, and saw Sergeant Payne running down the Bridge-road—I went to meet him—he told me to get assistance and go to Dives' wharf—I went there—when I got over the palings I saw a man in a boat close to the barges—I took Baker with me—I said to him, "We are in the wrong; we must go back to the wharf"—we went to the wharf and there I saw Stirling on the look out—he said, "They are inside, at work"—after waiting a few minutes Stirling said, "Look out at the front"—I passed the word to Baker</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220142"></xptr>
               <p>and he went out at the front—presently I heard a loud whistle in the ground in front of the mill, and some one called out, "Look out"—I heard some one running towards the wall in the Church-road, and as if some one was jumping down—I then heard a noise in the direction of the Phoenix wharf, and saw Stirling bring out the prisoner Barton—Baker came up to him and said, "Is that you?" and went in the direction of the churchyard—I waited a few minutes, till Sergeant Payne came with Hayward—I was going in the direction of Dives' mill afterwards, and then I heard a load scream—I leaped over the churchyard wall, and then saw Mahoney run from Baker—I went up to Baker—he said, "Make haste, he has run round the back of the church"—I ran round the front, thinking I should meet him, but he ran under the darkness of the wall, and I could not see him just at that minute—some one outside the churchyard palings said, "Go it, Gennery, you must have him!"—the prisoner Mahoney, who was on the churchyard wall, then turned round and said, "Yes, come on!"—I was present when he was apprehended—I then jumped over the wall again, and got on to the road, and went in search of him—I went round to Dives' mill, got into the boat Coates was in, and went in the direction of the Old Swan-going along, Sergeant Payne said, "Let me come with you," and he came into the boat—we got out of the boat—I saw where some water had dropped, and followed up the track—it appeared as if some one had got over the wall—Sergeant Payne got over the wall first, and I got on the wall with him—we there found the prisoner Mahoney in a dust-hole or coal<lb></lb>hole—he was there secured—when we were in the reserve room at the station, Mahoney said that, if he knew what I was going to do, he would have broken my b—y neck, coming down the wall—when I first saw him, he was, I should think, four or half a dozen yards from Baker.</p>

I am an engine-fitter and mechanic of 45, Dale-street, Bristol—I know Cecil—that is him, the second one—I last saw him about 7th September—I also saw him on 1st September, Bristol fair day—I am quite certain it was the first—he mentioned seeing a lot of horses, to me, when he came in, and I told Kim that it was the fair day—I had never seen him before—he did not come to see me, but I was lodging in the house where he came, Mr. Curtis'—that is how I became acquainted with him—I saw him on the next day, Sunday.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you in business for yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but not very large—I take in plating for shoemakers—Mr. Curtis keeps a private house—Cecil did not come and take the same lodging—he knew a woman, Mrs. Rouse, who lived there, and rented apartments, and I was asked to go</p>

               <p>and get this lodging—she is here—she came up with me from Bristol; but I came up on Monday evening, and she came up on Tuesday—Mr. Fussell came up with me on the Monday evening, and the young woman on the Tuesday morning—if anybody tells you that we both came up on Tuesday morning, I should contradict them, and if anybody says that the female came up with both of us, all in the same compartment on Tuesday morning, I should contradict that—I live regularly at Mrs. Curtis'—I took Cecil to Mr. Fussell's and saw him two or three times of an evening, after working hours, during the first part of the week—I never stayed there a night—I did not go to see him at Mr. Fussell's—he called at my place, Mrs. Curtis'—Mrs. Curtis is not here—Cecil stayed at Mr. Fussell's nearly the whole of the week—the last time I saw him was on Friday evening—I do not know what his business was—I did not even know his name, nor did he know mine—Cecil came to see Mrs. Rouse—she is a tailoress, and her husband is a soldier in India—I am no relation to him—I called at Mr. Fussell's once only between Saturday and Friday—that was in the evening—I did not go there and dine with him one day—I never was there but once, and that was on Wednesday evening, but I am not positive—I did not call on Monday, about dinner-time, and ask Mr. Fussell where the young man was—I know that he and another young man lodged there—I have never seen the other man since the Friday—I have been into Fussell's house two or three times—he did not know what I was, any more than any other customer going to have a glass of beer—he did not know my name—I heard of Cecil being in trouble, last Friday—I went to Fussell's on the Friday evening, because Mrs. Rouse received a letter—I asked him if he remembered a young man, or two young men that I had brought there to ask for a lodging, and he said he did—I told him that they had got into trouble, and he would be very likely wanted to prove that they were at his house, if he would be kind enough—he said that he did not like leaving his business, but he would do so; and I went and told Mrs. Rouse—nothing further was said than that he had got into trouble—I said nothing to Fussell about when it was—I asked him if he remembered the day they were there, and he said "Yes, perfectly well"—I asked him when it was, and he said something about having some pigs die; that Cecil entered into conversation about it; and he perfectly remembered his coming down on the Saturday before—I cannot say when the pigs died—nothing was said by him or by me as to what the day of the month was—we did not fix it as the Saturday before the pigs died, but I knew when he did come—I never mentioned 1st September to Fussell, but he said it was 1st September—I asked him if he could remember the day, and he said "Yes, it was 1st September," fair day; that was on Friday evening—I did not see him again before Monday evening, when we all came up to town—I only sent for him—I never saw him at all between those days—I cannot say when the 1st September was mentioned; whether it was on Friday evening or Monday evening, on the way to town, or after we got hew—he never asked me if I could recollect the day, and I never asked him if he could remember it—I have not been paid any expenses for coming up here, but I am in hopes of having my expenses paid up and down—I suppose I must look to the wife—I am a working man, and cannot afford it—I paid Mr. Fussell's expenses coming up, and my own—I was a stranger to Mr. Fussell till 1st September—I did not pay for Mrs. Rouse—she came up on Tuesday—on my oath we did not all come up on the Tuesday morning in the same compartment—if Mr. Fussell has sworn that we did, it is not true—if his account his correct, my account would be incorrect.</p>

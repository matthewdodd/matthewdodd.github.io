               <p>ROBERT CREBER. On the 1st of December I was on Blackfriars-bridge, and noticed the prisoner going along the barges, taking coals out, and throwing them down by the side of another barge - another woman was coming up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030050"></xptr>- I saw her several times take some lumps of coals off the barges, and throw them down; she then went and swept them all up into her apron, and wrinsed them - I went and told Mr. Pearson, whose barges they were; he told me to take her - directly I went on the barges, the coal-heavers hallooed out, "Here comes the Police," to give her notice - they then both ran off; I jumped into the mud after them, and took the prisoner - I took the coals from where she had thrown them; it was low water - there was about a peck in that heap, which she had thrown out - I found about a bushel thrown down in another place.</p>

            . Creber shewed me the barge the coals were taken from - it belonged to me and my partner; we are robbed to a great extent by these women.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He never saw me take a bit of coal- he perjures himself very much; I had but a peck, and they were stones which the heavers threw over.</p>

On Monday, the 2nd of May, the prisoners called on me with a pattern of silk—Bonsor asked me if I could dress figured silk after the French fashion—I said I could and had dressed thousand of yards—pat<lb></lb>terns were produced to me—I think Lilley produced some patterns—I think they had been dressed—I asked him if they were not French silks—he said he did not know—I think it was Bonsor produced the pattern of the silk in question—I observed that it was undressed—Bonsor said "If I send you a piece how soon can I have it back—can I have it the next day"—I said, "Perhaps the next evening or the following morning"—after showing me the patterns they both left together—I think I returned the patterns which Lilley showed me to him—the pattern of this silk I returned to Bonsor—I was given to understand a piece would be sent, and it came shortly afterwards, in three pieces—a lengths runs about sixty to seventy or one hundreds yards—this was forty-three yards in three pieces—on open<lb></lb>ing the parcel I found it was the pattern Bonsor had shown me the sample of—this yard and a quarter is the piece which Bonsor brought, and there were two others besides—the three came together packed in a brown paper parcel—I took the smallest piece to Eastman and Co. and left it with Hughes the foreman—I took the other two lengths to the police-office—I have dressed silk for Bonsor before, but never for Lilley—I should say it is not in a stare fir for sale—there is a bar at one end and it is cut in a jagged sort of manner—it is very unusual to find a piece of silk in that jagged stare—I did not notice the ends till I opened the parcel—the piece shown to me has a bar at one end till I opened extraordinary in that piece—nothing except the other end being cut in an untradesman-like manner.</p>

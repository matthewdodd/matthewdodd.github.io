                  </hi>. I am an agent, and reside at 10, Elder-walk, Britannia-fields, Islington—on Saturday morning, 10th May, about 3 o'clock, I was coming from Whitechapel to Shoreditch, having been engaged late on business in Whitechapel—in Commercial-street a young man came up and wished to forward a conversation with me—I gave him to understand that I had nothing to say to him—while he was speaking to me the prisoner came and seized me by the left arm, the other man was on my right—I had both hands in my pockets—the prisoner said, "Now, come on," and a third person then came up and strangled me, and the prisoner and the man on my right rifled my pockets—it was twilight, and I could see them—when they let me go I called out, "Police!"—I lost 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a little pouch containing pawn<lb></lb>broker's duplicates.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, H</hi> 14). On the morning of 10th May I was on duty in Brick-lane, and heard a cry of "Police!" in Commercial-street—I ran there and saw the prisoner and two females walking very sharply towards me—just before I got to them they turned into a court—I then met the prosecutor, and he told me about his being robbed—the prisoner and the others passed while he was telling me—I followed them about fifty yards; one of them ran away—I caught the prisoner, took him back to the prosecutor, and said, "Is this one of the men?"—he said, "Yes, that is the man that had his hand in my left-hand pocket"—I took him to the station—I afterwards went back, and within a yard or two of where I took him, I found this bag, containing these duplicates—the prosecutor claimed them and the bag.</p>

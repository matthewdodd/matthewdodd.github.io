                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Howsden, brushmaker, in Holles-street, Marylebone. About two months ago the prisoner came to our shop—he said he was come for a set of blacking-brushes for Mr. Leslie (who is Lord Harewood's brother or son, and lives opposite to us)—I said I thought he had made a mistake, as we did not serve the family, and he went away—on the 8th of Aug. he came again, and said he had brought an order from the valet of Mr. Leslie for a set of blacking-brushes, and a clothes-brush—I let him have them—he said the valet would call the next day and pay for them—he mentioned about his having come before for brushes, and said, "This time I have brought a written order"—he said Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Leslie's valet, had given him the order.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What are you? - I am a <rs id="t17881022-76-viclabel352" type="occupation">lighterman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17881022-76-victim647 t17881022-76-viclabel352"></join>, and owner of barges.</p>
               <p>Are you concerned in carrying corn from the ships to Queenhithe? - Yes, any where; I am very largely concerned; I have a great many craft, and a great many hands; I have known the prisoner some some years; the prisoner was employed by one Goldhawk, a large master, to take the wheat from my barge higher into the country; he was so employed in January last; he came to my house and had his Christmas-box; I gave him half a crown; I put it on board the 14th of January, and in the morning of the 15th of January, I missed a sack of wheat out of my barge, which lay a long side the barge of Goldhawk's; there was only that one; it was about half past seven in the morning, when I saw my barge, a long side that barge; on the 15th of July I received information from one Clerk; I took him to Guildhall, and Alderman Curtis was in the chair, he examined him. This prisoner was then at Guildford on a trial; I got a copy of the indictment to take him; if he was cleared of that there; and we took him, he was taken there and nailed; and then he flew from his bail since, from that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220099"></xptr>time till this; I did not see him till last Thursday; he came to my house about ten at night; and he came and cried, and owned every thing to me; he said he robbed my craft, and his master's craft; and one Cooke was the ruin of him; and that he took one sack of Mr. Ashby's; I made his bail take him away.</p>
               <p>Before this, had you held out any promise of favour to him? - No, he begged for favour.</p>
               <p>Did you hold to him any hope or prospect of mercy for any thing he should say? - No, I did not; Ashby's are Quakers.</p>
               <p>Should you know your sack, if you was to see it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I suppose you have seen a great many hundreds of the same sort? - Yes. I cannot swear to the sack.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Field? - Yes, I know Field very well; he is a barge builder.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Nelson? - Yes, he is a lighterman.</p>
               <p>There was a word or two said to you, about a Mr. Cooke; what way of life is he in? - He is a barge builder.</p>
               <p>I believe this said Mr. Cooke happens to have some actions depending against Field and Nelson? - That I knew nothing of till to day, only what I have heard.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear it till to day? - Not the contents of it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never heard that Field and Nelson were defendants in actions brought by Cooke, till to day? - I have heard it in our market several times, but I never saw the actions; I had no business with any actions.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that these actions had stood for trial, for months past? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear any thing of it till to day? - Not that the trial would come on to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you know that that these actions stood for trial before the last sessions here? - No, I did not then; I have no business with any of their actions.</p>
               <p>Was you here at the last sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state to the Recorder, who now sits here, that these actions were standing in Lord Kenyon's paper, for trial? - I do not recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Oh, mighty good, mighty good. Will you dare to swear you did not hear me state that distinctly to the Recorder of London, who now sits as Judge. Were not you standing here, within three of me? - I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you was not standing within three of the people? - I was sitting there.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state to the Recorder of London, that that application was made in order that these actions might be postponed? - I do not recollect it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear the Judge say, that on that ground he would postpone the trial? - The trial was put off on account of their witness being out of the way.</p>
               <p>You know that was not the ground upon which it was put off? - I know he was not in the way.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, were they put off on your application, upon the motion of your counsel, and upon your own affidavit, Sir? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state to the Recorder, that that application was made, only because these actions were remaining for trial in Lord Kenyon's papers? - No, I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not hear that? - Yes, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard it this very sessions, within this week past? - No, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Was not you here when your counsel moved, to put off the trial of Mr. Cooke? - I certainly was.</p>
               <p>Was not you within reach of me at the time when your counsel moved to postpone the trial of Mr. Cooke to the next sessions? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state to the Recorder<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220100"></xptr>of London, in the hearing of this Jury, that this trial was to be postponed again, because these causes were remaining in the King's Bench? - You never said any thing to me about the trials.</p>
               <p>Will you dare deny it? - I cannot recollect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Will you dare to deny it? - I must deny it.</p>
               <p>Why it is in the memory of every man that heats me now; deny it if you dare, and I will indict you the next sessions; I will have you now tell me the day it was made? - Last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, upon last Thursday, did not you hear me (standing in the place I am now in) talk of these actions? - I have no business with these actions; I believe there was something mentioned; I am not interested in these actions.</p>
               <p>Did you hear me talk of them, yes, or no? - You was saying something to the Judge about them.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you hear me distinctly state, that the object of postponing Mr. Cooke's trial, was, that Mr. Cooke's action in the King's Bench might be tried? - I have nothing at all to do with Mr. Cooke; I am upon my own bottom.</p>
               <p>Court. You appear an honest man, in a reputable situation, without considering the consequences of the questions that are asked you; you should answer them? - I heard him say something about the trial last Thursday, but not before.</p>
               <p>How was it that you never heard of these actions till to day? - I said, I do not know what they are for; I have heard to day that they were actions brought by Cooke against Field and Nelson, for defamation; nobody applied to me to prosecute.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Neither Field nor yet Nelson applied to you? - No, never.</p>
               <p>You say, you obtained a warrant against the prisoner while he was at Guildford? - Yes, he was tried there for some wheat at the Albion mill, I heard; I do not know that Field and Nelson prosecuted this man at Guildford, I never heard so from them; I was not down at Guildford; I understood that the proprietors of the Albious mill prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Who acts as your solicitor? - His name is Lloyd.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, have you ever seen Mr. Lloyd on the subject, in the course of your life? - Yes, when I first employed him, and I saw him this sessions over the way, at the Bell; he has a clerk here, that attends him; his name is Turner.</p>
               <p>You know better, Mr. Lyon? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, that that affidavit, that you yourself swore not three days ago, was in his hand writing? - Yes, I saw him write it.</p>
               <p>You was the prosecutor against Mr. Cooke? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you represent to the court, that this man was at that time in custody, and would be here by by five o'clock that day? - He was on the road, and was in custody of my bail; and was at my house that night? I lent his own bail three guineas to fetch him up.</p>
               <p>Who was present at the time he begged mercy! - One Mr. Berry; he is out of doors, a friend of mine, he happened to be at supper with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I mean to shew that this is a wicked and infamous charge against this man, for the sake of involving Cooke, who has two actions in the court of King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am precluded from mentioning the name of Cooke; I forbear to mention the name of Cooke; I think it my duty, when a man is discharged from an indictment, studiously to conceal from the court the name of the man.</p>
               <p>Court. As far as it is proper, and as far as it is admissible, the name of Cook may be brought in; but farther than that it would be wrong.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. By whose advice did you indict these two people? - By my own, or else I should lose all my employ.</p>
               <p>Have you never said to any body that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220101"></xptr>you never missed any wheat, and that you were very sorry you had got into the scrape of prosecuting? - I will swear that I never said so, because I had lost it.</p>
               <p>Did you never say, you had never missed any? - No, I never said so, because I did miss it.</p>
               <p>You never said so to Mr. Fosgate then? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - I do.</p>
               <p>You was present the other day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, after all that passed then, when it was by your own advice, that this indictment was prefered? - Sir, it was my own.</p>
               <p>Is not young Nelson here? - He may be; yes, I believe he is here.</p>
               <p>Did not he join with you in every affidavit that has been made on the subject? - No, I can not say he has, he has in some affidits, but all I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not young Nelson join one of the defendants in these actions brought by Cook, and join you in every affidavit you have made on the subject here? - Not in every one, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Did he join you in more than one? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you made any affidavits in this court, in which young Nelson did not join you? - I cannot; recollect that.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you made any one in which Nelson did not join you? - Upon my word I cannot say; I know there was an affidavit to move the court, there was two or three I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did you make any one in which young Nelson did not join? - I know there were some affidavits of young Nelson's.</p>
               <p>Are there any one in which young Nelson was not a party; young Nelson, I mean the son of one of the defendants? - He was at Guildford, and heard this man's confession, that was my reason for subpoening him.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you have made any affidavits to the court, in which Nelson has not joined? - No, I cannot swear that, because there are five affidavits.</p>
               <p>Who else joined you in these affidavits? - I am sure I cannot give an answer to that; oh, Sir, Pedley, one of the bail for Akers.</p>
               <p>Who else is there? - There was Nelson one, I was two, I think there was five; upon my word I cannot tell their names, they are people that I subpoened.</p>
               <p>More reason by much to know who they are? - I do not know any one of the others names, they were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>What in a criminal prosecution against Mr. Cook, an eminent bargeman, as eminent as you, at least? - I heard they could give some informations.</p>
               <p>Did you ever read the affidavit? - I heard it read over; but I cannot recollect the names; one lives over the water, he kept a public house; I believe he did keep a public house by Mr. Cooke's.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that this man was tried at Guildford upon an offence to affect his life, for a crime committed six months before; that he was taken up the very day before he was tried, and acquitted, without calling any witnesses; and that he was instantly admitted to bail on your prosecution? - I was not there; it was at the prosecution of the Albion mills.</p>
               <p>Have you never been told so by your co-affidavit man, Mr. Nelson? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was not it stated in the court, that they were imposed on, and were ashamed of the prosecution? - I know nothing at all about that affair.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that you sent down a constable with a warrant in his pocket, with instructions not to give it to the goaler? - I sent down a man with a warrant of detainer.</p>
               <p>Was not he instructed, in your presence, by one of your sollicitors, not to give it to the goaler? - I did not instruct him.</p>
               <p>Had not your constable his detainer in his pocket to deliver it to the Judge? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know that this man is a witness for Mr. Cooke in these very actions that are to be tried tomorrow?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220102"></xptr>- I do not; I never heard so, never in my life, from Nelson.</p>
               <p>Do not you know this indictment was prepared in order to prevent his being a witness on these actions? - No, I do not, deny it.</p>
               <p>Now you have sworn, in the hearing of these gentlemen, that it was by your own advice that this indictment was prefered? - It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Recollect what passed here the other day; will you venture to swear that still, after knowing what was stated? - I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean still to swear that this was by your own advice? - Yes, it is by my own advice.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state that this prosecution was commenced for the sake of taking off the evidence? - No, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear another person standing in court, whose name I will not mention, state that it was brought under his directions? - I employed Mr. Chetwood to assist me.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - Since July.</p>
               <p>Did not you, sitting in court, hear him state that this was commenced under his advice and directions? - What under Mr. Chetwood's? why yes Sir, Mr. Chetwood is employed; I was speaking of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you hear Mr. Chetwood state in the court, that it was by his advice and direction; did not you hear that learned gentleman say, it was by his advice and directions? - I do not understand what you say; I was talking to him at the time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to state that you was talking to him at that time? - I believe I was talking to him, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you never had a consultation at Field's house on this subject? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>You never was at Field's house? - Yes, I was there about three days ago.</p>
               <p>Since the sessions commenced? - Yes, last Friday; my business led me there.</p>
               <p>Was that after the trial of Cook was over? - Yes, the day after.</p>
               <p>Field is one of the defendants in the action that is to be tried to-morrow? - So they tell me; I heard so to day.</p>
               <p>Are not you a witness in that action? - Not that I know of; I have no subpoena.</p>
               <p>Have not you been told to attend tomorrow? - No, not that I know of; I have had no notice to attend; I have not been desired to attend; I do not mean to attend; I know nothing of the cause without I am subpoened.</p>
               <p>After Cook was acquitted here upon your prosecution, the next day you happened to be at Field's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing said about Mr. Cook and Akers? - Yes, I told them that Akers was at my house the night before.</p>
               <p>Who was present? - Pedley, the man that joined in the affidavit; I went in; there was one Artis there, he is another witness; nobody else as I saw; nobody else besides his wife.</p>
               <p>Were none of your lawyers there? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were they? - How do I know.</p>
               <p>Was not Field present at any consultation on this prosecution; has not Field been attending this sessions in order to wait for the trial of Cook and this man? - I never saw him in here yet.</p>

               <p>Have not you seen him at the public house in the Old Bailey? - Oh! yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Has not he been here every day at the public-house you have been in? - No, I deny it; I believe I saw him twice; I saw him to-day.</p>
               <p>How many hours is it since you saw him? - Three hours ago I suppose.</p>
               <p>This is the very Mr. Field who is defendant in the action brought by Mr. Cook? - Yes, I suppose he is like other people, come here to hear what he can hear, and to see what he can see.</p>
               <p>Did he happen to be present at any conversation about this prosecution, on the day after Mr. Cook was tried, when you and Mr. Chetwood were together that day? - I was not with Mr. Chetwood that day at Field's; Mr. Field was not with me and Mr. Chetwood that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220103"></xptr>day; I saw Mr. Chetwood this afternoon; we have not been together to day.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I might be in the house, not upon any business.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have you been together, yes or no? - I did not come here till seven.</p>
               <p>How many hours is it since you three were together? - Near an hour; I saw Field about seven o'clock.</p>

             went in, and he carried in the sack on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Did you see what was done with that sack of wheat? - Mr. Cook held a sack of his while the other sack was on Mr. Akers' shoulders; and these three put the wheat out of that sack into Mr. Cook's sack, and set it behind the door; other people saw it besides me, whom I can mention. After the wheat was just out of that sack William Akers put it under his arm, and shut the door, and attempted to chuck it into Mr. Cook's loft, and it fell from the loft into the street, and I took it up, and have had it ever since; here is the sack.</p>
               <p>Did you know the person of Akers at that time? - Yes I knew him, I had seen him often before that.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by any body in the hearing of Akers at that time about the sack? - That very evening Mr. Cook said to Akers, I heard him say so; I am speaking what I know of my own knowledge, and nothing else he said to Akers, where did the wheat come from, d - n my blood, says he, where did the wheat come from, out of Lyon's barge, says he, d - n my blood, says he, that is right, bring as many as you will, and I will give you half a guinea a sack for them.</p>
               <p>Did you see Akers go after this? - He went out of the skiff; into Morris's causeway; young Clarke was then waiting for him in the skiff; I did not see which way they went, whether up or down the e.</p>
               <p>Did you see Akers at any other time? - Yes Sir, on the 18th of February; I saw him bring another sack on the 13th of February; the skiff came into Mr. Cook's yard; I saw

               <p>Did you hear any body say any thing on that occasion? - Some of Mr. Cook's men held the candle, but who they were I do not know; I know very well that they were Mr. Cook's men, they were employed by him.</p>
               <p>Did Akers or Clarke, in the hearing of Akers say any thing on that occasion? - Akers went in to Mr. Cook as soon as he delivered it; and some time after I heard him say, in the course of a quarter of an hour, Akers was along with Mr. Cook in the road, close by the house.</p>
               <p>Did Akers say any thing then, or did Mr. Cook say any thing then to Akers? - Akers then told him he took it out of Lyon's barge, I did not hear any reply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It was no secret whose barge it came from? - Only Mr. Lyon's barge; that was mentioned publickly and openly, two or three times over.</p>
               <p>How came you to begin by saying that you came to speak the truth, and nothing else, how came you to call out whore first? It is an aukward thing when a man's conscience lies in his face and he thinks every body suspects him? - I mean nothing else but to speak the whole truth.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I keep a chandler's shop, and sells coals, and that is all at this present time.</p>
               <p>What was you before? - I was a sawyer formerly to many persons and before that I was a coach wheeler. I was a sawyer to Mr. Cook.</p>
               <p>Did not he discharge you? - No.</p>
               <p>What was that dispute about stealing the nails and the stuff? - I never heard any such thing; I took a chandler's shop, and left him freely and willingly; he never charged me with any thing; he and I parted very friendly. Do not you speak more than you know, for I shall not. I do not come here to be brow-beat by any body.</p>
               <p>How came you not to lay this information before?</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first mention this? - The first information that I laid was at Sir Sampson Wright's, a good while ago.</p>

               <p>Was it the 15th of January? - No Sir, it was not.</p>
               <p>The 16th; you are an honest man I suppose? - No man ever alledged any thing against me.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose as an honest man you discovered it in the month of January? - No I did not.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose you discovered it in February? - No.</p>
               <p>Not even then? - No.</p>
               <p>Perhaps in the month of March? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did your honesty rise up for half a year for you to give evidence against this man? - I think it was some time in January; no I am wrong now.</p>
               <p>What made you discover it at last? - For the good of my king and country.</p>
               <p>Then you kept it a secret for the good of your king and country all January, all February, March, April, May, June and July? - I do not think you are far off the month now. Am I obligated to tell you the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes you are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You kept the sack snug all this while? - Yes.</p>

             I was subpoenaed up on the piece of business. I heard of the actions some time standing.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, man, when you gave the first information of this upon your oath, and I advise you to take care; do you mean to swear that you laid your information before the magistrate before ever you heard of the action brought by Cook against Barrett? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you tell us when it was that you first thought proper to lay this information? - When I was first subpoenaed.</p>
               <p>How long was that after the action was brought?</p>
               <p>Then you never laid any information till after you was subpoenaed as a witness in these actions? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not usually keep sacks of other people's? - I never did before.</p>
               <p>You was subpoenaed before August then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These causes stood for trial in July, you know, at Westminster hall? - I was not there.</p>
               <p>Why you was seen at Westminster hall? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you was not there? - Yes; I was never subpoenaed at Westminster hall, I was to the Old bailey.</p>
               <p>When was that? - In the last sessions.</p>
               <p>Then am I to understand that you never gave any information till the last sessions? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>What before last sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - Some time before then, I cannot recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say you never was examined against either Mr. Cook or Akers till the month of September? - Oh yes! before then long enough; I was examined before Sir Sampson.</p>
               <p>And you told the whole then as you have now? - No Sir, quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>Yes, but it was about stealing sacks? - Yes, but it was another part of the business; that was another indictment.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say when you was examined before the justice against the prisoner and against Mr. Cook, you told but half your story? - I told nothing of this piece of business, this is quite another piece of business; I was examined as a witness, that was another affair.</p>
               <p>Did you charge them with this robbery? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>How came you not to charge them with this robbery at that time? - Because that was since January; it was another piece of business; it was not brought from the same place.</p>
               <p>What was the oath you took then before the magistrate; was not it to speak the whole truth against the prisoners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220106"></xptr>The man was tried in Surry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you examined to all you knew against the prisoner? - No, only to that very fact, that it was about then.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say this, that at that time you had the sack, you knew of this offence, and you never charged him with it before the magistate? - No, Sir, this sack was not concerning that business that I went before Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>How came you not to charge him with it, was it not the same day? - That was the 15th of January in the morning.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell before the justice the whole that passed on the 14th, if it was true? - I know it was the same day, the 14th of January, I do not dispute it.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was not the 14th of January? - No, I will swear it was the 14th of January, of the Albion mills business, in the morning; and the landing was at Morris's causeway.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, will you swear that? - I have swore it before Sir Sampson Wright, that that landing was not at Morris's causeway.</p>
               <p>Will you swear now, that in your information before the justice, they did not charge this man with bringing a sack to Mr. Cook's on the 14th of January from a skiff, and landing it on Morris's causeway? - No Sir, it was not done so, on my oath; it was not at Morris's causeway.</p>
               <p>Or did you discribe yourself standing at the time? - You are sensible I did not take that oath.</p>
               <p>Good God of Heaven! where did you describe yourself as standing? - In Mr. Cook's yard.</p>
               <p>Then you did not say that you was standing in Morris's causeway? - I was sitting there the same morning.</p>
               <p>Did not you describe yourself as standing. at Morris's causeway, when the Albion mills were taken? - I believe you are rather too sharp upon me; I believe you would, if you could; I was down at the causeway, to be sure, when I heard the boat coming up with the wheat, and my curiosity led me to see what was going on, it was in the morning about six, or between five and six.</p>
               <p>Will you give an account, will you give some reason to the gentlemen, why, when you was examined against this prisoner, and against Mr. Cooke, for a charge of receiving a sack on the 16th of January, and at the time you had the sack in your custody; why you kept that secret, and laid nothing of it? - It was not a piece of business of that indictment; it was about the Albion mill business.</p>
               <p>Will you say this, that you did not charge him with it, because it was not the charge against the prisoner? - It was at Guildford.</p>
               <p>Was you the person that brought down the warrant? - No.</p>
               <p>You know of his being tried before Lord Loughborough? - I do not know any thing of that; I was in court, and was not called in court; I was before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>How came you not to prefer the indictment till September; because you had had the sack in your possession ever since January? - I was here last sessions.</p>
               <p>Did you ever go before a magistrate and make this charge? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did you ever attempt to prefer your bill, till after his acquittal at Guildford; and that not till September sessions last? - I never was before any justice here.</p>
               <p>You was in Surry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard this man tried? - I was not close enough to hear what Loughborough said.</p>
               <p>Court. I think I understood you to say, that when Clarke and he brought the two sacks on the 13th of February, on Morris's causeway, Akers went into Cooke's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And each of them put the sack under the bottom of the barge; Clarke and Akers? - Yes Sir, they did indeed.</p>
               <p>Then Akers went into Cooke's house? - Yes, they both went in.</p>
               <p>And then I think you said, in about a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220107"></xptr>quarter of an hour, you saw Akers and Cooke together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you say, it was, that Akers told Cooke, that the wheat came out of Lyon's barge? - Yes, about a quarter of an hour after.</p>

               <p>Did you hear the prisoner say any thing on that occasion? - He begged for mercy, and said he would throw himself entirely into the hands of Mr. Lyon; that he hoped he would shew him mercy.</p>
               <p>Did he say that he should shew him mercy for? - No, he did not; he said he would throw himself upon Mr. Lyon's mercy; and that old Cooke was a villain; and he was the man that led him into the error; that was all I heard him say.</p>
               <p>Before he said that, had Mr. Lyon said any thing to him to induce him to talk in that way? - Not any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That old Cooke had led him into the error? - Similar to that.</p>

               <p>I believe the prisoner came there with one of his bail? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your friend Lyon had paid the expences of one of the bail? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry the brewhouse should be deprived of your services, they must be very important, I will not detain you any longer? - You are very obliging; I wish you a good night.</p>

               <p>Whose sack, and whose corn was that? - Mr. Ashby's; it was in Mr. Lyon's barge, at Paul's wharf in London: The next time, was the 13th of February; we took a sack of malt from Mr. Lyon's barge; and a sack from Mr. Randall's barge; both together; we took it to Mr. Cooke's; Akers and me; I stepped in the water, and he heaved; one of the men took hold of my shoulder and helped me up; the barge was building on Mr. Cooke's premises; I am sure Akers was the man that did it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Well, Sir, why they say you are a very bad man? - Yes, it is to be hoped this will be a great warning to me.</p>

               <p>Did you give the whole account of all your iniquity in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you mean to swear that positively? - Not the account of all.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, that you said one syllable about stealing this sack from Mr. Lyon's barge before the justice, in Bow-street? - No, I did not mention it.</p>

               <p>Why did not you proceed against Cooke, upon your own evidence, and that of the two witnesses that have been examined? - I thought I had not witnesses sufficient without Ivey and Culloon; it was he that gave evidence before alderman Curtis; he was taken by Pedley: The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character; one of whom was Mr. Goodhawk, to whom the prisoner had lived servant four or five years.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Lyon say, whether he should appear, or give any evidence against him? - No, the next morning I took him down to Mr. Lyon's house; I took him first over to one Mr. Field, who is a little concerned in this matter; Mr. Field did not care much to see him; I took him to Mr. Lyon, and told Mr. Lyon that I thought it was a hardship to bring him up so far after the promises we had made; the promises were, if he would come forth against Mr. Cooke, Mr. Lyon would do all in his power to clear him; these promises were made me, before I went into the country; I had three guineas the last time, and six guineas before.</p>

               <p>What was the answer to that question? - Mr. Lyon came out, and said to me, they were to meet at the Rummer, on Labour-in-vain hill; and there he was to consult about the business; that he was to come into court, and have no witness about him: we went to Mr. Field's, with Mr. Lyon, to acquaint him of the consultation; he damned Mr. Chetwood, and said he had been robbing of him, and putting his hand into his pocket, and taking his money from him; and he would have the advice of Mr. Fielding; we went away from there, and expected to meet them at four, according to their appointment; at eleven Mr. Field came over to my house, and brought Mr. Lloyd's assistant; they insisted on having the prisoner; I told them that Mr. Chetwood their own counsel, had given me to the last day of the sessions, to surrender him; I said I would surrender him at three o'clock, which I did:</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Lyon the man you have been speaking of? - That is the man, I swear positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was the prisoner in any employment at Poole? - Yes, in the dock, and received wages.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the prisoner went out of town, entirely to prevent his being taken on this indictment? - I cannot say how he went out of town.</p>
               <p>Did he never say so to you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I say that is a most - I will not trust myself to say what it is, it is a question that never was put to the bail of any man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you never said to any body that the prisoner was kept out of the way, and supported by Cooke, to prevent his trial on this indictment? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Will you be positive you never said so to any body? - I am only saying I supposed it to be so; I could not have any other thought, when the man did not come on his trial.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say so to any person, that you believed the man was kept out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220110"></xptr>way by Cooke? - It is very likely I may have said so.</p>
               <p>Court to Lyons. Upon your oath was you with this man at Mr. Chetwood's and Mr. Field's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say that they came too late, that Cooke was acquitted? - I never said so; he swore he would be d - d if he did not keep him till the last day, and surrender him; the man begged for mercy, I told him I could not say any thing about mercy, he must take his trial.</p>
               <p>What did you go to Mr. Chetwood's for? - To get his opinion about this man's coming.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then the application about this man, the evidence, came from Pedley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes; I gave the money to bring him up.</p>
               <p>Court to Pedley. Is it true that you applied to the prosecutor to admit the prisoner a witness against Cooke? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Lyon. Did not you, after this conversation, go to Mr. Fielding? - Yes we did.</p>
               <p>Did not you appoint four o'clock to meet him, at the Rummer? - We did at first, but we contradicted it.</p>

               NOT GUILTY
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>As soon as the verdict was given Mr. Chetwood thus addressed the court.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I would not trouble you till the verdict was given, but I beg leave now to observe, that Mr. Lyon and Pedley, and the witness, called at my house on Saturday morning, the purport of their business was, knowing that I was a friend and acquaintance of Mr. Lyon, he had told me that he should be ruined by this recognizance he had entered into, and that he was sent out of the way: Mr. Lyon upon that, and to save his recognizance, and to bring back the prisoner, I believe, supplied him with money. Last Monday morning Mr. Lyon and Pedley came to my house to take my advice: Pedley there proposed to me that if it would be of service, for he said, though I have been bail for him, it cannot be imagined that I would go from one end of the kingdom to another to bring a man to be transported; no says he: he swore he would not. Is it possible, says he, to make Akers (for I have him in my custody) a witness against Cooke? It is impossible, says I, he has been before the Grand Jury. Then, says Mr. Pedley, I will be d - d if he shall be surrendered, for it shall never be said that I coaxed him to London to transport him. It was then mentioned, that as I think one Wilson had been concerned in this robbery, was it not possible to indict Wilson, and make Akers an evidence against him? No; says I, no such thing can be done; no tricks can be played in a court of justice. Mr. Lyon said I, I have nothing to do with it, I am to try to bring these people before the court. Pedley said, can you devise any way in the world that Akers can be made an evidence? Says I, there is no such thing as doing it. Sir, says he, would the court acquit him if he was to come to the bar and acknowledge his guilt, and charge Cooke? I said, God forbid any such thing should be done. This was the conversation with me, whether by any possibility Akers could be made evidence against any body else, as Pedley swore he should not be transported, as he had brought him to town.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Chetwood has done very right in coming forward, as his name has been publickly mentioned; and I must say he has done very right also in mentioning this at a time when it could not affect the the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. I waited till the trial was over, my Lord, for it would not have become a man that had been consulted and concerned to say any thing pending the trial: there is Mr. Pedley, he knows what I have said to be true.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There is one circumstance in this cause; there has been too much of mystery and management in the conduct of the prosecution, too much seeming connection with other business, which had nothing to do with the administration of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220111"></xptr>justice here: the effect that has produced on your minds has been, you have taken the cautious line, and if the prisoner is guilty, the prosecutor must thank himself.</p>
               <p>Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

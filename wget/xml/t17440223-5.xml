            , and called for a pennyworth of purl, and I took notice of his looking up at the shelves and viewing the pewter; he went into the yard, to see a couple of cocks that were there, and when he came in again, I saw something in his breast like pewter; I said to him, Friend, I don't like you; I took hold of him, put my hand into his bosom, and took out these two plates. I asked him, what he did with those plates? he said, they were his own; but Mr. Norman and his wife said, they were theirs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the plates of the maid; I desired her to lend them me, to fetch a slice of meat, because I had a friend coming to me - I don't know the maid's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in that neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming to live in it, at the sign of the Punch Bowl.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put them into your bosom?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had them under my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the words the prisoner said to you?</p>
               <p>Blakemore. He said, What have you to do with them, they are my own plates.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I was going to fetch some meat.</p>
               <p>Blakemore. You said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Norman. He wanted to mix the plates with others, because I should not be able to swear to them. <rs id="t17440223-5-verdict28" type="verdictDescription">

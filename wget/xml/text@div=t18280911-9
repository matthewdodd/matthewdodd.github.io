The prisoner called on me in the morning of the 26th of July, stating that his master, Mr. King, wished me to go down and see his son, who was dangerously ill at Walworth. I went, and on my return found this had happened; I did not know the prisoner before, and could find no Mr. King at Walworth; these two books were taken off the shelf in my dining-room.</p>

            . I am servant to Dr. Cholmeley. I let the prisoner in when he came for master; and about half an hour after master was gone the prisoner came again, and asked me if the gentleman had called and left a note for him; I said No: he said if I would let him write a note he would be obliged to me; I showed him into the dining-room, and gave him pen and paper; I left him there for about five minutes; I returned, looked through the niche of the door, and saw him putting something under his smock-frock; I went in and told him he had been taking something; he denied it - I called the other servant; he then got up, pulled the books out, and put them on the sofa - he was secured.</p>

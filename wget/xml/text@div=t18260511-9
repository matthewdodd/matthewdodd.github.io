The prisoner was in my service, and entrusted to collect monies for me. Mr. Parton, of Chatham, was a customer, and indebted to me.

Thirty-five shillings a week; he has a wife and two children - he has stated to me that he has repaid 75l. and 25l., which he had used, but I know nothing of that; I know nothing of any deficiency prior to February - he never returned any money to me, as having used it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's clerk - it was the prisoner's duty to account to me for money he received. When he came from his Christmas journey he delivered me an account, in his own hand-writing, which I produce - here is no account of this 2l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know of his being deficient in 75l. and 25l., and paying it back when he got money? A. He certainly was deficient; when I applied for 75l. to Mr. Alchin, of Hastings, he said he had paid it; the prisoner was on a journey at the time, and when he returned included it in his cash account, as if he had received it that journey. I believe he borrowed 150l., by his wife's means, to raise it.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was that before or after you discovered it? A. Afterwards, about February this year - he had received it in August.</p>

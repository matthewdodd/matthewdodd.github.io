               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house at the time you missed these articles. - A. No; he had slept there all night for what I know, till the morning; I traced him to a jew dealer in East Smithfield; the jew owned to having bought the articles of him, and produced them all, except the scissars. After making the discovery, I met with the prisoner in a public-house, and took him to the office, the officer searched him, and found two pair of scissars upon him. I saw all the articles on the evening before in my shop, and I saw the prisoner about five o'clock that evening. I do not know, of my own knowledge, at what time the prisoner broke out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you try it? - It was tried before Mr. Bishop, Mr. Dawson and Mr. Lambert, and it fitted: this is what was made for an experiment in the brewery.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom does this brewhouse belong? - To the crown.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - I think four shillings.</p>

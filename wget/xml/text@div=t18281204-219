I had a shop at the corner of Catherine-street, Strand - the prisoner entered my service about four years ago, and was authorised to receive money on my account, and was to render an account monthly; I had a customer named Sheldon; I have examined my monthly accounts, and find I have not received, since January, 6l. 4s. on his account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. He came into your service four years ago? A. Yes, and was to receive 2l. or two guineas a week; I never recollect any conversation about his being allowed a commission on what he sold, nor about his receiving any thing at Christmas; I did not say I had allowed it to his predecessor, and would to him; this 6l. 4s. was not included in the monthly accounts; I recollect receiving an account from my wife - this is it; here is credit given for 6l. 4s., received from Mr. Sheldon, deducted from an annual gift of 20l. - he does account for 6l. 4s. in this way; I issued a writ against him for the money before he absconded, and then took out a warrant; I never gave him permission to go out of town after rendering the account - his brother came and brought a receipt, which I said was no account at all; Mrs. Pearson gave the prisoner a receipt- she handed an account to me, in which he had made an account for 80l. as a gratuity - his brother did not give me any account; I issued a writ against the prisoner directly.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. When he went away, you brought this forward? A. Yes - I thought the embezzlement was complete - here is the account for January 1828 - the 6l. 4s. is not down; he should have rendered an account of it the last day of the month; he used to send the account sealed up to the warehouse - not to the house.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is there not in this account an item of 10l.? A. Yes, I made him a present of that; I swear I did not give it to him on account of a gratuity; I very often make my servants presents - it was in June 1826; I think I saw him but once after I received this account from my wife; he stayed on my premises two or three days, but evaded me in every kind of way; I called several times, and could not see him.</p>

            : the prisoner was in the habit of rendering his accounts to the clerks, or to Mr. Pearson, but never to me before; in August last, Mr. Pearson pressed for his account, and I think at Mr. Pearson's desire, I wrote to him; the prisoner brought me this account - I could not check it; I never opened the paper - I was going to give him an acknowledgment for the sum handed to me, which was 16l. 8s. 5 1/2d. - he said he had a receipt ready written - I signed it without reading it; when my husband came home, I handed him the money and the account - I am not conscious that the seal was broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you are in the habit of assisting your husband in his business? A. No - I have hand money handed over to me by the clerks, which I have paid to Mr. Pearson, or sent to the banker's; I have received money, and given an acknowledgment for it; it was in consequence of a letter I sent to the prisoner that he brought the account- our establishment in the Strand was about to be given up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time I entered Mr. Pearson's service, in 1824, I was to succeed Mr. Robinson, whom I had some knowledge of - he agreed to give me 100l. a year, but it was a verbal agreement - Mr. Robinson said he did not give commission, but he made a present of 20l. a year at Christmas - Robinson is now dead; I had repeatedly asked Mr. Pearson to settle - he said "I am in a hurry, and can't give it you now;" in June 1826, I asked him to let me take 10l. on account, which he allowed me to do; Mr. Sheldon knowing me, became a customer of Mr. Pearson's, and this sum I held back, considering myself entitled to it; on Thursday, the 22d of August, I was desired by a note to bring the book to London-wall, and Mr. Pearson found it all correct - there is a lad here, I believe, that can prove it - this is the book, and here is the account I rendered - he took the book. and said "Mr. Patrick, you received money of Mr. Dodd," and then he marked them all off in the book, and made no objection - on the Monday following, he called on Mr. Pearson - two or three persons had been inquiring if the premises were to let; when he called, I told him of it - he said I must go and tell them 300l. rent, and one thousand guineas for the lease; I went to several persons, and one of them appointed to meet Mr. Pearson, at London-wall; on the Wednesday evening, I met him at the factory, and went to London-wall with him, and when he was gone, I was ushered up stairs to Mr. Pearson, and this account lay before him; Mr. Pearson had a sale on the 26th of August, and from the 22d, I had never seen him - I wrote a note to know whether I was to shut up the shop or not - then a man applied for it to exhibit the Red Barn, and he took it for a week - on the 27th, I saw Mr. Pearson, and asked him leave to go into the country; he gave me leave, and then he asked for the receipt - I sent my brother with it the next morning, when he picked out two sums of Clementi and Frieseland, and said "I will issue a writ against your brother," and he took out a writ that every morning; my brother came back to the Strand, and I went into the country; I came back on the 9th of September, and wrote to Mr. Lacey, to say if he had any instructions to take proceedings against me to send to Austin-friars, and on the 18th of September, he took out the warrant against me; I was at Carpenters' Hall several times - I never absconded; I supposed, had he intended to take any proceedings, he would have sent to Austin-friars; here is the mark in the book against this very account, and Mr. Pearson made no objection; he says he did not see me, but he saw me on the Monday and on the Wednesday evening.</p>

               <p>SIR: - If you have instructions from Mr. Pearson to take any proceadings against me, I shall take it a favour if you will send them to Mr. Coates, Austin-friars; if any, have taken place, I will call, with two friends, and sign a bail bound. J. P.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. PEARSON. Q. Is the account in your hand-writing? A. This date is not mine; this letter is Mrs. Pearson's.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was this letter written by you after the account given to Mrs. Pearson? A. I think I can swear it was before, to the best of my knowledge it was two days before this account was furnished to Mr. Pearson - supposing there to have been no entry of four years gratuity, it would not have been a correct account, because he had delivered a July account, in which he had omitted items which he credits in this account; he gives credit for them here: -(Letter read.)</p>

This green book is a book of sales, not of money; it is merely of goods sold - this account is the one he delivered, sealed up, to Mrs. Pearson; this other, is the cash-book, which was rendered to me after he delivered the account - I compared it with the cash-book, and it was fabricated; the prisoner kept this book, and when I saw it, three or four days after, it was not made up - I can prove the monies are entered as paid, in August, when they were received in May, July and February; he writes them here as paid in August, and in the former leaves they are never credited.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that in that green book there are not entries the same as in the account? A. Yes, of sales; I have never compared the entries in this book with the account rendered by the prisoner, and ticked them off.</p>

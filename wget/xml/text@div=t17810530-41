            , a watchman of St. Giles's, came and knocked at my door, and said, he saw two men pass by my door, with a carcase of lamb. I sent my servants to see if it was my lamb; I did not get up myself. The next morning the lamb was brought to Litchfield-street office, and I went and looked at the lamb; but did not know it to be mine: then my servants were sent for; one of which supposed the lamb was mine. The prisoner has been my servant for near two years, greatest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300040"></xptr> part of the time: he has been from me three months. He behaved very honest; I never had any suspicion of him.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner, and another man, going up Dyot-street, about half after ten o'clock, with the lamb upon his shoulder. I asked him, where he was going with it, at that time of night? The other gave me answer, what was that to me? I took the prisoner to the watch-house; the other ran away: the other said, he would go for the master he bought the lamb of. The prisoner went very quietly to the watchhouse; then the prisoner said, his master owed him 13 s. and one of the men bid him take the lamb for the money. He gave me a direction to his master. I went to Mr. Hembrew's slaughter-house, to see if it was open.</p>
               <p>To Weaver. Was you sent for to look at the lamb? - I was sent for to the Rotation-office.</p>

               <p>Do you know the lamb found on the prisoner was the lamb that was in the slaughter-house? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>To Donallan. What became of the lamb? - I brought it to the watch-house, and left it in Treadway's hands.</p>
               <p>Treadway. I carried it to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Was Weaver there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the lamb produced there, the same the watchman brought with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Weaver. Did you see the lamb that was at the justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know it? - I believe it was the lamb I dressed.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to of a is a particular way of placing the kidneys.</p>
               <p>When had you dressed it? - I believe, on Wednesday night; I am not positive to it.</p>
               <p>By what mark can you swear to it? - By the manner of putting the skewers.</p>
               <p>May not other people put skewers the same way? - Yes, they may.</p>
               <p>To Hembrew. Do you think you could swear to your own lambs, when they are dressed? - I do not think I could: many people dress like us; many people do not.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

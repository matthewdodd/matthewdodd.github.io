               <p>Joseph Hall. I was with Samuel Smith when we found the Horse. I told the Prisoner, that Smith wanted to buy a Horse, upon which the Prisoner told us, that all the Horses in that Stable were his, and if any of them would do for us, he would sell us one. We pitch'd upon this Horse, and the Prisoner led him out of the Stable and asked 14 Guineas for him. I asked him how he came by the Horse, and he said he bought him in Northamptonshire, at a Place call'd Badby, of one Goodman; then I told him the Horse was stolen, and charged a Constable with him; when he was in Custody, I told him I supposed he had a Mind to a little Mare that was with the Horses: I can't say, says he, which I had a Mind to, - which I could come at.</p>

                  </hi>. I was shopman to Thomas Merchant, a pawnbroker, in Ryder's-court, Leicester-square. On Tuesday the 10th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop to pawn tome things—soon after I missed a pair of trowsers—we ran out after him and saw him going up the court very quickly—as soon as be turned the corner we stopped him, and took these trowsers from under his cloak.</p>

I have known the prisoner three or four years - I had a quarrel with him five or six, if not seven, months ago, and blows passed between us; on the 25th of September, I was standing in the footway in <placeName id="t18301028-76-crimeloc420">Berwick-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. When you used this expression did you put out your fist at all to him, or alter your position? A. No, not that I know of - I did not touch him, not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether you accompanied your threat by doubling your fist and giving him a blow or not? A. I really do not know - there might be some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280036"></xptr>blows occur; I do not recollect - I do not recollect any thing more that happened till I got to Marlborough-street; I was down in the kennel, and was picked up - I do not know how I came there; I became insensible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him if he did not give me the first blow. Witness. Not that I know of.</p>

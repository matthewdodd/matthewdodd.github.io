                  </hi>. I live with James Ames, cheese<lb></lb>monger, Duke-street, Manchester-square. On the 10th of January, the prisoner came between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening—he asked the price of a bit of bacon, at the door—I said 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I refused that—he said he would give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he took it into the shop to weigh it—it came to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he threw down a half-crown, which my master took up.</p>

I took the half-crown of the prisoner—I rang it first on the counter, and did not much like it—I rub<lb></lb>bed it, and saw it was not good—I gave him the change, and he put the bacon in his pocket—he went out as quiet as possible—I told the boy to follow him—he came back without resistance—I asked him where he got it—he said he would give me another for it—I said that would not do, it was not the first he had given me, and I should make an example of him—he attempted to force his way out of the shop—I took hold of his coat slightly, but he twisted his head under my arm and away he ran—I fol<lb></lb>lowed, and cried "Stop thief"—he was stopped and given to the officer—he said he lived at No. 4, John-street.</p>

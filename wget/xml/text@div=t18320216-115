               <p>Q. Did two men meet you? A. One met me, and gave me a blow in the stomach; then another man came behind me, grabbed me, and got hold of my seal and key<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160043"></xptr>- the ribbon broke; he ran off up the highway, with the seal and key; the man who struck me in the stomach ran a different way - I sung out Murder! and Robbery! the witness came up, and said, "I know the party quite well," and in about two or three minutes a Thames Police-officer came up; he went away with the witness Hicks, in pursuit of the man - I did not see the prisoner again till he was at the Thames Police, about a month after; I have never recovered my seal or key.</p>

               <p>Q. What opportunity had you of seeing the man who came behind you? A. I turned round, and saw the shape of the man going away - I did not see his face; by the prisoner's appearance, I think he is the man who came behind me, and took my property; I am a Trinity waterman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. About nine o'clock at night, a few minutes before or after - it was dark: the witness was present at the time - he was not in my company.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Philip-street, St. George's in the East. I was in Ratcliff-highway on the the 24th of November - being out of work, I was selling things in the street, and saw two men come up to Burns, one behind and the other before him; one made a snatch at his seal and key, and with the blow which was struck in his side, he fell; I assised him up - he said, "Did you see those two men?" I said Yes; he asked if I knew them - I said I thought I did; the officer came up - I went with him, but did not find them then; I was taken ill, and obliged to go to the London hospital, and it was eight weeks after before I saw the prisoner - he was then at the Thames Police; I thought he was the man who went before the prosecutor - I took it to be Murray, by his appearance and dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? A. I took it to be the person who I had known before - I had known the one I took it to be four years by selling pies in the street; I cannot positively swear he is the same man - the prosecutor was on one side of the way, and I on the other; the street is twelve or fourteen yards wide - it was a dark night; there was a gas-lamp a little way from him - I only had a momemary view of him; they no sooner struck him than they were off, one way, and the other the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at all seen them before they struck the prosecutor? A. I had seen two men come up the lane behind him, but had not observed them so as to know they are the two men who struck him.</p>

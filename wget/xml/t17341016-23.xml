            . The Prisoner and his Wife hired a Room of me by the Week on the last Day of April. They staid till Bartholomew-tide, and then he set his Wife up in Bartholomew-Fair to sell Gin and Black-puddings. But some body stole her Bottle of Gin, and then she was broke. I was to have 2 s. a Week, but they had been there 24 Weeks, and paid me no more than 12 s. and besides, they used to come home drunk at all Hours, and so I was resolved to give 'em Warning. But as I was going up to their Room, I met his Wife coming out with a Bundle; upon which I went in to the Prisoner, and said, I suppose she's gone to raise a new Stock of Gin. No, says he, but if she is, I'll go and fetch her back. So he went away, and I miss'd my Goods, but they never darkened my Doors afterwards I took him about a Week afterwards, and then his Brother came and told me, if I would be easy he could help me to my Goods again, for they were at his House. But I would not meddle with them, for I had heard say, that one must not take such things back.</p>

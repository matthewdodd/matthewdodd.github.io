I looked over my shoulder, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't shove me against the window;" and at that time I had a sight of the prisoners - Cox had hold of my arm, and Davis was very busy about my person, at my right side - I am certain of them both. I was released immediately I told them not to push me against the window - it struck me immediately that I was robbed; I clapped my hand on my fob, and missed my watch and chain; I said,</p>
               <p>"I've lost my watch," still keeping my eye on the prisoners, who were going away. A man said,</p>
               <p>"There they go;" I said, Yes, I know it, and immediately followed them, and caught Davis by the collar, and said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, where is my watch?" he immediately up with his clenched fist, and struck me on the mouth. I called out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake help;" Cox then came up, and I immediately received a violent blow on the face; I am not sure he struck it. I still kept Davis, and grasped at Cox with my left hand - I held them both, and was down on my left knee crying for help, still holding them both, and while down I received several kicks or blows about my body. Two patrols came up, and I gave the prisoners in their charge. My watch was not found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How long had you seen your watch before you put your head through the window - A. I did not put my head through the window; I only looked in. I had put my watch into my fob two minutes before - I had just left the shop. I did not pull it out in the street; nobody could take it before I got into the crowd. I did not feel it taken. Davis did not strike till I collared him - four or five persons were about me, but my eye was on the prisoners.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Davis touch your person - A. Yes; I felt his hand down at my trowsers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cox. Q. You said nothing to the Magistrate about my holding your arms or striking you - A. I did not mention every thing to the Magistrate, for I was so irritated, and all in a gore of blood. I said my arms were pinioned, and I think I said Cox was one who pinioned them; but I was confused, and on recovering I recollected every thing. I am certain of both of them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of February, about a quarter before six o'clock, Hall and I were coming along Whitechapel; there was a mob at the corner of Goulston-street, we ran across, and were told a gentleman had lost his watch. I immediately ran, and just before I got to Petticoat-lane, I found the prosecutor holding Davis - he complained of losing his watch. I secured Davis, and Hall took Cox, who was standing by. Davis said he was innocent. I pushed them into a baker's shop, and searched them, but found nothing on them.</p>

            . I followed the last witness, and at the corner of Petticoat-lane, which is about twenty yards from Goulston-street, I saw Skillern holding Davis. Cox was striking at Hone, who was partly down - I secured him; he made a great resistance. When I got him out of the mob, he put his hands up, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got nothing." I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cox. Q. Did I resist - A. Yes. When I first went up, he was striking the prosecutor, and when I laid hold of him, he made all the resistance possible.</p>
               <p>Cox's Defence. I was passing by, and heard the prosecutor call for assistance - I went up, several people came round. I was shoved about, and received a blow from somebody - I do not know whether it was the prosecutor or Davis; but I returned the blow, and was taken.</p>
               <p>DAVIS'S Defence. I was passing; the prosecutor said he had lost his watch. I stood in the crowd, and if I had known anything of it, he could have taken me in the crowd; but I walked away to Petticoat-lane, when he knocked my hat off, and I struck him.</p>

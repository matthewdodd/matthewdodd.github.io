On the night of the 14th of November my house was broken open, and about 20l. worth of property stolen; as soon as I discovered it I called in the Police-officers, and, in consequence of their representing that it must be somebody who knew the premises, I sent to the prisoner's lodgings.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I am an officer. I went to Castle-court, Broadway, Westminster - the prisoner had met me in the street, said where he lived and gave me the key of the lodging - his wife came while I was there; I found this pair of braces in a table drawer, which Mr. Baker's foreman identified - there was a box, which was locked; I sent to Avis (who had the prisoner in charge) for the key of it - Avis brought it, and in the box another pair of braces was found.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the box, which I opened with the key I got from the prisoner, and found this pair of braces in it; when I went back to the prisoner he asked if I had found any thing - I said, "Yes, these braces;" he said they were his own manufacture, and not Mr. Baker's.</p>

            . I am quite clear that these braces are my property - this pair I have had twelve months in my window; the last five weeks I have paid the prisoner by the day - I have lost the braces since he has been there, but I cannot say when; I lost none on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARBOROW. I am a brace-maker. I made these two pairs of braces for Mr. Baker, I have no doubt; this pair I can particularly speak to, because they are a sort of leather which is not generally used - I think they have been made since September twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not supply Mr. Hunt, Mr. Field, and others? and if a number were to be kept separate, and they got mixed, could you select them? A. I could select this pair; I have bought articles of the prisoner to be used in brace making.</p>

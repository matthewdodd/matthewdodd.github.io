On the 9th of July, about twelve o'clock at night, the shop was closed; the prisoner came there with her mistress, and looked at some things, and was in the shop about ten minutes - her mistress bought nothing; the prisoner bought a piece of ribbon for shoe-strings - when I put the handkerchiefs on the counter, the prisoner took them up, and shortly afterwards went to the door; on my putting the handkerchiefs back I missed one, and accused her of having it, but she denied it - I called the servant to search her; she would not allow her bonnet to he taken off - the servant saw part of the handkerchief behind part of her bonnet; I sent for an officer - he brought it to me; it has the shop mark on it.</p>

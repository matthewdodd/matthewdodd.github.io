I immediately followed the prisoner, I found him standing at a private house door with fourteen pounds of ginger at his feet; I went up to him, and he turned round; he was in the act of undoing his apron; I took up the parcel and saw it was my property; the prisoner ran away, I cried stop thief, the prisoner cried stop thief likewise; I followed him down Cavendish-street, he went into Charlotte-street. I saw no more of him untill he was in custody of the watchman. I am positive he is the same man; I could swear to his waistcoat, he had on the same waistcoat he has now.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was crying the hour half after eight, and hearing the words stop thief; I turned towards where I heard the noise and saw the prisoner, he was the first I met, he was crying stop thief as hard as he could; he was the first, and there were about an hundred after him, seeing he had an apron on I thought he was a shopman, and not a thief; I bethought myself that he must be the thief; I followed him, and sprang my rattle; he ran into a mews where there was no thoroughfare; he tore his apron off, and threw it upon a dunghill; he returned out of the mews against me; I said where is the man that ran in here; oh, said he, he is gone down the mews; I said, stop my friend, I think you are the man, what have you done with your apron; he replied, I had none; I took him on suspicion as a thief; I secured him; not knowing what he had done I brought him along to Duke-street; Mr. Lawrence called have you got him watchman; I said, I have somebody like him; he said, has he a striped waistcoat on; I said, he had; he told me to take care of him. The apron was found at the same place where I had seen him throw it.</p>

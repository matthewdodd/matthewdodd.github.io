                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 37). On 10th July, I was on night duty in Leather Lane, Holborn—I had received instructions to watch Messrs. Elmslie's tin foil factory in Union Buildings, Leather Lane—I ex<lb></lb>amined the premises about 10 o'clock—they were fastened up safe then—the factory door was locked, and I placed a private mark upon it, so that I could tell if it was opened—about 1.15 next morning I examined the door again; the mark was not disturbed—about 1.40 I examined it again, and found the door had been opened, and the private mark gone—the door was locked—I called up a man named Pitt, obtained the key from him, went into the factory, and found this piece of tin foil just inside the gate, ready to be taken away—I did not touch it—I then searched the factory with Pitt, but found no one—I locked the door, and gave the key to Pitt—I then stood outside to see if anyone would come out till 3.45—I then went and asked the housekeeper to give me the key again—when I opened the door I found that the tin foil which was against the door was gone—I obtained Kibby's assistance, and searched the factory thoroughly—on the bottom floor there is a sort of horse box—between that horse box and the ceiling there was a small space, about a foot high—I got upon the manger, looked in, and saw Smith's legs—I pointed it out to Kibby, and we got some steps on the other side, and there I saw Davis—I took Smith to the station, and Kibby took Davis—I searched Davis at the station, and found a latch key and a skeleton key on him—I found that the skeleton key opened the factory door—I afterwards returned to the factory, and found the tin foil, which I had seen near the gate when I first went in, on a bench on the second floor, covered with hay.</p>

Elmslie's employ about four years—he left work on 4th July, saying that he was ill—he had not worked regularly for some weeks before—on the morning of 11th July I found that the factory had been broken into—I searched it, and found under a flight of stairs, near the entrance gate, a chimney pot with this piece of tin-foil in it, worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have a workman named Anthony—on 17th July he handed me these four keys—he had been searching the place by my order.</p>

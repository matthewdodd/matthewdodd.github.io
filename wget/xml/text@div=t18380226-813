                  </hi>. I live in Sydney-street, Mile-end. On Monday evening, the 19th of February, about five o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and asked me to lend him a truck—he said he was living in Meux-street, which is within 200 yards of my house—I let it to him for two hours, but he never returned it—I found it in Hampstead-road, opposite the Reservoir—I had suspicion, and my son watched him from the place he took my truck from—the truck found is mine—I did not find it myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I borrowed it for two hours, and before I had it an hour and a half, it was taken from me by the policeman—I refused to give it up, saying I had borrowed it for two hours. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was to pay 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my lather. I was present when the prisoner hired the truck, for two hours, about five o'clock—I followed him—he went up Charles-street, Hampstead-road—I saw there some people round it—I went and asked them, in his presence, if he had offered it for sale—no reply was made—I told the prisoner he had hired the truck—he said not him, but the other—I said no, it was him—he took hold of the handle and wanted to drag it home to my father—he took it a short way, then threw down the handle, and ran away—I ran after him, and hallooed, "Stop thief"—he was caught in Charles-street, by two gentlemen—the policeman came up, and I gave him into custody—I do not know that he was trying to sell it—I could see the people examining it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner drop the handle of the truck in Hampstead-road, all at once, and run—the witness turned round, and called, "Stop thief" after him—the prisoner ran down Charles street, and was stopped by two gentlemen—I took him, and he said, "It was not me that had the truck, it was the other one"—at the station-house Alfred Coe said he had hired it for two hours—the prisoner said, "If I did it is now seven o'clock, the two hours are hardly up yet."</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old; I work for Mr. Laws—last September I was employed by him to shake the salt off some skins in Mr. Law's back-garden—the prisoner came and asked me for some skins—I told him they were my master's—he told me to throw them away, and he picked one bundle up and put it into his pocket—he picked up three bundles, and went away with them—I was going in to tell my master, and he called me back, and said he would give me a good hiding if I told my master, and promised me a penny if I aid not tell him—I did not tell my master then; I told him two Saturdays ago.</p>

               <p>—those skins came from France—I do not know what kind of skins they were; they were rather long ones, as long as a sheet of paper; I do not think they were so wide; they had no hair on them; they were in a cask with a lot of salt—the prisoner did not take the three bundles at the same time—a boy named Eaton, and a boy named Henry Wood, were with me—we were all knocking the salt off—Wood is older than me; he is fifteen—the prisoner spoke to me; he did not speak to them—I do not think they saw what I saw; their eyes were fixed on their work—I did not say anything to them about the prisoner taking them.</p>

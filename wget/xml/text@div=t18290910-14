I think in February; I keep a book of the goods sent out - I had but recently began business, and did not receive any payment till after Christmas; I did not expect the money for these articles to be paid before Christmas - I called on Mr. Jones in March, and was suprised to see the prisoner's receipt for it; I have not my books here.</p>

I ordered a pair of breeches and gaiters; they were brought home by the prisoner in the beginning of December - I did not pay him at the time, but he called afterwards, and had it; he gave me this receipt: he had 2l. 1s. in money, and 1ls. in spirits - this is the receipt.</p>

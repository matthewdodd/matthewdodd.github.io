            . I reside in Gray's Inn-lane. I live with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of observing any person near Mr. Butt's house, and when. - A. On Tuesday, December the 6th, about six o'clock in the evening. It was just turned six. I was passing down Gray's Inn-lane. I crossed Liquorpond-street, and just as I got to the Talbot public-house I saw three men stand by Mr. Butt's window.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Wandsor. - A. Yes, by sight I seeing these three men, and knowing the house to have been robbed before, created a suspicion. I saw the prisoner stand between two men - one was taller than the prisoner or the other one - the tall man put his hand to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. A sash window. - A. Yes, and forced it up, and at the same time shoved open the blinds of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. That you could see distinctly, could you. - A. Yes, I stopped by the Talbot light, and just at that instant the other two were in the act of assisting the prisoner at the bar into the window, and before he was in the act of getting in, by the lamp I could see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Just in the act of getting in. - A. Yes, his hands on the lower part of the sill of the window, and the other two men were assisting him in the window, and part of his person in, I seeing him in that situation, I thought by the time that I got up to the window, he would be got in; but I was too quick - and the other two men assisted by pulling him down, and that was the cause of their dispersing.</p>
               <p>Q. They fled, did they. - A. Yes, they ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. The window was got up, and part of his person in. - A. Yes. I knocked at the door of Mr. Butt's house, and told the servant that the house had been attempted to be robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any of the three persons say any thing. - A. No. I told the servant I would go and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150032"></xptr>look after them. Upon that consideration I went over the way, and stood in a dark place of the new building belonging to Gray's Inn. I heard a whistle, and I saw the three men come together again. I saw them coming, and I walked on. They were coming towards me, and expressed the words, that is, the bugger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular reason they had for pulling the prisoner out. - A. The other two men might see me.</p>
               <p>Q. That was your opinion - was any thing said or done. - A. No. I thought it proper to cross over the way. I crossed over the way, and they crossed after me, and went before me. I then met a gentleman unknown to me I claimed his assistance in taking the three men, and told him they had been attempting to rob a house above. He said he was in a hurry, but he would assist me as much as he could. We walked on as far as Portpool-lane, and there I told him, as soon as I laid hold of the prisoner at the bar, that he was to assist in taking the others. As soon as I laid hold of the prisoner, I lifted up my umbrella, and told him, if he made any resistance, I would knock him down. He immediately fetched me a blow on the right side of my head. The other two men were standing on the other side of the way, and as soon as the other gentleman saw the prisoner strike me, the other gentleman ran away. I then recovered myself and fetched the prisoner a blow on the head with my umbrella. I pursued him down the lane, and between that and a wheelwright's shop, he turned round, and gave me a blow. I then attempted to take him again, when he slipped under my arm; he hit me two blows, both on my right side and on my left, and escaped from me. I immediately cried out</p>
               <p>"stop thief" as loud as I could holloa, and pursued him to a place called Sparrow's-Rents, that leads into Liquorpond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him at last. - A. I took him at Meux's brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the person of the prisoner. - A. Yes, I had seen him many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the other men before. - A. I think I should know them. I know him perfectly. I have seen him on several other different affairs of picking pockets, and such like.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was six o'clock at the time. - A. Yes, there was no light of day at all. The cause of my seeing his face, there is a chandler's shop next door to Mr. Butt's that had a light, and the light of the lamps I saw his face perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. This was an early hour in the evening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons passing. - A. Not any one at all; between Liquorpond-street and the Bull, I did not see any person coming. I then took him to Mr. Butt's house, and gave him in charge of an officer, and from thence to Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. The servant to whom you communicated this is a female servant. - A. Yes, a maid servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman says he know my person well - I wish to know where he knew me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaughan. I have seen him in Holborn with another person who picked a gentleman's pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go into the parlour after you had shut the shutters and let down the curtain - A. No, I did not, I went out in the street, when the young man said, did I know that the house had been attempted to be robbed; I said, no He told me to go in doors and shut the door. I went in, and then I thought there might be somebody in the house. I went out in the street, and saw one of the parlour windows wide open.</p>

I did not go to commit felony; I merely went to ask Jones the reason for discharging me. As he was coming upstairs I was going to ask, and because I could not get a word he seized me and we both fell. He fell on the barrel instead of my throwing it upon him. The handkerchiefs were then round my neck; he pulled both off. I wore the blue Guernsey all the time. "</p>

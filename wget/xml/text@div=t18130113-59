It appeared it had been forced, by marks on the under side of the window itself. After day light. I saw the marks of feet in the garden; many feet marks at the end of the wall, between Mr. Lane's and my garden. I observed there the marks of feet.

               <p>Q. What lane do they live in - A. The adjoining street, No. 7. Me and the others pursued her, and we met her as she was coming out of the door, No. 7, with a bundle under her arm. We secured her, and also the bundle. We took her up stairs into the room that she lodged in; there I found some towels and some knife cloths, and from some enquiries we had some reason to suspect Pamphlet, and on Sunday morning we apprehended him. In searching his lodgings a handkerchief was found by my brother officer, Paas.</p>
               <p>Q. In Pamphlet's house did you find anything but the handkerchief - A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday evening, the 1st of January, I went with the other officers. We secured the prisoners. I searched the lodgings of Spicer, after the other officers had taken away the principal part. I looked among the fragments. I found some things which have since been sworn to, in the house of Spicer, and two trifling things in the house of Butler, which have been given up to the servants.</p>
               <p>- LAVENDAR. I accompanied my brother officers to Spicer's house at Chelsea, and found a number of things I produce now. In the mean time, Butler's wife had got away. Gillmore and I went in pursuit of her. We met her coming out of her house with a bundle in her hand, which I observed Gillmore took possession of. That is here. We accompanied her to her apartment in the upper story. I found some trifling things there belonging to Mr. Ousby, which are now present.</p>

            's Defence. These things that were found in my possession. On Thursday morning, about half past six o'clock, I was going to Covent Garden market to buy some greens and potatoes, for my wife to sell. On my going up by the Five Fields, I saw by the side of the bank, a bundle. I went to it, and picked it up. I took it home to my wife. She said, what have you got there. I said, a bundle. This was about half past six o'clock, on Thursday morning. I left it at home until I came back from market. We took the things out of the bundle; it was very dirty. My wife's sister took some of it home to wash. My wife had not time to do it being busy in her shop. These things were hanging up in the out-house which the officer called the pigsty; it is an out-house, which any body can see what is in it, passing along the road; and these things, which my wife took to pledge, thinking they were her own, as I picked it up on the highway. She thought it was her own, as I had told her that I picked it upon the highway.</p>
               <p>John Butler's Defence. I work at the new Strand bridge. On Thursday morning, my brother called on me to go to Covent Garden, to bring home greens and potatoes. I was behind. He went forward. He said he picked up a bundle. He took it home to his own house. That is all I know about it.</p>

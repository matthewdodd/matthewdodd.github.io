                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, at 5, St. John's-row, Hoxton. On the morning of 15th July, about 4 o'clock, I was aroused by the Police—I had secured the house overnight—the windows were all down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160068"></xptr>
               <p>but I am not aware whether the back parlour window was fastened—I bad a wooden cash box on the shop counter, it was painted a dark mahogany colour—when I went into the shop, after being roused by the police, I missed the cash box; it had contained from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards missed a silver watch, which hung over the back parlour mantelpiece—I did not miss that till it was brought to the station with the money—I found the back window up—(<hi rend="italic">a piece of charred wood with a lock attached was produced</hi>)—I have applied my key to this lock and it unlocks it—it appears to have been charred—both the male prisoners have been in my employ, the elder one till about five weeks before this transaction, and George left the day before this hap<lb></lb>pened—the back parlour window looked into the yard; it was not fastened and any one from outside could lift it up; but they must go through the yard, and get over the cistern.</p>

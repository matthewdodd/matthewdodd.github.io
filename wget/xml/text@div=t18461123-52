                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, and live in Chapel-street, Totten<lb></lb>ham Court-road—on Saturday afternoon, 3rd Oct., about five o'clock I went into a coffee-shop in Mill-street—the prisoner was sitting there—I asked him to let me pass him—he refused—I tried gently to pass him—he pushed me out—I said, if you do not let me pass, "I will give you a slap in the face"—he said, "Do it"—I told him to put down the knife—he had an eating knife in his hand—he was eating when I came in—he put the knife on the table—I struck him slightly on the face with my open hand, and went back a few paces, and he took up the knife and followed me with it in his hand—there was a man named Morriss there—the prisoner made a deliberate thrust at me with the knife, and stabbed me in the side, between the ribs—I was taken to a doctor's, and then to the hospital—the prisoner went with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a caftman. I was in the coffee-shop when Onslow came in—I was facing the prisoner at the end of a settle—Onslow asked the prisoner to get up to let him come by—he said, "If you put that knife down I will come by"—he put the knife down, and Onslow hit him a back-handed slap in the face, and went back some distance—the prisoner took up the knife, followed him to the door, and stabbed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital. On the 3rd of Oct. Onslow came there—I examined him, and found a wound on the left side of his chest, directly over the heart, not penetrating into the chest, but gliding upwards, beneath the muscles, to the depth of between two and three inches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What made it necessary that he should remain in the hospital so long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was necessary to watch the symptoms with great care, lest the membranes of the chest should become inflamed—when he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184611230048"></xptr>
               <p>to the hospital I asked how it happened—as far as I recollect, it was said to have taken place in a scuffle—I do not remember his telling me it was not done for the purpose, but that is the impression on my mind—the wound is not quite healed—I did not keep the wound open to prevent inflammation <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the membrane—I let it heal as quickly as it could—that is the way to pre<lb></lb>vent inflammation of the membrane.</p>

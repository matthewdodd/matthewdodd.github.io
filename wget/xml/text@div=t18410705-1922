                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, living in Brown Bear<lb></lb>alley, East Smithfield. I came down at sue o'clock in the morning of the 6th of July, and found the kitchen-door locked—I had left it locked when I went to bed, but the key had been taken from the outside and put inside—I attempted to force the door—I and another man lodger forced the door right off the hinges, and the prisoner rushed out of the room—before we forced the door he said, "What do you want here? I have got what I want; I will bring a file of soldiers to you"—he had no business there—I found all the drawers ransacked, the things turned out, and a bundle of clothes tied up with a piece of tape, a sort of strong net like, on the floor, and every thing in the place ransacked; and the tongs laid there, as if they were for his own defence, to attack any body; there was some bread and meat which must have been taken out of the cupboard by him, and in stop<lb></lb>ping to eat it he was detected—he left a cap and a sailor's jacket belong<lb></lb>ing to himself—the articles now produced are mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was there at four o'clock in the morning; there was no one in the place. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> One of my lodgers was out late, and came home at four in the morning—the outside door was left open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. This shawl is my ser<lb></lb>vant's, Mary Kilts—the gowns and table-cloth are mine—the shawl was hanging behind the door, the table-cloth was among the dirty linen, and the bed-gown was hanging on a line to dry; all my children's things were tamed out of the drawers.</p>

I was called to the house, and I saw the prisoner in the evening of that day at the corner of Brown Bear-alley—I told him he was charged with felony—the prosecutor came for<lb></lb>ward and gave him in charge—the prisoner said he merely wanted his jacket and cap that had been left behind—these clothes were lying in the kitchen, tied round with a string—I found a cap and jacket there.</p>

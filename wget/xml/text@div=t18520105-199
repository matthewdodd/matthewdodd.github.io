                  </hi>. My husband's name is William Bennet. On 1st Jan., about 8 o'clock in the evening, I met a young man in Deptford, and went with him to a public-house, and had a glass of rum—the prisoner was at the side of the bar, and could see me—I took a shilling out of my purse, where I had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to pay for the rum—I put the purse back into my dress-pocket—the prisoner was about three yards off, and could see what I did—when I left the house she followed me, and asked me to give her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not give it her—she said she was both hungry and dry, and asked me to give her a pint of half-and-half—we went to another public-house—she took me, saying it was a quiet house; I did not take her—we sat down together, and had a pint of half-and-half—I took twopence out of my purse to pay for it, and put the purse back into a pocket under my dress, not the same pocket—after I had drunk the half-and-half, I became insensible for about half an hour—when I came to I missed my purse—the prisoner was brought into the room, and said, "Will you give me in charge?"—I said, "Yes, you have taken my money"—I was sober; I had had nothing but the rum and half-and-half—I have been ill fifteen months—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. On 1st Jan. I was at the King William public-house, with two of my mates, and saw the prosecutrix and prisoner in the tap-room—they sat down together, and had a pint of half-and-half—we sat at the same table—after they had the half-and-half, the prisoner put her arm round Mrs. Bennet, and took off her bonnet—Mrs. Bennet did not appear to have any senses—I saw the prisoner put a shawl over Mrs. Bennet's dress, and take a purse out of her pocket, and put it into her own bosom—I told my mates of it, and the prisoner made quite a laugh of it—she afterwards came up to us, and asked if there was a back yard, where no one would interfere with her—I thought she was going to run away with the money, and me and another man went to the street-door to prevent her coming out—she went to the back yard, a policeman came, and she was given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with James Atfield, in High-street, Poplar. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 9th of Nov., the prisoner came and purchased a pair of worsted gloves—after she left I missed a short length of ribbon—I followed, and was bringing her back—she sent her daughter back for her brother <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—I went back to the place where I stopped her, and saw her daughter looking about—I stopped to look for the ribbon, and while I did that the prisoner and her daughter got away—I found the ribbon in the street, near where I stopped her—her daugh<lb></lb>ter had not been in our shop—this is our ribbon—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I had seen it there half an hour before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never was in his shop in my life; I was passing the shop; he came and accused me of this. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am quite certain she is the woman—I found this ribbon as near as possible to where she had been standing—it was picked up and given to me—it was about a quarter of an hour from her coming, into my'shop and my catching her—it was very dark.</p>

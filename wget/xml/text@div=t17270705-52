               <p>The Prisoner in her Defence said, That the Fire happened by Accident to take hold of the Child's Cloaths, and that she being out of the Room, it was unfortunately burnt before any one could come to its Assistance. The Court was induced to believe this Account from the following Circumstances: First, Because the Prosecutor could not prove that the Prisoner was conscious or fore apprized of the Accident. And 2dly, It seem'd a Contradiction, That a Woman should in such a Manner contribute, or be any Ways assistant towards the Death of the Child, when at the same Time she took it but for weekly Wages, and by Consequence proposed some Advantage to herself from the Child's Life, but could propose none from its Death; upon which Consideration the Jury <rs id="t17270705-52-verdict253" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Edward Grant, leather seller, of Chiswell-street. On Monday, 8th Dec, the prisoner came to our warehouse, and asked if we purchased pieces of leather—he was told yes, by a young man, in my presence—he showed some leather, which was purchased of him at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a lb.—on the Tuesday he came again, brought some more, walked to the wale, put them in himself; they were weighed and examined, and seemed to be similar to what we had purchased before, and we purchased them—on the Wednesday I was examining the leather at my leisure, valuing the pieces, and then found they were not the description of pieces we were in the habit of buying of upholsterers—they did not appear like upholsterers' cuttings, but appeared as if they were skins which had been cut into pieces for the purpose of sale, not waste pieces—I found I could put them together as whole skins—on the following day I gave information to the police, and on the Friday, at about twenty minutes past 1 o'clock, at which time the prisoner had been in the habit of coming, I had a policeman there—the prisoner came, brought some more pieces, put them into the scale, and I paid him for them—I have a memorandum here of the amount he brought each day (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—Monday, 8th, 21/4 lbs.—9th, 23/4 lbs.—11th, 1lb. 15ozs.—12th, 11/2 lb.—and 13th, Saturday, 23/4 lbs.)—I did not pay him for what he brought on the Saturday—it was all leather of the same description, roan and skiver—he did not give any account of how he became possessed of it—we have been for</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Bartholomew, of Cannon-street. The prisoner has been in his service three or four months; he is an upholsterer—this leather is Mr. Bartholomew's—I gave it him out on the Saturday morning to cover a chair with, and put a mark on it in con<lb></lb>sequence of a communication made to me by Mr. Bartholomew—I had been out of town, and came home the night before—the prisoner had no authority to take anything away.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you a character with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a good character—I do not know that he has been a soldier, and has a piece of silver in his head—I marked the skins I gave the prisoner in a particular way—he bad to cover a chair, but only did the back of it—there are no per<lb></lb>quisites at our house—the prisoner has never sold leather by my direction—I did not before I went out of town desire him to collect the cuttings, and I did not when I came back complain that he had not given me, or my master's son, our proportions—our cuttings have only been sold once since we have been in Coleman-street.</p>

On Friday 12th, I went opposite the counting-house at Mr. Grant's warehouse, and at 20 minutes past 1 o'clock I saw the prisoner come in with some skins—I afterwards saw him go out, and followed him to a public-house in Hoxton, where he joined another roan—I afterwards followed him back again to Mr. Bartholomew's, No. 1, Coleman-street, and I then communicated to my inspector what I had done—that is how we knew where the prisoner worked—on the Saturday, I concealed myself opposite Mr. Bartholomew's, and the prisoner came out at a quarter-past 1—I followed him up Coleman-street and Moorfields, into Rope<lb></lb>maker-street, where he took two rolls out of his trowsers pocket—previous to that I could not see that he had anything—he put them under his arm, went through a court into Cripplegate-street, and then took a third roll out of his coat pocket, and went up Milton-street to a public-house—I waited till he came out—he stopped a second and looked round, and then went to Mr. Grant's, in Chiswell-street, with the three rolls—I afterwards went in.</p>

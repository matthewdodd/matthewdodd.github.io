                  </hi>. I am a coach-painter, and live in New-street, Borough-road. On Sunday evening, the 13th of Sept., I went into the Red Cap public-house, at Camberwell, about eight o'clock—I do not recollect seeing the prisoners there—I got into a quarrel—a man interfered with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and picked up a quarrel with me—I do not know a person named <hi rend="italic">Blind Dick, but</hi> he interfered in my behalf—I first saw the prisoner New at another public-house, the Prince of Wales, in the London-road—I cannot say what time it was, it was between eight, and it might be twelve o'clock—New introduced himself into my company—some conversation passed—I did not see Ball there—I left that second public-house at something like two o'clock in the morning—New was with me, standing in the very same place with me—I had with me a silver watch, a chain, seals, and key, and a purse containing the money stated—while I was in the public-house 1 stood some gin—when I got out I went towards my own home in New-street, Borough-road—I was followed by New and <hi rend="italic">Blind Dick—they</hi> wanted to take me further, to get more drink—an officer interfered, and said I was in bad company—he took me away from them, and passed me on towards the Walworth road—from there I went into a coffee-shop—I was followed in by New—whether Ball was with him I cannot tell—I went in, and New came and sat in the box with me—I cannot recollect whether I saw Ball or no—I did not see him till I was awoke up—I fell asleep there—I am satisfied that I was drugged—I am satisfied I was not drunk before I took the coffee—I was perfectly in my senses—I was perfectly aware I had all my property—before I went into the coffee-shop I pushed my watch-chain inside, and buttoned my coat, and when I awoke my waistcoat was open, and my watch, and money, and purse were all gone, and the men gone to—<hi rend="italic">Blind Dick</hi> was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Cross, who keeps the White Hart coffee-shop in the Walworth-road. About half-past two o'clock that morning I saw the prosecutor come into our coffee-shop—the prisoners Ball and New followed him in—there was no third person came in with them—the prosecutor sat down, New sat down next to him, and Ball sat opposite him, on the other side of the table—I heard the prosecutor say, "Take my money; leave me alone; it is all good; it is more than you can spend to-night; shake it, it is all good"—I saw a purse in New's hand, and heard money rattle—I had not seen the prosecutor have any coffee before that—they had had three cups of coffee—I heard New tell him he had better take his money and put it in his pocket—the prosecutor fell asleep after that—he and the two prisoners seemed to be all three asleep, their heads were all down together—I did not see the prisoners get up and go away—I had never seen Ball before—New had been at our coffee-house before—he did not frequent the house—a witness told me something.</p>

On Monday morning, the 14th of Sept., I was at the White Hart—I saw the prosecutor drunk—I saw New—I do not recollect Ball—there was another man between New and the prosecutor—there were three men altogether about the prosecutor—I saw a person not in custody trying the prosecutor's pockets—that was in presence of the other two men—I should say they must have seen what the other was doing—they then all three left the prosecutor—New went out first—the other two followed immediately after—the prosecutor was asleep at the time—I saw the other man feeling at his pockets—while his pocket was being felt New observed that I was watching, and he made a motion to me to look another way—I gave information to the waiter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, of Cardiff. In July last, I was in London, and on the 30th, I went to Woolwich—a gentleman addressed me on board the boat—some conversation took place, and when I got on shore at Woolwich he asked me to go and have a glass of ale with him before we parted—after some persuasion, I went with him to Mr. Murray's, the Gun Hotel, into a room upstairs, in which there was nobody else—I had one glass of ale, and after I had drank it, the prisoner came in alone, and after that, another man came in and introduced a ring for sale to the whole three—no one would buy it, and he immediately introduced three cards—the prisoner and the one who was in the bout with me got betting, and wanted me to bet—I said no, as I had left my purse in London—they got from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw which was the black card when he laid it down, and saw some money and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note pass between them—I said, "I know which is the card"—they said, "Why do not you bet if you know the card?" both the prisoner and the man who was in the bout—I said, "I have no money"—they said, "You have got a watch and chain," and I took my watch and chain off and laid them on the table—while I was doing that, I lost sight of the cards which were lying on the table all the time—after I had put my watch and</p>

               <p>chain down, I turned up the card, and it happened to be the wrong one—I was completely overcome, and did not know what to do, and the person who was in the boat with me saw that I was in distress of mind, and said that it would be doing him and me a great favour if the prisoner would take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch and chain—the prisoner said, "If you will call on me at High-street, Paddington, and bring me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you can remit me the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when you get home—I immediately went to my uncle's, and from there to the Arsenal, but was not able to find him—I immediately left Woolwich for London, went to Paddington, but could not find any High-street there; I inquired at a great many shops—I saw nothing of the prisoner till I was called to Woolwich at the latter end of August—he was then in custody, and my watch was shown to me in court in the prisoner's presence by an officer—this is it; it is worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the chain about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

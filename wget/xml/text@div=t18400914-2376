                  </hi>. I am butler, in the service of John Alphonso Doxat, of Layton, in Essex, in the parish of Low Layton. On Monday the 16th of September I came down a little after six o'clock to open the house</p>

               <p>—it might be ten minutes after, or it might be only six—I found the kit<lb></lb>chen door unchained and unlocked, but not open—there was a bottle of orange wine on the mat close to the door—the store-room door was broken open—the lock had been burst—two holes were cut in the door at each bolt, top and bottom—by getting into the store-room they could get all over the house—I missed from the store-room a silver funnel, a snuffer-tray, tea-spoons from the kitchen, and two pairs of boots—about an hear after, the prisoners were brought to the house by the gardener—the constable came and took a silver spoon out of Griffiths's pocket, and a pair of boots were found on his feet, belonging to one of the young gentleman—he said they were his own—I found an old pair of boots left in the hall which do not belong to the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener in the prosecutor's service. I was in a field adjoining the house soon after six o'clock in the morning of the 16th, and saw the prisoners get over the prosecutor's wall, leading from the dairy to the lawn, in a direction from the house—they ran across the lawn and over the walk—I ran across the field and headed them—they got over a fence—I turned them back, and they ran towards Temple Mills, and hid themselves in a hedge—I lost them—I went to the railroad, and gave information, and saw the railroad men tracing them—before I could get up they were secured—I took a clasp-knife From the hand of East.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's under-gardener. In con<lb></lb>sequence of what Green told me, I went after Noyce, and saw the prisoners about three-quarters of a mile from the house coming down a field from the railway—they passed me on the road—Griffiths had lime on his coat—I turned round and said, "You are the men I want"—they made a start, and got over the ditch—I attempted to get over the ditch—East put his hand in his pocket, and said, "You b———, if you come here I will stab you"—they crossed the marsh, and I after them—the railroad men took East, and I took Griffiths—before I got up to him he threw something away on his right hand, and something on the left into the river—a tea-spoon was picked up, and I afterwards went with the police-constable and found a gimlet exactly on the spot in the river where he threw something, and that exactly fitted the hole in the door—I saw the sifter found on him—I went to the river to a hay-stack, where" I first accosted them, and there found a pair of boots.</p>

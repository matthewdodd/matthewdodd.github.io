                  </persName>. I keep the Queen Elizabeth public-house, 61, Asylum Road, Peckham—the prisoner was a customer of mine; between the 19th or 30th May he brought me this cheque on the Birkbeck Bank, dated 19th May, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable to Henry Gilham, and signed Frank Dorrington—he asked me to change it—I said "Is it all right?"—he said "Yes"—I had previously changed a cheque of his wife's—I changed this for him, and paid it into the London and Westminster Bank; it was returned unpaid on 30th May—I wrote to the prisoner and he wrote back this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed by the prisoner, stating that he would call on the prosecutor on Monday.</hi>) I afterwards saw him; he said he was sorry, and asked me to wait a little while, I consented to do so, and I afterwards received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner, stating that he had paid some momey in and. requesting the prosecutor to present the cheque again.</hi>) I paid it into my bankers again, and it was again returned unpaid—I then received this letter, dated 2nd July, making excuses, and a week or two afterwards I took out a warrant—I saw the prisoner again, he still promised to pay; he told me his child had been buried—I afterwards heard that there were more of his cheques about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cheque be brought before was not drawn in his wife's name, but he represented it as a cheque of her trustee—he told me he had a separate income from her, and I have no reason to doubt it—he came in occasionally to see me about the cheque—I don't know whether he had any beer; very likely—I should not have taken these proceedings</p>

I keep the Cripplegate Tavern and know the prisoner as a customer—on 30th June, he came in and asked me if I could oblige him with change for a small cheque, as he had been very poorly and had not been able to get out to get to the bank before closing hours—I said I did not mind obliging him under the circumstances—he asked for a pen and ink, took his cheque-book out and drewthis cheque. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated June</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th, on the Birkbech Bank; pay self 21., F. Dorrington.</hi>) I paid that into the London and County Bank, and it was returned unpaid—I wrote to the prisoner telling him so, and that unless I had the cash for it very shortly I should take some preceedings—he wrote this answer produced. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he thought he had sufficient money to meet the cheque, and that if it was paid in again on Tuesday morning there would be twenty times the amount to meet it.</hi>) I paid it in again on Tuesday, and it was again returned to me—I waited in expectation of seeing him, and in the mean time this letter came. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner, stating that he was going to pay in a country cheque, but it would be two or three days before it would be placed to his credit, and that he would call on the prosecutor.</hi>) I did not see him after that—I have never been paid.</p>

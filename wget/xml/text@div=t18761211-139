                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Gant, a labourer, and live at 60, (Croydon House), Barking Road, Trenton—I left my house on the 11th of June and went into the country—I left safe in the house a shawl, a mole-skin waistcoat, and a pair of water-tight boots—the boots were very much like what my husband has now on his feet—I came back on the 6th and the things were gone—the prisoner lodged there—he did not tell me he was going—he had not a change of clothes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> Your mother told me you had nothing but a bed rolled up against the wall—you used to dress in a light jacket, a a pair of trousers, and a cheesecutter hat; you had no water-tight boots—I never saw you dressed otherwise.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Star Street, Trenton—my house is opposite where the prisoner lived—on Whit-Monday afternoon I was at my window about 3 o'clock; my landlady was at the door talking to her friend—when she shut her door a young man came of Mrs. Gant's house with a large sack; he dragged it by his side into Church Street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am sure it was not 10 o'clock in the morning, but 3 o'clock in the afternoon as I was going out for a walk to West Ham Park, and did not go because it came over dull.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 29). I live at Plaistow—I apprehended the prisoner on 27th November—I charged him with stealing a quantity of wearing apparel from No. 3, Star Street, Barking New Road—he said that he knew nothing about it—on the way to the station he said that he took a sack, but not the other things—he said he took it to put his shirt in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not say I took a sack to put my shirt in. I lived with my parents in the house, but could not obtain work and left there to go to Primrose Hill, where I heard there was work. I doubled the sack up under my arm after putting in it a few things of my own. John Blake charged me with stealing a coat, but neither he nor the coat is here.</p>

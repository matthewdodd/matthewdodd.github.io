On Sunday evening. the 6th of April, about ten o'clock, I was going to see my sister, who was dangerously ill - she lives in Green Arbour-court, between Golden-lane and Goswell-street; instead of passing through the court I went through the <placeName id="t18281023-1-crimeloc4">Queen's Head public-house</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where was the landlord's son at this time? A. He was present, near me; and when the scuffle ensued he said,"You had better let the man alone - I know him - he is going to his sister's;" I had told him I was going there on my first entering the house - she lives within fifteen yards of where the hat was taken from me; I did not know Donohough before - there was nobody with him when he took my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men do you think rushed out of the taproom? A. I should think five or six or more; I did not know any of them, to be acquainted with them: I am positive Cotterell is one of those who rushed out of the room- when they all came round me I scuffled with them; they lifted my legs from under me, and carried me into the skittle-ground - I was laid hold of in all parts, and tumbled about, and being struck at the time; I cannot say what part of me they laid hold of in particular, except my legs: I called out - the landlord came, but they had got me on the ground then; they kept me on the ground; as soon as the landlord came I knew his voice, and said would he allow a man to be robbed and ill-treated in that manner - he asked me what my name was; I told him, and he said he did not know me - I said, "If you do not know me then, tell my brother Eatly, who is so close by (he is my sister's husband); he said I might be d - d, or something to that effect, and I must get out of it in the best manner I could; my shoes were off then: I was held by the legs, and beat on the heel of my left foot, to hinder me from hallooing, the pain was so intense, that after a short time I became quite senseless - I was kicked about the loins and the side of my head, and my lip was cut in getting me into the skittle-ground: they took from me there, a blue surtout coat and a pair of shoes - my money was in my waistcoat pocket; they tore my waistcoat off my back: while they were stripping me I was held by the handkerchief, by Cotterell, and he was threatening me during the time, that if I made resistance they would finish me; I told them to take what they liked, but not prevent my getting more (meaning not to hinder me from work) - they left me; and as soon as I recovered, which I suppose was in a few minutes, I got to the door, and got out, but when I got to the door leading from the house to the court, (having nothing on but my trousers, stockings, and shirt,) they kicked me into the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were all about the place, though not near you? A. They were in different places; one was about the door - I was kicked into the gutter, they saying at the time, "You b - r, we wish we had finished you;" I got up, and said, "I don't care - I have got out safe;" I went to my sister's door - I was bruised about my side, and hurt in the face, but not disabled from doing my business, it not being hard labour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had any thing been done to you when the landlord came? A. My shoes had been taken off, and I was on the ground, on my back, when the landlord spoke to me; I am quite positive of that - he was barely a minute talking to me; this was in the skittle-ground: a glimmer of light came into the skittle-ground at the time the landlord came - a candle was brought in; I am positive of that - I think I mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230004"></xptr>that at the last trial; I have not read what I stated then - I am positive I mentioned it before the Magistrate; it was quite dark of course, but the candle came in and went away - it did not remain there; I believe it was a woman who had it: I said I could not see Donohought assisting to take off my clothes - I will not be certain that I mentioned about the candle on the last trial, as I omitted many trifling things, and made it as short as I could; I do not think I was asked the question - I said I was senseless for a short time; it was a kind of fainting: when they took my property they left me - I cannot say they ran, as I was lying in a dormant state; when I came to myself they were gone from the spot - I had seen Cotterell in the passage; he was one of those who joined at the time I was struggling with Donohough for my hat: I suppose there were five, six, or seven in the passage, or more - the landlord's son was looking on; there was a light from the bar - the passage runs down by the side of the bar, which has a counter and a window, which forms a partition; I have known the landlord eighteen or twenty years. Nothing had been done to me when I struck Donohough, except my hat being taken; I was too much confused to see whether they were drunk or sober: my sister left her room a minute or two after I got there - I cannot say whether she went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Donohough took your hat before you struck him? A. Yes; when they gave me these blows on the ground I became insensible; when I came to myself I got up to go away, but as I came out they kicked me into the gutter; I cannot speak to Mawley, but there is another not in custody, who I know.</p>

            . My father kept the Queen's Head - he now keeps a potato-shop; I am a lapidary. -On Easter Sunday, the 6th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, Holland went through the house - he did not speak to me, nor say any thing about his sister; as he came by the bar, going out into Green Arbour-court, Donohough took his hat off - I said "Give the man his hat, or else I will tell the officers of you;" there were no blows struck: I did not see Holland strike him - Holland did not call out for help.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see done? Who came out? A. They were all standing in the passage - I cannot say how many came out of the tap-room; there were five of them altogether: I told the officers who they were - I had seen them coming to the house several times; after Donohough took Holland's hat, he was trying to save it from going - they took hold of him and brought him towards the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by "They"? A. The thieves who took hold of him and pulled him to the yard door, are not taken: I saw both the prisoners in the passage that night - they stood in the passage; they took hold of me and stopped me from going into the tap-room to tell my father that Holland was being robbed - I heard no words used.</p>
               <p>Q. Not about "Entrails"? you have been examined before. On your oath did you hear nothing about entrails and kicking? A. There was no kicking at all - I have sworn they said "If you speak a word, I will kick your entrails out."</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying you did not hear it? A. I thought you meant if they said it to Holland, they said it to me - I told them to let the man alone; they were then pulling his clothes off, between the passage and the yard door; they took hold of his coat, pulled him to the yard door, and pulled off his coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when they pulled off his clothes? A. Banks was - he had hold of Holland: the two prisoners kept me from going into the tap-room; I said "Let him alone, because his sister lives in the neighbourhood;" he had not told me he was going to his sister's, but I often saw him going to his sister's, and I thought he was going there when he came through the house - they also took his shoes off; the tap-room is parted from the bar and the passage.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing to the prosecutor while he was on the ground? A. No: after they took his clothes off, they shoved him down; he was not in the skittle-ground at all, nor within several yards of it - that is the whole truth; I had seen the five or six men in my father's house before, but not to stop, not to sit down to drink - they have drunk at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were quite sober? A. Yes; I was there all the time and am certain Holland was not within many yards of the skittle-ground - he was about six yards from it; my father was not present during any part of the transaction - he did not converse with Holland; he knew nothing of it - I was within three yards of Holland.</p>

               <p>Q. Could your father be conversing with Holland for a minute and a half, while he was on the ground, without your seeing it? A. No - he never came there at all, or I must have seen it; I saw Holland at the time his hat was taken off - he did not strike any one then - he could not have struck Donohough two blows in the face without my seeing him; he could have gone to his sister's, without going through our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cotterell, during this affair, touch Holland at all, or lay violent hands on him? A. He did not, because he had hold of me at the time, to keep me from going to my father; they went away after the transaction - Mrs. Eatly let her brother in, and came into our house in about four minutes; Cotterell was not in the house then - I did not see her conversing with him; I saw her all the time she was in the house - she did not converse with Cotterell at all while she was in the house - that is the truth; she could not converse with him without my seeing her. The young men had been in the house about an hour and a half, before Holland came - they had been drinking ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they not been larking about the skittle-ground, with some women of the town? A. No - there were no women at all; they had been shoving each other about the passage, and saying, "I will treat you - I will stand a pot, and you shall stand a pot:" the direct road to Green Arbour-court is through Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know when Mawley was apprehended? A. No; it was a long time after the robbery; I had seen him before the offence, but never afterwards till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you live with your father? A. No - he lives in Whitecross-street - I saw him last night.</p>

            . I am Holland's sister, and live in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230005"></xptr>Green Arbour-court. There is a small narrow alley leading to the house, which two people cannot pass through, or they may go through this house; my brother came to my house on Easter Sunday, about a quarter-past ten o'clock - I was ill at the time; I let him in - he had nothing on but his trousers, stockings, and shirt - no shoes, coat, or waistcoat; he was dirty and his trousers torn - he seemed very much beaten, and as if he had been on the ground; his face was scratched and he had a little scratch on his lip - he told me what had happened when I let him in - I ran to the public-house directly, and called the landlord out of the bar; there were several persons about him - I asked him if he knew any thing of the robbery, and my brother losing his things; he said he knew nothing of it - he was very saucy indeed, and very much in liquor; he called his son and asked if he knew any thing of it, and he said No - he then called the pot-boy, who said he knew nothing of it; I went away - Blower's father came to me next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you see Cotterell there? A. I did - he came up to me and said he knew nothing about it; he came to my house next day, and said he heard I represented him as one of the party, and had come to ask why I said so - my husband was at breakfast and could have taken him, but young Blower had not given his name then: I knew Cotterell before - he is a neighbour, and worked with my husband, (who is a bricklayer) he knew where I lived, and I suppose knew I was Holland's sister.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When the landlord called his son, he said he knew nothing about it? A. Yes; he denied all knowledge of the fact, and the person Mawley was taken about five weeks ago.</p>

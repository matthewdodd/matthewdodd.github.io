                  </hi>. On 31st October I was lodging at Mr. Weeks', 175, Liverpool Road, Islington, and on that afternoon, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I locked up my valuables in this iron safe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my apart<lb></lb>ment—there were three diamonds, several rings, two diamond rings, an opal ring, and other articles, and 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, silver, and copper—there were also some photographs there—the value of the jewellery was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this ruby ring, these other rings, these fifteen Cape rubies, this diamond ring, and these two big loose diamonds belong to me—one loose diamond and some rings are still missing—these photographs were sent me from Germany—my brother's writing is on the back of them—all those things were locked up in the safe—I returned at a few minutes before 12 o'clock, and the safe was gone—I did not see it till I got it at the police station.</p>

I have never entered by the front door without a key—at one time I found that the door would open without the use of a key—I once came home about 9 o'clock at night, and there was no one in the house; I was rather fidgetty about it, and tried the door whether it was shut, and it gave way—it would open with a push—the landlord said he would repair it—I do not know whether he did—I have lost three diamonds; that was all I had—I never pledged any diamonds—I think I have pledged diamond rings—I do not recollect the date, but I should say a week or fortnight before the robbery—I only pledged one diamond ring—I have not pledged other diamonds—I do not recollect pledging a ring on 2nd October—I may have pledged one on 19th October, but do not recol<lb></lb>lect it—I mean to speak the truth—I do not recollect pledging rings on 19th and 20th October; I might have done so—I lost between 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it might have been even more—I don't know when I bought these diamonds—I have the invoice here—it was on 23rd October.</p>

On 31st October I was living at Mr. Weeks', 175, Liverpool Road—on that day I hung up the key of the front door at the corner of the dresser in the kitchen—Pearce was there about 3 o'clock that afternoon, and after he had gone I looked for the key and it was not there—I have not seen it since—on the same afternoon after tea I went to Mr. Hayter's room and it was safe—I saw Mrs. Weeks go out that night about 8.30—I went out at the same timer—I do not sleep there—no one was left in the house—the street-door was closed.</p>

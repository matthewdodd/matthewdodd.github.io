                  </hi>. I live at 86, Burford Street, Birmingham, and am an iron bedstead maker—I am brother-in-law of Mr. B. W. Overson, a japan<lb></lb>ner, of Birmingham—Mr. Overson is very ill, and unable to attend—he has broken a blood vessel, I have a doctor's certificate—on the 19th April, I went to 12, Cannon Street, Whitechapel, and there saw Solomons and Abraham Aaron—I asked Solomons if the governors were in—he said, "No"—I said "Is the manager in?"—he said "No"—I said "Then you are not the manager?"—he said "No, I am merely a clerk, what is your business?"—I said, "I have come from Birmingham concerning a little hardware goods, I have been recommended by a firm in Birmingham to you, and most probably I may do some business with you"—he said, "In what kind of hardware, we don't have any dealings in hardware goods"—I said I had a friend or two to go to and would be back—I said "What time do you close?"—he said "Seven o'clock"—I said I would be back in an hour—he said "Very well, but you might as well tell me your business, the governors won't be at home either to-night or to-morrow, they are at Brighton"—I said "I won't tell you now, I will come back in an hour"—I came away and saw Mr. Overson, I told him what I had seen and heard, and returned about 5.30—the place was then closed—I went again next morning and saw Solomons, and tendered Mr. Overson's bill for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asked for cash—he said "Oh, I thought you were Over<lb></lb>son, why did not you tell me your business last night, and give me your bill, I would have given you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but there came a party directly after you</p>

               <p>went and I gave it to him"—I said "You must have been very quick in giving it to him, or the party must have been very quick in coming in, for you said you should not be closed till 7.30, and when I came back at 5.30 you were all closed and gone"—he said "Well, you know what a clerk is, when the master is out of course he likes to get an hour to himself if he can"—I said "That is very true, but can you pay this bill?"—he said no; he had not got a farthing belonging to the firm, he did not know what to do as a clerk; "Consider yourself in my position, you would not know what to do yourself"—I left the invoice with him—I said "I do not know what to do, we must have our money, we merely had enough for our expenses to come up, and we have nothing to go down with—he said, "I am very sorry, but I do not know what I can do, but if that is the case I will borrow you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and give you on account, to bear your expenses down to Birmingham"—I said it was no use my taking 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not take it; I left—I went again with Mr. Overson the same day—we saw Solomons, but did not get any money—Solomons offered 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, to pay our expenses down to Birmingham, and said he would send as much money as he could on Satur<lb></lb>day—Mr. Overeon said he could not take that—solomons then said, "Well, I am going out in the course of an hour to collect some money, if I get it, and you take the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and go back to Birmingham to-night, I will send down in the morning for certain what I get"—we then left and did not go back.</p>

About five or six weeks ago the prisoner Francis came to my works at Birmingham, and said he was the son of Mr. Cavender. He ordered some goods of me, and said that on receipt of the goods he would send me the cash; before sending any goods I received a letter by post (marked A). <hi rend="italic">This was dated April</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1870, <hi rend="italic">from C. Cavender &amp; Son, Birmingham and Sheffield Warehousemen, Importers and Exporters of every description of Merchandise, and requesting to know if Mr. Overson intended to execute the order.</hi>) I wrote a reply to that letter, and on Saturday, the 9th instant, I forwarded a crate of goods to Cavender &amp; Son, Cannon Place, Whitechapel Road, the address Francis gave me; three days after I received the letter produced (marked B). (<hi rend="italic">This was from Cavender &amp; Son, and acknowledged the receipt of the crate, and requested the remainder to be sent as quickly as possible.</hi>) On that day I sent another crate of goods, and on the next day I forwarded two more crates of goods, all to the same address. On the 13th I received the letter C; and on the 18th instant I received the letter D. (<hi rend="italic">These requited duplicate invoices to be sent, and stated that a cheque for the amount should be forwarded on Tuesday next.</hi>) I also received a telegram (marked E). <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> 'Both Mr. Cavenders are out of town; will telegraph them, and very likely send some to-morrow.' All the crates were full of japanned goods, and were well worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have never received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020008"></xptr>
               <p>any payment for any of the goods. I expected a remittance on the 14th instant, as my terms were cash.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After Charles Aaron was in custody he asked me to take the money. I refused. Francis asked me to do the same. I sent a telegram to Cavender on the 13th instant. I told Francis I must have immediate cash to pay my workpeople. Signed, Benjamin William Overson."</p>

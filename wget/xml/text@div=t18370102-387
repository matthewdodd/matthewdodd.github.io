In consequence of information, on the night of the 31st of December, I went towards Mr. Gale's just before three 0'clock in the morning—i was crying "past two"—i went to the shop, and found a window forced open—i saw two saws lying on the ledge of the window, not outside—powell, who was with me, took them up—i waited a little time while he was gone to fetch a light, and the prisoner bolted out of the window, and tried to escape, but I secured him.</p>

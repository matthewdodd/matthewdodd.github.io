            . On the 22d of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw two men standing in the carriage-way in Fitzroy-square, wrapping something in a white cloth. I went up, and one ran away - it was quite dark; the other dared me with a shout - I tried to take hold of him, but he ran away, and threw the things over a wooden paling. I did not see what it was, but it rattled like plate, as I thought. I followed him, calling Stop thief! to the end of Carburton-street; he then came back. I waited till he came up to me - we made a blow at each other; I then followed him across the street, knocked him down, and nearly fell myself, and on recovering, saw him in the hands of the watchman. I left, and cannot say whether it was the prisoner.</p>

               <p>JOHN WHALES. I am a constable. I heard an alarm at the end of the street - the watchman was holding the prisoner. I took him into a shop, and searched him, and in his pocket found the brass nozzle of a lustre, and four cut glass drops - a watchman of the square gave me four more drops; and after taking the prisoner from the office to the watch-house, between nine and ten o'clock at night, in a passage which goes through the square, I found this lustre - the brass nozzle corresponds with it, and belongs to the fellow one.</p>

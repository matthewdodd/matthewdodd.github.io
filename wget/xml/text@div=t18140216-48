On the 2nd of February, I locked my shop up at half after ten o'clock at night; I was called up on the morning of the 3rd of February, at four o'clock, by the patrol. I went to my shop; I saw the tiles had been taken off; there was a hole big enough for a man to get in, and four shutters were taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken out of your shop - A. A haunch of mutton, two shoulders, one quarter, and seven smaller pieces; they were hung up in the shop upon hooks, and two iron hooks were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money in the shop - A. There were six or seven pennyworth of halfpence; they were gone; they were in the drawer. On the 3rd I saw my mutton again at Shadwell office; I knew it to be my mutton.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the mutton - A. About thirty shillings.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the night of the 2nd of February, I met the prisoner; he asked me the way to Bishopsgate-street, he had a bag with him. I asked him what was in the bag; he said, beef; he said a woman employed him to carry it. I took him across the way to a watch-box where there was a light; I told the watchman; he said, he must go to the watchhouse. He threw down the bag and the meat; I pursued him, and took him to the watchhouse. The watchman brought the bag and the meat to the watchhouse. When I brought the prisoner to the watchhouse I saw the bag contained mutton; there was a hind quarter, a haunch, two shoulders, and several small bits, and two hooks also.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure the mutton was mine; there is no doubt of the books being mine, I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been nineteen years serving his Majesty; I get my living by portering, or any thing of this kind. I was employed to carry the meat to the Green Dragon, Bishopsgate-street.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH MOREN. I live at Walham Green, near Fulham. On Saturday, the 14th of November, I first observed the prisoner at Little Chelsea, about a quarter before twelve o'clock. I observed him go into every shop almost he came to, public-houses and chandler's shops, and appearing like a traveller I suspected him to be passing bad money, I went forward to the next public-house, expecting he would come in the same as he had at the other houses. It was the Queen Elms public-house, kept by a person of the name of Easton. He came in as I expected, and called for a pint of beer. He offered a shilling. I took particular notice of the shilling, because I had suspicion of him. It was a crooked shilling. The woman refused the shilling. The prisoner said, he had no other money, therefore he could not have the beer, or would not. I cannot be sure which word he said. She delivered him back the shilling, and took the beer from him. The prisoner went out down the road, towards London. My suspicious were increased, and I followed him. I saw him go into the next chandler's shop, kept by a Mrs. Vincent. He went in, and staid there a very short time. Upon his coming out of that shop I went into Mrs. Vincent's. I there saw a shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020006"></xptr>which Mrs. Vincent shewed me. It was a similar shilling to the one I saw in the public-house. It was evidently a bad one. I desired her to put it in paper, and to keep the man in her recollection that had just gone out. I continued to follow him until he went into another chandler's shop, not far distant from Mrs. Vincent's. I endeavoured to avoid his seeing me. The next chandler's shop he went into was opposite of the Admiral 
               <persName id="t18121202-5-person104">Keppel</persName>
            . I went into the Admiral 
               <persName id="t18121202-5-person105">Keppel</persName>
            . I told the landlord my suspicion. I then came out, and went into the chandler's shop. I found a shilling had been offered there. The woman told me that he had offered a bad shilling. I then went over to the Admiral 
               <persName id="t18121202-5-person106">Keppel</persName>
             again. I then saw a shilling in the landlord's hand, (his name is Bailey), which perfectly resembled the other shilling I had seen, from its being crooked, with a hole in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other shillings that you have been talking of, each of them a hole in them too - A. The one at the chandler's shop had; the first. Mr. Bailey has kept that shilling ever since. I believe I saw it at Marlborough-street. The prisoner was in the tap-room of the Admiral 
               <persName id="t18121202-5-person107">Keppel</persName>
            . I detained the prisoner, and sent for a constable. He wished to go into the yard. I said, I could not object to that. I said, I would go with him. I did; and during our stay there, he said he would give me all the money he had got, if I would let him escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you previous to this made him acquainted with the charge you had against him - A. Yes. I told him that I had observed his actions for some distance along the road, and that I was determined to stop the passing any more bad money. I believe the words I made use of were, to stop him in his career. The officer came in near two hours. I was with the prisoner all the time. I never took my eye off him. As soon as the officer came I beckoned the prisoner out of the tap-room, where he was sitting in. I had brought him from the yard into the tap-room, and then I took him into the back parlour to search him. I took off his hat, and in it I found fifteen bad shillings. There was in his hat a woman's huswife, what women keep thread in, a dirty bit of a brown bag, and some tobacco. Twelve of the shillings were wrapped up in a paper parcel, tied round with a string, and the three others, making the fifteen, were in a bit of paper, by themselves. The twelve shillings were wrapped up in paper, with paper between them, so as to prevent their rubbing. The three had no pieces of paper between them. I then took him to Marlborough-street office. He was there searched in my presence, I having searched no farther than his hat. There were forty sixpences found upon him, good money. I deliver the shillings that I took. The fifteen I found upon him are exactly similar.</p>

            . On the 14th of November the prisoner came to my house, between twelve and one, alone. He called for a glass of ale. He asked me what it was. I told him, two-pence. He then made an attempt to put his hand into his pocket, and produced a shilling and a penny. He said, one penny would not pay two-pence. He then pretended to feel in his pocket for more halfpence, as I supposed. He then gave me a shilling. I took it, and turned away to go to the bar for change. The last witness, Moren, was just coming in the front door. He said, has he called for any thing. I said, yes. The prisoner was in the tap-room. I looked at the shilling, and the shilling was a bad one I knew. It was a crooked shilling, with a hole in it. That shilling has never been out of my sight. I am sure it is the same shilling that I received of the prisoner. There is a bit of silk I tied in it five minutes after I received it.</p>

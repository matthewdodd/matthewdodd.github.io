On the night of the 9th of April, about ten o'clock, I locked up my money as usual, in my iron chest, which is in a small counting-house adjoining the shop. I put in a 40 l. Bank note, three 10 l. Bank notes, fifteen sovereigns, and a half-sovereign; there was a great deal more money there before, a quantity of silver, and my cash box. I locked the chest, and took the key up to my bed room. The prisoner slept in the shop to protect the property. I was unwell on the morning of the 10th, and Mr. Lewis, my junior clerk came up and fetched the key - I delivered it to him about nine o'clock; it was not out of my possession till then. About three quarters of an hour after, I went into the shop; the prisoner was not there - I asked for him; he had no business to leave the shop. I did not see him again till his appreheasion, on the 29th of April. I went to the chest about as hour after I went into the shop, and then missed this money, which consisted of the cash taken on the previous day. I found the chest open; it is usual to leave it open in the day time. The bowl in which this money had been put was gone - I did not know the numbers of the notes, but should know the 40 l. note, from a mark which was on it.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Davies's service, as cashier. It is my business to take the money, and hand it over to him at night. On the morning of the 10th of April, about nine o'clock, I went up to Mr. Davies for the key of the chest. Before that the prisoner had asked me for the key, as he said he wished to make out some bills; he asked me twice to get it - the first time was about eight o'clock, and again about half an hour after. When I had the key I unlocked the chest, and took out the silver and copper - I left the safe open, and did not go to it afterwards. I left the prisoner in the counting-house, and saw him take a book out of the chest - I was out about half an hour, leaving him there. Mr. Davies went to the safe afterwards - I do not know in what state he found it.</p>

               <p>"Ah! Hill!" I recognized him as Mr. Davies's servant; I sent for the prosecutor, and told him the charge - he said nothing, but as we were taking him from the office, he said voluntarily, that he had one of the best of masters in the world, and what could have induced him to do so, he could not tell.</p>

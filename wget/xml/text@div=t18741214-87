                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Parfett, of Feltham—on 5th November, at 5 p.m., he had a sheep named <hi rend="italic">Billy,</hi> in a small paddock ad<lb></lb>joining the kitchen garden—about 7.10 the next morning I went there and found nothing but the fore quarters and the head—I communicated with the police, and Cooper went with me to the paddock—we compared the skin with a part of it which had been brought from Staines, and the two portions corresponded—there is no doubt that they belonged to the same carcase.</p>

                  </hi>. On the last day of November I was with Reed, the carman, leading a horse on the Charlton Road about 9 p.m.—I felt a weight on the back of the cart, and found a-man there—I should not know him—I told him he must get off—he went to the other side of the road, and I never saw him afterwards—I put my hand to the back of the cart and felt part of a sheep—I then brought Reed to the back of the cart, and we sent for the police, and gave them the sheep—while the police were at the Spell<lb></lb>thorne Inn the prisoner came up, looked at the sheep, and said "If you want me you know where to find me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear whether Reed had said anything to him—it was a very wet night, and we had been on the road from 3 a.m. till 9 p.m.—it was a market gardener's cart laden with dung—it had been rain<lb></lb>ing part of the time, and the roads were wet and muddy—there was a ladder</p>

                  </hi>. On 30th November the boy who was with me coming home spoke to me, and I went to the back of the cart and found the hind part of a sheep—we went on to the Spellthorne Inn, and going along I saw a man following us; he kept at one distance behind us, and when we stop<lb></lb>ped at the inn he came up, and it was the prisoner—I asked him whether he was the man who put the sheep on the cart, he said "No"—I said "It is very strange, you are the man who followed me"—he said "Don't you know me, Joe?"—I said "No"—he said "Don't you know John Green?"—I said "Yes"—he said "That he was at home if he was wanted"—I sent for the police, and gave them the sheep—it was about a mile from Feltham where the boy showed me the sheep in the cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sent the boy to mind the horse and I went to the back of the cart—the man went down the Staines Road—the ladder fixes into the cart on some irons; it is about 6 feet wide, and wider than it is broad—I did not know the prisoner till he said "Don't you know me, Joe?—I knew where he lived—it had been a very wet, soaking day, and I had been on the road ever since 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 199). On the 30th November, about 9 o'clock, I went to the Spellthorne Inn and saw the hind quarters of a sheep, with the skin on and quite warm—in consequence of what I heard I went to the prisoner's house—he looked out of the window, and I was admitted—I asked him if he had been to Feltham; he said "No, he had been to his brother's"—I saw his trousers on the back of a chair by the fire; I examined them, and found spots of blood—I examined his coat, which was on another chair, and saw wool on the collar and on his cap—I told him I should take him on suspicion of stealing a sheep—he made no reply, and I took him in custody—next morning I went to the inn, and in a little paddock at the back of the house I saw the fore quarters of a sheep—the hind quarters were at the station—I saw them compared before the Bench, and they agreed exactly—the skin also matched—I compared the prisoner's boots with the footprints where the sheep was killed, and they corresponded—the nails go right through the waist to the heel, and they are neither square nor round—the boots are now on the prisoner's feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I knocked at the door he came to the window, and asked who was there—I said "Police-constable Simms" and he came down and let me in—he has got the trousers on; he has no others.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 264). I went with Hooper to the Spell<lb></lb>thorne Inn, and saw a sheepskin; we then went to the prisoner's house, and found him undressed—his trousers had been washed as high as the knees, and above that there were marks of fresh blood, and also on his coat—I called his attention to that, and he made no reply—I found this wool (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his coat, and some on his whiskers, and on his cap, which was a woolly one.</p>

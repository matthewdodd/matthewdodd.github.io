               <p>Q. Where was his hat - A. He had his hat off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with him before - A. No; I never saw him before. He was taken with the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You went to a public house in Nightingale lane with a friend - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The sailor was there with his friend - A. I never saw him in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say, when he was charged with this, he took this hat up for his friend's hat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so dark that a man might have mistook the hat, and not have known it was your's - A. Yes. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>- I was going home on that night, about half past nine, I stopped under the gateway; I heard the cry of murder in the street; the rattles sprang in all directions; at that moment the prisoner came by me and went up a court with this stick and a hat, they were concealed under a large jacket, which sailor's wear; he endeavoured to hide himself behind some carts; I catched hold of the stick. When the watchmen came by, I said, you must be the man that they are looking after, and this is an unlawful weapon; then a scuffle ensued between him and me, I still kept hold of the stick; he ran; I cried out stop thief; he was stopped immediately. The prosecutor owned the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. So that stick you call an unlawful weapon - do not you know that is a common stick for a foreign sailor to have - A. That is for the judgment of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. What altercation had taken place before this you do not know - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That old hat is not worth a shilling - A. I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been three weeks in this country. When I came out of the public house we had a few words together, and we had a scuffle; I took the hat for mine as I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

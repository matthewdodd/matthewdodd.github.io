About the 16th of May last the prisoner came and looked out a parcel of goods to the amount of sixty-three pounds, for which he wanted me to give him credit until he had sold them. I told him it never entered into my mind to give any credit whatever. I told him my young man should go with him, and whatever he sold he was to pay him, and whatever he got above the sum I charged to him was to be his profit. I sent my porter with the goods with a charge not to give them up to him upon any account whatever. The goods were cambric, shawls, and long shawls.</p>
               <p>- LLOYD. I am a porter to Mr. Cox. On the 18th of May I took the goods, scarfs, two pieces of cambric, and five silk shawls to the White Bear in Bride-lane. The prisoner then took me to a street in Holborn; he did not sell any there. He then took me to a house in Holborn; he sold ten yards of cambric there, and one scarf. He got the money for it. We came from there to the same house in Bride-lane, Fleet-street; we there sat down together. He asked for the parcel of goods; he said he thought he could sell them to the landlady of the house. He took the goods with him. I did not see any thing of him afterwards. I thought the prisoner long in selling them; I enquired; the landlord told me he had been gone out of the house with the goods some time. The prisoner never returned with the goods or the money.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Bond and his partners; I sleep in the house. I saw this packing-case in the hall; on the 21st of February, about half-past five o'clock. I saw the prisoner come up the yard, and in about five minutes, saw him going down the yard, with the case on a porter's knot; it weighed 2 cwt. - I saw two men come up the yard with him; they went down the yard about a minute before him - I followed, and brought him back with it; I asked where he was going to take it - he said, to Chiswell - street, but did not tell me the number, or which end of the street; he then said he was employed by two persons who had gone down the street, and wished me to go after them, but I did not think proper - he said it was a pity he should get into trouble when he was innocent; I gave him in charge, and said I would go to anybody for him - I opened the case, and all the books were in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see two gentlemen go in with me? A. Yes, they came out before you; he said those gentlemen had employed him - I did not see them when I stopped him, nor afterwards.</p>

            . I am a constable. Clark called me to take the prisoner; he said two persons employed him in Chiswell-street to come and fetch the case from Bond's- he did not say what part of Chiswell-street; he said he was well known at two houses, but when we went there they did not know much of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took me to a public-house where I had been acting as porter for three months, but I owed the landlord 8d., and he said he knew me, but not lately; I lost a situation through getting intoxicated, and now get my living by portering for different gentlemen.</p>

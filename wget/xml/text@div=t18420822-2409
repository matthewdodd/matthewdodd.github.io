                  </hi>. I returned from Richmond on the 14th of July. These drawers are mine—I found them in the tub which I saw Onion go to—they had been in the box, and also this torn handkerchief, and this night<lb></lb>gown—this shawl was in the parlour—they are all mine.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 14th of July I saw this handkerchief on the drawers in Onion's apartment—Mrs. Crow's sister was there, and said it was her sister's handkerchief—Onion said it was not—she said it was very like it—Onion said, was there only one handkerchief of a sort to be bought, and it dropped—she afterwards came over to my place with the handkerchief on her neck—in the course of the afternoon she all of a sud<lb></lb>den snatched it off her neck, and tore the border off—she said she did not like the colour of it—she gave it to me, and wished me to burn it—before she went to Queen-square she asked if I would give up the hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and also when she returned, and would I say that I had lent her different sums of money, and say nothing about the keys—this was in the presence of Mr. Onion's son—she winked at me, and said, "You know, Mrs. Cotter, you lent me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so-and-so, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so-and-so"—I said, "I did nothing of the kind"—she always seemed to have plenty of money—she told me that Mr. Onion was her guardian, not her father—that her father allowed Mr. Onion 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for her, and she went in the name of Osborn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I found this shawl on the stairs, outside the prisoner's room door—this bed-gown was in one of the drawers in the bed-room—all the articles in that drawer were of female apparel—I received this torn handkerchief from Mrs. Cotter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Henry-street, Old Kent-road. On 23rd June, I was at a public-house in High-street, Deptford—I came out about twelve o'clock, and on my way home I saw six or seven men quarrelling—I stopped and looked on, but did not interfere—some one came and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> us off the path, and told us to go on—I went to go on, and as soon as I got to the corner of the street, I saw the prisoner and another run<lb></lb>ning after me—I saw the prisoner pull a brickbat out of his pocket as he ran—I ran to a policeman for protection, and no sooner had I got behind the policeman than the brick hit me on the head, and knocked me down—the prisoner threw it with force when he was not more than three yards from me—it wounded my head—I could not see out of my eyes for a week from the effect of the blow—it bled a good deal—he was taken on the spot—I had done nothing to provoke him—he was one of the party quarrelling—they were not fighting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He hit me first. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not—I do not feel any effects from the blow now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 190). The prosecutor ran up to me for protection—he had not been to me more than a second before four Irishmen came running up, putting themselves in a fighting attitude before him—I had not time to question them as to their conduct when the prisoner threw the brick—he was one of the four men—I did not see where he got the brick from—it seemed to be thrown with all the strength he had got—he stood about three yards from the prosecutor, and it came with full force on the man's head—he fell—I seized the prisoner, and secured the piece of brick, which I produce—on the way to the station he begged very hard of me to let him go—I took the prosecutor to the doctor's—the wound bled very much—they were both sober—I saw no provocation given by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You asked me whether any one had struck me, and I pointed out the prosecutor. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No—the prisoner works at a silk manufactory—I did not see any bricks about—he took a deliberate aim at the prosecutor—the wound was about half an inch long—there is no surgeon here.</p>

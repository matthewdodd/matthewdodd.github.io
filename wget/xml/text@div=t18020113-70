Yes; I lived with his father, about two years ago, who was a fishmonger in Fore-street; I know one Belcher, but never saw him but once: the last day of December, Buckingham, Belcher, and I, went towards Covent-Garden; and had a pot of beer, about three o'clock; Buckingham-said he knew of a good place, but for want of a centre-bit they could not get in; Belcher said, let us go and see if we can't rob it; going along we saw a lamp-lighter's ladder, and he persuaded us to take that; Buckingham said we could get one nearer than that, in Aldersgate-street; we then agreed to go to the Old Hand-in-Hand Fire-office, but first we took a ladder from Aldersgate-street; Buckingham said I looked more like a lamplighter than he, and I took it; we walked about till it was dark, we went to Buckingham's room, No. 5, Grub-street, up one pair of stairs, he brought down a sack, those keys, and a chisel, and between five and six o'clock we went to Angel-court; then Belcher got a pipe of tobacco, a farthingsworth of matches, and a halfpenny candle, the ladder was put against the wall, and Buckingham told me to go up and stick a knife in the putty; I said I could not; he said, then break the window; I said I could not without making a noise; he said, if any body comes he would stick his knife in them; then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130050"></xptr>I broke the top window over the door; I was to put my hand over, shore the thing round, and hoist up the sash, but I could not open it; I then broke the bottom window, got in, and went down stairs and let them in; Buckingham put a match into the pipe and lit the candle, and we all went up stairs to the first-floor; Belcher put a pair of pistols in his pocket, and we all filled the sack full of things; Belcher and me held the sack open while Bucking ham put them in, bed-furniture, and table-cloths; three counterpanes were tied up in my apron, and not put into the sack; Buckingham wanted Belcher to pull off his smock-frock to make a sack of it, but he would not; Belcher went down first with the sack, I was to wait and see that nobody was coming after him, Buckingham came back to me, and then Belcher ran away with the things; Buckingham and I took the three counterpanes to a man of the name of Blake, in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street, he keeps a private-house; Blake took us up three pair of stairs, to an empty room, first he told me to wait down stairs, but I said I would not, and I went up with them; Buckingham asked three pounds for them, Blake said he would give eight shillings a piece, and that three times eight was twenty-eight; he meant twenty-four, but he gave Buckingham a one pound note, a seven-shilling-piece, and a shiling; I had the seven-shilling-piece and the shilling; we then went to an Alamode beef-shop, and I changed the seven shilling-piece; I said I was afraid to go home, as I had left my place,and he said he would take me to a house in Chick-lane, where we went and slept two or three nights; the house is kept by one Smith; next day we went to an ironnonger's in Redcross-street,and bought a stock and centre-bit, which I paid for, I gave two shilling, and had sixpence in change, Buckingham took them to his lodgings in Grub-street; going down Snow-hill, on Friday fortnight, we went into a gingerbread-baker shop, and bought a plumb-cake, I gave the one pound note, and the young woman went for chage; Buckingham gave me the twenty shilling note to take care of, because his pocket was not good; I staid with him till the money was all gone, then he told me I had better go home till he could get more tools to work with; I told one Jago, the next day after the robbry, what I ahd done, but my father spoke to me about it first; I went to Buckingham several times, to ask him what I had better do; he told me not to say any thing about it, for they could not hurt us, as it was only a warehouse,and not a dwelling-house, at most they could only trasport us for it; I told my father five days after I had told Jago, and he took me to Mr. Holdsworth, who took me to Buckingham's, in Grub-street, the same night; I called him down by the nick-name of Kebble, and he came dwon, and was taken.</p>

I stood at the Door to listen, and heard a Woman's Voice, saying, Well, Grace, What have you got to Night? She answer'd, That as will fetch my Clothes out of pawn, and now I'll follow this Trade no more, but get into a Place and live honest. I suppose some Body there had got a Buckle from her, for I heard her say, Now I can bang you for taking that Buckle. She was ask'd how she could be so barbarous to serve the Man so?

How do you do ? Will you go and take a Night's Lodging with me? I said, No, and with that he threw my Oysters about the Street. You Villain you, says I, han't you done enough in getting me with Child, but you must throw my Goods away? Then he said, truly, that he'd make me any Satisfaction, and so he gave me a Crown for my Oysters, and follow'd me to my Cellar, where he would go to Bed, and there was another Woman with me, and I went out and left them together - When I was at the Red-Lion against Drury-Lane, Will. Adams, the Thief -catcher, told me, if I'd give him two Guineas he discharge me, and because I would not, he sent for Allen the Constable - When the last Witness follow'd me from the Coach and Horses Alehouse, where I went to change a Guinea, he went to put his Hands up my Coats, and ask'd me to go along with him; and when I was at the Brandy-shop, Davis bid me go backwards and warm myself, and he brought me half a Pint of Liquor, and begg'd the Seal of me, and said it was Brass; but when he found I would not part with it for nothing, he gave me a Shilling for it - If I would have spent the Money among these People, I should soon have been let loose again.</p>

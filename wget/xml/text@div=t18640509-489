                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 16, Lansdowne-road North, Dalston—I had a relation named Joseph Hankin—with the exception of my mother, I was his nearest relation, as far as I know—he used to live with me, but afterwards went to reside with the female prisoner, at 2, Union-court, Stoke Newington—she is a monthly nurse, and her husband is a road-scraper—he lived there eighteen or twenty months—the female prisoner told me that he paid her twelve shillings a week for his board—I was in the place very frequently, nearly every Sunday—before he went there, he had placed 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my possession, which I returned to him, in November, 1859—I last saw it in March, 1862, the whole amount; it was in notes and gold—in July, 1862, be spoke to me about making a will, and I asked the prisoner and her husband to come up stairs and sign the will—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced. This was dated</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">d July</hi>, 1863; <hi rend="italic">it left the whole of his property to Mary Ann Vickers, after payment of his debts and funeral expenses. Signed, "Joseph Hankin, in the presence of David Read and Maria Read"</hi>)—I wrote this will in pencil from his dictation, and afterwards took it to Mr. Howarth, my brother-in-law, who copied it—Mrs. Read was not present when I had any conversation with the deceased about money—he died on 26th November last, and I went to the house about three or four hours afterwards—I went straight to the box where the deceased had told me that his money was, to take it, but only found about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went down stairs, and said, "Mrs. Read, you must be aware that my cousin had money to live upon; all he possessed in the world was in this house. I cannot find it: do you know anything about it?"—I believe the male prisoner was present—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "He had money to a large amount in this house; bank-notes to a large amount"—she said, "Bank-notes! I had no idea he had any money at all. I never saw any of his money, beyond what he paid me weekly for his board and lodging, you know Mrs. French has been to see him, and stayed with him till 7 o'clock in the evening, and left him in a</p>

Board and lodging for Mr. Hankin, up to the time of his death, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Paid, Maria Read.")—on 8th January, I went again, with Inspector Langdon—I went in first, and said that I had brought a gentleman to question her about this money—I said, "Do you know him?"—she said, "No, I have not that pleasure"—he then asked her if she knew Mr. Hankin had any money—she said, No, he had not any money, that she knew of, and that Miss Vickers and her mother knew all that there was—Langdon then produced a piece of paper, and said, "This is some information from the Bank of England. You are the woman who has changed the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—she said, "I know I did; he gave me the money"—Henry Read then came running down stairs, and said, "Charge us with robbery; charge us with robbery"—that was before he was accused—I then said, "You are the man that changed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes"—Langdon said to Mrs. Read, "What witnesses have you?"—she said, "None, but my own children"—a Coroner's inquest was held in February, at which I heard Mrs. Read state that she changed a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in December, 1863—the deceased kept the 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a box in his room by itself, and the other money he had he kept in a separate box—after his death, I found the box in which he had kept the 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was not there—the rest of the money which he paid his way with, was in a tea-caddy, which I found—he also had a little plate and jewellery, and his wife's clothing—I went with Inspector Langdon when the house was searched, and, in a room up stairs, which the deceased had occupied, was found a tea-caddy, a silk dress, and a hearthrug—the daughter found those things—when I asked about a brooch, she said that it was not in the house, but she sent for it—Mrs. Read was not there; but I heard her solicitor say, that he had the brooch—the deceased's habits were very reserved, very mean and close, and very quiet—he was paralyzed for some time before he died, but was better towards the last—he has been bed-ridden, but he could get up afterwards.</p>

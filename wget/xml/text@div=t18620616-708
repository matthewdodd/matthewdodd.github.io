On 27th May, I had the prisoner in charge in the police-van from Horse monger-lane to Westminster police-court—he tried to force his conversation on me for some time, but I did not listen to him—at last he said, "I have had my friends to see me this week, the evidence is very slight against me, and I shall get turned up"—he hesi<lb></lb>tated a moment, and said, "Ah, there is nobody saw me set it on fire, or they would have come forward before this, and got the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made a memoran<lb></lb>dum of that in pencil.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector D</hi>). On the Sunday morning after the fire, I examined the spot between 9 and 10 o'clock with Mr. McMurray, and saw him find a piece of lucifer under the broken pane of the window at the end of the room next to the machine-room—I went over almost directly, and saw the prisoner at his house—I said, "You first discovered the fire?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Come across with me to Mr. McMurray's; as you were the first to discover the fire, I want to put some questions to you, but be careful what you say, for I do not know how it may turn out"—I asked him where he was last night—he said, "I was at the Old Sergeant at a raffle; I left there at 12 o'clock at night, went home, and went to bed about a quarter to 1. I awoke about twenty minutes to 3, looked out at my bedroom win<lb></lb>dow to see if it was time to get up, and saw a light on the tumbling weir" (that is at the back of Mr. McMurray's premises, nearly opposite to where the fire was) "I got up, ran round to Mr. McMurray's, and rang the gate bell; Malkham, the watchman, let me in, and gave me a pail, and I fetched two pails of water, and put the fire out"—I asked him what he had in his pockets, if he had any lucifers—he turned out his pockets, and there was a small piece of a lucifer, but not the same sort as that I found inside—I do not think it was like those which Nurse gave him the night before—I saw a fourteen round ladder of about eight or nine inches to a round, lying on some wood at the back of the prisoner's house—I received information and obtained these matches from Mrs. Maxsom, at Wimbledon, which, appear to correspond with this piece picked up by Mr. McMurray—the box is here—Bell's lucifer-match manufactory is not far from there—I enquired at the Old Sergeant, and they sell Bell's matches there—I got these matches (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner's mother; they are different—I searched the prisoner's</p>

               <p>bedroom on the Sunday, but could find no matches there—it is eighty-nine yards from where I found the wood to the finishing room—there is a bridge close to the prisoner's garden, which leads to the pathway under the wall of the finishing room—from the prisoner's cottage to the fire, is eighty-nine yards; from the fire to the bell, is ninety-five yards; from the fire to the gate leading into the prisoner's garden, is thirty-three yards, and by the public footpath to the garden gate, supposing he ran there and back, would be 161 yards—from the bottom of the street where Malkham was, to the finishing-room window, is forty-two yards—from the finishing-room window to the tap, is about thirty yards, because he would go through the machine-room.</p>

Q.</hi> What are you reading from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This paper contains the distances—it took me a minute to walk from the garden gate to the fire and back to the bell—if any one had been on the inside and thrust their hand out through the paper, then in withdrawing the hand the paper would bear inwards—if it was done with an umbrella or a stick, it must have been a large one—an umbrella was found inside partly burnt—I believe there has been a reward—I do not know who is to get it—Mr. McMurray offered it—I advised him only to offer 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he offered 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I got the in<lb></lb>formation that the prisoner had told Nurse to say that he had not seen him, I took him into custody—I received information which took me to Nurse—Mr. McMurray told me that Nurse had seen the prisoner, and I went to him in consequence—Nurse was very reluctant to tell me—I do not know whether he is to get the reward—the match found inside, corresponds with the matches which Nurse obtained from Mrs. Maxsom.</p>

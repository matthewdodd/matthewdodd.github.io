            . On the 8th of August one Mrs. Berry sent her servant to me, and wished me to give her change for a five pound bank note; I directly went to my money which was the nearest, to give the change, and I had laid down the four guineas in gold in part of the change for the note, and was telling out the silver; I said to my daughter, inspect the silver, I am not clear it is all good; the child inspected the silver, and found one dubious; just at that juncture the man came into the shop, this was between eight and nine at night, and my daughter said this shilling looks dubious; the man asked for some stockings; I had some suspicion of him from his appearance; I changed the shilling, and he took the whole in a handkerchief that lay on the counter, and swept it all up into the handkerchief just at that instant as I changed the shilling; there was four guineas, and six and thirty shillings in silver; he jumped out of the shop immediately; my son was shutting up the shop and he pursued him; I thought at first it was no more than that, but I have recollected since that it must be near eight pounds.</p>

               <p>About a quarter past eight the 8th of August last, I was shutting up the shop, I saw the prisoner jump out of the shop, I pursued him, and I was not two yards from him till he was brought back; he ran about sixty yards; he was searched by the constable, but the money was not found on him. A man came up to him about sixty yards off, which I thought would assist me in taking him, but I was mistaken; but if he had an accomplice it is no wonder the money was not found.</p>

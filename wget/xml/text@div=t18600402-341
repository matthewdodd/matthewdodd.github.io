                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the M division of police. On 24th March, I went to 128, Blackfriars-road, where the witness Mr. Lincoln lives—I saw the prisoner and Mr. Lincoln there—Mr. Lincoln told me that the prisoner had purchased of him a quantity of old coins, to the amount of nearly 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked the prisoner how he became possessed of so much money; he said he received it from his father, who was a builder at Woodgreen, near Tottenham—Mr. Lincoln then handed me this blank cheque book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked the prisoner where he got it from; he said he got it from his father to give to a gentleman in Cheapside, but he did not know who the gentleman was, or where he lived, he did not know tho number of the house—I told him I did not feel satisfied with his statement, and I should detain him till I had made inquiry at the bank respecting the cheque-book; he nip de no reply—I took him to the police-station—I told him to let me have what money he had about him, aud he immediately drew from his pocket a bag containing seventy-one sovereigns—I first asked him if he had any money, and he said he had none about him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020029"></xptr>
               <p>—I then told him I should search him, and he immediately drew out the bag—I also produce a silver watch which he drew from his pocket—he gave I me an address, 16, Nelson-street, Ivy-lodge, Woodgreen—I have since ascertained that he lives at 16, Nelson-street, City-road—when I returned from the Bank, I told him the charge against him would be obtaining a sum of money, amounting to 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by means of a forged cheque, and also for forging the signature of Mr. Shaw for the cheque-book—the prisoner I then said,"I did do it, there was no one else with me; there was no one I else concerned in it."</p>

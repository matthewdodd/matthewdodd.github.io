               <p>The prisoner rented a room of me—last Tuesday night, at ten o'clock, I heard him coming down stairs, and asked, "Is that Mr. Hagan?"—he said it was—I asked him if he would be so kind as to come down stairs, for I wished to speak to him—he asked what I wanted of him—I said I wished to speak to him, had he any rent for me—he directly rushed down stairs, rushed into my loom, took me by the hair of the head, and called me very bad wicked names, and kicked and thumped me, and bit my finger when I put up my hand—my five children screamed so loud that it attracted my neighbours, and they came in and took him from me, and took him up stairs—his own brother-in-law was one of them, and he asked if he was going to kill the woman—the prisoner was up-stairs some time, and when I was un<lb></lb>dressing he came down again, never said a word, but rushed into the room with a candlestick, and struck me with it in the face—it split my lip right open—I held my head down by the foot of the children's bed—he tuned round and took up a knife, and made a plunge at me with it—I fell under the bed, and the knife did not strike rile—a great quantity of blood came from the wound—I was taken to the hospital by my neighbours.</p>

               <p>down-stairs, and as soon as they entered the place below I heard a screaming and bawling, and down I went—the door was wide open, and they were all bawling together, mother, children, and all, and I saw the prosecutrix and her daughter having hold of the prisoner's wife by the hair of her head—the prisoner was pulling them to get her loose, and the more he pulled the more they pulled his wife, and sometimes he gave them a hit, but for all that they would not let go—with my assistance he at last got her away, and she went outside the door—I then got the prisoner out, and the prosecutrix and her daughter, and two little sons,<hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jemmy,</hi> were hitting him—one is about eight years old, and the other about six—when I got the prisoner outside the kitchen door Gorman was there—we got him up-stairs, and then Gorman and I went into the kitchen again to Mrs. Egan, to make peace and quietness—Gorman went in first, and she up with a jug to hit him, thinking it was the prisoner—"Don't hit me, Mrs. Egan," said he, "I only come to make peace," and she drew back her hand—we were talking to her some time—when the prisoner came down stairs again, hearing her call him all the b—b——s she could, and his wife wh—s, and he said, "Mrs. Egan, can you prove my wife a wh—," and in he comes, "You b—b—," says she, "I will let you know," and she <hi rend="italic">pitches into</hi> him again, and her daugh<lb></lb>ter too, hitting and striking him—he had no candlestick in his hand, nor any knife—he hit her a blow somewhere on the head with his naked fist, and she fell and tumbled against the bedstead, and whether it was the blow or the fell that cut her I could not make out—as soon as she got up I taw that her lip was cut—he did not take up a knife, and make a blow at her—he then went up-stairs into his own, room—I and Gorman remained these till the policeman came.</p>

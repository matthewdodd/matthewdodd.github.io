                  </hi>. I am a cattle-dealer, of 3, Grosvenor-road, Walthamstow—on 4th January the prisoner was in my employ as a drover—he sold three sheep for me to Mr. Alfred Edwards, a butcher—I sent them by him to Mr. Edwards—the prisoner has not paid me any money on account of these sheep—he left my service on the 9th—I did not send him away—he ought to have come to his employment on that day—I afterwards saw Mr. Edwards, and in consequence of what he told me I communicated with the police—I sold the sheep for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner had no authority to receive the money.</p>

I am a butcher, of Walthamstow—on 3d January I bought four sheep of Mr. Burrell for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner called on me on 6th January, and I said, "I suppose you have come for the money—he said, "I suppose I have"—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more when I got to the beer-shop and got change—the next day he came to my house with a pig from Mr. Burrell to be killed—I killed it with his help, and when I had done it Mr. Burrell came to my shop and went away with the prisoner, and I saw no more of him till he was in custody—they did not take the pig; they went off together—Mr. Burrell sent to my house afterwards to know whether I had paid him for the sheep—that was on Tuesday or Wednesday, and I said that I had.</p>

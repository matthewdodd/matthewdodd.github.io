I am in partnership with my brother, John—tfe live at No. 135, Aldersgate-street, and are ink raanufacturert—both the prisoners have been in our employment—Harding was so till about three weeks ago, as under warehouseman and packer—it is neatly fivt years since Cooke left our employ as out-door porter—we have missed various articles for a length of time—we missed ink-powders about the 24th of Feb.—we did not miss any oxyde of iron or labels—we do not keep the oxyde of iron in very large quantities, two or three hundred weight—we keep the labels in the warehouse, wrapped up in paper and marked at the end in large quantities, from fifty to a hundred thousand—we could not possibly miss them—in consequence of information I applied for a warrant to search Cooke's premises—I was present when they were searched, on Tuesday, the 16th or 17th of Feb.—Harding was still in our employ—I sent for him from the warehouse to the counting-house—I said, "I am very sorry, John, to see you in such a situation, we have a very serious charge against you, it is not an affair of yesterday; I am afraid you have been robbing us for years,"and in order that I might be correct I would read from this paper that was then lying before me.</p>

                  </hi>. I came to London on the 19th of last August—I came to Cooke's house, and went to work for him on the morrow—he had asked me to come—he came from Kings Stanley, in Gloucestershire, where I came from, and I knew him there—before I came to London I had fol<lb></lb>lowed the business of a painter for the last four years—when I came from the country I went straight to Cooke's house to live—I and my wife had the top of his house—he told me I was to assist him generally—he carried on the trade of an ink-manufacturer at No. 22, New-street, Cloth-fair—that is very near Aldersgate-street—after I had been there some time I observed Harding frequently came to Cooke's premises—I did not at first know where he came from, but I found out at last that he came from Mr. Arnold's—I cannot say whether I heard it from himself or from Cooke—I was sent by Cooke to stay at the bottom of the gateway, in Al<lb></lb>dersgate-street, till I saw the young man that I frequently saw come to Cooke's house, and to tell him that Cooke wanted him—there is a court leads out of New-street into Aldersgate-strect, and that was where I was to go—Cooke gave me directions where to go and stand by the corner of the</p>

               <p>gateway—I was not to go any further than where he desired me to go—Mr. Arnold lived about 100 yards from where I was told to stand—Cooke said Harding generally passed that way to his meals—he told me not to go near to Mr. Arnold's, but to stand where he told me—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect whether that direction was given me the first time or not, nor whether I saw Harding the first time I went or not—I sometimes saw him on those occasions—I was sent to stand there ten or twelve times—I went to Cooke's in Aug.—I saw Harding come there several times before Christ<lb></lb>mas—I saw him many times before the 24th of Feb.—he frequently came—I recollect on one occasion, before Christmas, he brought two half-gross of ink-powders—they were not such as have been since found at Cooke's—they were black ink-powders, but were small ones—he brought them in the evening under his right arm—he had a latch-key, and let himself in, as he frequently did at other times—Cooke was out when Harding brought the ink-powders—they were put into the counting-house—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect Cooke coming home, but next morning I saw the ink-powders on the same board in the counting-house—they were taken out of the papers and labels that they were in, and were then lying loose—they had been packed' up when I saw them come—they were in labels that had Mr. Arnold's address on when I first saw them—I am sure of that, and they were taken out of the labels when I saw them the next morning—Cooke had been at home, and had been into the counting-house—in Jan. three quart bottles of red ink were brought by Harding—they had Mr. Arnold's name and seal on them—I very well recollect the 24th of Feb.—we had an order for ink-powders—Harding came at dinner-time, and brought in something in his leathern apron, which is used in the ink-powders; oxyde of copperas, I believe it was—Cooke asked him to-get a young man to come and show me how to make ink-powders—Harding said he did not think he could get him to come—Cooke said, "Try; tell him I will give him plenty of beer"—Harding took what he had brought into the counting-house, and put it on the floor—I afterwards saw it was oxyde of copperas—it was whitish brown colour, similar to this that is produced—it ii sometimes called oxyde of iron, and I have heard it called white copperas—there was about ten pounds of it, as far as my judgment goes—there was no mark on that, but it was brought by Harding in his apron—whether there was anything else in his apron I cannot tell—I did not see whether there was or not—his apron was tied on, and he had the bottom part of it held up—some time after that Paddock told me to come tip stain—he said he had been finding some of Mr. Arnold's labels—he had them on the table in the first floor—I saw them—I should say there was about two gross of them—I took one sheet which bad four labels on it, and gave it to Mr. John Arnold—I saw it produced again at the police-office.</p>

Arnold's servants but Budgin, and I never saw him there but on that occasion of making the ink-powders—I did not state that Cooke bad frequently found fkult with me—he has found fault with me—I never said that I would be revenged on Cooke, nor that I would serve him out—I recollect the evidence I gave before the Magistrate—I said I would inform Mr. Arnold—I am prepared to swear that during the period I was in Cooke's employ I never said I would serve him out—I did not say so after I left him, to my recol<lb></lb>lection—if any one swears I have it will be false—I never said so to Paddock, or in his hearing—I recollect Paddock saying it at Guildhall, and I denied it—since I left Cooke's service I have been supported by the police-officer—I went to him and told him, and he told me not to go into the country, and said he would keep me from a state of starvation, and when I wanted money I went to him—I do not know who furnishes the money—the officer never told me—I said before the Magistrate that I had not received any money from Mr. Arnold, nor any person in his employ.</p>

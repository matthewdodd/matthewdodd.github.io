            ; she told me there was a person gone by her with a pair of her mistress's pattens in her hand; I ran after the woman; the girl shewed me the woman in the street; she had got a number of things in her apron; I asked her what she had got there, she said they were not her's; I told her I believed they were mine. I examined the things when I took her back. I found a small bed-furniture, and a small tablecloth, belonging to me. There were several other things belonging to a lodger of mine. This small tablecloth and bed-furniture is mine; it is worth four shillings.</p>

The liquor had made me much intoxicated, or else I should not have done any such thing.</p>

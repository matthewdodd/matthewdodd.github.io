                  </hi>. I am a constable at the London Docks. On the 21st of December I was on duty at the tobacco-gate, and saw the prisoner coining out with a basket on his shoulder—I asked what he had—he said, "A bottle or two"—I found in it this 68lbs. of tin concealed amongst some straw—he said he had got it from between the warehouses, and he would give me half a crown if I would hush it up—it is marked "A.W. and Co.," with a G at the top and No. 550.</p>

                  </hi>. I am quay foreman at No. 4 warehouse in the London Docks. There are nearly 3000 pigs of tin there similar to this, but with different numbers—after the prisoner was stopped I searched over the pigs, and found No. 550 deficient—this is the stab I missed—I have a tally which was found about two yards from the stack near the door going up to the warehouse—I had tied it to this slab myself—this is the property of the London Dock Company.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you had the care of this ever since? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The officer has—there is no person employed to watch the stack—I gene<lb></lb>rally look over them in the morning when I go—we only missed this one—I had seen it safe at half-past nine o'clock that morning—I am sure it is the same that was taken from the prisoner.</p>

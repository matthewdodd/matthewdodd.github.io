                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 192.) I was on duty at the Brandy-quay, in the London Docks, about seven in the evening of the 16th of March—it was partly dark—I heard a noise like the rustling of clothes, and the breathing of some person, and there was a smell of brandy, which led me to where I found the prisoner lying under a steamboat-boiler, with a cask of brandy near him—the head of the cask faced to where he was lying down concealed—I spoke to him—he said he came there to get a ship, and had lost his way, and could not get out—I asked where he lived, he said at Shad-well, and he was a willow-cutter—he gave me some name—I asked him what he was doing about the brandy—he said, "Nothing"—I saw Rudkins, the officer—we searched the prisoner, and found these three spiles in his jacket-</p>

               <p>pocket—he said he cut them that day with his knife—I asked what for—he said for amusement—I pointed out the spot where I had taken him to Rud<lb></lb>kins—when I was taking him to the station, he said he lived in Essex-street, Whitechapel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Docks. On the 16th of March, my attention was called by Rutledge—I saw the prisoner—Rut<lb></lb>ledge pointed out the place to me—I went there, and felt the head of the brandy-cask, near the boiler, and found a spile sticking in the head of it—I felt on the bulge of the cask, and found a hole bored in it, and near the head of the cask I found this bladder, with a quart of brandy in it, and this gimlet by the side of it—I have compared the brandy in the bladder with that in the cask, and it corresponds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am keeper of the brandy vault, at the London-dock. Some brandy was shown to me in a bladder by Rudkins—I have drawn some from a cask near the steam-boiler—it appears to be exactly the same quality—this spile taken from the cask is not such a spile as is used in the docks—these other three are of the same sort of timber, and this gimlet would have made such a hole as was in the cask.</p>

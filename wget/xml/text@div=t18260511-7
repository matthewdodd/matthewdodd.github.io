I found one of my waistcoats in pawn at Parsons'.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, the 15th of April, and told him it was for Hart's robbery - he said he knew nothing about it; the waistcoat was produced before the Magistrate; he said he bought it of a man some months ago. His examination was read over to him - he said it was true, and signed it - (looking at it) this is what he signed; (read.)</p>
               <p>The said William Taylor says "I am not guilty of stealing any of the goods; I bought the waistcoat of a man at the Angel tap, Edmonton, one evening last summer, and pawned it with Parsons."</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Parsons, pawnbroker, Newington. On the 12th of April a man pawned a waistcoat, in the name of Taylor, for 5s. - I think it was the prisoner, but should not like to swear to him.</p>
               <p>AARON HART. This is mine, and one of those stolen that night; I had two of this pattern, and only bought them a few days before - it cost me 8s.; I have written No. 16 on it. The duplicate was brought to me by a watchman, who is not here.</p>

            . I live in Riding-house-lane. I used to work for the prisoner's mother. I know he had this waistcoat seven or eight months ago; I marked W. T. 2 on it for him myself - here are the letters; it is marked with cotton; I did it before Christmas; and I know he was ill at home, and in bed, on the night of the robbery, for I went down to his house - it was on a Tuesday night; I do not know the day of the month, but next morning, when I went to see how he was, I heard of Hart's robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was in bed? A. I took him up a mess of gruel, and left the house at a quarter past ten o'clock; I saw him at home next morning - he came part of the way home with me, and his sister told him of the robbery - he had no doctor, only some gruel. I live a quarter of a mile off, and have washed for his mother two years.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. He was in bed and asleep by half-past seven o'clock on the night of the robbery - he was not well. I sleep in the same room as him; I locked the door myself at half-past ten o'clock, when I went to bed - my brother John slept in the room - he is nineteen years old - he is at work to day; my two little sisters were also in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know you would be wanted here? A. I brought my brother some clothes this morning; he said his trial was coming on, and I could stop. King went up with me to take him his gruel. I know he had the waistcoat three or four months before Christmas. I was at the bridge one Saturday when he brought it; my sister marked it for him; I sat by her and saw her do it - it was my sister Mary Ann - here is the mark she put on, W. T. and a figure. I got up about six o'clock in the morning - my brother was in bed then, and the door locked.</p>
               <p>AARON HART re-examined. The letters W. T. 2 were not on the waistcoat when I bought it.</p>

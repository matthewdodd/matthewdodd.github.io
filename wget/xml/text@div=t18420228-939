                  </hi>. I live with my brother, John Baber, who keeps a hair-dresser's shop, in John-street, Oxford-street, in the parish of St. Maryle<lb></lb>bone. On Saturday, the 12th of February, about a quarter past nine o'clock, a policeman came in with the prisoner, and asked if I knew that the shop had been robbed—I said, "No"—he told me to look into the window—I did so, and missed six combs and four pieces of wood, done up in paper, to represent soap—one pane of glass was broken at the corner—I do not know how long it had been broken—I think it had not been broken that morning, or I should have seen it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clicker, and live in Foley-street. I was passing through John-street on the evening of the 12th of February, and saw the prisoner with two others—I distinctly saw one of the others in the act of breaking the window, and the prisoner and the other were standing before him, to hide him—I did not see either of them take any thing out—I then proceeded to fetch a policeman, and when I came back the prisoner was two or three yards from the window—I pointed him out to the policeman as one of the three—he then ran away—the policeman ran after him, and he was taken in Oxford-market—as he was running he threw away a piece of wood, done up in white paper, which was an imitation of soap—I saw a stranger pick it up, and give it to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He says he saw it picked up, he was the full length of a street off when the gentleman picked it up, and it was full two minutes before he came up after the policeman collared me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I should think one minute had not elapsed—I was close behind the policeman.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody at a quarter past nine o'clock—he saw me, and ran away, across John-street, into Oxford-market—I pursued, and caught him there—I saw him throw something down, done up in white paper, which was afterwards found to be a piece of wood—this now produced is it—I searched the pri<lb></lb>soner at the station, and found in his pocket this other piece of wood, done up as an imitation of soap—as we were going to the station I heard some<lb></lb>thing drop on the pavement—I looked, but could not find any thing then—after taking him to the station, I returned to look at the window, and this brad-awl was given to me by Mr. John Baber—it is such an instrument as is used by thieves to break a window—I have seen similar things used by thieves.</p>

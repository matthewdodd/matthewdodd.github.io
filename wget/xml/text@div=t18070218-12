               <p>Mr. Pooley. Was the prisoner Allwright employed by you. - A. Yes, as a weekly servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any customer that dealt with you of the name of Lake. - A. Yes, Mrs. Lake keeps a chandler's shop at Walworth; she had some goods delivered on the 1st of December. Some time after I sent the prisoner at the bar to see if Mrs. Lake was ready to pay a little bill; he returned the same afternoon, saying Mrs. Lake had only paid one guinea, and that she had borrowed; the boy is here that was in the shop, that took the guinea of him, and handed it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after you received this letter. - A. Yes, the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This young man had been in business for himself before he came to you; he had unfortunately failed. - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. It was an object to you to have a person that had some customers that he might recommend to you. - A. It might be of service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not agree that he should have a certain commission upon all these goods that he should dispose of to his own customers. - A. Before he came to live with me as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever live with you as a servant. - A. Yes, first of all when he came to me, he asked me if I would send some goods to customers that he knew of, and allow him a commission for his own trouble; I said I had no objection if he would send good customers, he said he would send goods to no customers but what would pay the money in consequence of that; as I was going out of Thames street, he said he would help me to move, I then told him he should be a servant at fourteen shillings a week and his victuals.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you whether or not you did agree that you would furnish his own customers with goods provided he did or would guarantee the payments. - A. I never did. I allowed him a little commission money that he might put something into his pocket, but not for him to guarantee the debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a dispute between him and you about that commission. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he claim nineteen shillings as commission due. - A. He never did, he summoned me for nineteen shillings; but I do not know what it was for.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that summons before or after you knew that the money had been received of Mrs. Lake. - A. After the 16th of January the money had been received of Mrs. Lake; we knew it before he claimed the nineteen shillings; he came to me on Monday the 26th of January, I owed him for a week's wages.</p>
               <p>Q. That was fourteen shillings; instead of that you gave him twelve shillings. - A. He was not a person that exactly suited us, he wished to be master.</p>
               <p>Q. He summoned you, and that was the day that you took him in charge of felony. - A. That was the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You never charged him with it before. - A. I did not know where to find him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you meet him in Tottenham Court road, and assaulted him there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He took out a warrant for your knocking him down in Tottenham Court road; when you went to the police office, you knew that Mrs. Lake had paid him the two pound two shillings; did not he attend at Worship street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in consequence of that you appeared at at the police office. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that Mrs. Lake had paid him the two pound two shillings. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was bound over for this assault. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not know where to find him, you met with him in Tottenham Court road, and next at the Police office; was it not where you attended to the summons at Fuller's Rents, Holborn, that you met with him there, and took him in custoday. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When he brought you the guinea, did not he claim any part of the money for commission - A. He never mentioned any thing of the sort, he came home and said, Mrs. Lake had paid only one guinea, he entered it in the book, the book is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the prisoner went after he quitted your service. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you not know that his friends had taken a situation for him. - A. I knew that they had taken a house somewhere at Islington; he said when he came in the shop, when I was paying him his weeks wages; I have been round and served the customers from another shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know at that time that Mrs. Lake had paid him the two guineas. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that these goods were furnished by you for Mrs. Lake, that she was a customer of his, how much was he to receive out of Mrs. Lake's money. - A. Two shillings, I believe.</p>

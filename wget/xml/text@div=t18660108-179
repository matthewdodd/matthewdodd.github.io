I carry on business under the name of the Patent Crucible Company, at Battersea, with my five brothers—the prisoner entered our service as traveller, in January, 1863, by virtue of a letter which I have—(<hi rend="italic">This was from the prosecutors, appointing the prisoner as country traveller at a weekly salary of</hi> 60 <hi rend="italic">s. the arrangement to be terminable at a month's notice</hi>)—that is the arrangement on which he continued in our service,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601080029"></xptr>
               <p>with the exception of certain alterations in salary—his duties were, to take orders and receive sums of money, which he was to remit to us not later than the following Tuesday—he would post them on the Monday, so that we should receive them on the Tuesday—his accounts were in this form (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is the name of the customer, the amount due, and the amount received—it was his duty to remit the money to us—he had no authority to endorse checks or bills, and he had been told so—it was not his duty to receive money at Birmingham—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the first sheet we received after 25th August—there is no entry on it of any amount from Messrs. Rolleson—their name does not appear in it—it is a Birmingham account, and it was not his duty to receive it—the sheets did not come up regularly every week, and we had made complaints to him respecting that—Mr. Foster's account does not appear here—he had no authority to endorse that particular cheque—there is no entry on the receipt of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the en<lb></lb>dorsement on the cheque is, "For the Patent Crucible Company, Charles C. Cooper"—I never heard of this sum being received by him until I heard it from Messrs. Foster, about a week or nine days after—I instituted inquiries, and sent my brother down on 30th September to collect the Birmingham accounts, not supposing that they had been paid—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the account from the 5th to 30th September—it would be transmitted to me on Monday, 2d October, and I should receive it on the 3d—here is no entry here of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Walker Brothers—their name does not appear here—I have got all the sheets here, but there is no such entry in any one of them—the warrant was issued on the 9th—the last time I saw the prisoner was the 15th or 16th September—we had a conversation—he said he thought ha paid the three amounts—they had nothing to do with this—they amounted to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if he owed any more money, and he said "No."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did he enter your employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In January, 1863—his dealings in the country were not very extensive—it is a fact that he increased our customers some 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year since he has been in our service, as we had no traveller—the business principally conducted by him was very extensive, especially in the north of England—his expenses ought always to have been paid him in advance, but occasionally he used his own money, and then we sent it to him—he had no authority to sign cheques or endorse or draw bills—we instructed him at some date, which I cannot tell you; to get as much money as he could, and not bills—I am not aware that he was in the habit of endorsing cheques up to this time—he could have done it without our knowledge—we should not have found it out if he had—we Were not aware that he was in the habit of doing it—in two or three instances I called his attention to it, and told him not to do it again.</p>

               <p>all, this must not occur again; when we write for remittances, it seems that we are careless in our book-keeping")—if we make an application for money, that does not prove that we are careless—I have got the books here—we sent for the prisoner up to town some time in October—the warrant was issued before we were furnished with a copy of the accounts between us and the prisoner—the accounts are in writing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an account sent to us before the warrant was issued—three sums were accounted for by the prisoner before the warrant was executed—I knew perfectly well where he resided—I sent my brother down to take a warrant out against him at Manchester, but we found we could not proceed against him there—after the warrant was issued, he came up to London and gave us his address—he has a wife and nine children.</p>

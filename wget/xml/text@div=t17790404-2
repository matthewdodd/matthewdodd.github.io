            , who is now in the country. I employed the other prisoner some time ago to make me some clothes. I gave him the money beforehand to buy the cloth. He did not make them. I went to his lodging, and because I insisted on seeing the cloth he threatened to be revenged on me. I went after that to America; when I returned I met him in the street, and he asked me to drink, which I consented to, though I knew he had malice in his heart against me. He then asked me to lend him some money; he said he was in distress. I saw no more of him from that time till this happened; then out of revenge he said he had the watch of me. I never had it in my custody. When I was at the Brown-Bear, he said I had better say I gave him the watch. I do not know the laws of this country. I refused to say so. Then he said, as I would not say he had the watch of me he would get clear in spite of my teeth; as he was the first speaker he could say what he pleased.</p>

               <p>All he has said is false, word by word. I never borrowed any money of him. He desired me to pawn the watch; he said it was his master's; that his master wanted to raise some money; accordingly I innocently went to pawn the watch, and was stopped.</p>

On Saturday, the 13th of March, about ten at night, I carried home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040005"></xptr> some things; I staid supper, and when I went away the watchman was calling past twelve o'clock. The prisoner was at home all the time at work on his board; he was undressing himself to go to bed when I came away.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutrix. Was it the 13th of March you was robbed? - I do not remember the day; it was of a Saturday.</p>
               <p>To Charlton. Do you remember the day of the month on which the robbery was committed? - I do not; it was on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Steed called seven other witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Edmonds called no witnesses.</p>

            , I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Night was this done?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. About 12 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dance with the Company ?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in the House?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. About an Hour?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. I went into my own Room, which was about ten Doors from the House. I went into my own Room, which was a Ground-Floor. I came back to Mr Lewis's to light my Candle, and these young Fellows were without side of the Door, excepting two, that happened to be within side.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. There was a Matter of Ten, to the best of my Knowledge. Those young Fellows were without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174709090037"></xptr> out-side of the Door, every one of them. There was something of a Quarrel about their refusing, I think, to pay their Reckoning. A young Fellow who was there, cry'd out, Have you no Weapon about you? We will stand by one another till we get our two Partners out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the Partners, Men or Women?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. Men, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you, or any body see, this young Fellow in the Scarlet Waistcoat do?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. It was not one of the Prisoners at the Bar, another young Fellow said to him, Give me the Hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. He is not here, if he was I should know him: He said, Come let us break the Door open; but it was not one of the Prisoners. Another young Fellow said, he would give any Money for a Hatchet. There was a great Hubbarb; there was Murder cry'd within side. I saw a Man come out to the Door. D - n your Blood, said one of the Fellows without Doors, cut his Hand off.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. Not one of these young Fellows.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing to say against any one of them at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then stand you down, you might have been in the Indictment as well as they.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know touching the Murder?</p>
               <p>Williams. They were all in the House together a great many of them; and, Sir, they call'd for Beer; when they had done they made a Hurly-Burly and did not pay the Landlord.</p>

             make a Hurly-Burly?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, but only said, Let us go out, let us go away. When they had got out somebody bolted the Door in the House, the Windows were shatter'd to Pieces presently. The Man said, 'Tis a sad Thing I should go without my Reckoning. He was within, and they broke his Windows in a sad Form; shatter'd all the Panes in a Quarter of an Hour. I look'd out and I saw three at the Door.</p>
               <p>Q. Which Three?</p>
               <p>Williams. Never a one that is here, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What Three?</p>
               <p>Williams. Two had Sticks in their Hands, and one with a Cutlass. I said, Gentlemen, you had better go about your Business. I said, do not let them come in. One of them has a Cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there?</p>
               <p>Williams. I was going by and I heard Musick, and I went in to see who was playing on the Violin, and a-going in they were all merry together; so when the Hurly-Burly rose I was frighten'd out of my Wits.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Williams. I have nothing to say against any one of the young Fellows in the House.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Murder committed, without side, or within side the House?</p>
               <p>William. The Person that was murdered was within; but he that committed it was without. Mr Lewis walk'd to the Door. I saw him make a Motion to fasten the Door more, for they expected every Minute the Door would burst quite open; so with that I saw the Man, the Deceased, come away with his Hand upon his Neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do do know that any of the Prisoners at the Bar did it?</p>
               <p>Williams. I am sure none of them did it.</p>

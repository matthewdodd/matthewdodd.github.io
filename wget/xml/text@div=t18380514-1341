                  </hi>. I am a mercer and draper, and live in Holborn., I have one partner—the prisoner was a shopman of ours for about five weeks—he was to have 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—in consequence of missing things on Wednesday, the 16th of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, I directed Philip Beer, one of our young men, to go round and get the keys from all the young men <hi rend="italic">to</hi>. have all their boxes searched—when the prisoner's box was come to,. I was sent for, and on reaching the room I saw a shawl lying on the bed by the side of his box, and fifteen or sixteen pairs of stockings, and a pair of gloves in the box—a policeman was sent for, and he was given in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. Mr. Mew directed me to search the young men's boxes—mine was searched amongst the rest—I collected the keys from the different young men—on opening the prisoner's box, I found this shawl, several pairs of stocking!, and a pair of gloves—the shawl has our shop-mark of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it, and two cards, which were with the stockings in the box are marked 221/2—the shawl would have the shop-mark on it when sold—I cannot say it was not sold, but it is my belief it was not—the stockings were open, and loose in the box, not done up as those in the shop—they are all new, and have never been worn—I cannot swear to their being Mr. Mew's property, but the cards which were in the box with them belonged to the shop.</p>

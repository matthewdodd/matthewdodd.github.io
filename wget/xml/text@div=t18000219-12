               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys.Q. Do you know a more harmless inoffensive fellow than the man at the bar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not bear a great deal form the deceased before he struck him? - A. Yes; he was always provoking him; I would not have borne so much, I could have suffered myself to have been killed first.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no unfair fighting? - A. No.

             sworn. - On the 28 th of January, I was called in to the deceased, about the middle of the day: I found two other professional gentlemen there, who lived nearer, and got there before me; when I saw him, he appeared to me to be dead; however, we naturally proceeded to do all that was reasonable and proper to restore him; but after making some experiments, we thoroughly agreed that no more would be of any use; he was dead at that time; we had him stripped, and put into a warm bath; we discovered no external marks of violence, no bruises, or any thing of the kind, except a cut in the upper lip; the next morning we met in order to open his body; we made a very minute examination, and we could discover nothing that could lead to that idea that a blow had been inflicted that could have caused death, if we had not been informed that the man had been killed by a blow; there was nothing that could have that appearance, excepting one circumstance, on taking out the stomach, and opening it, it was reported that it was in that part he received the blow; upon examining the coat of the stomach, there was one or more place of extravasation diffused over the inner membrane of the stomach; that, however, was by no means the cause of his death, however it might have been the effect of a blow; there was on other particular appearance that we could discover; it might eventually have caused death, but not immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. If the violent concussion had affected the heart, it might have produced instantaneous death? - A. Yes, as it did in this case.</p>

On the 28th of April my trunk, containing this property, was taken from my room - I left it safe at half-past two o'clock - a person was cleaning the room - I returned about twelve at night, and it was gone - I have found none of the things - I had not seen the prisoner there that day - he used to bring coals to my former lodging, in Crown-court, Whitefriars - it was a hair-trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you left the servant to clean the room? A. She comes at times to do it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's mother - we keep a little shop at this house. On the 8th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my room; he looked much confused - he came in at the side door, not at the shop door - he asked the price of a penny pie, then turned round, shoved the door too, and stood with his back to it - he went out at the side door, and seemed alarmed - I do not know whether he went up-stairs; he took a two-penny pie, and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a way to the shop, through the side door? A. Yes, he had no coals with him; I never knew him bring coals to that house.</p>

            . I live in Water-lane. I have known the prisoner some time by sight. On the 28th of April, about five o'clock, I was standing at my street door, which is opposite to Swile's - I saw a very respectable man, dressed in blue, walking to and from by the door - the prisoner was inside the passage, and a hair trunk laid in the passage by him, near the door - the man in blue stepped up, took she trunk on his left shoulder, and walked down the lane as fast as he could; the prisoner came out in about two minutes, with two pies in his hand - he was by the trunk when the man took it. I did not say what I had seen till next morning - I had heard of the robbery at twelve o'clock at night; I did not see them speak to each other; it was done momentarily.</p>

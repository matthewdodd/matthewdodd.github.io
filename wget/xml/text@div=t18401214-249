                  </hi>. I rent the upper part of a house in Regent-street—I let portions of it furnished—the prisoner came into my service in the early part of September—in November I missed some things, among others, the articles stated—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and she said she had not got them. On the 1st of December I gave her warning, and gave her leave to go out and look for a lodging—on the Wednesday follow<lb></lb>ing, in consequence of what I heard, I went to the house of Mrs. Crow, and there I saw a tray-cloth which I recognised as mine—I went from there to the station, and saw the prisoner there—the constable took the tray-cloth—I said to the prisoner, "Mary, this is the tray-cloth I asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140009"></xptr>
               <p>you for repeatedly"—she said it was hers, and that she had had it three years—she then said to the inspector that she had purchased the duplicate at her last lodging three months previous—she gave the keys of her boxes to the constable—I saw them searched—Mrs. Crow was present, the prisoner was not—the boxes were locked—I found in them some ribbon, table napkins, towels, and part of a jack-towel which had been cut up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. After I had been with you a month, when Miss Frisby, one of the lodgers, was going away, you asked me to collect all the napkins and towels, to see if they were all safe—I did so—you said there was one wanting—I went down stairs, but did not find it—next day I found it down stairs, I brought it up, and you then said all your things were quite right. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That did occur, but it was subsequent to this—I did not re<lb></lb>ceive all the towels and cloths—part of them were kept back—I did not ask for the jack-towels, because those things were in use in the kitchen—if you washed out any kitchen cloths, you kept them down stairs—I was not in the habit of seeing them brought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I asked for a clean towel, as I had nothing for use, but she would not give it me, and I had to take my own towels and use them—she gave me some tea cloths, and I sent them to the wash with my own things, and when the woman brought them home, why not claim them?—we had another lodger, a Captain—I had the care of his plate—Mrs. Cole had no plate, it was all German silver—the Captain was only a fortnight in the house—he left through Mrs. Cole's ill conduct, he would not stop when he was told that she was a kept lady—a lady and gentleman named Wells lodged with her—he saw her gentleman go down one morning very early, and asked me if it was the case—I said I did not know, but if it was, I would not stop—next morning, mistress sent me out for a Seidlitz powder—I took it up into her bed-room, and this gentleman was in bed with her—I told the lodgers of it, and gave her notice to leave—the pieces of ribbon Mrs. Cole gave me—the other things I bought the day I left—before my boxes were taken away, I came up to my mistress, and said I was ready to go when she paid me my wages—she said she missed a knife—I searched every where for it, but could not find it. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I found her to be a very malicious creature, and making very false statements to the lodgers, and in consequence I had her up, and she said it was not her—I afterwards found it did originate from her, and she then said, "Rather than have any more confusion, we will part"—I said, "Very well, this day month"—she gave me warning—I never gave her the ribbon, I positively swear—I missed several knives and forks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Edward Crow, and live at No. 16, North-street, Marylebone. On Tuesday, the 1st of December, the prisoner came to hire a lodging of me—she left, and said she would come in the evening—she then brought me a bundle containing some things damp, and asked me if I would take care of it—I afterwards opened it, and found in it three napkins, and a jack-towel cut in three, all apparently very wet, but I am not quite sure—next morning she asked for the towels and said they were not hers, she was going to take them home—I gave them all to her as I supposed, but the tray-cloth had fallen down behind the arm-chair, which I did not see—in consequence of something, I gave notice to Mrs. Cole, who came to my house, saw the tray-cloth, and claimed it—I saw the constable open her boxes the same night, and in them were found the same napkins she had taken from me in the morning, the</p>

               <p>jack-towel, two other towels, two pieces of ribbon, and a gilt slide—I saw them all taken out—before they were found, the prisoner said to me at the station, "The towels that you have of mine, I have had these three years, and there are more in my box—they were in pledge last February twelve-month with a silk handkerchief."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The night I left my place I engaged this lodging; I had these towels washed; I gave them to Mrs. Crow to take care of; next morning, when I asked her for them, she gave me five; I said there was another; she said she did not know where it was, she would look; she afterwards met me on the stairs, and said, "Here is your towel;" I said, "Be so good as keep it till I come back;" when I returned, a policeman was there; Mrs. Crow said, "This is the young woman you want;" I said, "What do you want me for?" he said, "You are accused of stealing a table-cloth;" I said, "Where is it?" he asked for the towel; I said, "That is my own, and I have five more in the box;" I gave up the keys, and said, "There is nothing in the boxes but what is my own;" I said I had had the towels three years, and before I bought the duplicate of them they were in pledge thirteen months.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 41.) I searched the prisoner's boxes on Wednesday evening, the 2nd of December—the prisoner was then in custody—I found all these things in the boxes except the tray-cloth—Mrs. Cole and Mrs. Crow were present, but I took them out—I opened the boxes with the keys the prisoner had given me—I found the gilt slide at the bottom of the box—no one put their hands into the box but me—Mrs. Cole and Mrs. Crow were standing two or three feet from it—no one could have put any thing in while I was searching it without my seeing it, and I am positive no one did—I took the things to the station, and showed them to the prisoner—she said the towels and napkins were hers, she had had them three years, (I am sure she said that of all the cloths,) and the ribbon her mistress had given to her—the gilt slide was not mentioned to her—I have had these things in my possession ever since the Wednesday when I found them.</p>

It is quite false—I never followed her, nor ever went out of my own door—I did not go to Mrs. Cole's till eleven o'clock next morning, when, seeing the fish-napkins, I went to inquire about the prisoner's character—I told her that I was very particular who I took in, for last Sessions a woman was tried who had brought stolen property to my house, and I was frightened.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I told Mrs. Cole that I must get time to wash my own things before I left; she said, if I would get them ready and bring them to her, she would send them to her washerwoman for me; I brought her up a cap and one of these napkins, and when the woman sent them home they were marked with the "W" in blue cotton—when the lodgers made a piece of work about Mrs. Cole and this gentleman, they had me up—this gentleman said I was telling falsehoods, and he did not think I knew it; he said, "Mary, I think you are doing a great deal of mischief, it is very wrong;" I said, "How sir?" he said I had told Mr. Wells, and the whole of them of it—I said I could be on my oath I had never named it to any one in the house; he said Mrs. Cole meant to have them all up to clear her character; I said, if he had me up it would not be very plea<lb></lb>sant for either party; Mrs. Cole said, "Why? and I said, "I saw Mr.——in bed with you one morning;" Mr.——said, "Do you mean that?" I said, "Yes;" he asked if I had not told any one of it, I said, "No;" he advised me not to speak of it, and said Mrs. Cole had said she was very sorry I was to leave her, for I was a very faithful servant; he said, "Mary, promise you won't speak of it, and let the scandal go no further;"—he gave me half-a-crown, and I promised before I left the room that I would never speak of it any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter of the last witness. I remem<lb></lb>ber the prisoner having some towels—I hemmed three for her after she left her place at Mr. Nicholls's, in the Strand, about three years ago—these are the three—I can swear to my own work—they are coarse towels—one side of them was not hemmed, because I had not time to do it, and she put it into her box, and here is one with one side not hemmed, the other two are complete—these are my own work—they were new when I hemmed them three years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean deliberately to swear that these are the three towels you hemmed three years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was living with my mother at the time—she saw me hemming them—no, she was out with the stall that day, as my father was tipsy—I hemmed them all the same day; I was going to my place that night, and had not time to hem this side—I am sure that was the reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why say just now it was because the prisoner took them away in a hurry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had some caps to quill up for me—she did not wish me to lose my place—she and my mother had a fall-out—I always spoke to her—I have no feeling against any one in this case—I have not threat<lb></lb>ened, since I have been in Court, to give Mrs. Crow a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> the moment I get out—I have not spoken a word to her, and if I saw her I should not know her—I will swear I never said so—I was to be at my place at seven o'clock the evening I hemmed these towels, but I did not go till a quarter after eight—my mother carried my box—I did not tell her I had hemmed the towels—I do not know these diaper ones—I only saw some in the prisoner's box, but I should not know them again—I never took notice of them—I do not call these towels new—I cannot tell whether they have been washed—I only hemmed two sides of each, not the four sides—I saw them about five months ago, when the prisoner lived at Mrs. Grogen's, No. 12, Gee's-court—she took me there to tea one Monday, and as she was pulling out her things, to put on her shawl to go out, I said, "Here are these towels, Mary, that I hemmed," and she said, "Yes"—my mother was not there—I did not tell her of it—I did not go before the Magistrate—I should know a hem that had been ironed or mangled—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one of the towels</hi>)—I do not know whether this hem has been ironed or mangled since it was hemmed—I cannot say—I do not think it has—they have been washed since I hemmed them—some persons iron towels and napkins after washing them, and some do not—there was no letter on either of them when I hemmed them, that I know of—I did not notice it—I hemmed this side, but I did not take notice of that letter—(<hi rend="italic">this was the towel with but one side hemmed; the letter "E" was on the unhemmed side, and close to the edge</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live at No. 83, Great Maryle<lb></lb>bone-street. The prisoner came into my service about the 22nd of No<lb></lb>vember, 1838, and lived with me one year and ten months—I know but little of her towels further than she had such things, which I saw the day after she left my service, when she was taking away her things—there were</p>

               <p>different sorts, but there was one which I asked a friend of mine what it was called, and she said, "A damask towel"—I likewise saw another, which had the letter "W" in the corner—I said that was not one of the initials of Mary's name, and the next time I saw her I asked her how it came to be marked so—she said, as she could not read, all her things were marked in that way, and she showed me a pocket-handkerchief and a cap, which were marked in that way—I am single—she sent a strange woman to take her things away, and not liking to give them to a stranger, I requested a friend of mine to take an inventory of her things, and my friend had one in her hand which was a damask one—I said Mary had excellent things, but I did not know she had such things—it had a "W" in the corner—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—that is the kind of towel, but that this is the same I could not swear—it has precisely the same sort of mark—I gave her a character to Mrs. Cole—she left me because I considered her temper rather hasty, and she said if I chose to pay her she would leave immediately—I told her she might go—I gave her a character, as being hasty, but as for honesty, sobriety, and such like, I never had her equal—one of Mrs. Cole's lodgers would have been here, but he is in Paris—I have two letters from him, and one letter of Mrs. Cole's to him.</p>

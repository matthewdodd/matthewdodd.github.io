                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 306). I was on duty in Prince of Wales Crescent, Haverstock Hill, on the night of 21st January last—I saw the prisoner standing at the door of his shop, No. 27—I wished him good night, and went round my beat—It was about ten minutes to eleven, as near as I can tell—it takes me about half an hour to go round my beat—I had been round several times before the fire occurred, about three times I think—I then saw smoke coming from the top of the shop, from the two corners of the facia—that Was about half-past twelve o'clock—I rang the bell, knocked at the door, and sprang my rattle—I stayed there till the firemen came—I saw the prisoner about a quarter of an hour after I had rung the bell—I saw him and his wife come from the passage at the back of</p>

               <p>the house—they appeared to bo perfectly dressed, the wife had a shawl on her head—the fire was extinguished in about from half to three-quarters of an hour from the time I first rang the bell—after it was extinguished I went up stairs into the first floor back room—I observed some dark sticky stuff on the floor—it smelt very much like tar—I went over the rest of the house, I found the same appearance all over the house—I went into the bedroom in which the prisoner and his wife slept—it was the top front room—I looked at the bed; it did not appear as if it had been slept in—the blanket and counterpane was merely thrown back; it did not appear as if any one had lain on it; there were no sheets on the bed—there was the same black appearance on the bed, the blankets, and counterpane—I cut a piece of paper from the wall and a piece of the cover from the sofa, and gave them to Dr. Redwood's assistant, together with two pieces of I wood, which I cut, one from the little back room on the first floor, and the other from the second floor back—that was some few days after the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the Western Fire Brigade, stationed at Ferdinand Street, Haverstock Hill—I was called to a fire at 27, Prince of Wales Crescent, on 21st January about half-past twelve or a quarter to one—it was a very cold frosty night, the night before the rain froze—I saw smoke come from the shop front, through the shutters; one stream of smoke was coming all along the shutters, but it seemed to come out in two particular streams, one just over the fanlight, and the other at the further end of the shutters—I was accompanied by two more firemen, Coutts and Keller—I saw the constable Ford when I arrived there with the engine—I went round to the back, in the court, with my hand-pump, and got over</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060045"></xptr>
               <p>the wall into the yard of the house—the other two firemen were with me, wo cut a hole through the window and shutter of the parlour on the ground floor—I then looked through and saw fire burning under the counter, very slightly, that is, I saw flames coming from under the counter—the door that divides the parlour and shop is half glass, and I saw through the glass—I had the hand-pump and a pail of water with me—I tried to open the shutters, but found I could not, from a bar being across them, and two of us burst open the yard door—we went into the kitchen, and from the kitchen up the passage into the back parlour, and I commenced to work on the fire—I should say this took up about a minuto or a minute and a half—we burst the door open very quickly—when I got into the back parlour the flames were still coming from under the counter—they had increased very trifling—Coutts went into the back parlour with me, he worked the hand-pump with a pail of water, and I crawled on my hands and knees towards the counter and played upon it—we had opened the parlour door to get into the parlour from the passage, and we opened the door between the shop and parlour; it was not locked, merely shut—we had nearly exhausted the pail of water when we were driven back by a sudden flame which seemed to come all over the shop—I can't tell what kind of flame it was—I had to cover my eyes, the sulphur from it was so great, and run momently, I could not have stood it—it smelt very much like tar, and the stench was very sickly when it was in my throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any sound of an explosion, or merely a blaze? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A sort of a blow, a sort of sudden light as if it was blown, but no loud report, only a sudden blaze up—we got out into the yard, I got out safe, one of the men dropped behind me—we closed all the doors after us—when I was in the yard I again looked through the hole in the shutter which I had previously made—the flames were then coming into the back parlour—the smoke was very black indeed, and very voluminous, it came out in volumes out of all the windows—we then went round to the front—we had taken our engine with us when we went there, the engine belonging to the Western Fire Brigade—we then ran onr hose oat and got our engine to work, another fireman took the branch—we cooled the fire down in about ten minutes—we then went into the premises and thoroughly extinguished it—I came out to have a blow, and saw the prisoner standing near my engine—the smoke and steam was then coming out of the shop front—I believe there was a little fire then, because the firemen were working it—the prisoner was thoroughly dressed—I said, "Mr. Wales?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you insured?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "In what office?"—he said, "The Western"—I asked if he could show me the policy or give me the number and the particulars—he did so—he went into a neighbour's parlour in the next house, and he produced the policy from a tin box or case; either he or his wife had it at the time I spoke to him, I won't be sure which, but I saw him with it afterwards; he either brought it from under his right arm, or his wife gave it to him; it con<lb></lb>tained a policy for the plate glass and a policy of Insurance—I asked if he could account for the fire—he said, no, he could not—I said, "I shall leave a man behind; I suppose you have no objection to it?"—he said, "No"—I afterwards went over the house—I went into a back room on the first floor laudiug—when first I broke the door open the smell was very great indeed, and the smoke so suffocating that I could not enter—when I did go iii the smell had very much gone off—the smoke had gone—the smell</p>

               <p>was very much like tar—there was no furniture whatever in the room—I observed the flooring, it was then very wet with a black substance—I should say about half a gallon, as near as I could estimate, of a black liquid which was very sticky when you touched it, and smelt very much like tar—it was all over the floor—I then went to the second floor front; there was a carpet on the floor of that room, and as I walked across to open the window to let out the smoke, I found it stick to my feet—I put my hand down on the carpet, and when I brought it up it was all over black stuff, the same as I had experienced before, and it smelt very much like tar—it had the appearance of tar—I can compare it to nothing else—there was a bed in that room, and blankets and a counterpane on it, but no sheets—I looked to see whether the bed had been laid in; my opinion was that nobody had slept in it, because the clothes were laid level across, made for any person to get in—the blankets were very black indeed, almost a jet black, where they had been exposed to the smoke—I next went into the back room, second floor—I observed a hearthrug there, that was the same as the front room carpet, of the two I think it was more saturated—the floor of that room was the same as the back room below, but the liquor swimming on it appeared to be about a gill, about as big as a large-sized glassful, it was lying close to the crevice of the door—I touched it and smelt it; it was sticky, and smelt the same as I had smelt in the room below—the paper on the whole of the walls was very black indeed; there was some smoke which you could not nib off, such as I had never experienced before at any fires, and I have been at a great many—I examined the banisters and woodwork; I found them covered with a black substance, and it was all blistered up in black blisters, and in one portion it was as if it was running down, but the heat had dried it up; that was on what is called the cheek of the staircase, the wood-work that runs up the side—that had the same smell, but not so much as the floor—I left the house about three o'clock—I was taken ill—I returned next morning about eleven with Mr. Becker, the manager of the Western Insurance Office—I examined the shop more minutely as soon as we could clear the rubbish away; that was about the next day, the second day after the fire—I examined the remains of the counter, it is here—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of it—there is some more in a van outside; this is the top of the counter, and here is the underneath part of it, the part that was burnt—the upper portion is not burnt—there is a bit of the cloth on it now—it is printed calico—the remains of the counter which is outside is like this, burnt inside, but not out—I saw some boxes which were found by my firemen in the shop—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them; that is burnt inside, and not out—there were two other boxes larger than this they are here,—they are more burnt—I saw them on the premises the next day after the fire, but not to take any particular notice of them till the fireman called my attention to them, about the second day after—I smelt the boxes at that time, I could not perceive any smell in them, only of burnt wood—this is the remains of the other box—they got broken in turning over the ruins—this is the third box—there are two big ones and a small one—these are the whole of the three boxes—I examined the state of the shop floor the day after the fire, but not so minutely as I did the day after, and since that—I examined the part where I first observed the fire when looking through the hole in the shutter—I found a hole burnt in the floor where, as near as I can remember, I first saw the fire; it was burnt completely through, and I saw another hole from two to three feet nearer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060047"></xptr>
               <p>towards where I was kneeling when I first went in, nearer the parlour door—I found several smaller holes, some about five inches in diameter—the holes under the counter were, I should say, about eighteen inches by fourteen, I never measured them—one was a little larger than the other—the one nearer the parlour door was the largest—there was one hole under the show board of the window; that was about nine inches across—on clearing away the rubbish of the shop I found the floor was burnt all over, as if something had run all over the floor alight; we saw that when we came to sweep the floor up—we did not discern that while the rubbish was lying about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There is no doubt the fire was all over the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the appearance something had burnt it here and there, all over the shop, as if something had run all over it slightly—some parts were left not burnt; it was as if you upset a pail of water, the lower parts would be wet and the higher parts would not—I give it as my idea that something had run alight all over it, and as it ran on the lower parts it burnt it, but there were some portions, a foot or eighteen inches square, not burnt—I have been a fireman a great many years—the flames had not rushed up through the house, or else they would have fired the staircase, and that was not burnt—the walls were blackened by the smoke, in my opinion—there were blisters on the doors outside, where the heat had got to them—the outside of the first floor front door was very much blistered; heat would blister that, not flame, the flame was not up so high as that, that is my opinion—I saw the appearance of smoke having come through the top of the door of the first floor front room, not flame; flame would have fired it—the door was blistered outside, and smoke had got inside through the cre<lb></lb>vices, but only smoke—the walls of the staircase were blackened; that was from smoke—if I was asked to give my opinion as a practical man, I would swear it was not flame—the banisters were not charred; they were blistered into a lot of little black blisters—I have not said that they were charred; there was something on them which the heat had caused to blister—I saw the flooring of the first floor back room all black; that was from something in the smoke; in my opinion it was not smoke that blistered it, but something that was conveyed up in the smoke—it got on the floor by condensing itself in the smoke, and so falling on the floor—the walls on the second floor were all blackened—the walls in the first floor back room, which I have been speaking of, were not blackened; they might have been a little discoloured by smoke, but they were not blackened as the others were—I am speaking of the little room on the landing over the kitchen—the walls of that room were not blackened in the same way as the walls of the staircase, nothing at all like it—the door was shut—the door of the second floor back room was open when I went up—I believe I mentioned at the police-court about finding half a gallon of something like tar—I can't call it to memory—it is nearly four months ago since I was at the police-court—I have stated more about tar this time than I have stated before—I did speak about tar at the first hearing—I have not heard the scientific witnesses give their evidence—I have read some of it in the newspaper—I have never been allowed to be with them—there was a bed and bedding in the front room second floor, but no sheets—there was also a bed in the back room first floor, but, as far as my memory goes, no sheots or blankets—in the top back room there was a bed, and that had a counterpane and a blanket—I found no sheets on any of the beds—the only parts of the house in</p>

I am fire superintendent of the Western Insurance Company—ou 22nd January I went to these premises, which had been burnt—I noticed a very strong smell of some compound—it smelt to me like a mineral oil, paraffin, or something of that description—I did not examine the floor of the shop at first—the walls were extremely blackened—the paint was much blackened and blistered—I examined the flooring of the shop—I found it covered with a deposit—I produce a part of the flooring which I took out from the front room—the whole of the ilooring was of the same appearance—I found a watch in the basement or cellar of the house, underneath the shop—I delivered it to Dr. Redwood about twelve o'clock that day—I was told that a person of the name of Wales desired to see me—I went down to the shop and saw the prisoner—I asked if his name was Wales—ho said, "Yes"—I said, "This is a very bad job"—he said, "Yes, it is"—I asked him how it occurred—he said he did not know—I said, "Did you ever keep any inflammable spirits on the premises"—he said, "Never"—I asked if he had his py—he said,</p>

I carry on business at 8, Finch Lane, and am sur-veyor to the Western Insurance Company—ou the 20th November last I examined these premises for the purpose of insurance—I examined the furniture, stock, and fixtures—the furniture was very good indeed—it was ordinary furniture—the stock consisted principally of clothes, chimney ornaments, bronze statuettes, a few watches, and a little mosaic jewellery—I made a report to the office—I did not see the prisoner with reference to the insurance—I saw his wife, and an insurance was latterly effected for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on stock and utensils in trade, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on fixtures, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on household goods, furniture, &amp;c.—in company with Mr. Becker, I went to the same premises the morning after the fire, about a quarter-past twelve, and roughly examined the salvage—I did not go minutely into it, because we had an assessor to look at it.</p>

I am a fellow of the College of Physicians and lecturer on chemistry at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was requested to go over the premises in the Prince of Wales Crescent, and have done so on two occasions, on 1st April and 1st May—I examined the state of the walls—I have also been shown some articles that have been brought from the premises—I have not been in Court during the case—in my judg<lb></lb>ment, the deposit on the walls was a substance of the nature of tar—I have examined it—it is a substance of the character of tar, and in some places, on the windows, of pitch, which is dried tar; that is the only difference—iu setting fire to tar a portion of the tar burns and gives rise to a sooty smoke, and another portion of the tar volatilises, unburnt, and gives rise to this tarry deposit—it would be conveyed in a state of vapour, which would condense in the form of a liquid at first on the cold surface, and then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060052"></xptr>
               <p>dry up: it would condense most on the coldest surface—there were symp<lb></lb>toms of this deposit on the whole of tho surfaces of the house—the whole of the interior was substantially saturated with it—the walls of the rooms on the first floor were not much affected, but the floor was, and, with the exception of the walls on the first floor, I think the whole of the interior of the house was characteristically covered with this deposit—there is a composition called oil of tar—the combustion of oil of tar would account for all the appearances—the substance on the walls was either tar or pitch but the substance that produced it need not necessarily have been tar or pitch; it may have been of some allied nature, such as oil of tar or lesin—naphtha would account for the blackness and soot—naphtha is coal tar, but it is a name applied to many different substances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there was a sudden turst of flame, a thick black smoke with a tarry smell, taking that in connection with the observations you made and the appearances you have described, what in your opinion was it caused by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The appearances, taken by themselves, show that a very large amount of combustible vapour was generated quickly, because it had forced its way in a most remarkable manner, which nothing but a sudden evolution could have done; the whole of the windows were more or less covered with a sticky deposit, but in some of the windows this was sufficiently thick to be scraped off in the form of pitch, and in the kitchen the thickness of this pitch was considerable, and also on the window of the top front room; the pitch had condensed on the inside of the upper sashes and had gone out through the crevice, and then been deposited on the upper part of the outside of the lower sashes; the inference would be that while in a state of vapour it had condensed on the sash and got inside—this is a piece of the glass of that window, taken out by Mr. Redwood; here is a portion which I took out myself from the kitchen that was covered on the inside—I do not at this moment call to mind noticing the kitchen floor particularly—the floor of the back room on the landing was entirely black, ana covered with this tarry or pitchy deposit, more par<lb></lb>ticularly a piece of stone in front of the fireplace, which was probably cold—I have looked at this table—cover—the top—was no doubt originally the same colour as the sides, but this black effect was no doubt caused by the deposit of the vapour—that is proved by the fact that where any object sheltered the cloth from the direct falling of the vapour upon it, there You have no vapour deposited, and consequently the mark of the object—here you have the marks of the three feet of the lamp—I saw the cloth upon the table—the part that hangs down is not at all affected, showing that it was not something spilt, but something condensed upon it—here is a mark of a comb, which was evidently lying on the table; of course the vapour in condensing fell on the comb and not on the cloth, and there is the mark of the comb so fine that you can see the teeth—marks, almost as if it was photographed—the paper on the walls was entirely black—that was not from soot, or not entirely from soot, because it would not rub off—it did not soil the fingers—it was varnished on by this deposit—from the streaky character of tho paper where it had been blackened, I was inclined to think at first that the paper had been a watered pattern; but I afterwards found some of it—this is a piece of the staircase paper, and this is a piece just from the very bottom of the staircase—I consider it quite clear from the appearances that there must have been a very sudden exhibition of this vapour, and it must have been from something in a comparatively liquid state, something that would very readily volatilise—I think if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060053"></xptr>
               <p>shavings had been saturated with some imflammable liquid, the probability is the liquid would have been burnt and not set free, in this case the greater portion had been volatilised—I have examined the boxes produced, and the result of my observation is that in that box, and more particularly in another, a smaller box, burning had taken place substantially from the inside—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one—I think the character is even more marked in the larger one than in this—there is no appearance in these boxes of the deposit that appeared on the walls—if the liquid had been in these boxes I think I should have expected to find some of the deposit in them; of course the tar, or whatever it was, might have been in some vessel inside the boxes; if the tar had been placed bodily in the boxes I should have expected some residuum, but if it was in a vessel it might or might not be so, it would depend upon the condensation downwards—I mean to say, supposing the tar was in a vessel, and that vessel put in the box, I should not expect to find any marks in the box to indicate that—I had some jewellery shown me—I also saw some of the shop flooring, over which some liquid was said to have been poured—the appearance of the burnt shop floor was as if some burning liquid had flown over it, there were irregular marks—the flooring was simply burnt—I have here the remains of a silver watch—there is no doubt the state of this watch could only have been produced by a very severe fire, and not from a fire in which a large quantity of matter was volatilising, because there you have necessarily a low temperature, the distillation keeps down the temperature; the silver, the glass, and a portion of the handle have been melted—it could not have been exposed to a high temperature, metallurgically speaking—the greatest marks of fire were on the floor under the counter, and the counter itself was not burnt through, so that the articles on the counter could not have been subjected to any great heat—that was shown, more-over, by the remains of the oilcloth covering remaining on the counter not being burnt; in my opinion it is quite impossible that that effect could have been produced by that fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you able to say positively that the deposit you found was from oil of tar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was of the nature of tar, and there are only certain substances which could have produced it—there is no oil of tar in floorcloth, not in the oilcloth of which I have a specimen here, taken from the place—ordinary oilcloth does not contain oil of tar—floorcloth is made with linseed oil chiefly, in the form of paint, paraffin is not used; there may be sometimes a little of the spirit of paraffin used to volatilise it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of opinion that the burning of oilcloth or floorcloth would account for the appearances in the upper room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not only a matter of opinion, but I have no hesitation whatever in saying it would not, in no quantity—if you get some unusual kind of oilcloth, I do not know what may happen, but I know very well the properties of ordinary oilcloth, and that wo found in the remains on the premises, and I have made experiments with it—if it did contain something in the nature of oil of tar, it would depend upon the quantity and the time during which it was consumed, whether it would account for the appearances in the upper part of the house; if a considerable quantity of india-rubber or gutta-percha were heated, it would boil and volatilise, and produce something that might be called in the nature of oil of tar—I have made experiments upon this oil<lb></lb>cloth in several ways—I have burnt it—when I burnt it in a particular way I was able to extract a resinous matter from it—if you take a piece of it in a thin slip, and set fire to it, it burns with very considerable activity,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060054"></xptr>
               <p>and under those circumstances it produces very little soot, and practically no vapour—at the same time, if you heat it in a mass or roll, by putting it on a fire or heating it with charcoal, it burns very little and it dis<lb></lb>tils a great deal, but very slowly, and moreover in that case, where it only distils and does not burn, you have all the form of the oilcloth left, and more than half its weight remaining—if you operate in a particular manner it is possible to get from this a something in the nature of oil of tar, but still a very different kind of substance from the deposit found upon these different articles; in the first place, it is not so siccative, it does not dry up into a pitch-like mass, and the smell is entirely different—you can make it pretty well any colour you like; if you pistil it in such a manner that it shall be all distilled no soot is formed, and the substance is of a comparatively light colour; if you partially distil and burn it you have a good deal of soot mixed up with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a great quantity of oilcloth, subjected to a mass of flame, no matter now it originated, burning with great intensity from the midst of the oilcloth, would not something be produced in the nature of oil of tar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Put in that general way, yes; and it would, of course, go up in vapour—it would not be deposited in the same way that I found it here, because it is a slow process to produce it from this oilcloth, and the vapour produced in the house had evidently been produced suddenly—it might have been produced from the oilcloth, if there was time enough, but then the appearance would have been different—I was not of opinion that gas had been generated in the upper part of the house—there must have been smoke or soot in the upper part of the house, but whether there was flame or not I can't say, I don't think there was any evidence of it—there was scorching—the paint was scorched, the woodwork was not charred—I think it doubtful if much flame went up the staircase.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would india-rubber or any kind of oilcloth you have ever seen, suddenly burst into a flame, with a thick black smoke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—india-rubber in a mass burns very slowly, and this ex<lb></lb>tremely slowly; we put a mass of half a pound of this on a fresh fire, and it was more than half an hour before we could get the whole of it con<lb></lb>sumed; it is very difficult to burn—if a substance volatilises slowly the vapour disperses, it makes for the readiest channel—neither the theory of burning india-rubber or oilcloth will account for the appearances I noticed.</p>

I am professor of chemistry at King's Col<lb></lb>lege—I have been on these premises and seen the darkened substance on the walls and on the table-cloth, and the deposit on the windows—the only way in which those appearances can be accounted for, in my judgment, is by the sudden combustion of some substance of a resinous or turpentine character, hydro-carbon—tar oil would be of that kind—tar oil has a very characteristic smell; every one knows the smell of wood tar, it is some<lb></lb>thing of that nature—I smelt it distinctly when I went on the premises, in one of the rooms particularly there was a very strong smell of wood tar—the slow combustion of oilcloth or india-rubber would not account for the appearances—I took some things from the premises, here is a white china dish cover that was in the kitchen, it is so completely covered that I don't know whether there is any patterns on it; this has been done by the volatilisation I speak of; it was resting against the wall, and it is covered both before and behind with this volatilised matter—here is a piece of the paper stripped from the wall in the passage; it shows the kind of way in which this has come down—this is from the lowest part near the floor, and</p>

               <p>from there to the top of the house it was completely stained in this manner—this is not charring, but something deposited upon the paper and soaked and which I have afterwards been able to dissolve out and identify in as a tarry oily liquid—this is a portion taken from the front bedroom at the top of the house; it is completely blackened in the same way, not charred, but blackened by this deposit—I have also, some pieces of glass—this is a piece which was taken from the kitchen window, and on it there is a quantity of a black pitch-like deposit, which burns when it is scraped off; it shows very much like pitch, it melts, and burns with a bright smoky flame—the quantity of oil from which this vapour came must hare been considerable—I don't know to what extent, it would be rather a guess to say, but about two gallons, or something like that; I cannot tell—front one to two gallons probably—the appearances which the house presented were those of a sudden burst of flame, accompanied by a large quantity of some black tarry matter and vapour—a great sweep of name had evidently gone up the staircase, the bulk of heat was most manifest at the bottom; the marks of scorching and burning of the paint diminished as you went up; the quantity of this black deposit was very considerable, and it was distri<lb></lb>buted through the house in the most remarkable manner—in general the doors had been shut at the time, but the great expansion of the air produced by this burst had carried the smoke into the rooms and deposited it on the surface of the furniture, hangings, and upon almost everything; it had been even forced into some of the drawers and stained some of the linen—it had actually found its way into a cupboard and stained what was hang<lb></lb>ing there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You speak of a sweep of flame: are you of opinion that the flame did go up the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt it did go a considerable distance up the staircase, to the first floor—it scorched the paint on the back of the first floor door—that would be caused by a hot blast of air—I can't say whether it was actual flame.</p>

I am professor of chemistry to the Pharma<lb></lb>ceutical Society—I handed some articles of jewellery to Dr. Odling—they are in Court—this is the watch—I have looked at that watch and some articles of jewellery, and have examined the premises—I did so about three days after the fire—from the appearance of the rooms and the description given by the firemen, I think I was able to judge of the character of the fire there had been—I do not think it possible that this watch could have been broaght to that state by that fire—there are some faces of watches here where there is evidence of very intense heat having been applied; the enamel of the watch has been fused—I do not think with such a flame as constituted the principal part of the fire in that shop, that effect could have been produced in the time the fire lasted—I saw the state of the walls and flooring, and am of the same opinion with Dr. Odling as to the cause of it.</p>

               <p>morning of 22nd January I was awoke by a noise from the front—I had been in bed since nine o'clock—I listened and thought I heard a woman scream—I opened the window, and saw a woman standing on the flat, the roof of the house, in her night dress, screaming—she was at the height of eighteen or twenty feet from the yard—I heard somebody say, "Can't you jump?"—I said, "For God's sake don't jump, for I have got ladders"—no sooner had I said the words than two men were over the wall taking my ladder—they were getting it over the wall into the court as I rushed down stairs and helped to raise it against the wall, as they were not used to ladders—I held the back of it to save it from slipping, as it was a very slippery night, while somebody fetched the prisoner's wife down; she was in her night dress and had got her stockings on—she was taken into No. 2, Charles Place, Mrs. Thredder's, opposite the back entrance—there is a passage at the back—about three years prior to the fire I was employed by Mr. Taylor, the landlord, to help paint this house—at that time turps was very dear, about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gallon—they got a kind of naphtha stuff to put in the paint—when I was at the fire I smelt just the same smell as when I painted the house—I was taken ill with the nasty-smelling stuff—it won't flare, it makes a smut—I have tried it since—the board over the fanlight had been there before the prisoner came to the house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wales had it—the deposit on the paper and walls was carbon—it was the deposit arising from the consumption of the floor cloth and table covering—supposing a fire to have broken out in the shop, among the contents of which were floor cloth and table covering, which were burnt, the ascent of the smoke or smoky flame charged with that matter would be quite sufficient to account for the appearances in the upper part of the house—I express that opinion with certainty, as far as a matter of opinion can be certainty—I say it on my belief—I took portions of the table cover<lb></lb>ing and stair covering from the <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> in the shop, which we have in Court—there was a large mass of <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> in the back room, but I did not find any burnt matter; it consisted of part of the plate glass front, and the electro-plated tea and coffee service, melted—it was collected together in the back room—there was a large heap; perhaps over a cart load—I can hardly judge of the quantity—it presented the appearance of a black burnt mass in minute fragments—it was from that that I took this piece, of oilcloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is a piece of the plate glass shop front—you may see that some of it has fused, but this is not the fused part—this is only from the severe contraction, the cold going on it from the fire-engine playing—this piece of glass is not fused—from the appearance presented by the plate glass, there must have been a very great amount of heat indeed—this piece is not a sample of that which showed the most heat—this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) shows me that there must have been a very large amount of heat in the internal part, and the body of water playing on the front caused the contraction you see—there is nothing in this piece which can be called fused—I picked these pieces of floor cloth out of the <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> of the shop—the house was in charge of the fireman, and I signed a receipt for them—I made experiments on the portions of the floor cloth I took away, and judge that they were made of paraffin oil or patent turpentine, boiled oil and dryers, sugar of lead, in the principal part of it, and that caused the amount of carbon to be deposited—I came to the conclusion that there was either paraffin oil or patent turpentine in it, on account of the smell and the flame it evolved, and the appearance when it was burnt—I examined the table covers—their composition was similar—the burn<lb></lb>ing of a quantity of floor cloth and table covers, the matter being carried upwards in the smoky flame would, in my judgment, be sufficient to account for the appearances presented in the upper parts of the house; it was all of the same character—I examined the bottles and glasses, on which there was a deposit arising from burning wood—a large quantity of wood had been burnt in the shop—something in the nature of tar can be extracted from burnt wood—that would also ascend in burning—it is my opinion that the deposit was in the nature of tarry matter.</p>

               <p>me—I am not acting as a qualified doctor—I could do so—I can hardly tell you how I came to be in this case—Mr. Wales's brother-in-law is an old friend of mine, and he said he wanted me to give evidence—it was through him my services have been obtained—his name is Thomas Turk—I really don't know what he is—I believe he sells horses, or something of that kind, or is a wheelwright—I really don't know—I knew him when he kept a public-house—he is not an old friend—he is a person I have been acquainted with for some time—I say that the deposit on the floor was cobblers' wex—it did not cover the floor—I only took a piece of it away—there is no tar in cobblers' wax—I scraped some of the matter off the walls and analysed it, first by trying whether it would dissolve in water—it would not—then I dried it—I found that it was carbon—I threw it away after I dried it—I found it was carbon because it was insoluble—I put dilute sulphuric acid to it, and I could not dissolve it—I wanted to see whether it would dissolve or whether it would float—it floated in the acid—I subjected it to my chemical tests, and I was quite satisfied it was car<lb></lb>bon, because it would not consume, only at a very extreme heat—it would only just fuse—I did not expect it to consume in sulphuric acid—it passed off in vapour like soot—that was not when I put it into sulphuric acid—I tried it first in water and it was insoluble, and I tried it afterwards with <hi rend="italic">liquor potassi</hi>, liquor of potass—I tried a piece of the paper from the wall, about half a sheet of note size—I expected that would dissolve in water, but I found it did not—then I tried liquor of potass—I expected by that means to find an oily material that would amalgamate with the potass, and make a kind of black soap—I do not mean that I found an oily preparation in the potass, but on the paper—the soapy matter was not sufficiently unctuous to wash your hands in, but it answered my purpose—it showed me I was correct in my theory, that the oily matter had ascended from the burning floor cloth, and deposited itself on the walls—it was not only carbon, there are other things with it—there is the oily matter—I tried the liquor potassi, and also the acid—they were both going on at the same time—they did not bring me to the same result—the result of the sulphuric acid was nothing at all, no benefit—I never analysed oilcloth before—I did so on this occasion, I swear that; I ascertained its com<lb></lb>ponent parts—in my opinion I found paraffin oil in the floor cloth—it was only in the form of vapour—the walls did not smell of tar, they smelt smoky—I did not see any trace of tar, only on the pictures and the jug—there were traces of tar there—there is only a smoky smell on this table cover—I can't account for the appearance of it—I can only account for it just in the same style as the carpets; the carpets were in the same manner—it looks like some deposit of soot upon it—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at a hearth-rug</hi>) I do not smell any tar here, it is only a sooty smell.

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a fellow of the Royal Society, and am editor of the Chemical News—I examined the premises, 27, Prince of Wales Crescent, the day before yesterday—I examined the paper on the walls in several rooms and different parts, I think all over the house—the paper appeared covered with uniform black deposit—it appeared most likely to be caused by a thick black smoke having settled upon it—I examined the boards in different parts of the house, they were coated in a similar way to the paper, and in addition there seemed to be a thick oily matter in some parts—I could not tell what that was caused by—it might have been pro<lb></lb>duced by many different things—I believe I know the component parts of oil-covering and oilcloth, such as I observed among the <hi rend="italic">débris</hi>—in my opinion the consumption by fire in the lower parts of the house, of such oil-cloth and oil-covering, would produce the effects I saw on the wall, and the deposit on the floor up stairs—oil-covering is a fabric covered over with oily matter; dried boiled linseed oil is the principal component, I believe, but I am not very well acquainted with the process of manufacture—I have made some experiments by burning some of this oil-covering—when I went over the house I saw certain appearances on the walls, on the floor, on the picture frames, and on the glass, and I thought it very probable that the combustion of oilcloth in the lower part of the house would produce the same appearances—I tried the experiment with some of the identical oil-cloth that I took from the premises, and I succeeded in imitating that most perfectly—I set fire to the oilcloth, and when the air had free access to it it burnt with a very smoky flame—upon placing a piece of glass or paper, over that flame the glass and paper were covered with a thick smoke—a black deposit of smoke and soot—that effect was produced when the air had tolerably free access to it, but when it was burnt in a very confined space of air a destructive distillation went on, and an oily matter was evolved that went up in vapour, and condensed upon any cold surface which I placed above it—I placed some of the blackest paper and blackened glass, blackened with the smoke of it; the vapour condensed on this, and pro<lb></lb>duced a similar appearance of the streaks running down that I saw on the glass in the house—by regulating the supply of air during the com<lb></lb>bustion I could produce both those effects simultaneously—the dense black smoke rose on to the paper and glass and porcelain that I had placed above it, and was, so to say, cemented on to the surface by the oily matter producing a black shiny deposit, exactly similar to that seen on the jugs and other things that were in the house—I believe I have given all the results of the experiments I made—I believe they would account for the deposit on the floor, as well as that on the walls—I think the appearances upon this table cover, might be produced by condensed smoke ascending from the lower part of the house where oilcloth was burning, and forcing its way through the closed door; the room would be filled with smoke, and the smoke would gradually settle down upon anything that was in its way; it would naturally not settle upon the part that was hanging—tar is pro<lb></lb>duced by the dry distillation of wood—the circumstance of a fire in a house would be very favourable to the production of tar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Taking the results of the experiments you made, supposing a great quantity of this oilcloth, oil-covering, or oil print in the lower part of the house, would there be a considerable quantity of the same kind of liquid that you produced by your experiments escape to the upper part of the house in vapour, so as to become such a substance as you perceived in your experiments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is all a question of the amount of oilcloth that was in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060065"></xptr>
               <p>the lower part—if there was sufficient I believe it would produce the I effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I presume the experiments you tried with the oil<lb></lb>cloth you tried with small pieces and folded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I tried it principally rolled up; not such a roll as was in the house, but a few square inches rolled up in my fingers to imitate as nearly as possible the condition under which it was burnt in the house—oilcloth will not burn quickly if tightly rolled up—I tried several experiments; in some cases it was more tightly rolled up than in others, the more tightly it was rolled up the more slowly it would burn—I did not analyse the oilcloth at all, so as to ascertain what the elements were, but I think a chemist knows sufficient to speak on such a point—it was sufficient for my purpose to know that it was oily matter—possibly the oilcloth is not all composed alike—I do not know whether it is or not, but I should say not—I only used the oilcloth I took from the house—the term "tar" is such a very vague term, it simply means a resinous thick oily matter, very dark coloured; when oilcloth is burnt it would produce exactly that appearance—there is no tar is oilcloth—tar is a product of destructive distillation—there is nothing of the nature of tar in oilcloth any more than there is in wood—by distilling oilcloth you can get something in the nature of tar—it would not take me many minutes to do it if I had the materials—I examined the deposit on the walls, not chemically; I did not analyse it—it is impossible to say from the appear<lb></lb>ance of this table cover whether it could have been produced by the burn<lb></lb>ing of oilcloth, but I should certainly say that the room in which this was lying hod been full of smoke, which hod gradually settled on it—it is im<lb></lb>possible to say whether there is any tar on it—I know what oil of tar is—if a gallon and a half or two gallons of it in a vessel was reached by flame it would rapidly volatilise and burn with a smoky flame; there would be a great mass of black smoke and vapour, which would penetrate through every crevice, and it would produce this appearance—I believe all the effects I sec on that table cloth could be produced in that way—the piece of glass produced by Dr. Odling has a tarry smell—this appearance would certainly be produced by a sudden rush of vapour arising from the com<lb></lb>bustion of tar-oil—I should expect to see the inside of the glass present a similar appearance to the outside—I believe that such a combustion could arise from the burning of oilcloth—it is simply a question of quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take any quantity of oilcloth you like, and place it in any way you desire, would a fire suddenly reaching that oilcloth produce a sudden burst of black smoke, almost suffocating the persons who were near, and a quantity of vapour, passing all over the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where a quantity of oilcloth is exposed to the action of fire must not combustion be going on for some time before it breaks out into smoke and flame. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If the oilcloth had been previously exposed to the action of the heat a process of dry distillation would go on; that dry distillation would produce a quantity of oily matter, and the heat coming suddenly on that oily matter afterwards might produce the effect, but I was given to understand that the oilcloth was supposed not to have been exposed to the heat previously—I cannot say that I know the con<lb></lb>tents of the shop; it was entirely in ruins—the destructive distillation of wood and floor cloth together, with a volume of smoke ascending, would certainly be sufficient to account for the evolution of something in the nature of tar; it cannot possibly be otherwise—it would not only produce</p>

               <p>sometliing in the nature of tar, but it would produce tar itself—I believe that that something in the nature of tar found oti the floor in the upper part of the house would be accounted for by the burning of the oilcloth and other matters in the shop below, but the expression, "something in the nature of tar," is excessively vague—I was enabled by actual experi<lb></lb>ments with the burning oilcloth, to produce precisely the same appearance—I will not say that that must have been produced by it, but that may have been, and probably was—of course if two gallons were in the shop that might account for the appearances, but the appearances may also be accounted for by the burning of the materials shown to me as having been in the shop—I believe the one would produce them just as readily as the other—portions of the oilcloth rolled up were shown to me; in some of the experiments I made I rolled up the oilcloth in a similar way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to say that all the experiments were tried with small pieces of oilcloth a few inches square? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not try any experiment of how it would burn when rolled up as it was in the shop—tar or pitch is formed from destructive distillation—I should scarcely think it could be produced by the destructive distillation of dried linseed oil, but I am really speaking without much knowledge on the subject.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry to Charing Cross Hospital Medical College, and have been so for four or five years—I visited the premises 27, Prince of Wales Crescent, on Monday, 1st April—I examined the carpet—I do not think I have a piece of it with me, but I have the extract which I took from it—I observed a deposit on the carpet—it seemed a black smoky sort of deposit, smelling somewhat tarry—I took it to the hospital, and in the course of the following day or two I examined it as well as I could—I took a square piece, where the deposit appeared thickest—I boiled a small piece of the carpet with ether—I then poured off the ether and evaporated the solution, and so obtained dryness—I have the basin in which I performed the operation; it has the re<lb></lb>sidue in it—there is a small yellow deposit on the evaporation, a some-what tarry or oily-looking substance—I found that this was acid to test paper—supposing a quantity of oil-cover and oilcloth had been burnt in the lower part of the house, to the best of my belief that would account for the deposit I found on the carpet—I tore a piece of paper off the walls and took it home with me, but did not subject it to any special chemical examination—I also found the deposit on the paper; it was, however, of a different character and appearance at any rate; it more resembled soot; it was a very carbonaceous deposit—I examined the glass of the pictures—I removed one of the pictures, and have it here—I observed what appeared to be a yellow oily substance on the glass—I ex<lb></lb>perimented on that by scraping off a portion of the deposit and boiling it with ether, and another portion with water—the etheral solution or eva<lb></lb>poration gave me a yellow oily substance very similar to the one obtained from the carpet—the aqueous solution was acid—I may state that both these yellow deposits appeared to resemble as closely as possible the yellow oily substance which is obtained during imperfect burning, the distillation, I ought perhaps rather to say, of wood and such like sub<lb></lb>stances</p>

               <p>and fabrics; paper for instance, linen, dresses, and so on—I also examined a white jug, which is hero; it is completely coated over with a kind of black shining deposit—the deposit on the paper was dull, the deposit on this jug is something intermediate between the two other ap<lb></lb>pearances—on the paper I noticed a black opaque deposit, more like soot—on the glass of the picture I noticed a yellow oily substance not in the I least like soot—this seems to have the blackness of the one and some<lb></lb>thing of the oily character of the other—by burning oilcloth and oil-cover, I taken from the premises, I have produced results essentially identical with these three appearances—a day or two ago I had submitted to me a small portion of the glass from the shop—I have it here; there is a black opaque tarry-looking deposit on it—I made a small experiment with that within the last few days—I boiled it with ether, and I found that it separated into two portions, a black powder apparently very like soot, and a liquid, which on evaporation gave me a yellow oil identical in appear<lb></lb>ance with that I obtained by the other processes—that experiment con<lb></lb>firms me in the idea of the black shining deposit being somewhat inter<lb></lb>mediate between the other two—I have here the results of the ex<lb></lb>periments I made, and, if permitted, can show by burning a small piece of oilcloth the mode in which the deposit is produced—in the first place, I burnt a piece of floor cloth, simply taking two or three thicknesses of it I together—here is a portion of the oil-cover which I myself removed from the premises—I only took three or four thicknesses—I burnt it, and noticed that it burnt with a bright light, and with a very thick, smoky flame—at a short distance above that flame I held this piece of white porce<lb></lb>lain, and obtained immediately this deposit on it—there is no particular smell from it, nothing at all in the nature of tar, I believe the burning was too complete for that—I also made another experiment, in which I placed a piece of the substance folded up into a small crucible, such as I have here, in order to take the extreme of the opposite side—in the first experiment I burnt the substance completely with a good supply of air—in this case I did not burn it at all—I simply subjected it to a distillation—I heated it without contact with the air, and in that case I got on the upper portion of the crucible this yellow oily deposit, which is acid to test paper, and resembles closely in all respects the yellow deposit found on the glass of the picture—I should be unable to distinguish between the two—I made a third experiment, not, if I remember right, from the oilcloth, but from the floor cloth; but in one case I made an experiment from the floor cloth which from an oversight I did not make from the oilcloth—I first got a black soot deposited; I then exposed it to the oily vapour attainable by the destructive distillation, trying to obtain the appearance I had got on the jug—this is it—of course I produced the effects rather roughly and imperfectly, but that is a shining black appearance, something like that I found on the jug—I believe that was all the experiments I tried—I cer<lb></lb>tainly believe that the appearances I observed on the premises might all have been occasioned by the burning in the shop of a quantity of oilcloth and oil-covering, with a limited draught of air passing through—sup<lb></lb>posing this table cover to be on the table of a room where the door was shut, and the smoky vapour getting through the crevices and settling on it, I should expect it would present this appearance—I should be sorry 3to swear absolutely that it would, but I should expect it—the tar-like smell on the rug seems to me to resemble very much the burning of wood and other fabrics—I do not say it is identical—a smell is a vague thing to swear to.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you learnt how long this fire lasted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not—I heard it in a general way—I did not understand that it would affect the question much—I was asked what would be the effect of the burning of wood, not what actually took place—it appears to me that a fire lasting an hour, with oilcloth and wood in the place, might account for every wall and window, and almost every article of furniture, being covered with this black deposit—I admit frankly that it is a very difficult case to speak absolutely upon; but the impression I formed on the matter was that it might—if the floorcloth burnt it appears to me it might produce the effect, if it was not burnt, I should not think so—I cannot pretend to say how long it would take to burn oilcloth folded up in sufficient quan<lb></lb>tities to produce such an effect all over the house; it would entirely depend upon the temperature; I cannot give the slightest idea—I think it would depend upon the heat, the draught, and so on, of course it would burn much more slowly in rolls—it is impossible to form an idea how much oilcloth it would take to produce these effects, I believe if a quantity was burnt in a building it would produce them; if you force me to make a guess, I should say perhaps one hundredweight or so: it is a mere guess—I can't say how long it would take to burn a hundredweight; it would depend on the draught, I never made the experiment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a moderate flame, confined to an area of three or four feet, and suddenly a burst of flame, a quantity of black soot, a suf<lb></lb>focating smell of vapour, so that persons were obliged to rush out in consequence, should you be of opinion that that arose from the burning of oilcloth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All produced suddenly! it seems very unlikely; I can't pretend to say it is impossible, I should be very sorry to say so, I should be very sorry to say it was likely, it is not the phenomenon I should expect to see; but I see a good many phenomena that I don't expect—it is precisely consistent with the possibility of a flame reaching a vessel full of tar oil; it is exactly the result that would follow assuming that it was an exceedingly cold night, I should think the appearance! presented all over the house would be entirely consistent with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see the <hi rend="italic">débris? A.</hi> I did—I saw the remain! of a quantity of oilcloth that was actually burnt—I have some small piece with me that have been more or less burnt—I saw some in rolls that had been partially burnt, one end of it or something of the sort; the portion burnt off had been consumed; I found it in the <hi rend="italic">débris;</hi> the great bulk of it appeared to me to have been consumed: I found some remains—it appeared to me that the portion that was not there had been completely consumed; I could not say that whole rolls had not been consumed—I heard some statement of the time the fire lasted, but I did not pay much attention to it, because it was not the point submitted to me—I think they told me that it had lasted some hour or two, but I did not pay much attention—I am sure that it did not last ten or twelve hours; looking at the place was enough to show that—a combustion might have been going on for some considerable time before the effects were visible in smoke issuing from the room; one would fancy that the shop would first of all fill with dense vapour, which would afterward ascend—I cannot say how long the fire would smoulder before smoke would come out—I cannot say that oilcloth burning, and air suddenly admitted, would account for the sudden rush of flame and black smoke; it might; it is a question I feel some uncertainty about, not having any special knowledge to guide me—the smell in the nature of tar might be accounted for by the burning of the</p>

               <p>oilcloth and floor cloth, provided they did burn—it appears to me that might have caused all the appearances I saw—I have no doubt that some quantity was burnt, because I saw it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that black which you produce what is called in popular language "lampblack?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the burning of almost anything will produce that, and the more oily it is the more easy it is to produce it—the yellow matter is a substance which may be seen in burning a piece of twisted paper—it contains citric acid, which was the cause of the acidity I noticed; it is contained in a great variety of other substances—I believe pitch of commerce is a residue after distillation of oils from coal tar—I do not believe that a destructive distillation of linseed oil would produce any appreciable quantity of coal pitch—that confirms me in my idea about these experiments—I found no pitch—if there was pitch, or anything in the nature of it, and any fire about the house, I should imagine it could not be due to the linseed oil and the oilcloth; it is a very delicate question to answer, I am only answering it to the best of my knowledge; it is all rather obscure.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this watch: from the effects of the fire, which you yourself saw, do you think that a fire which left such traces behind it would have been intense enough to have consumed watches, and to have left them in that condition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so—I have examined this watch with some care—it appears to me rather as if some white metal had fallen on it—I should certainly think the fire would have oeen sufficient to reduce watches to this condition—I have no reasonable doubt of it—it seems to me, not that the watch is melted, but that some white metal has fallen on it—if that was found amongst the <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> I should certainly have no hesitation in saying that it was caused by the fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that that could have occurred without a very high temperature of fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I can judge from these specimens, I should think that a very high temperature was not required, because I cannot perceive that even the brass work has been melted—I cannot tell whether this is silver—I cannot tell the precise temperature at which silver melts—I do not think that a high temperature is antagonistic to destructive distillation—you might have destructive dis<lb></lb>tillation carried on at a high temperature; possibly not in the same spot, but the two processes might go on at the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing that watch to be on the counter, and the counter not burnt, what would you think then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My answer must a little depend upon whether this is silver or not; taking it to be silver, it does not seem to me likely it would be the case; certainly it is possible, supposing there was an iron plate on the counter, for instance, and it was raised some dis<lb></lb>tance from the counter, the heat might then be sufficient on the counter, yet the counter would not be burnt—supposing a fire under the counter, the counter not burnt through, and the watch upon it, it seems very unlikely that it would be melted on the woodwork; supposing this is silver, it would of course be impossible: some metals melt at a very low tem<lb></lb>perature indeed—of course it could not be melted through the counter.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>, Esq. (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I saw the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi>—as far as I can judge, this watch does not show any signs of fusion; it appears as if some fused metal had fallen upon it—the glass is melted—in my judgment the fire that caused the effects I saw in the house would be sufficient to reduce watches to this state, if brought within the action of the flame—I have no doubt of it, a common kitchen fire would produce this effect, and more.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. ODLINE</hi>. I have heard the account given by the last gentleman, of the experiments he made and the results; they are not at all inconsistent with my observations: we made substantially the same experiments, except that we used half-pound materials, but bringing out substantially the same results. I scraped some portions from the wall and from other portions of the premises, and placed them through a rough analysis—the results from the oilcloth do not alter the opinion I have expressed—taking oilcloth and working it in different ways, you can get different results, but the product obtained by the different modes of treating oilcloth differs from the deposit in the house in several particulars—the product obtained by the destructive distillation of the oilcloth is oil, and not tar; it is a substance that is not siccative and does not dry up into a black pitch; the substance produced by the distillation of oilcloth smells essen<lb></lb>tially of the oil; it is the smell of burning oil, quite distinct from the smell of burning tar—another point is that the distillation is an extremely slow process, whereas the distillation of tar takes place almost instantaneously—it took us three hours to distil one half-pound of the material as we found it; we took the roll rather thicker than my arm and cut a section out of it, and tried it with the piece of oilcloth as we found it in the premises, and it took us three hours to distil it, and half an hour to burn it on a strong fire, and it left half its weight in ash—I do not mean that it took three hours before a product was obtained that would fasten on the walls and furniture; the product began to be formed very soon after the heating, but it took that time to effect a complete distillation—there is another point of less character, that the substance produced by the distillation of oil<lb></lb>cloth has a very strongly acid reaction, whereas in the case of this deposit on the walls it was only just acid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to account for the appearances presented in the house by the combustion of any quantity of oilcloth whatever, in connection with any quantity of wood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you take any particular part of the house, a portion of the wall or anything else, leaving out the consideration of smell, that appearance might no doubt be produced by the oilcloth; but if you take the evidence of the sudden evolution of vapour, that could not be produced by oilcloth, because oilcloth will not produce vapour suddenly—we extracted tar from the paper, and from some of the crockery, and from the glass of the windows, what every one would call tar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it that you did distil in three hours from half a pound of oilcloth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We distilled what chemists call empyro<lb></lb>matic tar; that is truly in the nature of tar—it is quite distinct from the substance that we ordinarily call tar; if you burn wood long enough, and with an insufficient access of fir, you will get tar from wood—the ordinary manufacture of tar from wood is a process lasting some weeks—burning wood for the same time it takes to burn oilcloth, will produce tar; if I had performed the same experiment on wood as I did on oilcloth I should have got a tarry substance.</p>

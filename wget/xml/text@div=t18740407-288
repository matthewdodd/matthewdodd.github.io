I keep the St. Bartholomew public-house, West Smithfield—on the afternoon of 12th March, between 1 and 2 o'clock, the two prisoners came in—Haywell first and the other directly after—he nodded to Haywell, and Haywell called for a glass of stout and bitter, and tendered a florin in payment—the barman found it was bad—I broke it in two pieces afterwards—the prisoner got the change and went out—I did not tell him it was bad—Williamson called for a glass of stout and bitter, and tendered a florin—I found it was bad immediately—constable Butcher came in, and I gave Williamson into custody—after Haywell had gone out, my barman gave me another bad florin which be took from the money board—I marked one of the florins and Carter the other, and they were given to the Sergeant at the station—about three weeks before that Haywell had been into the house with another man, who had asked for two glasses of stout and mild and tendered a bad florin, which I broke and gave back to him, and he paid with a good one.</p>

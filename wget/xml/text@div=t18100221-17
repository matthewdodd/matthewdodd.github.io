               <p>Q. Were you returning home from dining with some friends on the day laid in the indictment - A. Yes, between ten and eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been dining - A. At the Virginia Coffee-house, Cornhill. I had drank rather more wine than I usually take. Between Holborn-hill and Middle-row, near Middle-row, the prisoner addressed himself to me; he said, that he had got boots to sell to gentlemen, he could supply gentlemen with superior boots much under the usual prices. I said, if he was a good workman and would give me his address, I would call and look at them; he mentioned something about Tottenham-court-road; I do not think that he mentioned any street or place; he continued walking by the side of me towards my own house, and going through a passage, I think it is called Red Lion-passage, leading into Red Lion-square; he said something about the particular mode of cutting boots at the present time, and proposed to call at a coffee-house that is in the passage, to have something to drink. I do not recollect what particular we had to drink, nor do I recollect that I went into the house, but I went near the bar. We left there, and proceeded up Red Lion-square and up King-street, until we came near the end of <placeName id="t18100221-17-crimeloc101">Bloomsbury-place</placeName>

               <p>Court. What pocket was it - A. My right hand breeches pocket. Having discovered his intention, I resolved to be more watchful of him; it made me more collected. I then, opposite the end of Bloomsbury-place, crossed the way and bid him good night, expecting by that means to get rid of him; he crossed over after me, and not wishing that he should follow me up to my own door, seeing what sort of a character he was, I went up Southampton-row, and then along the south side of Russell-square, till I came to the end of Bedford-place; I there told him I could say nothing more to him upon the subject of boots and shoes, bid him good night, to go home; I turned down Bedford-place towards Bloomsbury-square; he still kept importuning me about the boots and shoes till I came to the end of Bedford-place, next Bloomsbury-square, near to my own house; I turned round to him and desired him to go away. I looked over my shoulder to see if I could see a watchman.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. By this time perhaps you got quite sober - A. Yes, at that instant I was collected; he made a dash at me, got hold of the seal and chain, and snatched it away; he did it with considerable force, he broke the seal and chain off, the ring gave way, I thought he had got watch and all at first. I called out watch, and followed him, he ran towards Russell-street; I collared him at No. 21, he collared me, a scuffle ensued, I never lost sight of him, he never was above four yards from me; I threw him down, I saw the seal and chain in his hand, and finding himself overpowered he resigned it up, and wished to get away; I laid hold of his hand and took the seal and chain out. The watchman came up at that instant, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When he snatched the watch, did not you both fall down together - A. No, I threw him down.</p>
               <p>Q. It was very frosty weather at that time - A. No it was very wet.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know whether you can undertake to say it was not an accidental occurrence of him endeavouring to snatch it from you, to save himself from falling - A. No, it was quite the contrary; he continued wrestling with me when he was down, he was undermost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he charge the watchman with you - A. No, I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>- BAXTER. I am the watch-house keeper. I produce the seal, key and chain; it was given to me by this gentleman at the time the prisoner was brought.</p>

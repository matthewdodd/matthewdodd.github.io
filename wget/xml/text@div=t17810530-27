               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. On Sunday se'nnight my husband lay down on the bed: I had an acquaintance in the room; my child wanted to go down stairs with her. I bid her take the child down, and I would come and fetch her up: I went down after her, and hearing the dog bark, I thought it was my husband's brother had come in. I went to see, and a woman went out: the child said the dog barked at her; but not thinking she had been in my room, I went up stairs, and missed a tea-chest. I went into the next room: they said I had better go after her: I said I could not run then, the fright had seized me so; but if they would run after her, I would follow them as fast as I could. By this time it was about a quarter of an hour after I saw her go out: we went after her, and at the top of Red-lion street, I saw her with something in her apron; I walked behind her; she stopped till I passed her; I then pulled her apron down, and saw the tea-chest; I brought her back, and called my husband; he took her up stairs, and found the spoons in her pocket: she said a man gave them to her in Holborn.</p>

               <p>I met a woman in Holborn, who gave me the tea-chest and the spoons.</p>

On Thursday, 25th Dec., I locked the coach house door, and next morning missed a saddle, bridle, and other things—I saw on the next Monday, at the police station, at Smithfield, a saddle, two bridles, a bridle rein, and some horse cloths, worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they correspond—I do not know the pri<lb></lb>soner—there</p>

                  </hi>. I am a harness maker, in the employment of Mr. Duf<lb></lb>field. I remember a policeman coming to Mr. Duffield's on Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 27th—on 25th Dec., the prisoner came there, and asked me if I would buy a saddle and bridle—I said, "Yes," and asked him to bring them—he said that he could not at present; he came again on Friday, 26th, and asked me if I would come clown and look at the saddle; he gave me his address, No. 5, Vinegar-yard, Drury-lane—I went there at 7 o'clock, and he took me to the top of the house, and found a saddle, two bridles, some reins, and a cloth—I asked him the price of them, he said 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I bid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he took it—I did not pay him, thinking it looked rather suspicious, but asked him to bring them down to our place, and to call at 12 o'clock on Monday morning for the money—he and I took them down to Mr. Duf<lb></lb>field's at that time, he carried part and I carried part—I was at Mr. Duffield's when he called for the money; the things were produced to him, and to the policeman, they are the things which were afterwards shown to Swinyard at the station.</p>

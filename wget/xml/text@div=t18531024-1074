                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers in the London district, stationed at Charing-cross Branch office. The prisoner was a letter carrier in the employment of the post-office there—I was there on 15th Oct.; he was on duty that day—a few minutes after 12 o'clock he was employed in sorting letters for delivery—he was standing at a sorting table for that purpose, taking the letters in his left hand, and placing them in pigeon-holes, according to the different walks—for some reason I thought it right to watch him—the chief inspector, Mr. Edwards, was at the farther end of the office, at a raised desk, looking down the sorting table—it is my duty, while the letters are sorted, to walk backwards and forwards, to see that the sorting is carried on properly—I was about two feet from the prisoner, behind him, so that he did not see me—while I was so stationed I observed him put his letters in the usual course in sorting them—the usual course is to take them up in handfuls in his left hand, and with his right hand sort them into the boxes—I observed him come to a small letter, and with his finger and thumb press it and bend it, so as to ascertain whether it contained anything, and then place it underneath the letters that he had in his hand—he then lowered his hand with the other letters, and placed a few more on the top with his right hand—he had five or six letters in his hand, with the one underneath—he then leaned forward, took his pocket handkerchief out of his pocket, looking intently at the inspector at the desk, then dropped his handkerchief down, wrapped it round the single letter, and placed it in his coat pocket behind—I then drew a few paces back, keeping him in sight, and waited until the sorting was completed, and the prisoner gone to his proper seat—I immediately made the senior inspector acquainted with what I had seen, and he came with me to the prisoner's seat—I said to him, in the prisoner's hearing, "This man I saw secrete a letter in his pocket handkerchief, and place it in his pocket"—the prisoner was sitting on his seat with both hands behind him, looking up at us, and when I taxed him he drew the letter out with one hand, and the handkerchief in the other—it was a small letter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I immediately placed my hand on the letter, and said, "This is the letter"—he said he had not had the letter—I said, "I will swear I saw you take it from behind your coat"—I took it up, and asked the senior inspector if it belonged to the prisoner's walk—he said, "No, it did not"—I took possession of it, and proceeded to search the</p>

               <p>prisoner—he bad two letters in one of his coat pockets, which had not been posted, and a third letter in his side pocket addressed to himself, and a pocket-book—he was then taken to the Chief Office, and given into custody—I opened the letter before the Magistrate—it contained a half sovereign, stuck in this card—I can, by pressing the cover with my finger, feel that there is an enclo<lb></lb>sure—it bears the 12 o'clock post mark of the 15th, and is addressed to Mr. Ellery, No. 5, Lower Crown-street, King-street, Westminster—that would come to the office at Charing-cross in the usual course.</p>

                  </hi>. I was senior inspector of letter carriers, on duty on 18th Oct., at the Charing-cross office—about 12 o'clock that day I received a communication from Mr. Harper, in consequence of which I immediately went to the prisoner, who was then at the seat of the Lambeth-walk, to which he belonged—Mr. Harper said, "This is the man who I saw secrete a letter in his pocket handkerchief and put it in his pocket"—the prisoner had his hands behind him—he drew them from behind, and in his right hand was his pocket handkerchief, and in his left the letter which has been produced—he directly threw the letter down on the desk, and Mr. Harper directly seized it—he asked me if it belonged to the prisoner's walk—I looked at it, and said, "No, it belongs to the Whitehall delivery"—the prisoner said, "I did not take the letter"—Mr. Harper replied, "I saw you distinctly put it in your pocket"—he was then searched, and after being searched he repeated the statement that he did not take the letter—I said, "It is useless your denying having done so; Mr. Harper saw you put it in your pocket, we have seen you take it out"—if this letter had been posted at Walworth between 9 and 10 o'clock, it should be at Charing-cross at 12 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). My Lord and Gentlemen,—Being upwards of 250 miles from home, without any relations or friends in London, and being unable, through want of pecuniary means, to obtain Counsel to defend me, I trust I may not be deemed impertinent in addressing these remarks to you, in answer to the offence with which I now stand charged. During the two years and a half I have been employed as a letter-carrier, I have been but two days absent from my duty; neither have I ever been reported, either for insobriety or any delay as to the delivery of any letter that may have passed through my hands. Respecting the letter now in question, I beg to repeat what I stated before the Magistrate on the day of examination, that I bad no intention to purloin any letter, and that the letter I placed in my pocket was the one directed to myself. I am married, and have a daughter eleven years of age. This is the first time that either myself or any of my family ever stood before a Magistrate, much less a large tribunal like this; and should it please God, through his goodness, to restore me to my family, I shall do all in my power to regain my character by a steady honest life.</p>

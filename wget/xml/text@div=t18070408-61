               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor was very much intoxicated when he came home with Smith and me from the club, it was between two and three o'clock in the morning. I got up in the morning and did Smith's horses, for him. I never left the mews; when Smith came to the carriage, the prosecutor asked about his watch, Smith said that he never saw the watch. I met a person in August last, I bought the duplicate of him, I gave two shillings for it. I am innocent of stealing the watch.</p>

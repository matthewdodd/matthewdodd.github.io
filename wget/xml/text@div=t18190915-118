            . I live at Leeds in Yorkshire. On the 30th of May I dined at the Dog tavern, Holywell-street, Strand, with a friend; I then had this property in a paper in my breeches pocket - I left between eleven and twelve o'clock with my friend - I was quite sober. We went through Maiden-lane, and into Munday's coffee-house. I got to my house in Bedford-street about twelve o'clock, and then missed them - I do not know how or when they were taken. My friend had retired into a passage a short time, and I stood in the street the while. I found my rubies gone, and my gloves put in my pocket in their stead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. When did you last observe them safe - A. At the Dog tavern - I might have put my gloves into my pocket myself; some women came near me in the street, but I did not speak to them - I never saw the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live at No. 68, New Bond-street. About the 26th of May, the prisoner was recommended to me as a person who could purchase stones for me; he shewed me all he had, and I particularly noticed the ruby, and two large turkois. On the Monday following he called and said he had lost them; I advised him to advertise them. On the 12th of June the prisoner brought me twelve, which I purchased for 3 s. each - he was a stranger to me. In a few days he brought me nine more, not so good as the former, and I gave him 2 s. 6 d. each for them. Some time after he brought me twenty more, which being inferior I did not buy. About a fortnight after that he brought me the two large turkois which the prosecutor had shown me - I did not know them again. I said one was pretty good, but the other was not good. He asked 20 l. for one, and 10 l. for the other. I offered him 10 l. for the fine one, and would not but the other - he agreed, and I bought it of him for 10 l. Immediately after that he said,</p>
               <p>"I have something that will suit you better than these." I said why not show all you had at once? - he produced the ruby. The moment I had it in my hand, it struck me that it was Mr. Hebden's. It was a little before nine o'clock in the morning; I was alone, and considering he was a stout man, I was afraid to stop him, but kept examining the ruby to divert his attention till my clerk came. He found I was a long time, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not wish to purchase it to day I will call again;" and to induce him to call again, I said I would give him 15 l. for it, and 3 l. for the bad turkois; the ruby was worth 20 l. - I returned them to him, and he went away. I called my boy up to follow him, and saw him go towards Hannover-square. I went out of town directly after, and left directions with my clerk to stop him if he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are a great number of turkois in the market - A. Yes; many persons come to sell them; he appeared to know the value of them. Turkois are very much alike; it is almost impossible to distinguish them.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Delony; I was present when the prisoner sold the turkois for 3 s. each - he afterwards sold twelve at 2 s. 6 d. each, and about a fortnight after, he brought another parcel, which Mr. Delony declined purchasing. About the beginning of August he brought two large turkois, and asked 40 l. for them; Mr. Delony declined buying them; I received orders from Mr. Delony to stop him. About three days after Mr. Delony went out of town, he came again with the bad turkois and the ruby, and said Mr. Deloney offered 15 l. and 3 l. for them. Perceiving that they were the things belonging to Mr. Hebden, I kept him in conversation till the porter came in; I sent for an officer, and had him secured. I asked him how he came by them? He said he bought them of a foreigner. I told him they belonged to a gentleman, who had lost them. I afterwards went with the landlord of the Dog and Duck, to Coldbath-fields to see if he knew him; he said he had often seen him about Covent-garden, but nothing further. I asked the prisoner who he bought them of? He said he was a foreigner of the name of Laprell, but he did not know where he lived.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to Marlborough-street Office. He said he was a general dealer, that he bought and sold any thing, and that he bought this property of a foreigner, whom he did not know. I asked him where he himself lived; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150042"></xptr>said in Chandler-street, Grosvenor-square; he said he could not tell the number, but the housekeeper's name was Delany, and it was a private house nearly opposite the chapel; I went and inquired at every house, but could find no such name. I returned and told him so; he said I had mistaken the name of the street. I asked him what street he meant; he mentioned several, but could give no direct account - at last he wrote down Chandos-street, but what Chandos-street he could not tell. I proposed to go with him, but he refused, saying, he was a respectable man, and did not choose to be disgraced in the neighbourhood. I made inquiry, and went to No. 5, Cooper-street, Westminster, and found a book in the kitchen. On my fetching him from the House of Correction, I asked him if he lived there? he said he never did. I shewed him the book; he said it was his, and contained an entry of the ages of his children; he then said he did lodge there, and asked if I had taken his wife. It was a small poor house.</p>

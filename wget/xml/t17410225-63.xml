A Man who was before me, pick'd them up, and we carried them in, and while we were talking to Thorne's Apprentice, the Prisoner ran out of the House. We sent the Boy after him, and he was brought back; and then I went away.</p>

Just as I got to the Door, and was going into the Shop, the Prisoner rush'd out of the Entry, and ran away as fast as he could. The Apprentice follow'd him, crying Stop Thief! and under Alders-gate he was taken.</p>

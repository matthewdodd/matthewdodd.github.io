                  </hi>. I am a frame manufacturer, of No. 9, King Street, Covent Garden, and am employed occasionally to sell pictures on commission. On 24th July the prisoner called on me, and said that he had a picture by Linnell, and if I showed it to Mr. Fitzpatrick he would buy it, as he knew him by sight, but not well enough to speak to him—I asked him whether it was a genuine picture by that master—he said, "It is, and Mr. Fitzpatrick has seen it"—I said, "Is it the one he saw at Mr. Smart's?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him that if it was not genuine I would have nothing to do with it, but, if it was what he represented, he could send it round, and I would show it—he asked me when I should see Mr. Fitz<lb></lb>patrick—I said, "In half an hour"—I had an appointment with him in the City—he deals very largely with me for frames—his pictures always come to</p>

               <p>my place—he said, "I will send it round in a case; it is not far off; but do not mention my name to Mr. Fitzpatrick"—he said that he was very much pressed for money, and would part with it at a sacrifice, and he should not like any one to know the price he sold it at—I went into the City direct, and afterwards found this picture left at my place (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has "John Linnell" on it—it is exactly in the same state as when it was brought to me, and is in the same frame—it was inclosed in a rough case—Mr. Fitzpatrick came home with me—he opened the case, and asked me that I thought of the picture—I said I thought it was a great deal of money for so small a picture—Closs had told me to get him 135 guineas for it, and I asked 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Mr. Fitzpatrick that a party had brought the picture to me, and that it was the one he had seen at Mr. Smart's—he said, "Yes, it is," and asked me if I thought there was any doubt about it being genuine, and he took it up, and rubbed the name—I told him that I was not a sufficient judge to give an opinion on it, never having had one in my possession, and I thought he had better go to Mr. Linnell before he bought it—I told him that the person was pressed for money, and that it was con<lb></lb>siderably less than Mr. Smart had sold it to him for; and Mr. Fitzpatrick agreed to buy it if it was genuine—I told him that I believed it was genuine, from what I was told—he said that it was too far to go to Mr. Linnell's, as he should lose the train—I then told him to go and ask Mr. Smart, as the picture was painted for him—he said, "I will give 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and will go to Mr. Smart"—he went away, returned again, and said, "It is all right; Mr. Smart says it is the picture"—during his absence, I went and saw Closs, and told him that I could not get him what he wanted—he said, "If you bring me 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and when I came back, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, "Well, I will give you 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he went away with the picture, and gave me a cheque for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two bills of exchange, making altogether 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he told me distinctly to ask Mr. Closs about it being genuine, and if I could get a warranty I was to do so—I handed the cheque and two bills to Closs, and asked him if he would give me a receipt or war<lb></lb>ranty—he said that Mr. Fitzpatrick had been to Mr. Smart's, aha he would sooner have given him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than he should have done so, and that Mr. Smart had said that it was genuine, and what more did he want—I said, "As you ay it is so, that is sufficient.</p>

               <p>satisfied that it was the picture, but if I could get a warranty I was to do so, and I was not to part with the bills unless Closs would say positively that it was the genuine picture by Linnell—I had not mentioned Closs's name but Mr. Fitzpatrick knew who it was, because he said, "It is a tall gentle-man with a moustache;" and I said, "I will not say that it is not"—Closs said, "If he is not satisfied he can have his money back, for I lose 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it."</p>

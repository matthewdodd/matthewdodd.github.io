               <p>Q. Do you remember the night when your master's house was robbed - A. I do, on the night of the 31st of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person that was up - A. No, I was not; the two children went to bed first, I went next; I secured the doors before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors to the house - A. One front and one back, and one back and one front in the area. I fastened the front area with a key, and bolted the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the front door fastened - A. The key turned, and the bell put up, and the two bolts bolted; the back doors were both bolted and barred.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not aware of any person going out - A. No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the house - A. My master and two sisters, no other servant but me. I went to bed before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alarmed in the night - A. I was not; I got up between four and five, my master called, it was quite day light then; I went down stairs, the first I observed was, the bar was down; I saw the watchman holding the prisoner in the parlour; I went and called somebody else a few doors off; I came in again and turned into the parlour the second time; I saw four silver tea spoons and the sugar tongs, which I know to be my master's property in the watchman's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the door or the house when you first came down - A. When I went out I saw the door open.</p>

               <p>Q. That is where Mr. Warner's house is - A. Yes; his house is No. 7. On the 31st of May I entered my duty, and as half past four o'clock in the morning on the 1st of June, I was calling the hour of half past four, I perceived Mr. Warner's gate, No. 7, open; it is a fore court; I suppose it is about twenty yards distance from the house; I shut the gate again, I thought it was left by accident, it was day light. I went from there and called the half hour up to the end of my beat; I then called a gentleman at No. 21, I returned to my bar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260013"></xptr>I then stripped off my coat, my cutlass, and pistols, and left them; I locked up my box, I went up the beat, and called the hour of five o'clock; it wanted then a quarter to five. I came to Mr. Warner's, I found the gate open, which I had shut at half past four, and I found some spots of ink on the pavement, which caused some suspicion in me. I then entered the gate; I went up to the area, I saw the shutters cut to pieces; the chips were on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they inside shutters - A. Inside shutters; the windows were thrown up, and some chips laying on the outside pavement, and the bell was on the pavement, it was taken out of the window. Then I tried the door, I put my hand to the door, I found the street door open; I could not get in the area, it is a very deep place; I pushed the door open; I found a coffee urn, or a tea urn laying in the passage ready to take out; I went in, I holloaed out who is here, nobody answered; I went on to the parlour door, I then saw the prisoner packing up linen in a gentleman's shirt; I said, sir, what are you doing, he stepped up to me, and said he had a brother that lodged in the house; I said you are a thief, you are robbing the house; I at the moment catched him by the collar; he struggled a little, not much; I then rung the bell which lay opposite of the parlour door, in the street, and Mr. Warner came down; I begged of him to look in the kitchen to see who was there, he looked and said nobody was there; I said you may go up and dress yourself, I can take care of this man; he came down again; we searched the prisoner, we found a pen knife, and some trifling things; Mr. Warner searched his breeches pocket; found four tea spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs, I saw him take them out; he delivered them into my hands; I searched his other pocket, I found a large knife, I took it from him; Mr. Warner picked up his hat, and took out a dozen of doyles from the crown of his hat; Mr. Warner took up an instrument which can be produced by Mr. Armstrong; I asked the prisoner whether it was his or not, he said nothing, he did not deny it; after we had searched him, I had every thing in my possession. I took him to Worship-street, there was no magistrate sitting; I took him to a young man, he put irons on his hands. I took him down to Mr. Armstrong the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine the house more particular to see whether there were any other things in the kitchen - A. There was a quantity of damask table linen packed up in a shirt to a great amount; I catched him in the fact; he then said I have got a brother in the house, I am doing no harm.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office; the prisoner was delivered into my custody by Harris, the watchman; he delivered four tea spoons, a pair of silver tea tongs, twelve doyles, and this centerbit. I put the prisoner in the watchhouse. I called up two other officers, and we went to Mr. Warner's house that morning. In the kitchen this centerbit had made the impression; I fitted the centerbit to the hole, it fitted the hole, there was a hole in each shutter; we went over the fields, we could find nothing else of the property. I found three duplicates on the prisoner, it did not concern Mr. Warner. I took the prisoner before the magistrate, he was committed. I searched his lodging, I found nothing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else that was moved at all in the house - A. There was a number of things taken out of the kitchen drawers and put on the dresser. In a few minutes afterwards, I went into the kitchen, I saw the table cloths and course cloths that we used to wipe hands with, and two tea cloths, and two of my gowns taken out.</p>

Nothing more than the writing desk, that was in the parlour on the sideboard the night before; that was gone; I should value it at about ten shillings,</p>
               <p>Q. What else was there - A. Three table-spoons; I believe one was in the kitchen and the other two in the parlour to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot say; the day before I had cleaned them; I believe I had washed two of them among the dishes and put them in the kitchen cupboard. I know they are my master's; I cannot exactly say what is the value of them; there was a salt spoon that was taken off the sideboard in the parlour, I value that at about sixpence, there was a castor stand worth about three shillings and sixpence I should think, a damask tablecloth taken out of the parlour about two shillings, a cream pot about one pound; I am no judge of these things; a silver wine strainer about eighteen shillings; the tea urn I saw at the front door when I came down, that had been left on the sideboard in the parlour; I cannot say what it is worth, I am no judge in these things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How much of this tobacco is in London? A. I do not know - it is common, but it depends entirely on the colour.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 6th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Imeson's premises. I saw the hole in the wall - I could have got through it easily. On the 8th of November I went, with Waters and Brown, to a house in a small court, in Austin-street - there are but two houses in the court; I placed Waters in the yard, and I knocked at the door; no one came, and I sent Brown in at the window; he opened the door - he and I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in bed with a woman; I called Waters in, and, in a box, close by the bed, I found this tobacco, tied in an apron and this other parcel in a woman's cap; I then found a small portion of snuff in a paper, which I gave to Brown; I then saw Brown find these two crow-bars, near the fire-place; I found two dark lanterns. I then told the prisoner that I took him on suspicion of a robbery at Mr. Imeson's, in High-street, Shoreditch, of some tobacco and half-pence. I took him and the woman to the office. I then went, with Brown and Waters, to Mr. Imeson's, and examined the desk and cupboard, which were broken open, in the shop; I found the marks on the desk exactly fitted this bar, and some lime was on the desk - there is also some on the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never saw the prisoner near the prosecutor's premises? A. No; this was two days after - nobody else lives in the prosecutor's house - the bill was not found against the woman.</p>

            . I am an officer.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this bill produced at the office at the first examination? A. It was; it was not read nor examined - the snuff was produced and looked at - the Magistrate might look at it at a distance - he did not take it off the table; it had been in my possession about two hours.</p>

I went with Brown and Garton, on the 8th of November, to the prisoner's house, and while they were up stairs, I found in a cupboard in the lower room, a dark-lantern, and a bunch of skeleton keys; and on the mantle-shelf a phosphorus-box, some matches, and, in the corner of the room, I found this string, which I produced before the Magistrate, and Mr. Imeson stated it to be part of the string with which he had tied up a parcel the night before; I found these three little jars of tobacco in the lower room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call these two keys skeleton? A. No; but a great part of the bunch are skeleton.</p>

            . My husband is a bricklayer: we live in Old Castle-street; the house the prisoner was taken at is ours; the prisoner lodged there - they had two rooms - they were taken by the woman called Smith, in the name of Foggoter - nobody else lived there - there is but two rooms in the house - it is in a court in Leicester-street: the rent was generally paid by the woman; the prisoner paid it once.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GARTON re-examined. Esther Smith is the woman against whom the bill was thrown out, and who was before the Magistrate when Harvy was there.</p>
               <p>MR. IMESON. The paper this snuff is in, is an invoice of my writing, dated the 5th of November - I had not sent it out - it was in a parcel of tobacco and snuff, for a person named Potter, whose name is on it; the parcel was gone from the shop when I got up in the morning - this string was round the parcel, and from the peculiar manner in which we tie it, and having had occasion to use two strings of different descriptions, I would not swear, but have no doubt, these are the same strings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this bill produced on the first examination? A. It was not looked at, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the value of the tobacco and snuff missing? A. Between 30l. and 40l.; but I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure Potter's parcel had not been sent out? A. It had not - I saw it in the night of the 5th, at nine o'clock, when I went to supper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At my first examination that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060114"></xptr>paper was opened, and both the Magistrate and Mr. Imeson took a pinch of it - it is very strange Mr. Imeson should not have looked at the paper - it was never observed, and Mr. Imeson said there was nothing by which it could be identified.</p>
               <p>MR. IMESON. I did take a pinch of it, but never looked at the paper.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you certain it is the same paper which was produced? A. Yes; the invoice was in the parcel, folded up as an invoice.</p>

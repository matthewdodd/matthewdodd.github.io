            . I am a watchman. I was in Orchard-street at five minutes before one o'clock, on the morning of the 7th of August; I saw the two prisoners coming across the street - one had four fowls, and the other three; I asked where they got them - they said they brought them from the Strand; I took them to the watch-house, and then they said they got them from a house in Vine-street, Chandos-street; the Magistrate ordered me to go to that house, and it was empty; McAndrews' father came to give a description of the fowls before the Magistrate, but he was not satisfied with his description; he described the cock, the bantam hen, and another hen nearly correct, but I believe a woman went from the prisoner to him in the morning.</p>

            . I am a constable. Phillips brought the prisoners and fowls to the watch-house; they said they were their own, and they brought them from Vine-street, Strand, and were going to remove them to Perkins'rents; I heard the father describe the fowls very correctly- I believe the Magistrate was satisfied with the description, but he said it should stand over till Saturday, that it might be put into the Hue and Cry Gazette, to know if any person had lost them.</p>
               <p>McANDREW's Defence. He says it was a woman came next morning - it was only a girl brought our breakfast, and she was not there a minute; my father described all the fowls.</p>
               <p>DOVER's Defence. The Magistrate was very well satisfied with the description, but we were remanded till the Monday, and then the witness did not attend in our behalf- this prisoner came to me at half-past eleven o'clock that night, and asked me to go with him and get the fowls, and let them be in my place, as his mother was forced to move, on account of the improvements; we borrowed the watchman's lantern, and went and took out the fowls.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. I was obliged to leave my house that night; my son was at the play - he came to me at No. 2, Hungerford-market, and got my key to take away the fowls; I did not receive any description of the fowls from any one; I gave the description of them to the Magistrate - they were my son's fowls.</p>

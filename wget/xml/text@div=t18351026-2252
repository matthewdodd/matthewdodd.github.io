                  </hi>. I am a gardener. I was going through Uxbridge about seven o'clock on the 26th of October. I intended to sleep at the Bell, but the prisoner Ryder took me by the arm, and said, "Where are you going?"—I said I wanted a lodging—we went into the Chequers' tap-room, and had a pintof beer and a pipe—we came out, and then she asked me to go to a lodging and asked me for one penny to get a candle, which I gave her—she then bought a candle, and took a light from next door—she unlocked a door, took me up stairs, and said, "Here is my room"—I said it would not do for me, I should not stop—we came out again and she locked the door—we walked up the Chequers' yard, and she asked me to treat her—I would not give her any thing—she then and three men followed her—who they were, I do not know—I told Darvill—he directed me to stop at the yard and he went and found my watch in less than half an hour—this is it.</p>

            , who was at that time my attorney; the prisoner is eat up with the foul distemper, and has been so this two years; he did nothing for a livelihood, only what he robbed and plundered me of; he was too drunken and lazy to work; I am the worse by a thousand pounds for him, and he would lodge with me; he told me he was single, and made overtures of marriage to me, but when I found he had a wife and two children I turned him off, that was near five years ago. On the 23d of April I was sitting in my easy chair alone, he came to me and said, d - n you, you old b - h, money I want, and money I will have; and held up a knife to me, and swore he would rip me up if I cried out; I had cried out murder on his ill usage before, and nobody came near me; I never opened my lips; he took my silk purse out of my pocket, with a half guinea and 8 s. in it; I fainted away; after which I went to bed, and was not out of it for two or three days; I was at that time under the apothecary's hands, very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner when he had taken your money?</p>
               <p>A. Murray. He would not go out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you strip yourself before him?</p>
               <p>A. Murray. I did; and he came to bed to me, all lapped up in flannel, in a woeful condition, and lay there from four o'clock till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go away next morning?</p>
               <p>A. Murray. He was backwards and forwards all the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make no complaint to Mr. Mitchell?</p>
               <p>A. Murray. No; the apothecary came, but I dared not tell him upon the hazard of my life.</p>

                  </hi>. In the early part of Nov. last I was introduced to the prisoner by Mr. Graham, and on 4th Jan. this year I met the prisoner at Graham's, No. 8, Duke-street, St. James's—I mentioned that I was in want of money, and showed him this copy of a promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that if I would entrust it with him, he would pass it through his banking account which he had at the Manchester and Safford Bank, and would remit to my son 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the following morning, 5th Jan.—he said that his uncle, Mr. Hugh Shaw, of Manchester, kept an account there likewise—I had heard of the uncle before—I went to my son's chambers, in Great George-street, and obtained from him the original promissory note, of which this paper is the copy—(<hi rend="italic">This being read, was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th Sept.</hi>, 1855, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable to William Charles Hussey Jones, or order, six months after date, signed Edward Cresswell and Sons, at Williams, Deacon, and Co., Bankers, London, and endorsed, William charles Hussey Jones, Thomas Jones, Hugh Shaw</hi>)—I handed the original, to the prisoner, and he was to send my son 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the telegraph the following morning, and the remainder was to be sent in the course of a few days—the 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not to be sent next morning, because he said that it would not look well to pay the bill in one day, and draw the whole amount the same day—that was after I gave him the note—when he spoke to me before I went to get the note from my son's chambers, and said that he would pass it through the account he had,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150089"></xptr>
               <p>I believed he had an account there, and it was in consequence of that belief that I parted with it—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoners writing, except the signature—this telegraphic message (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is also his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How does it happen that you got this note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I applied to my son, and he had it by him—it was paid to him by his elder brother, who got it from Cresswell's—I believe that not a farthing of it has ever been paid by myself or anybody else, as far as I know—I have endorsed it, and shall be liable to the holder for it; I have not lived all this time without learning that fact—as far as I know, Cress<lb></lb>well and Sons have not paid it—I believe that none of the Tucker people are here—I know that Tucker and Co. got this bill—I do not know anything of Messrs. Tucker—I do not know whether they <hi rend="italic">did</hi> the prisoner, and me, and everybody else—I am not in communication with Messrs. Tucker, I never saw either of them, or spoke to them—I have never been in communication with them, nor has my son, to my knowledge, but I believe he has—he went to them—I do not know that he got this bill from Tucker's; it was on no other account but for this prosecution, for the production of it in this cause—I believe it was given by Tucker to enable my son to proceed with this prosecution—I cannot say whether, in point of fact, Messrs. Tucker are aiding in this prosecution—I do not think they are aiding in it further than as regards the giving up of this bill—I know no other motive for their giving it up, if it were not to Ald in this prosecution—I know nothing else about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Edward Cresswell and Sons are respectable, and pay their bills, what difficulty had you in getting it discounted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of the bill but receiving it from my son; I had never seen it—I know now that it had only two months to run—four months certainly gives people plenty of time to inquire about a bill or a note—my son Henry is a par<lb></lb>liamentary agent—I used a young man, of whom I know nothing, to get it discounted, because I had no banking account myself—I did not do it through my son, because it was not convenient for him to give me the money, not having it by him; he handed it to me as a matter of accommoda<lb></lb>tion—I wanted money, applied to my son for it, and he gave me the bill—I was to have 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back at once, and the rest was to remain in the hands of the defendant for a few days—I had been in communication with the prisoner from November—I have known Mr. Graham ever since the early part of 1854; I did not apply to him to raise money for me—he is a money dealer, or a money agent—I had not put or caused an advertisement to be pat in a paper; I know of none being put in on my account—Mr. Graham never, to my knowledge, advertised on my account—I have never heard it—I have got two acceptances of the defendant's, amounting to 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>); I have kept them till now—I had no other security, no other bill, or acceptance—I had one other transaction with him, but which I had given up six months before; it was for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—these two acceptances are dated 22nd Dec., 1855—when I first got them, I took means to get them discounted, hut could not; I did not get any more of them, but I had them in my pos<lb></lb>session at the time I have deposed to—I did not know that he had no banker's account until we were before the Magistrate; I had made no inquiry, I got a friend to make inquiry as to his status and position—I did not get the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till some days after—that would bring me to about the middle or towards the latter end of Jan.—I heard that he had applied to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act, and was in gaol in Lancaster Castle, and I then had him taken into custody, and brought up here—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150090"></xptr>
               <p>I have heard of people being whitewashed; I hare not gone through the process myself—I have been bankrupt—I suppose that it was his intention to get rid of all his liabilities in that way; of course, if he went through the the Court he would, so I had him brought up from Lancaster Gaol, and lodged quietly in Newgate—I did not mean that he should get through his liabilities, and rob me—on the second day after that, the father of the pri<lb></lb>soner sent that bill to Messrs. Tucker's—I have never had the bill from Tucker's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If, in point of fact, he committed the fraud you represent, why did you let seven months elapse before taking steps, and only when you heard that he was going through the Insolvent Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not till 6th March that the letter was written from my eldest son to his brother, send<lb></lb>ing a note to Messrs. Tucker with an order to deliver up the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he cheated you in Jan., why did you wait seven months before you gave him into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not know where the bill was gone, and was not desirous of punishing him, and did not think he would be guilty of such an act as appropriating the bill to his own purposes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you find out that you were cheated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 7th March the letter arrived in London—I did not take proceedings till Aug., because I had no wish to have punished him and destroyed his character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not know perfectly well that the Cresswells had notice not to pay the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was on the ground of my having been cheated—proceedings were taken by Messer's. Tucker, I did not take them—I do not mean that the Messrs. Tucker are the parties who, in reality, are at the bottom of this prosecution—I do not know that an endeavour has been made by the father to obtain the money from the Tuckers, and that they are at the bottom or this prosecution—I do not know whether Mr. Tucker is here; I have never seen him—it was he who arrested the prisoner, I only know what for from hearsay—the repre<lb></lb>sentation on which I parted with the bill was made in the presence of Graham, whom I had known from the early part of 1854—after the trans<lb></lb>action of 4th Jan., I applied to get these two bills discounted—I had the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill in my possession up to the middle of Jan.; I tried to get it dis<lb></lb>counted after 4th Jan. till I returned it to Mr. Graham; it was drawn by Graham, and accepted by the prisoner—I held it, and afterwards returned it to Graham in the latter part of Jan.; not all the three, but the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware that the prisoner had any banking account; he always represented to me that his uncle, Hugh Shaw, had a banking account, and was a man of great respectability and position, before the day I got the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, on what account was it drawn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was drawn for a moiety of the share of a slate mine, lease, of which I was the lessee—in the latter end of 1855, I had a take note of the Henry slate quarry—this bill was drawn by Graham, and accepted by the prisoner on account of my share in that quarry—I never endorsed that bill or made myself liable upon it—the prisoner was the pur<lb></lb>chaser of the share—Graham was a party to that purchase, he drew the bill on the prisoner; Graham was to hold one quarter of the mine; he and the pri<lb></lb>soner were to be jointly interested—I found I could do nothing with the bill, and returned it just as I received it, without endorsing it—the lease of the mine is made to me, and is dated Nov., 1853—I agreed to take them at that date; I did not pay any consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what way was their value increased so that the one-half was worth 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had expended a considerable sum of money in opening the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150091"></xptr>
               <p>mine, and had discovered a vein of slate—I represented that to Mr. Graham—the other two notes were drawn by me on the prisoner for the purpose of discount, for his accommodation—I was not to receive any of the proceeds if they were discounted; I have not even endorsed them—I paid for the stamps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not you to have a share of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I took the trouble of discounting it in furtherance of the arrangement contemplated with respect to the slate quarry—at that time I and he were partners—he was to pay 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his share, the bill was for that—he was to pay 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as purchase money, and the other part of the bill I was to have met—the purchase money was 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the agreement (<hi rend="italic">this was doted</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th Dec.</hi>, 1855, <hi rend="italic">between the witness, the prisoner, and Graham, and transferred half the beneficial interest in the date quarry from the witness to the prisoner and Graham</hi>)—If I had obtained discount for the bills, I should have handed the money to the prisoner for his own purposes—he was not to manage the quarry, I was to manage it—he could have had them if he had asked for them—nothing was said about that at the time the bill for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given—it was in March that I first discovered that I had been cheated—I did not positively know where the prisoner was, from that time, till I heard he was in Lancaster Gaol—I suppose he was at his place, Grafton House, Ashton-under-Lyne—I suffered from March to Aug. to intervene without prosecuting him, because I was very unwilling to do anything to damage him, a young man, In his future life, and therefore I declined to the latest moment taking any steps; and more than that, the representations he had made to me of his connections in Manchester had taken effect upon me; and I was still more anxious because one of his uncles I had known for a great many years, Mr. Edward Buckley—I made no charge against him till I heard that he was in prison at the suit of Tucker—I had not the least to do with his arrest by Tucker—the bill was produced before the Magi<lb></lb>strate (<hi rend="italic">A letter was here read from the defendant to Messrs. Tucker, dated</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">th Jan.</hi>, 1856, <hi rend="italic">enclosing the bill for</hi> 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—these other two letters are in the prisoner's writing, except the signature (<hi rend="italic">The first of these was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th Jan.</hi>, 1856, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to Messrs. Tucker, requesting the favour of a remittance of the balance of the bill he had forwarded last Monday even<lb></lb>ing: the second was dated</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th Jan.</hi>, 1856, <hi rend="italic">from the same to the same, requesting the remittance of</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">leaving the balance in their hands; having promised to settle some Christmas accounts.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> I am a son of the prosecutor, and am a Parliamentary agent, of Great George-street. In Nov. last, I had the note produced in my possession—I received it from the party to whom it is made payable, my brother, William Jones, who is the lessee of a colliery, in Flintshire—I know Cresswell and Co. very well; he had and still has very large transactions with them—I gave my brother the whole of it—he asked me if I had any loose money, and I gave him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 29th Oct., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st Nov.—on 4th Jan. he came down to my chambers, and in consequence of what he said I parted with the note, on the understanding that I was to receive the value of it next morning from Ashton, from the prisoner, but I did not receive one farthing of it—this telegraphic communication (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came to me on Saturday, 5th Jan., the day after—I never saw the prisoner till the day he appeared at Westminster.</p>

I am a tobacconist, at 17, May's-buildings—on Sunday, 1st March, the prisoner came to my shop—my wife called me from the parlour, and said, "Here is a bad half-crown I have received from this boy"—she gave it to me, and I asked the prisoner where he got it—he said "From a gentleman outside, to get an ounce of tobacco"—I went to look; there was no gentleman there, only some boys—I then asked him about his address, and told him, if the reference he gave was satisfactory, I should not press the charge—he gave an address—I then sent for a policeman, handed the half-crown to him, and detained the prisoner at Bow-street station—the address he had given was correct—a person came forward, and, on account of the representations she made, I did not press the charge.</p>

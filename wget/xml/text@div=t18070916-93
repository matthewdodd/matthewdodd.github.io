On Tuesday last about twenty minutes before four in the afternoon the prisoner came into our shop to look at some flannels, about a shilling, or fifteen pence a yard; I showed her some at a shilling, she said it was too coarse, she would look at some at fifteen pence; I could not find any of that price. I told her to wait till the young men were disengaged; she waited about a qarter of an hour, I saw her continually watching the young men, I saw her moving a piece of gingham about, but I did not see her take it; I went to the door where there were several customers; I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with the gingham under her arm; I saw it through a hole in her cloak. I informed one of our young men; she went towards Southampton Buildings, she looked at our shop; I believe she saw us; I and the young man followed her into the Grotto pulic-house, Southampton Buildings; she went against the table in the tap room. I picked the gingham up from under the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that gingham was you master's. - A. I know it was the same that was on the counter; I looked on the counter before I went after her, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>THOMAS OWEN. Q. You are shopman in Mr. Craig's house. - A. Yes. He has no partner. I followed the prisoner with the boy to the public house; directly she entered the tap room she fixed her back against the table; I said to her I think you have got something that belongs to us; she said she thought that she had something of great bulk, but she was afraid to bring it back again; I gave her a push of one side, I saw it drop on the ground; I think it came from under her cloak. The boy picked it up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, called three witnesses who gave her good character.</p>

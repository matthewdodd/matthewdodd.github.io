                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer, of 27, Peter Street, Southwark Bridge Road—on 1st June, about 3.30 in the morning, I was awoke by the raising of my bedroom window on the ground floor; it was broad daylight and the sun was shining brightly—the foot of the bed faces the window—I saw the form of a man push back the blind with one hand, and he was in the act of stepping off the window sill on to the floor, the whole of his body being in the room—I called "Halloa," and he immediately decamped back through the open window, closing the window and then the shutters—the prisoner is the man; I have no doubt at all about him—I saw a constable within two minutes and gave him a description of the man—in less than twenty minutes afterwards I was fetched and saw the prisoner at the bottom of the street; I recognised him and he was taken—I had shut the window and shutters</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187506050112"></xptr>
               <p>the night before—the shutters were not fastened; the window was by an ordinary catch—nothing in the house was disturbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a blind to the window—I had never seen the man before; I was awoke by the raising of the sash—the aspect of my room is south-east.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—about 3.40 on this morning I saw a man's figure on the blind outside—I saw his hand move as if unfasten<lb></lb>ing the hasp of the window; I heard it go back and shortly afterwards the window was raised, and he put his head in and held the blind back with one hand; then I saw him put the remainder of his body in to get into the room—when Mr. Baker asked what he wanted the man made use of very offensive language and jumped back into the street, closing the window after him and likewise the shutters—it was very light; I could see very plainly—the prisoner is the man; I have not the least doubt about him.</p>

About 4 o'clock on this morning I received information and went and examined the window; it could be easily forced open with a knife; shortly after this I saw the prisoner in George Yard; I sent for Mr. Baker and he identified him—I said "I charge you with being in the Lord Clive beer-house since 3 o'clock"—he said "I don't know where it is"—I said "At the corner of White Cross Street"—he said "I have been running about all the morning calling people for the races."</p>

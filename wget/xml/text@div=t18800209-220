                  </hi>. I live at 3, Sidney Road—in September last I put an advertisement in the papers—I had saved about 120?. in twenty years, and in answer I received a letter enclosing a card, and I went down and saw the prisoner at 23, Cadogan Terrace, Victoria Park; he said "I am a manufacturing chemist and M.D. as well, and for many years past I have been carrying on the business of a manufacturing chemist in Berlin, but having a wish to live in England I have sold the business and premises which were mine, with the stipulation that the machinery remains, and it will be forwarded to England shortly; I want an energetic young man like you, an Englishman, to assist me in working up a business in London; I have discovered a machine for making butterine from vegetable oil, a perfectly wholesome compound, scarcely distinguishable from butter"—that he had patented that method and sold it to the authorities at Frankfort, but the patent did not extend to England; he said "I also hold a certificate of merit for my manufacture of Eau de Cologne," and showed it to me, it was not in English—he also told me that he had discovered, after many years of study and immense cost, a luminous paint, which Mr. Bush had offered a good round sum for, and mentioned several other inventions, and told me that he had made a great deal of money by his business in Berlin, but had lost a great deal in buying Turkish Bonds, and since being in England his expenses had been very high, sometimes as much as 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day at the hotel, in consequence of which he wanted a temporary advance for about three weeks or so until he received the purchase money of this property at Berlin, 50,000 marks, and whatever was advanced he would repay—he showed me his furniture, which he said he had paid for, and he had been, put to a great expense in furnishing his house at Cadogan Terrace—he said it was his and was paid for—I told him I would think the matter over and let him know—he showed me the deed of purchase of the factory at Berlin, and translated it to me, but not at the first interview—he wanted me to advance him some money to help him over the temporary difficulties and to make samples before the purchase money arrived in England, and I told Fourth Session, 1879—80.</p>

               <p>him I would consider it and let him know—I went to see him next day and he was out—I said I would call again, but I think I wrote to him afterwards declining it—I then went to the North of England to my home and on 28th October I received this card. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner, making an appointment at his factory</hi>)—in consequence of that I went with my wife to 46, Osborne Road, Victoria Park, and saw the prisoner there, another young man, a German, and two little girls, who were labelling bottles of stuff of some kind—it is a four-roomed cottage with a warehouse at the back; one room was fitted up with shelves and glass bottles, empty, and up<lb></lb>stairs there were full bottles, and some empty boxes; some bottles were labelled "Eau de Cologne, double distilled, manufactured by Dr. Mellinger, of Cologne, on the Rhine"—the little girls were labelling them, and stamping them with wax J.M.—he gave me a sample bottle, which was pretty fair—it smelt of Eau de Cologne—he said that Mr. Bush had sent him 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and showed me the invoices, some of which were for essential oils—he said that Mr. Bush would take a large quantity of the manufactured articles, he buying the raw material from Bush, and that Cannon and Brown, of Windmill Street, had given him orders which he was then executing, and he showed me more stuff which was being sent out—he then said "You see your first decision was an unwise one," and that he did not like to owe any one money, and wanted an advance of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for the goods from Bush, if I would agree to his terms, and as security he would make an assignment of the goods—he also said that he should want to have my name in conjunction with his, but did not want me to incur any responsibility, or advance any money whatever—he said "I have more money myself than I can use," and mentioned property in and near Berlin, in addition to the chemical works, and he said that the factory was at 22, Frederick Street, Berlin, as far as I remember the number—I did not advance him any money at this interview, but I saw him almost daily, and he took me and my wife from the factory to his house, and showed us the furniture, and said that it was his own—he subsequently offered me a bill of sale, and on the 4th of November I advanced him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two sums of 51. and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this promissory note for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable 31 days after date, as he said that I could not have the money till he got it from Berlin—when I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the factory he gave me a sort of assignment of the goods there—I drew it up and he signed it—I know that it was not a legal instrument because it was not stamped, and therefore I did not preserve it—he wanted me near him, and about that time I' removed to Homerton to be near the factory—I afterwards advanced him other sums—I went a good deal to the factory, but did not do anything, as he would not let me interfere—on the 26th of November I advanced him 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making the amount 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me the promissory note for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he showed me a letter stating that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been sent him from Germany to his bankers' agent in Thames Street, but said "I have hot the means even to go to the City for it"—I said "What have you done with the money you had from me?"—he said "I have not spent more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the business, but have had very heavy expenses, and it is all &amp;6ne," and he asked me to borrow 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my brother, who was there messing about, but not working, and then he would get the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and hand me over half of it, which would carry me over the week, and on Monday I should have all—I borrowed the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the evening, and in the morning, as soon</p>

               <p>as the house was open, and a poor German gentleman stepped in and had a short conversation with the prisoner in German—the prisoner said "Give me that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; this is my friend Dr. Saxe, of Norwood, and I am going with him to the City for the money"—I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they left together, and he told me to take charge of the factory till he came back—he was away four or five hours, and when he came back I asked him for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I was to receive—he said that awing to some irregularity he had not been able to get it, but was to have it to-morrow certain—I then complained bitterly about the way he was treating me and he pulled out a half-crown and a florin, and offered me the station with my brother, and saw him there, and said "What about my money? I think I am in a fair way of being swindled out of it"—he said "Oh, no, you shall be paid your money; you shall have your money"—I went to 25, Cadogan Terrace, and found that his wife and family had gone, and a constable was in possession of the house—a little time after that I obtained a warrant—I afterwards examined the Ean de Cologne at the factory, and found it to be methylated spirit in the bottles, and in some of them water—I have never been repaid a halfpenny—I lent him the money on the faith of his being a manufacturing chemist, and having sold this business in Berlin, for which he was to receive the money, and of his having machinery value 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was in transmission to England, to be put into the new factory, and because he said that he would guarantee that before a year was out I should receive good wages, not less than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to Mr. Ogle, my solicitor, on the 28th of November, the day after the prisoner was locked up on a charge of indecent assault—I went and swore an information the same day—I was first examined by word of mouth in the presence of the prisoner and his solicitor—I do not know how I got the warrant, I was so excited over the loss of my money that I did not know what I did—I knew what I was talking about to my solicitor—my age is 36—I was a goal warder at Huntingdon three years, but that is ten years ago—my wife was allowed to live there—we have no family—I had a salary—I have not been a policeman, I have been a marble mason—I was never warder of a lunatic asylum—I was a photographer, but only for my own amusement—I know nothing about business—I can manage to write a letter, and make what I have to say intelligible—I was born of poor parents in Suffolk, and had to go to work in the fields at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and had no education whatever, I could neither read or write—I have had no education but what I gave myself—these three letters are in my writing at the prisoner's dictation—he did not tell me how to spell "opodeldoc," I knew—when I made my complaint I said that partnership was to be a thing of the future—he was to repay me my money, and give me the option of a partnership, but I was never to invest any money in the business, because he said he had plenty of his own—my brother sued him for wages in the Shoreditch County Court—I went into the witness box and said that no partnership existed between us, not that there had been no idea of one—I did not advertise that I wanted a partnership, but I expressed a desire to meet with somebody who would take me into partnership if it was proved to be sound—I said at the police-court that</p>

               <p>a certificate of merit for manufacturing Eau de Cologne was shown me—I heard the Magistrate discuss with Mr. Ogle whether it was a false pretence or not—Mr. Ogle asked me if I had money to bring witnesses from Berlin; I said "No, I am swindled out of every penny;" he said "Then you can<lb></lb>not put written evidence before the Court"—I found out Dr. Saxe when Mr. Ogle told me to do so—I did not mention him at the police-court—I don't remember whether I mentioned 22, Frederick Street at the police-court, I did if I was asked—what I said was read over to me—I just went into the factory every day, but I did not go up each day into the chambers—I did not stay there daily from morning to evening—I wrote down this inventory of the property, at his dictation, and thought it much too high, it came to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw some of the articles (<hi rend="italic">This was a list of fixtures, chemicals, and other articles amounting to</hi> 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—this "idiotine" is Mellinger's name for iodine, you will see it so printed on the bottles—all the essences and essential oils were received afterwards—he asked me to draw the form of a bill of sale for him, but I never saw one in my life, and could not do such a thing—I drew an assignment of all this property to secure me the money, but as it was not stamped I thought it was no good, the promissory note covered it, and therefore I preserved the promissory note only, which I thought was as good as the assignment of the property—I also started on a draft deed of partner<lb></lb>ship, but it was never finished; I was going to submit it to him at the beginning of the new year, when he agreed that the partnership was to begin—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I swear, in the face of any number of witnesses, that this is the paper I produced at the police-court I got it from Mr. Ogle yesterday—it is my writing, but it is not all my composi<lb></lb>tion—he objected to it, as he said there were a lot of things which were quite unnecessary, and he would strike them out—I copied it from a form in "Beaton's Partnership," and altered it as I thought proper—I have got the original draft, but it is not here; the one I placed before him I took home and burnt—this is the one I produced at the police-court—my charge on the 5th of December was not obtaining 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed he would have both money and machinery—I told the Treasury that I had no funds—I did not know that Mr. Green had come from Berlin till I saw him at the police-court—I had seen Mr. Wontner and given him the general particulars—February 5 was not the first time I mentioned 22, Frederick Street and Lanberger Street, I mentioned them to Mr. Pollard at the Treasury—I do not remember being asked before the Magistrate whether he gave an address in Berlin, and saying that I could not remember—there may been an argument about it being of no use getting a witness from Berlin as I could not give the number of the house—I put the name of Hines and Mellinger on a piece of stone so that we should see the number—I do not know whether it is there now—I did not represent at the factory that I wanted, as partner, to buy a plot of land belonging to Mrs. Bates to erect a factory, but I heard Mellinger say so—I did not contradict it—I heard him tell two other gentlemen the same thing—I did not write a letter about it signed "Mellinger and Hines" to Mrs. Bates nor to her solicitors—the prisoner asked me to write some letters about it, one was to a gentleman named Swift, and I forget the named of the other—he told me to order labels to be</p>

I live at 40, Grosser Berliner Strasse, Berlin, and am an engineer—I know the prisoner—in September, 1877, he lived at a private house there, 156, Kurfurster Strasse—I obtained a mortgage for him on another house, and proceedings were taken in the Foreclosure Courts of Berlin—the house was sold by order of Court, and purchased it—in 1878 I knew him as living in Landsberger Strasse; he had a plate on his door with the equivalent of M.D. on it—he was a Doctor of Medicine at that time, but I did not know him as practising—never knew him living at 22 Friederich Strasse—I know the street well, there is no factory at No. 22, there are 300 houses it—the last time I at him in Berlin was at the end of June or the beginning of July, 1878—he did not leave Berlin till the end of November, 1878—I have no reason to believe he ever had a factory of any sort in Berlin, and never heard of it from him—I did not see him constantly—I did not know him as a manu<lb></lb>facturing chemist, or in connection with any manufactory at all.</p>

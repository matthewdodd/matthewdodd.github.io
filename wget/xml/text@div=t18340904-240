             (City police-constable No. 39). I was sent for, and took the prisoner with the crown piece - I took him to the compter, and found two half-crowns and one shilling and two pence halfpenny on him - here is the parcel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave the parcel and the crown to a young man behind the counter.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GILBERT. There was a lad in the office who took it, and gave it to me the same moment - I have the control of the office, and should have lost the five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into a public-house, and a well-dressed young man asked me to take the parcel to the King's Arms - I took it - he walked with me to the corner of Farringdon-street, and said he would wait till I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040124"></xptr>- I gave the crown piece which he gave me to a young man, who carried it to the book-keeper - he came, and took me by the collar - I asked him what for - he said, did I know what was in the parcel - I said I did not - the money found on me was what I worked for.</p>
               <p>(The crown piece being broken, was composed of Britannia metal.)</p>

On Monday night the 4th of March, about nine o'clock, I and my wife went out, leaving two lodgers in the house; I double locked the inside door, and the outside one was on the spring lock - we returned about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and found both the doors wide open; neither of them were injured. We missed these things - we found the lodgers at home, neither of them are here; they could not get through the inside door, for I had the key in my pocket. There is a passage between the two doors; nobody could get into the passage unless the lodgers let them in.</p>

            . On the 4th of March, about twelve o'clock, I was in Holywell-street, Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner with two others. I searched him and found a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170026"></xptr>pillow under his coat, and two pillow-cases in his hat, and in his right hand coat pocket a dark lantern - he said he had them from a friend, and at last he said from Mr. Abrahams, of Wheeler-street; I went there and enquired, they had not seen him for six months; they are Jews. On enquiry I took the things to Crafts.</p>

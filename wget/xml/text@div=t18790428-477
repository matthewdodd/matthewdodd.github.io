                  </hi>. I am a tailor of 2, Wills Place—on 8th April I was standing at my door and saw the prisoner and another woman, one on each side of Jones, who was drunk, about three yards from my door—they could not make him take his hands out of his pockets, and the other woman said, "Knock him down"—the prisoner knocked him down and punched him in the face three or four times, and then the other one saw that he had something in his clenched hand, and said to the prisoner, "Bite it"—she bit him on his knuckles, and he opened his hand, but I did not see what was taken—a constable caught the prisoner and the other one ran away.</p>

I am a son of the last witness—I saw a drunken man in the street accompanied by the prisoner and another woman, one holding him by each arm—the other one told the prisoner to knock him down—she did so, and was hitting him on his face while the other was trying to rob him, but she could not till he took his hands out of his pockets—the girl then said, "Bite him," and she bit him—he opened his hand, and there was a bit of paper in it and two sovereigns—the other girl took it and ran away, and a constable stopped the prisoner.</p>

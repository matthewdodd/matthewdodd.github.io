                  </hi> I am the wife of John Challenor, and live at No. 45, White-street, Borough. I have a daughter named Elizabeth Spriggs, by a former husband—she is thirteen years old—I know the prisoner—I had occasion to make a complaint of him some time ago, with reference to my daughter—he was imprisoned for a year—he came out of prison on the 26th of Feb., I think—I received the letter in question by post, on the 13th of Aug.—this now produced is it—I had received one previously, on the 20th of July, and one before that—I do not know whose writing they are, but I had many letters before which were proved to be in the prisoner's writing, and I took these to be the same writing—the letters that were the subject of the previous complaint were in the same handwriting.</p>

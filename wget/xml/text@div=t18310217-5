I went out on the morning of the 11th of February, at a quarter to ten o'clock - my husband had gone out before; I left nobody in the house - I secured the shutters, locked the door, and put the key into my pocket; I came home at ten minutes past twelve o'clock, and found the bed-room window, which is on the ground floor, broken - it is a sash window; I had left the lower sash down, and put a little brass knob to prevent its being raised up - there was a hole in the top of the lower sash, and the knob went into the side of the window; a pane of the lower sash was broken, a hand could then be introduced, and the knob taken out - I missed the gun off two nails over the mantel-piece, about three yards from the window - they must have got in to take it.</p>

             when the prisoner was apprehended - I should think it was between one and two o'clock; the gun had been brought to me by Kenny and Carter before, and was at my house - the prisoner saw the gun and handkerchief that afternoon, and said he had lent the handkerchief to the other two, and that was the only thing that would do him; in the evening, after we had locked the prisoner up, we went to Kenny's house and examined the instrument the window was opened with; it had been found round the prisoner's neck at the watch-house - I was present when it was found round his neck; I campared it with the window, and have not the least doubt of its being used at that window - it corresponded with the marks; here it is - it is a marline-spike, and was tied to a long bit of string, with a knife at the other end of the string - the spike had been used to the window; I did not see his shoes compared with the footmarks.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner in custody, about half-past three o'clock, and found the marline-spike on him - Ingram was there; I afterwards took and matched it with the putty on Kenny's window - it agreed exactly; I afterwards went to the watch-house, took his shoes off, and went next morning at day-break and compared them with the footsteps about three yards from the window which was broken into; I compared them with eight or nine footsteps going towards the field, in different places, leading towards where the gun was found - they exactly fitted them; I saw more footsteps nearer the window, but they had marks of nails in them, and his shoes had no nails; he said the sailors use the marline-spikes to splice their ropes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an appraiser and house-agent, and live in Mortimer-street Cavendish-square; the prisoner was my clerk for one year. On the 21st of May I sent him to pay some money, and I sent him specially that day about the taxes to Mr. Priest, the assessed tax gatherer, and to Mr. Payne for the empty rate—he did not pay me that day any money as received of Mr. Payne, nor has he ever paid me any money on account of the empty rate—the amount of it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are four entries of the prisoner's handwriting in this book, of that date, three for rates, and one on another business, but there is no entry of that rate—this is the receipt for it—it is in the handwriting of Mr. Payne—the signature is the handwriting of the prisoner—I have no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have had the misfortune to charge several persons with taking money and goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I once charged a man with taking silk from me—another man brought an action against me, and recovered about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages—I never charged a man named Spence with taking a watch from me—I directed the prisoner specifically to go to Mr. Payne for these taxes—I did not state so before the Magistrate—when I referred to the book, and charged my memory with a particular check, which the prisoner marked, it brought it to my mind—that was after the defence the prisoner made—about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. may have passed through his hands, during the twelve months he was with me—I had his two sons in my service—one named William, who was convicted last sessions, and one named Thomas—he has absconded—the signature to this receipt is in the name of Thomas—I had a settlement with the prisoner, in which I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a fraction—that was about the 10th of August—the money agreed upon was all inserted in that paper by the prisoner in August—there is an account of other monies, but not of this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were several monies which I had not received an account of at that time—this is the only charge of embezzlement which I make at present—I heard Mr. Payne examined before the Magistrate,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030072"></xptr>
               <p>and express a doubt about the prisoner being the person who received the money, and he explained the reasons of bis doubt—the prisoner was in a light coat when he came to him, and then he was in another coat, and he stood with his face from the light—Mr. Payne was very nervous—but he said, when he turned, his doubt was entirely removed—the prisoner's son William was charged with several offences—one charge was by the Union Bank—when I settled with the prisoner in Aug., he gave me a note, which has not been paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked whether you had said anything about having sent the prisoner that day for the empty rate, and you said something about a check? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I gave a check for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay money that day, which is dated on the 21st of May, in his own book, and after he had been before the Magistrate I found it—two or three years ago, certain men in my employ robbed me of some silk and horse-hair, and one man whom I had not charged, but who had sold or vended some of it, cut his throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am receiver of rents for the late Frederick Franks—I live in Harewood-street—I remember a person calling on me on the 21st of May last, for five quarters' empty rate, for a house in Queen Anne-street—the prisoner looks very much like the person—I cannot say that I have any doubt that he is the man who signed this receipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear positively to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is very much like him—I will swear more positively to the man by seeing him than I will to his signing the paper—I will pledge my oath he is the man—I am not so certain about his being the man who signed the receipt—I never said that, as I thought it could not be the prisoner's son, it must be him—I said I paid two sums, both of which were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the first was on the 21st of May, the other on the 4th of June, and I had some little doubt about which was which—if I am right, I saw the prisoner on the 21st of May; if not, I never saw him till he was before the Magistrate.</p>

Wick; are these the two receipts given on those two occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one of them is signed William Wick, the other Thomas Wick—I should say the prisoner's son signed the William Wick.</p>

               <p>Q. What quantity of callico was lost? - Twelve pieces; some run twenty-one and some twenty-four yards in a piece; they were lost from the lower part of the grounds, out of the copper house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the term boking? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this copper house join to the house you live in, or is it a part of it? - It adjoins to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How does this join to your house? - I come out of my own door to go into the copper house; there is no way communicates with it on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this copper house before the callico was missed from it? - I had seen it on Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the copper house connected to your house by boards or any thing? - It is all under one roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body sleep in the copper house? - No, nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any wall round the building that completely incloses them? - No, there is not; I saw the door of this boking house fast on Saturday night between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, at the time we left work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the workmen lodge in your house? - No, none at all</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next have occasion to see the copper house? - On Sunday between seven and eight in the morning I see it, it was fast then as I left it the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you perceive that any thing was missing from thence? - On Monday morning I went up to go to work about half past five and I saw a light in this house by the door being half way open; I went up stairs for a candle and lanthorn, and I went to look and I saw a bit of iron lay at the foot of the bridge; I looked at the door and the nail was wrenched out and the bit of the wood where the nail was wrenched out was cracked; the door was nailed up; the carpenter had been at work; I went into the copper house and I found the new wood, the boards was what gave the light; I went to look at the goods, and I found some were missing; it was the light of the morning that I saw in at the door; there was no light within the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the opening of the door let in that light you talk of? - Yes, I believe it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to find the door open when you got there? - No, I did not. When I got into the copper house I found a parcel of goods missing; I cannot rightly tell how many, in one parcel was fourteen pieces tied double, and seven were taken away; I cannot tell how many were taken away from the other parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the usual way in which they are left, to be tied double? - Yes, it is. There was a man came and took an account of them all, and there was twelve missing on the whole, seven pieces ash goods and five pieces of four; the four goods are goods finished for printing, but ash goods are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these called british white callico? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine any of the other buildings? - No, none but our own copper house; all the goods were lodged there of a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men at the bar? - Yes, I know Arnold very well, I lived with him over in Surry, and worked with him; I worked with him five weeks him, he had been over at our grounds this half year.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200026"></xptr>Q. How lately had he worked at Mr. Macmurdo's grounds? - It is a month ago last Tuesday since he was taken away, when he was taken away on this charge.</p>

               <p>Q Do you know Johnson? - I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q Do you recollect the Sunday night before this robbery? - On Sunday night we generally go out, I went out and I went into a house, I think it is the sign of the Blackmore's Head, the corner of Shorthouse-street, in Back-lane near Wellclose-square; this was the 20th of January.</p>

               <p>Bare. I saw the prisoner Arnold in company with Robert and William Marsh, they were drinking a pot of beer; I looked at the prisoner Arnold and asked him who he was; he told me he was a callico printer, and he worked at Mr. Macmurdo's, and he hoped there was no harm in coming down there to drink a pot of beer as he had no work to do at that time; I stood there a little time and I went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business in this house? - I went on business there; I knew it was an infamous house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Johnson? - I do not recollect seeing him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of the persons of the two Marshes? - I know them very well, I left them there. The next morning Mr. Lane came to the office and I went and apprehended

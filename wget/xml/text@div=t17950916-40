               <p>Q. At the back of Gamden Town, or some where thereabouts? - Yes. The prisoner came up to me and said, money.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the prisoner, are you certain to the person of the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said, your money, what did you do? - I put my hand into my pocket, and gave him some silver and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was it he addressed you with money? - He came up to me and said, money.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had given him this silver and halfpence, what past then? -He wanted some more, and I gave him some more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at this time collected or alarmed? - Very much alarmed indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing with him at that time? - I moved a little out of the road that I was in, and then I saw a stick in his hand and held over my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much money you gave him the first time? - I cannot say. He then laid his hand on my cloak and laid hold of it, and said he wanted it; I said I would take it off; I took it off and gave it him; I untied it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. He pulled it off, I think? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. After that had passed what became of him? - He went from me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of giving information of this? - I immediately as he left me turned round and see two gentlemen, and I screamed out to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of him before you screamed out? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. On your screaming, did they come up? - They did; they came up directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him taken? - No, I did not; he was not taken in my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the gentlemen what had happened to you? - I screamed out and said something, but they ran strait on after the man.</p>

I ran after him across the field, as fast as I could, into Chalk-lane, and there he was taken when I came up to him, when I came up a young woman had the cloak in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How she came by it you cannot tell? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the cloak now? - It is here.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you had it? - About two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. In justice to the prisoner, I would ask you, did he behave with any uncommon violence or severity to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did the thing as mildly as the thing could be done. I don't know whether you was ever robbed before? - No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Court. He did not use any particular violence, nor did not swear at you? - No, he did not</p>
               <p>Q. You see the prisoner run off, and you see the gentlemen run after him, but you did not see them lay hold of him? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell my lord and jury what you know of this business? - I was walking in company with Mr. Bufford, on the 20th of August, across the field leading to Chalk Farm; when I got about the middle of the field, I heard Mrs. Butler cry out stop thief! the men has robbed me; and I and Mr. Bufford immediately pursued the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the man? - He was at some short distance, within sight; we pursued the man as far as Chalk-lane, where he got over the stile, I suppose about a minute before me; when I got over the stile I found the prisoner at the bar in custody of Mr. Bufford.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the same man as you see in custody? - I cannot say that, because I am rather short sighted.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the cloak taken from the prisoner? - I did not. When I came up the prisoner had a stick in his hand, rather a large one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was in a trouble before, and I don't know how to proceed; I always worked very hard for my bread.</p>

               <p>I was walking across the field to Chalk Farm, and I observed the prosecutrix throw up her arms, and immediately I see the prisoner run off, and Mr. Colling-bridge and me ran, and at the end of the field he got over the stile, and I got over after him first, before Mr. Collingbridge, and I found him on the other side of the ditch, and I got up to him and took hold of his leg, and he slid down, and there was this stick and this cloak, which I took from him. Mr. Collingbridge then came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cloak when you came up? - He had it in his hand when I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the person that you see running from Mrs. Butler? - That I can fastely say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that cloak delivered to Mrs. Butler? - Yes, I did; I gave it to her myself.</p>

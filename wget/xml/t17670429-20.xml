My servant detected her in it, it was my property. I got a search-warrant, and searched her box at Mr. Showers's, a throwster in Leman-street, Goodman's-fields. There we found the things mentioned in the indictment, nineteen yards of black silk lace, three yards of white ditto, and twenty-two yards of silk ribbon; they were my mother's property, but she is since dead; she died the 2d of November. She was committed to the Poultry Compter.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Caley; I was by when these goods (produced in court) were found in the prisoner's box; the key was produced in the house, I think by her fellow-servant; these were Mrs. Caley's property.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hawkesworth. She came on the 18th of February, between seven and eight, to buy some blond lacc. I shewed her a box, and she bought about as much as came to 1 s. by noon, after she was gone, we missed a card of blond lace; I was very sure I had not shewed any lace to any body but her, and was resolved to lay wait for her the next time she came; and on the Monday morning, the 23d of February, she came again much about the same time. to buy some white ribbon; I shewed her some, and observed every parcel that lay in the drawer; the piece of white was in the corner next to her; it was missing. I charged her, and she was committed to the Poultry Compter; I went and confronted her with all these goods, after we had searched her box, and shewed her them; she confessed to all, and said she took them all in the shop; she did not say when, but we believe she took them from time to time; she has been an old customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether they were taken away before or after Mrs. Caley's death?</p>
               <p>Hawkesworth. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for any thing you know, these goods might have been in the shop after Mrs. Caley's death?</p>
               <p>Hawkesworth. They might for what I know.</p>

               <p>To her character.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Showers. The prisoner lived servant with us very near five years; I could never accuse her with wronging me. She went out as usual that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of her having any connexions with bad people?</p>
               <p>Showers. We do not know of her having any great connexions.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my master's on the 18th of February; I missed a card of blond lace after she was gone. She came again on the 23d for a little white ribbon; I saw her take a piece of white silk ribbon out of the box, and put it into her pocket. I let her go out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290012"></xptr> the shop; then I brought her back, and took it from her. Then I charged her with the card of lace; she owned she had it at home, and said if I would go along with her, she would give it to me again. I acquainted my master with it, and she was sent to the Compter. The lace was found in her box with the other things.</p>

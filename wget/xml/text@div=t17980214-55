               <p>(The case was opened by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>- BIGGIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am mate of the Commerce: I sent Lumsdale on shore, and Ritchie went with him, as he told me afterwards; I told him to take a boy with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not know any thing at all about Ritchie going but what Lumsdale told you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN LUMSDALE sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140064"></xptr>Knowlys. Q. I went on shore the 9th of January, the mate sent me on shore, and Ritchie went with me; we took some tallow on shore with us in a mat.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Biggin.) Q. When was it that Lumsdale told you that he and Ritchie had stole some tallow the night before? - A. He did not tell me any thing about stealing the tallow that night, only that he was in the boat with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did Lumsdale ever, at any time, tell you any thing about stealing any tallow, except that which you gave evidence of on the last trial? - A. No; except at his examination before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q.Lumsdale went on shore on Tuesday night by your orders? - A. Yes; and when he came back with the boat, he told me Ritchie had been with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Lumsdale.) Q. What was done the night before you were taken up? - A. I went on shore with Ritchie.</p>
               <p>Q. On that night did you take any thing with you? - A. Yes, I took a mat with some tallow in it; I got the lend of the Charlotte's boat, and me and Ritchie got along-side our own ship, and Penny handed over the tallow into the boat to me, and Ritchie rowed the boat to King James's stairs, and I went to Mr. Archer's house to see if there was anybody that I thought would stop me; I saw nobody, and I came back to the boat and took the tallow to Mr. Archer's; there was about the same quantity of it as there was the night I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever steal any tallow before this-this last voyage? - A. Yes, three times before; Mr. Archer gave me twelve shillings for it; there were two or three forty pounds, I think, of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you quite certain that the quantity was two or three forty pounds, and that you received twelve shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that before the Magistrate? - A. No; I said twenty-five pounds, and that I received five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. This examination of your's, at Shadwell-office, was upon oath? - A. Yes; and I did tell the truth; I did not say that I did not receive more.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were sworn to tell the whole truth? - A. I did not give all my evidence then, I told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn to tell the whole truth? - A. Yes; I told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. But not the whole truth? - A. No; I had been in prison with Penny, and he said, if I turned King's evidence, and confessed more then we agreed to confess, and he ever met me afterwards, he would be hung for me, meaning that he would kill me; and that was the reason why I did not tell the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tellkampff read the examination of the prisoner, Ritchie, taken by himself as follows;"Taken on the 11th of January, 1798.</p>
               <p>"On Thursday evening last, after we left work, Lumsdale asked leave of the mate to go on shore; that there was a quantity of tallow lying upon the beams in the said ship, that had fallen out of the casks, which the cooper could not get into the casks; Penny, Lumsdale, and myself, agreed to take it, and Lumsdale and myself brought it in the boat to King James's stairs; Lumsdale carried it to sell; he told me and Penny that he had sold the tallow, but did not say to whom, and that he had got two-pence halfpenny a pound. I had no part of the said money, only some bread and butter; I was never concerned in taking any out of the ship before, and neither mate not master knew of the tallow being taken out of the ship."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. The 11th of January was of a Thursday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Lumsdale was brought to your house the same night? - A. Yes; and Ritchie the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. The day he describes himself to have taken it, was on the Thursday before? - A. Yes.</p>

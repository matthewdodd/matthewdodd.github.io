                  </hi>, I am a shoemaker, and live at uxbridge—the prisoner worked for me. On the 10th of Oct. he brought some work home—I went to my till and paid him—I saw his hand come down very quickly by his side, and saw some shoes, which were suspended from the ceiling, moving backwards and forwards—I am convinced they were quiet before he came in—I gave him some more work, and he left the shop—I called him back, pointed to the shoes, and said, "What mean these; I will see what you have in your pocket"—I searched his pocket, which was a very large one, and found a pair of my shoes—a policeman was passing the door, and I gave them to him—the prisoner implored forgiveness, and asked me to consider his family—these shoes are mine, and were marked by me with the cost and selling price—they were among the shoes which hung up when be came in.</p>

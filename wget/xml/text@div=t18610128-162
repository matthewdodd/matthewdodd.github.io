                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 18, De Beauvoir<lb></lb>terrace, De Beauvoir-town, and am a telegraphic clerk—about 6 o'clock on the evening of the 12th January I was walking in Shoreditch—it was rather dark—I was attacked by three persons—the prisoner was among them—they caught hold of my bag, and pulled me a little way up a court, and when the prisoner found I did not leave hold of my bag he struck me on the cheek—I then let go of the bag and went into Mr. Woolf's, the linendrapere—Mr. Woolf sent for a constable, who went and found the prisoner in a cellar—he was brought back—in my bag that was taken there was a pocket-handker<lb></lb>chief, a comb, a pair of goloshes, and a box of powder, I think—I was hurt by the blow that I received—I felt it about two days—I am sure it was the prisoner that struck me—when he caught hold of the bag he said, "That is it," and he pulled it away—I heard him speak afterwards when he was brought back—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my bag.</p>

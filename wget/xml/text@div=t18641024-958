                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 300). On 19th September, I was in Elder-walk, Islington, and saw the prisoner and deceased—they had a few words, and the prisoner up with his fist and struck Dunn in the breast, and knocked him down, and he then up with his foot and kicked him in the bead as he lay on the ground—I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the deceased very violent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; very quiet—he did not make use of any bad language—I had been with another constable to the room where the prisoner lived to apprehend a young woman who lives with him for assaulting Dunn's sister; and while she was putting on her clothes, the prisoner made use of bad language, and said he would go out and give that big b-Dunn his b-oats—we told him he had better keep inside and keep quiet, but he insisted on coming out—Dunn came with his mother to stand up for his sister—it was as we were going to the station that the prisoner and Dunn met, and then this occurred—it was a little before in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Elder-street, Elder-walk—the deceased was my son—on the morning of 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> September the prisoner was going along Elder-walk, and he made use of two blackguard words to me—my son said to him, "Don't say those words to my mother, I will talk to you to-morrow"—the prisoner made no more to do but turned round and gave my son a blow in the chest which knocked him down, and then gave him three kicks as hard as he could lift his leg up—he was in a gore of blood—he came home with me that night, and next night we had to take him to the infirmary—he lived three weeks—he was in a dreadful state—he was covered all over with blood and blows.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had your son been fighting on the Sunday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he never fought till that night, when he came up and saw the prisoner's woman dragging my daughter by the hair of her head—he was indoors all the Sunday evening—he was indoors at 10 and 9—I have another son, named Frederick—he was not fighting that night—he has had a bad leg for six weeks—the deceased was very angry when he found his sister had been hurt—he did not vow vengeance for it—I was about two yards from him when the prisoner knocked him down—it was not dark—there was a lamp close to the corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Islington Workhouse—the deceased was brought there on 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> September—I examined him—there was a contused wound on his head extending down to the scalp—there had been very great baemorrhage from it—it had quite the appearance of a wound caused by a kick—he remained under treatment in the workhouse for about three weeks—he got gradually worse, and died on 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> October—I attribute</p>

               <p>the death to the diseased state of the man's lungs—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was disease of the lungs—the stomach was quite healthy; the heart was rather in a diseased state—there had evidently been long-standing disease of the chest—before his death, a low typhoid state of fever took place, which I attributed to his weak state from the profuse bleeding from the wound on the head—if it had not been for the hæmorrhage and fever, I think he would have recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You think that disease of the lungs was the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I think it was accelerated by the wound on the head—I am not quite sure of it—I don't speak with absolute certainty—his heart was very extensively diseased—I think probably he would not have lived very long; but I believe he would have been alive now, but for this—but for the wound, I should have attributed his death to natural canses—I was informed by the surgeon to the police that he had bled extensively—the skull was not broken—I think the hæmorrhage alone would have accelerated the death in a man of his state of disease—it would set up that sort of irritative fever of which he died—this happened on the 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—I did not see him till the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he was seen by a surgeon in the interval—I don't think the blow on the head would be caused by a fall—it was at the top of the head.</p>

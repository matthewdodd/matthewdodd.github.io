                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Glover, of Southwark-square, St. Saviour's. The prisoner Brown lodged in our house, and left on the 9th of May—on the 19th of May both the prisoners called at my door—Brown said she called to pay me some money and take her box away, which she had left—they followed me down stairs into my front kitchen—I had a watch on the mantle-shelf, which I saw five minutes before they came—I have a lodger in the house, but she never came down stairs—she is not here—I went from the front kitchen to the back, leaving Clayton behind in the front kitchen—she did not come into the back kitchen, but Mrs. Brown came after me into the back kitchen, and paid me the money—the prisoners went away, Clayton carrying the box, and on going into the kitchen three quarters of an hoar after I missed the watch—I went and found Brown in Covent-garden—I asked her where the young woman was who carried her box—she said she did not know—I said, "Where did she carry youi box to?"—she said she did not carry it further than the London-road—I said, "You could not carry the box with your child—where do you live?—she said, "I shall not tell you"—I told her I had lost a watch, and she must have take* it, or the young woman—she said she did not know where the other woman lodged.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I apprehended Clayton—she asked me what I took her for—I told her she was charged on suspicion of stealing a watch from Mrs. Glover's, in Southwark-sqnare—she said, "She must be mistaken, "I am not the person"—on the way to the station she said, "I certainly went to the house with a person named Brown, but know nothing about the watch."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and am living at 14, Welclose Square—on Saturday fortnight, between 10 and 11 p.m., I was standing outside the door, and saw the prisoner there by a cab—he came up and looked me in the face—I asked what he wanted, and he walked away and used some words, which I think were" son of a bitch," in his language—I saw a sheath—knife in his hand, and said "Oh, he has got a knife in his hand," and before I could turn round he stuck the knife in my shoulder and ran away—I followed him about four doors, and he hid himself under a seat—I had not touched him.</p>

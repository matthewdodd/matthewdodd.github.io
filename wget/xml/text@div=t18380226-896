                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier—my wife is a laundress, and works for Mr. Harding, of Anderton's hotel, Fleet-street. The prisoner has been in our employ twelve years as a washerwoman—in consequence of information which I received, I took the marks of some linen I brought to be washed, and delivered the linen to the prisoner—among other things was a cloth marked No. 4—I afterwards found the number of cloths I gave her correct, although the No. 4 was missing—on the 12th of February, before they left Mr. Anderton's, I had taken the initials and numbers of twenty-fire clothes, and drove home with them—I then delivered them to the prisoner, and told her to count them, and asked if she made twenty-five—she said she did—on the 14th, when No. 4 was missing, I put a mark on them—I had marked that with a bit of yellow worsted, and that particular cloth was missing when she returned me the cloths, but the quantity was right in number—I am responsible for what I do not return—it is worth about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed no other on that day—this could not be accidental.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 57.) I was called to the pro<lb></lb>secutor's laundry, on the 14th of February. My attention was called to a tub, and under that tub I found a table-cloth, wrapped up in an old cloth—I called to the prisoner afterwards, to point out which tub belonged to her—she pointed to it—I told her to put her hand on it, to be sure whether it was hers or not—she did so—and if it was hers that is the tub I found the table-cloth under—the cloth it is No. 4, and has a bit of yellow worsted in one corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, who keeps a chandler's shop in Grosvenor-place, Commercial-road. On the 27th of Au<lb></lb>gust the prisoner came, and bought half an ounce of tobacco, which came to 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I looked at it very much, expecting it was bad—it looked as if had been in the fire, from the colour—I suspected he had been in with bad money twice before, and I had turned him away—I was not quite certain of it—I gave him 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—he returned me a farthing for a pipe—I put the shilling in the corner of the till, and after he was gone I took it out—I was quit satisfied it was bad—I showed it to the person who came down stairs—I marked it, and wrapped it up in paper, and kept it in a box by itself till the 3rd of September, when the prisoner came again for a penny candle, and gave me a sixpence—my mother stood near the door, and when I went to the till, as if to get him change, I said to my mother, "Shut the door"—I then said to the prisoner, "You are the young man who gave me a bad shilling on Saturday night last"—he said he did not know he had given me a bad shilling—I said it was him, I was certain, and if he would give me good one for it I would let him go—he said he would go and get one, but he had not got one with him, and would leave his jacket—I went to get a policeman, and gave Brown the shilling and sixpence, and he returned them to me—I took them to the station-house, and afterwards saw the Inspector deliver them to Brown—I am sure they are the same.</p>

               <p>Q. After that, you heard whose cart it was? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went in to Mr. Taylor, and told Mr. Taylor; Mr. Taylor said, you must go after him and get it to be sure? - But he would not deliver it when I went and asked him for it, he said, it was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he and you had a very pleasant conversation, in which many oaths passed? - I made none on my part.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been used to look at this place the Magpie very often? - No, not very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't carts stop there frequently; have not you seen tarpaulins and mats about there? - I never saw any there in my life.</p>

               <p>Mr. Vaughan. Is it not customary for these people to have a great qaantity of mats and things in their carts, in order to cover the things that they put in their carts? - As the bundle appeared I should have thought it had been mats; he gave Mr. Harper nor me any trouble nor a miss word.</p>

            . Can you swear that to be the parcel you delivered to your porter? - This is the parcel I suppose by being a mat; I did not take particular notice; my carrier told me they were blankets, and there was a skewer undone, and I saw they were blankets.</p>
               <p>Varney. I can swear to the twine that is about them, one end is all pitched, and an eye at the other end of it.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Taylor, I have been his carrier about three quarters of a year; I carry goods from the Magpie, I ply there; in carrying goods my master finds the tarpaulins, but we very often bring mats back again when we have delivered the goods; in such cases we carry them home if it is late at night till we can deliver them to the owner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not left from time to time at this magpie? - They are. I have known the prisoner five years, he bears a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner also called his master and another witness who gave a good character.</p>

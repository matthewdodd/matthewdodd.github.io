                  </hi> I reside in Aldermanbury—I have one partner—we are importers of French clocks, and fancy articles, and cigar-cases—the pri<lb></lb>soner has been in our service about seven months—I received information from an officer, and examined my stock—I missed from it eight Masonic ornaments, a breast-pin, a cigar-case, a nail-brush, and a tooth-brush (<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles produced</hi>)—here is a breast-pin—I believe it is mine—it is one of the articles I missed—I think this cigar-case is mine—it might have been that another importer brought such, but I am morally sure it was taken out of our warehouse—I missed some Masonic ornaments, which are not here—these duplicates are of such articles as I have lost—these are the cards on which the Masonic ornaments were—this is the card which had the ornaments attached—the writing on this card is the handwriting of the manufacturer in Paris, and this is the writing of my partner—there is no mark on this nail-brush and tooth-brush—there has been one of our tickets on them, but it has been rubbed off—the prisoner had access to these articles.</p>

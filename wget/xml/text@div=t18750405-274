I am a cab-driver, and live at 43, Warden Street, Clerkenwell—I know Taylor—I was not present at the fight—some time before the fight I was at the York public-house—Taylor was there, a letter was read; Taylor read it out; it was an apology that the deceased could not come as he had promised, but he had sent 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to put down against Tubbs' 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it also said something about eight men on each side being enough to go—I did not see that the letter was addressed to Taylor—I heard that they were going to fight, I believe it was on Monday, 1st February, I was at the York in the early part of that afternoon, when the deceased and Tubbs came there together in a cab with a man they call "the coachman," and Floyd—Tubbs, and the deceased appeared to have been fighting—they were both very much injured; they were taken into the York; Taylor was with me when they came—I asked Tubbs who had won the fight, he said he had, but he had got punished for it—he asked Taylor for the money, I think it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, I did not hear any sum mentioned—Taylor asked <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>

I am a surgeon of 111, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury—on 1st February, about 6.15, I was sent for to see Dulgar, in Little Russell Street, his father's house—he was in bed on the first floor—he was insensible, his face was very much swollen, more espe<lb></lb>cially on the left side, blood was issuing from his nose and mouth, and his eyelids were both swollen up, his arms were bruised, and his neck scratched; he was suffering from injuries, and from concussion of the brain—he died the same night—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination two days afterwards—I found that his nose was broken, his teeth broken, his lips torn, and bruised all over the chest—the "cause of death was concussion produced by the general injuries he had received and the shaking—he had fought too long, that was what killed him—the concussion might have been caused by blows with the fist; the injuries were quite recent.</p>

The appointment was not made with me. I believe they had had a quarrel a week or two previous to the fight, but I was not there; I believe that was when the first arrangement was made to fight for money. I believe Dulgar gave Leonard 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit to bind the match, and the letter likewise. I received the money from Leonard, but not the letter; that was the night after it was sent. I heard there was a letter sent to me, and I went there to demand it, and I had the letter and the money given into my hands.

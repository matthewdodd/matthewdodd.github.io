On 3rd June, about twelveo'clock at night, I was endeavouring to clear the stalls in Whitechapel—theprisoner came up, and without saying anything, took me by the collar, turnedme round, and wanted me to take a woman in charge, who he was holding, and said she had robbed him of half-a-crown at a brothel—I would not takethe charge, he said, "I will be b----if you go till you do"—I would not—he put two fingers in my stock, kicked mo on the ankle, knocked me down, and nearly strangled me—I had two dreadful kicks in the side, and struckhim with my truncheon throe times—there were other people about, but Ibelieve it was the prisoner that kicked me—two constables and a civiliancame and rescued me—I have not been on duty since—he knocked me downthree times—with four or five other constables we got him to the station.</p>

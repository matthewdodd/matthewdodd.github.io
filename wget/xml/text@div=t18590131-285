                  </hi>. I am a corporal in the Royal Marines. On Tuesday evening, 18th January last, about 12 or a little after, I went to a coffee-shop kept by Mrs. Masters, in Church-street, Woolwich—the prisoner Moon was there—I had a tobacco-box in my pocket, containing an Arctic medal and two sovereigns—I fell asleep there for about an hour or an hour and a half—when I awoke my tobacco-box was gone—I gave information to the police—I saw a woman named Bowden in the room while I was there—when I woke up I told Masters that I had been robbed of a tobacco-box containing a medal and two sovereigns—she said, "I know nothing about it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 5, Martha's-passage, Woolwich—on Tuesday night, 18th January, about 12 o'clock, I was at Mrs. Masters' coffee-house—I saw the prosecutor there—he was there when I went in—I sat down by the side of Moon—the prosecutor was next to her—he was asleep with his head on the table—I saw Moon put her hand into his pocket and take out a brass box—she then got up to go, and Masters came out into the passage and asked her to give her the box to mind till the morning, and she had it—she took care of it—it was shut—I saw Moon leave the house, I went with her.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe you are what is called an unfortunate girl? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not see the medal—Moon did not open the box after she took it—she gave it to Masters—I was close to her—I saw her take it—the policeman afterwards came to the house where I live, and took me down to Mrs. Masters—I heard a girl there say that the medal had been taken by Moon, and Moon said that was true—I received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Moon, but I did not know where she got it from—I don't know what it was for: she gave it me, I thought perhaps it was to mind for her—I never told any one it was part of what she had stolen from the prosecutor—I did not mention this occurrence to any one until the policeman came to me next morning.</p>

From information I received on the evening of 19th January last, I went to Masters' coffee-shop about 5 o'clock—I saw Masters and Moon there—I told Masters that I had been given to understand that there had been two robberies committed in the house the night previous, and that I was a police-officer come to inquire about them—after some conversation, a girl in the house said it was not Mrs. Masters that took it, it was the girl Moon—I said to Moon "Is that true?"—she said "Yes, I took it and gave it to Mrs. Masters"—Masters said "Yes, I have got the medal, and here it is in the till"—and she immediately gave me up the medal, and I left the house—I said to Moon "What did you do with the box?"—she said "I gave it to Masters"—Masters stoutly denied ever seeing it; she said she had never seen anything of the kind—I told her I should call next morning, which I did, with the witness Bowden and Moon—I then asked them in Masters' presence whether the statement they had made was correct, that she (Moon) had taken the box and given it to Mrs. Masters—Moon said "Yes, it is true," and Bowden said "Yes, I saw her give it to her"—I then took Moon into custody, and told her she was charged with stealing a brass tobacco-box, two sovereigns, and a silver medal—I took her to the station—about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Masters' house and told her she would have to accompany me to the station, which she did—I told the inspector what had occurred, and he said he must charge her with receiving the property—she said she knew nothing about it, she had never seen it—I produce the medal.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated,</hi> "One of the girls in the house stated that the prisoner Moon had taken the medal") During the time I was asking Mrs. Masters some questions, the girl in the house stated that it was not Mrs. Masters that took the medal; it was the prisoner Moon—after I had received the medal, I asked Moon if she had given her the brass box, and she said she had—the other girl did not say at any time that she had seen her give Mrs. Masters the box; she said she had seen her give her the medal—in one respect I forgot that—I thought you were speaking about Moon—the box has not been found.</p>

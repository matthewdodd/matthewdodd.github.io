            . I had the care of Mr. Browell's house, while the family were out of town. On Thursday evening, the 1st of July, about half-past nine o'clock, I was going there to sleep, I met a man whom I suspected, when I got to the gate, I found the first floor-window open, I was alarmed, and stopped about seven or eight minutes. I saw a bundle thrown out of the window, I made an alarm when the patrol and several people came round. I do not know what became of the person. I did not see any body in the house.</p>
               <p>MATILDA PARKER. I am thirteen years old. I was going with my mother, and saw a man standing about, my mother said she did not like his looks. When we got to the gate, we found the window open, and the bundle thrown out.</p>
               <p>ELIAS TINKIN. I am a butcher. On the 1st of July, in the evening, I was walking along London-terrace, and saw the prisoner in company with two other men, standing opposite the garden-gate of No. 5, I looked very hard at the prisoner. I am certain that he is the man; I have known him these three years; I suspected him by his waiting about; I walked home, and had not been at home more than ten minutes, when I heard the cry of "Stop Thief!" I immediately ran out and pursued the prisoner, and overtook him at the corner of Coal Arbour-street, and with the assistance of Bailey, took him back to No. 3, London-terrace, and then to the watch-house. No. 3 had been robbed. The prisoner was running; it was a little after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I running when you took me. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BATEMAN. I am a patrol; my box is opposite the house. About half-past nine o'clock Bailey came to me, and said he was fearful some person was robbing No. 3, and that he saw a man get into the house, by getting on the balcony, and through the window; I took my bayonet to go over and watch, when the woman called out that there was a bundle thrown out of the window; she unlocked the door, and I went in. The man got away, and in a few minutes Bailey brought the prisoner to me.</p>

            . I am thirteen years of age. My father is a print-cutter. As I was coming down Hackney-road last Tuesday was a week, I saw the prisoner, and two other men, stand at the corner of Caroline-street. I went home, and in about half an hour I heard the cry of stop thief! I ran out, and saw the people running at the corner of the next street, which is Coal Arbour-street; presently after I saw Bailey go up and lay hold of the prisoner. and Mr. Tinkin went up to help him I knew the prisoner, was one of the men I had seen at the corner of Caroline-street; it was about nine o'clock when I saw him there.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BAILEY. I had been out to take a walk on that evening, and on my return at half-past nine o'clock, I saw three men lurking about the front of my house, which is No. 6, on London-terrace; I took no notice, went in, and went up stairs to watch them, suspecting they wanted to injure the railing; I had not been there more than three minutes before I saw one of them get over Mr. Browell's gate, and stand at the front door two or three minutes - He then got over the rails into the area; he remained there about two minutes, came up again, and got upon the wall which separates the front courts, and got into the balcony in front of the drawing-room windows, he pushed the window open and got in. I went down stairs to see after and inform the watchman of it, but instead of which I walked about two doors farther, and saw a woman waiting at the gate, with a lanthorn in her hand, I took no notice of her, but told the watchman what I had seen, and desired him not to leave the spot. I heard the woman call "watch!" and the watchman left me; I turned round and saw the prisoner get over the front rails. I pursued and took him.</p>

            . On the 30th of June, which was the night before the robbery, I slept in the house, in the same room where they got in; I left every thing safe-the drawers were all safe on the morning of the 1st of July. I went there a short time afterwards, and found them broken open.</p>

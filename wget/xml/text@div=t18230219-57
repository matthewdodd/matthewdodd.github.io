On the 30th of February, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner standing by the door, and go away in about a minute; I went out and missed nothing, but saw this waistcoat hanging in its place. He came to the door again in about half an hour, looked in, and went away - he came again in less than a minute; I was in the other shop; I saw his arms move, as if he was reaching in at the door, he then went away. I went to the door, and missed the waistcoat, which was about a quarter of a yard within the door; I followed and brought him back, felt in his breast, but could not find it. I sent for an officer, who searched him at the bottom of the shop - he asked for a light, and as I turned round to reach one, I saw the prisoner putting on his hat, and the waistcoat on the floor about a yard from him, and five yards from where it had hung - he denied throwing it down.</p>

I am a jeweller at 32, Davies Street—about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 10th February, the prisoner came into my shop and asked to look at some earrings—amongst the things that he looked at there was one set of locket and earrings—that was the only locket he looked at—it had five diamonds in the centre, and then it was alternately pearl and turquoise all round—I saw that locket in his fingers once—he left the shop after buying a pair of earrings—he had hardly gone off the door step when I missed the locket, and I called out to my sister—I gave information to the police, about half an hour afterwards—I went to the police-station on the 24th, and saw thirty or forty men together there and I picked the prisoner out—there were three ladies in the shop part of the time the prisoner was there, old customers.</p>

               <p>"Come sir, come sir!" I cannot swear to the man, but I observed the pistol; it was remarkable having a long screw barrel; I described it at Sir

While the highwayman was engaged with Mr. Bell, I endeavoured to conceal my watch, which he saw; he turned short round upon me, snatched the chain, and took my watch; then he turned round to Mr. Bell and finished his robbery; what he took from him I cannot say; he was near five minutes about it, and he thrust half his body into the coach. When he had done with Mr. Bell, he turned round to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now, sir, for you, now let me have your money;" he took from me two guineas and some silver; I cannot remember the exact sum; he appeared to have a great coat on; I was much alarmed; I kept my eye upon the pistol, which was brought pretty near my mouth at one time.</p>

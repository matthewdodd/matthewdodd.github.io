                  </hi>. I reside at 15, Marshfield-street, Millwall, and am a boiler-maker—on Saturday night, 3rd December, about 12 o'clock I had just turned into Marshfield-street, when I heard a voice call "Hoy," I looked round and saw the prisoners in company with two females, about 10 or 15 yards from me—not knowing them I passed on; the same voice again called out "Hoy," I looked round and the taller prisoner (John) was running towards me, he struck me a violent blow in the eye and rushed upon me, took hold of my coat, and got feeling about my dress—I took hold of him and the other prisoner (Alfred) ran up and clicked hold of my collar and took my cap off—John still kept feeling about my dress, and one of the females came up and clicked me by the hair and dragged me down amongst them, and Alfred gave me a severe kick with his foot in the back—I called "Murder!" and "Police!"—one of the females gave me a kick in the mouth with her foot—I lay there for some time till a mob gathered round—I put my hand into my pocket to get my handkerchief to wipe the blood from my face, and it was gone as well as my cap—I was sober—I had been making a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you are not sure they saw you receive the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am not sure, although I believe it; I have no recollect<lb></lb>tion of seeing them before they attacked me—I know one from the other by one being a little taller and having more hair on his face; it was not very light—there was a gas lamp from 20 to 30 yards from where I saw the pri<lb></lb>soners—I looked at John as he ran towards me to see if I knew him; that was the time I took particular notice of him—I don't know how many people there were about—I laid on my belly to keep my watch and property, and did not turn over any more till the mob came up to take them away—I am satisfied the kick I received from behind was from a man, the woman could not have done that, because she was in front of me, she kicked me in the mouth—I was within 60 yards of my own home—I am quite sure it was John Canham that gave me the blow in the eye; it was a violent blow—my eye is bloodshot at the present time from it—after I called "Murder!" and "Police!" a great many persons came up, and they did not abuse me any more after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 30, Davis-terrace, Isle of Dogs—on the night of 3rd December I was in Marshfield-street, going home—I saw the two prisoners, John Canham with his coat and cap off, standing over the prosecutor—there were several persons gathered round—I saw two women there—the prosecutor was lying on the ground, he had no cap on—there was blood on the side of his face—I am quite sure the two prisoners are the men I saw.</p>

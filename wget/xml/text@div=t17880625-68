               <p>On the 17th of June, I had my house broke open; about a quarter after 4 o'clock in the morning I heard a noise, I thought some of the servants were got up to washing, and I did not take my further notice of it; but when the servants got up about 6 o'clock, they informed me that the house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Who was last up the night before? - I believe the house-keeper was last up, but I was up till 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Were the doors and windows all fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know that yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was it in the morning? - The kitchen door was wrenched open, which opened into the yard; the adjoining house is an empty house, through which we suppose they came; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, the copper was taken out of the brick work; I heard that a person had been stopped at Clerkenwell with a large pot, I enquired and found the man that had stopped him.</p>
               <p>Who was he? - His name is Isaacs.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of this month, about a quarter past 5 in the morning, I was going out about some business, I saw the prisoner Lee, with a copper upon his head going down a court opposite to my house, where Hyser has an apartment; I immediately went up to him and took him into custody, I took the copper from him, and as I was taking the copper home to my own house, I saw the prisoner Hyser, about twenty yards from me with a large black pot upon his back, upon seeing me he ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250063"></xptr>back again with the pot; I took Lee to prison immediately.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Hyser that you saw? - I am very positive it was him, when I came back from taking Lee to prison, I saw Hyser coming out of the court towards Turnmill-street without any thing, I took him into custody immediately; there was the mark of the black pot upon his back, and I took him to prison; the prosecutor afterwards came to my house and claimed the copper, I went and tried it into the brick-work, and it fitted exactly.</p>

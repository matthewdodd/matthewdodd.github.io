            . I am a watchman of Old Haggerston. On the 22d of December, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I met the prosecutrix and the prisoner walking together, I bid them good night, turned into my box, and shortly I heard her screaming out, and calling Stop thief! I ran up, and met the prisoner running towards me. I caught at him, and he kicked my light out. I secured him; the girl said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me;" he denied it. I opened his coat, and found a bundle; he could not tell how he came by it, nor what it was; the girl came up, and said it was her gown; she fainted, and I took her home - they were both sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You are sure he was not intoxicated - A. He did not appear so at all.</p>

            . On Saturday night, the 22d of December, the prisoner came up to me in Finsbury-square; and walked with me to the door of my father's house in <placeName id="t18230115-122-crimeloc674">Kingsland-road</placeName>

I said, he should not, and told him to go about his business. When we got to the door, he snatched the parcel from me. I gave an alarm, and Jones took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me" - A. I do not recollect saying so. I walked arm in arm with him part of the way. He offered to take liberties with me. I think he was rather intoxicated. I do not think he intended to steal it, for he behaved very well. He ran twelve yards with it perhaps. He carried the bundle for me once, and I asked him for it, and he gave it me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out drinking all day. I wanted to go in doors with her; she said I could not - I thought I might. I deny having the bundle in my possession, it was picked up several yards from me; it was handed into her father's house, and given out again.</p>

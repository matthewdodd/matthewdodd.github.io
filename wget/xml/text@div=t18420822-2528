                  </hi>. I am in partnership with John Howell and others, lacemen, in Regent-street. On the 2nd of August, the prisoners came to the shop together—they asked to look at some Valenciennes lace for collars, which I showed them, and they bought some, which came to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they appeared to be both together—they did not pay the whole of the money—they left the lace, and went out of the shop—I had shown them a great many pieces that they did not buy, and I showed them a piece of the pattern that is here produced—it is a new pattern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's assistant—I remember the prisoners being there on the afternoon of the 2nd of August—Mr. Stroud was showing them lace—I watched them, and when they rose from their seats to leave the shop, the prisoner Howell dropped two pieces of lace about a yard from the counter—I followed them out of the shop, and con<lb></lb>tinued to keep them in sight till I was induced to give them in charge—I could not see what they were engaged in, but it appeared to me they were looking at some articles, or distributing something—they were talking—they did not see me till I put my hand on the shoulder of one of them—they were taken to Bow-street, and a piece of lace was there shown to me by Taylor—this is it—I know it to be the prosecutor's property from its general character, and from the pattern, which is peculiar—the lace that was dropped in the shop was taken up and put into the stock.</p>

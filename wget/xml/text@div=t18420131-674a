                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Butler, a linen<lb></lb>draper, Nos. 58 and 59, Shoreditch. On the 24th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop alone—she first pulled this holland, which hung over a rail, about half a yard within the door, and then walked away—she pulled it as if she was going to pull it off the rail—I saw her come in at the door—she did not ask for any thing—I was five or six yards within the shop—there were persons between me and her—she went out of the shop—she returned in about three minutes, pulled the holland right off the rail, and walked away about three yards from the door with it—I went after her, and stopped her as she was just</p>

I was fetched to Mr. Butler's shop, and saw the prisoner there—one of the young men desired me to take her into custody, and handed me this holland—he accused her of taking it—she said, "I was only looking at the quality, I intended to buy it"—he said, "You have come in at last, we will keep you now, and give you in charge"—she prayed to be excused for that time, and said she did not intend to steal it, that her husband was employed on the Eastern Counties Railway, and if this got to his employers' knowledge he would be discharged—she said she was innocent of taking it.</p>

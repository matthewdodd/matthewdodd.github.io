On the 16th of December, about three weeks before I applied for a search warrant, I missed a one pound note out of my pocket-book, in my trunks, a week after that I missed a clean shirt out of the same trunk, and a week after that I missed another shirt out of the same trunk, I did not miss the half handkerchief till I saw it in his box. The prisoner lodged in the same room with me, he is a <rs id="t18060115-9-deflabel52" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room? - A. No, he was out at work. I had two officers with me when I searched his chest; upon opening the first chest I saw two shirts, one of which I thought to be mine, and the other I knew to be mine from the mark that was on it, and this half handkerchief was in the box, and this one pound bank note was found laying at the bottom of the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you took the number of that bank note before you had lost it? - A. I had of that and two more about three weeks before I lost it. The officer took the things, one shirt I did not immediately know at the time, but afterwards, on close examination, I discovered it to be mine; he had almost taken the mark out of it. Two days afterwards I brought Stanton, the officer, to the house again, to take the last shirt with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you and the prisoner are both carpenters, did not you both work for Messrs. Wig and Mansfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are people of respectability. You have been discharged from their service since you made this accusation? - A. No, before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always mark your notes? - A. I do not. I was resolved if I had a spare note to lay by I would take the number of it, accordingly I took the number of these notes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you communicated your loss to your fellow lodger on the evening of the same day you lost it? - A. No, I only told the landlord privately, between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you never charged the prisoner with having taken the note before you got the warrant? - A. I never said a word to the prisoner till after I got the warrant; I could not accuse any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention the loss of your first shirt to the prisoner, which you say you lost a week after you lost the one pound note? - A. I believe every person in the house heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. A week after that you lost another; do you think that every body in the house heard of that too? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your loss must be well known to the prisoner? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you and the prisoner a quarrel before you made this accusation? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not remember bringing some window lead into the house, and putting it into the box which was common to you and him, for which he was angry with you? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not make a complaint to your master about it? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a chest in the room that was common to you and him? - A. Yes, there was a chest of the prisoner's in the room that had but little clothes of the prisoner's in it, and I put some of my clothes in it, such as a coat and waistcoat, but no shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. The key of that chest was always hanging up in that room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear that these shirts were not put in by yourself? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your washerwoman, by the desire of you, put the shirts in that box, when you was out of the way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was before the magistrate, did you give the magistrate the number of that note? - A. I did not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150011"></xptr>Court. You have been aked some questions about a chest, in which the prisoner said you might put some clothes in, was that the chest in which these shirts were found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in which there were some of your clothes? - A. Yes. But three weeks before I got the warrant I took them out, and was resolved to keep them out of it, as I suspected him taking the one pound note.</p>
               <p>A. Had you lost the shirts before you took the things out of the chest? - A. No, I had only lost the note before I took the things out of the chest.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On the 16th of December I went with Hancock to the prisoner's lodgings, and in his chest I found a shirt which the prosecutor claimed, a half white handkerchief, and a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the number of that note? - A. Yes, directly, before the note was opened. On the 19th he came to me and informed me, that one of the shirts I had left behind was his. I produce the shirts and the one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutor.) First look at the shirt Stanton took away on the 16th? - A. This is my shirt, it is marked D. K, No. 5, the half handkerchief is mine, it has my name, in red ink, in full length, and the other shirt belongs to me, the name may be dimly seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me the number of the note? - A. 4793.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Stanton.) Is that the number he told you? - A. It is.</p>

             sworn. Q. Do you wash the linen of the prosecutor Denny? - A. Yes, and I wash for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that shirt that the mark is almost rubbed out? - A. That shirt was in King's bundle the last time that I washed it, and I carried it home in King's bundle. Sometimes their linen was tied together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You know of course that red ink will wash out? - A. It will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge that is laid against me, I know not of one article being in the chest. On Sunday evening he was at the chest till near one o'clock, I thought he was putting in his clothes, as he was in the habit of putting them there, he always had the use of my chest to put in his linen and his clothes. When I came home at one o'clock, my landlady said that Kenny had lost a one pound note and two shirts. I made answer, that he had been out along with the girls of the town as usual; I did not suppose that he had lost any shirts; I offered two or three times to go and look in my chest, but he refused.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

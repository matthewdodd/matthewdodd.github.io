                  </hi>. I live in Jolly's-court, Match-walk, High-street, Shad<lb></lb>well. The prisoner lives in the Match-walk, one door from me—on Monday, the 20th of March, I was passing her door—she called out that I was a robber and a thief—I put up my left hand, and said, if she did not let me alone, I would make her prove her words—she took up a hearth-brush, and gave me two blows across my arm, just above the wrist—I rubbed my arm—it is not well now, being broken—I said, "I do think you have broken my arm"—she said, "I wish I had broken the other"—she caught up a broken dish, and threw it at me—I put up my hand to save my face, and it caught my other arm—I went to Mr. Croucher, a chemist, in the Highway—he strapped up the arm, and I was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the hospital—I could not walk, as I had lost so much blood—it was a very large cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mrs. Clements's house. I was with her and Mary Blythe on the 20th of March—as we were going past the prisoner's house into the Highway, the prisoner called Mrs. Clements a thief and a robber—she put up her left hand, and told her she would make her prove her words—the prisoner took up a hand-brush, struck her over the left arm, and broke it—Clements took up her right hand, rubbed it, went into her own house, and came out again to go down to the doctor's—in passing the pri<lb></lb>soner's door again, she went and took a broken dish off the table, and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it at Mrs. Clements—she put up her arm to prevent it cutting her face, and it cut her across the arm—the prisoner made use of very bad language when it first happened—she took up a fire-shovel, intending to strike Mrs. Clements the third time—she took up a chair, in her own defence, and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it across the room, but did not strike the prisoner with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am dresser at the London Hospital. Mrs. Clements came to the hospital on the 20th of March—the right arm had a lacerated wound, about an inch and a half in width, and an inch in depth—I think it likely to have been made by some sharp cutting instrument—I think a broken dish thrown would produce such a wound—the cut was obliquely across the arm—the contraction of the muscles caused it to be deeper—such a wound is sometimes dangerous, but I did not consider that so, on account of its not being jagged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a charwoman, and live at Croydon, in Surrey—on the night of 11th March, I was at Highgate, in a lodging house—my little girl was in the room, who has been in the Blind School—she knits a raw things—the prisoner was in the room—he was quarrelling with a woman—I had nothing to do with the quarrel—I do not know whether the prisoner was sober—I did not see much of him—I did not see him drinking—he said to would skin his mother for a shilling, and my little girl and two or three more laughed, and the prisoner came to my little girl, and said, why did she laugh at him—I did not see any knife then, but I saw him lay hold of the little girl—I got up to save her, and I pushed him off her, and he struck</p>

I am a servant at Mrs. Castle's lodging house—I recollect the night this occured, it was about 9 o'clock; the prisoner was there, and his wife, and I and my husband—I knew the prisoner, he and his wife had a few words, and I went between them—he was sitting at his supper—he said something I did not hear what, and the girl laughed—the prisoner ran from the place where he was, and said, "What, are you laughing at me?" he had the knife in his hand, cutting his bread and meat—I did not see him strike the child—I turned round, and when I turned again, Mrs. Gibbons lay bleeding at my feet—she was bleeding from the chin and the hand—the prisoner ran out of the door—he was not sober when he came in to supper, he was tipsy—I do not know whether be knew what he was about—he bad been drinking all day—he began drinking after breakfast, about 8 or 9 o'clock—I do not know that he was drinking all the time.</p>

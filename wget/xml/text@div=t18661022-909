                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at No. 48, Brunswick Street, Poplar—on Sunday evening, 9th September, the prisoner called on me, in the afternoon—I had known him about eight or nine months—he is a labourer—he is married—he followed me to church on the Sunday afternoon—he walked behind me, not by my side—he did not sit with me—he did not go with my consent—I wished to go by myself—when I came from church he overtook me, about twenty yards from the church—I went home, knocked at my door, and my little girl came from the kitchen with a light, and opened it—the prisoner went into the parlour with me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220021"></xptr>
               <p>and he said to my little girl, "Sarah, take the light away, as your mother can see to take her bonnet off by the light of the lamp"—he then said to me, "Will you be mine?"—I don't remember the answer I made, whether I said I would or would not—I might have said before the magistrate that I said yes, I don't remember now—he caught hold of me vehemently—no other conversation passed—he caught me around, and threw me on the floor, and I instantly felt a knife in my throat, and also one or two cuts across the chin—I felt blood—I rose with a hard struggle to my feet, and made to the street door, and gave an alarm—the prisoner remained in the room, as far as I know—I was taken to a doctor's—I did not see any weapon in the prisoner's hand.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman K 260). I took the prisoner into custody—he was all over blood, from a wound in his throat—I had not seen the prosecutrix at that time—when I went in the prisoner looked up at me and said, "Is that you?"—I had a slight knowledge of him—I think I had spoken to him some months, or it might be years, before—I got assistance, and took him to the hospital—he said, "eligion, and going to that church, is the cause of all this"—he was quite sober, but excited—he resisted me when I got him out into the street—I produce a knife, which was handed to me by a man named Boone, in the room—he is not here—the prisoner saw Boone hand it to me—it was open and bloody—he did not say anything upon it—he has been in prison since 19th September—he was in the hospital ten days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 213, East India Road—on Saturday, 9th September, about a quarter past eight, the prosecutrix was brought to my surgery—she was then bleeding profusely from two wounds, one of which, the slighter, was on the chin, the other, and much the larger, was on the left side of the neck, to the extent probably of four inches and a half—it penetrated through the integuments—some of the muscles were partially divided, and one or two small arteries were divided—such a knife as this would produce such a wound—it was a dangerous wound—I saw the prisoner, but only casually—I did not examine him.</p>

I am a ship's smith, of 42, Brunswick Street, Poplar—on Sunday evening, 9th September, between eight and nine, I saw the prosecutrix coming out of her house with her throat cut, and bleeding—I took her to a doctor's—I afterwards returned to the house, and saw the prisoner there—he was lying on his back in the passage with his throat cut—Dr. Baines looked at him and said he would be all right presently—the doctor went away—the prisoner got up, and went into the room—I followed him—he said, "Let me alone, let me die quiet"—he then asked me where the woman was—I said she was all right—I asked him why he did it—he said he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it through religion, love, and jealousy, and he</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 40, Norton-Folgate—I am a clockmaker—I deal with Mr. Scott. The prisoner came to me on 22nd Jan., about eight o'clock in the evening, and asked me if I wanted any frames—I bought two of him for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had another parcel with him—the frames were in some handkerchief or cloth, covered up—this is one of them—I saw Mrs. Scott two or three days afterwards—I had then sold one frame—she bought the other of me—I did not mark it—I am sure this is one I bought of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Scott. I went to Mr. Heitzman on 24th and got this frame from him—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—that was the price that he alleged he had given for it—it is my husband's—I made this mark "H" on it—I have had it in my custody since I had it from Mr. Heitzman—it is what is called a nine-inch frame—it is not finished—it is not in a state in which it would be ordinarily sold—it wants a piece of brass here, which we call a catch—here are three marks round this frame made by a chisel by the man who made the frame—if any other man made it, it would be marked by another chisel—this was made by the prisoner's father—I would not swear that I saw him make these marks on this, but I have seen him make marks on others—our men who make frames put particular marks on them—this is such a mark as the prisoner's father was in the habit of putting on the frames he made—the mark is three lines or rings, and this tool (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is a tool the prisoner used, to cut out these small pieces—I did not authorize the prisoner, on 22nd Jan., to sell this and another frame to Mr. Heitzman—he had no authority to take it to Mr. Heitzman either as a commission-agent, or in any other way—the prisoner was paid for piece-work, so much a dozen, and he had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for taking out and delivering goods—when he took goods he was to bring the basket back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mr. Heitzman is a customer of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner has brought me orders from him—I sent him to get orders, but he had no orders to take goods from my premises without my permission—he has taken goods from me to Mr. Heitzman frequently—Mr. Scott is in a state of imbecility—he goes and orders things in for me that he is capable of doing—he does a little writing in the books, but not at all times—if goods are sold to Mr. Heitzman, they are put in books first as sold, and afterwards as money received—my husband makes entries in the books when I wish him to do it—we have a book in which entry would be made of two frames sold to Mr. Heitzman, what we call the day-book—it is not kept in the work-shop,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185003040099"></xptr>
               <p>but in the office—if the prisoner takes an order from Mr. Heitzman, he is to bring me word what he wants—if he brought word to my husband, he would tell me of it—there was no one to whom he could bring word but me and my husband—I never go out till evening—I have never brought this chisel for<lb></lb>ward before to-day—I knew of this frame when the prisoner was before the Magistrate—the Magistrate examined this case, and dismissed it—the pri<lb></lb>soner's father was examined, and denied turning that frame—Brazier was asked a question, and this frame was put into his hand, and into the prisoner's father's hand—the prisoner's father turned these frames for me—I do not know that he now turns them for himself—the father and son were taken into custody—Popkins was taken away from me; I do not know for what pur<lb></lb>pose—I had no wish for him to go—I had an inclination for the boy, and proposed to his parents to have him—they told me I should have him, but they took him away—I have not asked the boy about this frame, only what he told me—he was the first person who told me about it—he told me pre<lb></lb>vious to his telling about the ring—I threatened him about the whip if he did not tell the truth—I had nothing in my hand—it is a whip which I believe is called a <hi rend="italic">cat-o'-nine-tails</hi>—I have flogged him with it by permission of his parents—I did not threaten to flog him again when he told me about this ring and the frames, unless he told me the truth—I guarded him against telling me an untruth—I said I would punish him if he told me an untruth, and the Magistrate would likewise—I did not at the same time tell him I would give him a suit of clothes if he told the truth—I did not promise him anything of the kind—I did say I would not swear to this frame at the police-court, but having compared this tool to it, I will swear to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARNOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it on the Thursday you said you would chastise him if he did not tell you the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and on the following Satur<lb></lb>day I told him about the clothes—I sent him to Mr. Heitzman to know if he wanted any frames, and it was in consequence of the message that he brought that I went to Mr. Heitzman—till then I had no knowledge whatever that these frames had been sold to Mr. Heitzman—I went to Mr. Heitzman on the Thursday, and found the frame there—the prisoner went sometimes and got orders, and it was his duty to bring word to me what my customers wanted—he had no right to take goods out of my shop without my permission—he had not my permission to take these two cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you allow him a commission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he got a cus<lb></lb>tomer that was not mine, and got an order, I allowed him a commission of a penny a frame; I could not afford to allow him more, but Mr. Heitzman was a customer of mine—the prisoner was not to take goods without my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 48, St. John-square; I am a brass turner. Some time ago I worked in the service of Mr. Scott—the prisoner's father worked there also—the men who turn the frames, make marks on them—they used a chisel for that purpose—I should say when I worked there, the pri<lb></lb>soner's father made this frame—this is the mark he used to mark them with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean that others might not make these marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should say that any tool run round here would make these marks—some mark inside, and some mark outside—the prisoner's father always made them in the middle, as this is—other shops have them made, but they have their private marks to them—some make no marks—it is nearly two years since I worked there.</p>

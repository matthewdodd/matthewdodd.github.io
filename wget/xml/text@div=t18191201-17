            . I am a carrier in the service of Mr. Chad. I go round Norwood and Southall to collect parcels. Last Tuesday week, at night, I received a box from the prisoner, he told me to tell my master to leave it as soon as he got into town - there was a direction on it - I cannot read; it was corded up. I took it home, and afterwards saw it in my master's possession, it was then open. It was about a foot and a half long, and one foot wide - it was heavy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect that you had orders from the prisoner to take it to Mr. Bevan's - A. No. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010014"></xptr>know Mr. Bevan, he is a relation of the prosecutor, and lives in Oxford-street. I delivered the box to my master; I did not see it opened, I saw it when it was open. I never carried a parcel for the prisoner to Mr. Bevan.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did the prisoner give it to you - A. At his master's, in the pantry.</p>

            . I am a carrier from Hanwell and Norwood. Butler delivered me a box, which I produce. I took it in doors and opened it, having some suspicion - it was nailed with three nails; it contained a marrow-spoon, twelve silver forks, and a variety of silver articles, also a shirt and four stockings. I took nothing out of it excepting some broken victuals - it contains every thing that was then in it but the victuals; it was directed to Mrs. Connor, No. 13, Gray-street, Manchester-square, London. I came to town immediately, and informed Mr. Bevan. The prisoner was apprehended. I am sure it is the same box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your curiosity induced you to open it - A. Yes. A shoemaker, and another person, who are my next-door neighbours, were present when I opened it. It was about eight o'clock in the evening. I live two miles and a half from Mr. Jones's. I left the box at my house. I went to town at four o'clock next morning, and informed Mr. Bevan; he came to my house and examined it - I did not think it proper to go to Mr. Jones. I had taken a box to Gray-street from the prisoner on the Tuesday before that, which was very heavy. I took two boxes before.</p>

            . I am brother-in-law to Mr. Jones. Chad fetched me; I went to his house and saw the box - I took an inventory of the articles; it is now in the same state, and contains the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you hired the prisoner - A. I did, and received a very good character with him. I hired him in the name of Condell - he now says his name is Connor. I received a verbal character from a person calling himself Captain Graham; I cannot find him now.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. The plate in the box is all my property, it contains the articles stated in the indictment - there are seventy-nine ounces altogether, and worth above 21 l. - one silver cup weighs one pound.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say. I sent the plate to my wife, to have it taken to Mr. Bevan to be taken care of.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES re-examined. I never authorized the prisoner to send my plate away, nor did I know of its being sent. He had made a false alarm that thieves had beset the house.</p>

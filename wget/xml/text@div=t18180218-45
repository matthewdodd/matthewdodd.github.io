On the 17th of January, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my master's shop - I did not know him before. He asked for some Irish linen, which I shewed him; he had seven yards cut off, which came to 17s. 6d.; he then bought two pocket handkerchiefs, which came to 2s. 4d. - in all 19s. 10d. He gave me a 5l. note, which I took to Mr. Francis, who was sitting in the counting-house - I said nothing to the prisoner. Mr. Francis came out with me into the shop, and said to him, "Will you have the goodness to favour me with your address?" the prisoner said, "Mr. Balduck, Lisson Grove, Paddington." As the prisoner delivered the address, I saw Mr. Francis write it on the back of the note, I also marked it myself (looking at one)-this is it. The constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The prisoner was taken into custody at the time-there were two customers in the shop. Mr. Francis was standing at the counting-house desk, he was not handling any money. He never put the note out of his hands until he returned to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ABRAHAM FRANCIS. I am a linen-draper, and live in High Holborn. On the 17th of January, Marchant brought me a 5l. note - I was in the counting-house. The moment I took hold of it I perceived it was forged - I had no other note in my hand. I immediately went towards the prisoner - I did not put it out of my hand. Marchant followed me; I had a pen in my hand. I asked the prisoner to favour me with his address; he said, "Balduck, Lisson-grove, Paddington." I immediately wrote it on the note, he saw me write it (looking at it)-this is the same note. I returned into the counting-house, Marchant followed me-the prisoner stood in the front shop, close by. I told Marchant to sent for a constable, who came in about a quarter of an hour after, and took the prisoner into cusa neighbour fetched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him respecting the note, after you had put his name on it - A. When my neighbour came in I said the note was forged, and I should sent for a constable-the prisoner heard it. I said he must give an account how he came possessed of it; he said he could very easily do that, if I would sent for Mr. Humphreys, of Staples Inn, who was his solicitor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he spoke of Mr. Humphreys as living in Staples Inn - A. Yes. I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180020"></xptr>send for him. When Marchant brought me the note I had no other bank notes upon the desk, or about me. I never parted with the note till I wrote his name on it. I was behind the counter in the shop, the prisoner was about eight yards from the door; I did not put him under confinement. I came round the counter, and stood with a friend, who came in with my neighbour, between the prisoner and the door. He made no attempt to get away.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you wrote on the note, what did you ask him - A. I asked him for his name and address. He did not say he took it of Balduck-it was on a Saturday night. I kept the note in my possession until Monday, in my pocket, separate from any others.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How many persons stood between him and the door - A. Two, and the inner door was shut; he could not escape.</p>
               <p>JOHN BALDUCK. I am a baker, and live at Lisson-grove, Paddington. I know the prisoner - I do not know whether he knew me. I once bought 12s. worth of biscuits of him. I never gave him a 5l. note, or gave him one to pay away for me. I never authorized him to use my name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does much money go through your hands in the course of a month - A. I pay for ten or twenty sacks of flour at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see the prisoner in December last - A. I believe I met him in Holborn. He never was at my house, except at the time I bought the biscuits of him, which is above a year ago; I then paid him in halfpence. I believe we always pay for biscuits in halfpence. I will swear that I did not pay him a bank note.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Look at the note-was it ever in your possession - A. Never. I always put my name on them when I take them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BALDUCK. I am the last witness's brother. I keep the Nightingale, public-house, at Lisson-grove, Paddington. I have known the prisoner six or seven years - He knew where I lived. I never gave him a 5l. note to my knowledge. I have dealt with him when I kept my brother's shop, which is above two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any dealings with him since the 4th of August, 1817 - A. Not any. No bank notes have passed from me to him since that period. I never authorized him to put off any notes in my name (looking at the note)-it has never been in my possession. I always indorse the notes as soon as I take them, just under the amount. I am well acquainted with the inhabitants of Lisson-grove, and am sure there is no other person of the name, except my brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are the streets about Lissongrove described as such a place, by Lisson-grove - A. Very likely; it is a large neighbourhood. I have lived there ten years, and am certain there are no other persons of that name there. I will not swear there is no such person in the neighbourhood. It may have happened that I have omitted to indorse a note - I am in the habit of indorsing them. I never knew any harm of the prisoner - He was once a respectable master baker.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Have you known him lately - A. I have not seen him since the 6th of April, 1816. I have taken no note of him since the 4th of August, 1817.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM EVERETT POOLE. I am a grocer, and live at No. 18, Golden-lane, Barbican. I know the prisoner. On the 5th or 6th of January he came to my shop, and bought two ounces of tea and a pound of sugar - I served him. He gave me a 1l. note (looking at one)-this is it. I gave him pen and ink, and asked him to write his address. I saw him write it on the back of the note (reads it)-"John North, Warwick-place, Whitecross-street." I put my initials under it, and can swear it is the note I received of him. I gave him 18s. 3d. in change. I have inquired at Warwick-place, and can find no such person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His being a stranger made me ask him to write his name and address himself. He was sometime in the shop - I noticed him particularly - I am positive he is the man.

I told him his name and address. I returned, and gave him the change (looks at one)-this is it-it has Mr. Smith's mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know that he slept at Leigh-street. He was porter to a person of the name of Good-luck, in Leigh-street - I believe he lived there.

            . My husband keeps the Elephant and Castle, in Great Peter-street, Westminster. I have known the prisoner eight years. On Sunday, the 28th of December, at half-past ten o'clock at night, he came to me with Mrs. Skelton. He asked for half a pint of brandy, which came to 2s. 6d.; he asked me to give him change for a 1l. note, which I did, knowing him. When he gave it me I told him it was broken; he said it was broken or torn, I do not know which, but it was all right enough, and that he had taken it at Clapham, in change for a 2l. note, at a public-house. I gave him 17s. 6d.; he drank the brandy, and went away. I observed the name of "Manning, Clif<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180021"></xptr>ford's or Clement's Inn," on it, I do not know which (looks at one)-this is it. Edwards was with me at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear that is the note - A. Yes; it is broken at the left-hand corner, "Manning, Clement's Inn," is on it. I swear to it from both these circumstances. I noticed it as I put it into the till. I cannot be mistaken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. I keep a chandler's shop. I was at Winter's, public-house, on the 28th of December, and saw the prisoner there that night.

            . I am an inspector of bank notes. I look at the 5l. note-it is forged in every respect, and so are the three 1l. notes; they are off the same plate. I should consider the signatures of them and the 5l. note to have been executed by the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The name are different.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM FRANCIS. I knew the note to be forged, and took it to Mr. Milton, at the Bank. I did not present it for payment.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read, No. 15,077, August 4th, 1817, 5l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not passed more than one note for these nine months, except what I received from my master, who is now under examination for the same offence. He told me to give that name and address.</p>
               <p>MARY WINTER re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you not said you took the note of Randall - A. I did not have it in my hand. When it was brought back to me I said I thought I took it of Randall. I took it out of a gentleman's hand, and said I took it of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you first said you took it of Randall - A. No; when I took it in my hand I knew it to be the note I received from the prisoner. I did not look at the indorsement till after I took it to Randall. I told Beech so.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BEECH. The account Mrs. Winter has given is not quite correct. She said positively she took it of Randall in change for a 10l. note, and that this note must be one of them. She had it in her hand more than a minute before she said so, and persisted in saying so all the time. I was with her about five minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Was any thing said about Manning, of Clifford's Inn, being on it - A. No.</p>

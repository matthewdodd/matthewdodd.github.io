I am a constable; I was charged with the prisoner the 14th of December; the prisoner said he was chopping wood in the cellar, and because he would not make a noise to disturb his master, he chopped it on the ham; that by accident he chopped off the knuckle, and put it in the box for fear his master should see it, till he could find an opportunity to tell his mistress, and get her to reconcile the matter.</p>

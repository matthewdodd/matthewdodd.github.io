                  </hi>. I am a Hoosier and hatter, and live in Grace-street, in the parish of All-allows, Lombard-street. On the 1st of October about eight o'clock at night, I had been out—there was no light except from the gas—It was night—my shop was open for business—It is generally shut up at nine—a friend was walking with me—I observed two lads at my window—I got to them as they made an effort to run away—I laid hold of them, but he way from me—he was bigger than the prisoner—I was behind them, and unable to see what they were in the act of doing—I found my window broken—the pane of glass bad been starred, and a piece taken out, and a pieve of back silk handkerchief taken out of the window—the rest of the window was entirely whole—the prisoner was one of the men, I saw him again within five or seven minutes—my friend Reynolds ran after him, and I ran after the other—when the prisoner was brought back he had nothing with him—I am confident he is one of the two I saw at the window—Mr. Reynolds is not here.</p>

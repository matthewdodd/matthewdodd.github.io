                  </hi>. I am check-taker in the service of Benjamin Conquest, of the Grecian Theatre—about 9 o'clock, on 10th August, the prisoners presented these forged cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for admission to the pit of the theatre—I told thorn the cheques were forged, and they could not go in;</p>

               <p>detained them, and sent for a constable—that is the ordinary entrance to the pit; there is another; but it opens at 5.30, and closet at 6.30—I was on duty from 6.30 till 12 o'clock, and was never absent—I am certain the prisoners bad not gone in that night; I know them well—these are two genuine tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I issued no others that night—the genuine pass tickets were printed on cards which had been used for Mr. Gillett's benefit, in August, and they were all marked "A 9 F"—we change the letters every evening—the "A 9" on these tickets is not genuine, and the "F" is in pencil—the admission to the pit is 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—no one is let in free.</p>

You will find Mr. Gillett's name on the forged tickets—the back is forged, and likewise the printing in front—it is 1869, instead of 1871—I understand that they were sold in front of the door—that was not by my permission, or the manager's.</p>

These are out up tickets for Mr. Gillett's benefit—what I call the forgery is on a card with Mr. Gillett's name—I do not allege that all this printing on the back is a forgery; the tickets, at some time or other, have been used at the theatre—there is a private entrance to the pit; they pay extra there—I was not there—the prisoners made no reply when I charged them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When I give pass tickets to persons they can give them away outside, but they ought not; they are not transferable, and no person bad passed out that night at that time—I was there all the time—the whole of the letters on this ticket are forged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Conquest's employ—I prepared the genuine tickets for 19th August—these others are not genuine—I delivered the tickets to Mr. Cooley about 6 o'clock; but on that night no one passed through the private entrance, and no pass tickets are issued at that entrance—I do not know whether the prisoners had been in the theatre, and were attempting to pass in again—the place is well lighted.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLEY</hi>. There is an entrance at which access could he had by tickets purchased at the bar—the barmaid has charge of them on great occasions, but no tickets were given to the barmaid on this occasion—many check-takers have been charged with allowing persons who came out to give their checks to others who came in, and Mr. Conquest estimates his loss from that at 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Half Moon, Holloway. On the 10th of May the prisoner brought this calf to me, and said it was for Wicks, the cow-dealer, who would be there in the morning; the prisoner came again next day, and told me to turn the calf loose, and let it go where it liked; Wicks called next morning, and the prisoner with him - Wicks said he should come for the calf in the afternoon; they both left together - two men came and looked at it about half-past two o'clock, and about half-past four, Pack came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050035"></xptr>Wicks? A. Yes, I have known him four or five years; he deals in calves - he had called on Thursday evening, about half-past seven o'clock, and said he expected two calves would be left - after the two men had been to look at it, the prisoner called; he beckoned me round the corner, and said, "John, has any body been about that calf?" I said, "Yes, two men, and it is a stolen one;" he said, "I believe it is, but you are to turn it into the layers, and let it go where it likes" - I said I should keep it till I saw Wicks, or the owner; Pack took it away about half-past four o'clock.</p>

            . I live at Plumstead, in Herefordshire, and am a calf-dealer. On Thursday afternoon, the 10th of May, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the top of the Archway-hill; I was coming to Smithfield, to buy a lot of calves - I knew him; he asked if I was coming for a lot of calves - I said Yes; he said he was going across to Highgate to buy one, and asked if I would like to buy it - I said Yes, if he brought it to the Coach and Horses that night, or to market next morning, I would look at it; he said he did not know that he could get it as far as the Coach and Horses, and would bring it to the Half Moon, Holloway - I left word with the ostler, that I would come there at six or seven o'clock, and look at it if he brought it; he told me he was going to buy it - I went the next morning, between six and seven; the ostler showed it to me - Hughes came in about half an hour; I agreed to give him 25s. for it -I had a sovereign in my pocket, which I gave him, and said if he would come to market, I would give him the 5s., or I would give it him next week; I saw the calf at Hatton-garden afterwards - I saw Pack at Smithfield, about four o'clock on Friday morning, and said something to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time heard the calf was supposed to be stolen? A. Yes; I have dealt in calves about a year and a half before that - I was servant to Mr. Welch, of Hockley, and bought a lot of calves at Smithfield, after I saw the prisoner; I do not always pay ready money - I had nine sovereigns, but no silver - I told the ostler I expected the prisoner was going to bring me a calf or two to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the prisoner to Meredith afterwards, to tell him to turn the calf into the field? A. No; I sent a man to tell him to lock it up, and let nobody have it till I came; I saw Dixon in Smithfield, but I never told him the prisoner was not the man who sold me the calf; I have bought calves of the prisoner's father and brother before, but never of him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 19th of May I apprehended the prisoner at Holloway-gate, at the Coach and Horses. He said "Don't take me to-night, you can take me in the morning;" I asked if he knew what he was taken for - he said Yes, he knew I was on the look out for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was known in the neighbourhood that the calf was stolen? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that Wicks had employed him to take the calf to the Half Moon, saying that the ostler expected two were coming - that he saw Wicks next morning at Smithfield, when he desired him to go and put the calf into Dixon's field.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Lord's-court, Crown-street, Soho. The deceased, Julia Foley, was my sister—she was thirteen years old. On Satur<lb></lb>day night, 5th April, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was standing in New<lb></lb>port-market selling things—my sister was on the other side of the way standing outside the basket, minding it—the basket was off the kerb—she was serving a lady with onions—I saw a Tan coming along very fast—I could not see who the driver was—I saw the horse knock my sister down, and the wheels went over her—the street was lighted with gas—it was a clear night—there were persons standing in the street selling things on both sides of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, in Newport-market. I saw the van coming along at about ten miles an hour—the prisoner was driving it—I saw the deceased standing or sitting behind her basket just off the kerb in the road—the horse in the shaft knocked her down, and the van went over her, about the chest—I think there was some one in the van flogging the horse, but I could not say who it was—I picked the child up, and took her into a doctor's—she was the last person on that side of the road—the van had passed all the other stalls, and had turned over two or three baskets, and ran up against an old woman before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the horse galloping? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was some<lb></lb>thing of a canter—there was a good deal of hallooing—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther the horse was frightened—they began to halloo and scream when it ran</p>

I am a boot-closer, of 53, Carnaby-street I was in the van sitting on the near side, behind the prisoner who drove it—I saw the girl that was run over sitting in the road with her face towards the horse, which struck her, knocked her backwards, and the wheels passed over her body—we were going about four and a half miles an hour—we had only come from Compton-street.</p>

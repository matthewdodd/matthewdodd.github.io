I am a hosier—I was staying at 32, Aldgate High-street—I was in Fenchurch on a Sunday evening, about half-past 9, and met the prisoner—she said, "Good night"—I said, "Good night," and passed on—she followed me, and asked me to treat her to a glass of ale, and took hold of my arm—I said that I would, and we crossed into Billiter-street, where I stood talking to her, and noticed that she was messing about with my watch-chain—I said, "Do not do that"—I pot my hand to my side, and my watch was there—she said, "All right"—I stood talking to her a couple of minutes, and was going to say, "Good night"—I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my watch—I said, "You hare got my watch"—she said, "I have not"—I seized her, and called "Police"—she said, "Do not make such a noise and I will give it to you"—at that moment a man ran round Billiter-street, rushed right behind her close to her, but did not seem to stop a moment—when he was out of sight, by the market, she said, "Now, you may take me to the station and search me"—my chain was broken off at the bow—my watch was worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

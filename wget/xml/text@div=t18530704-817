                  </hi>. I live in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. On 26th June, about a quarter past 4 o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by the barking of a dog in my house—I got out of bed, looked out at the window, and saw two men getting over the yard into the road—I sprang a rattle—they had a bundle with them, which they threw into the garden adjoining, and ran away—I could not see their faces—the police came, and shortly afterwards the prisoners were brought back by two policemen—I sent Charles James, my servant, into the next garden for the bundle—he is not here, but I saw him find it; I never lost sight of it—I examined the house, found the parlour window open, and the whole of the drawers ransacked—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185307040081"></xptr>
               <p>that room is on the ground floor, but there is a flight of steps up to it—persons could get to that window with the help of the water-closet roof and the dust bin—I had gone to bed about half-past 9 o'clock—the window was then shut close, but not fastened—there was not the least aperture left—I cannot swear to the prisoners, but I observed that one man was taller than the other.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On this morning I heard the springing of rattle, and saw two men jump over the prosecutor's gate—the tall one had a bundle, which he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> into the garden of the next house—they ran—I ran after them, and, with the assistance of another constable, took them—I told them they were charged with breaking into the house—they denied it—the other constable, who had Glover in custody, called out to me, and showed me a pair of sugar tongs, which he said he had picked up—the men had run by that spot—I am able to say that the prisoners are the persons who got over the gate—I only lost sight of them in turning a corner—I overtook them between 200 and 300 yards from the house—they said they had been bathing in the Surrey Canal, which is at the back of Mr. Godfrey's house—their hair was wet—I took them to the station, took off their boots, and compared them with some marks in Mr. Godfrey's garden, and they corresponded—I made impressions by the side of the marks—Glover's boots were very heavily nailed, and corresponded exactly—on Kingsley's boots there was a plate, which exactly agreed with the marks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>) I was on duty in the Clapham-road, about half-past 4 o'clock, and saw the prisoners coming towards town, in a direction from the prosecutor's house—in consequence of what Lewis said to me, I stopped them—they said they had been bathing in the canal—as we got near Mr. Godfrey's house, Kingsley said, "Here is something," and pointed to the ground—I looked down, and saw this pair of sugar tongs—I compared Kingsley's boots with the marks in the garden, and they corresponded.</p>

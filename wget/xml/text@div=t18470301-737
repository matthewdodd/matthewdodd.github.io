I am a surveyor—I live in Albion-terrace, Canon-bury-square, lslington—I have a yard at the back of my premises, where I keep building materials—I know this kitchen range, it is mine—I lost it from my yard three or four days before I was before the magistrate, which was on the 19th of Feb.—my yard is enclosed by a wall—the gates are kept locked—they were not found open on any occasion, so as to account for the range being taken out.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 16th of Feb., between five and six o'clock, I saw the prisoners in the New North-road—that were in conversation together, and were about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—Moon had this range on his shoulder—they walked fifty or sixty yards in my presence—I then stopped Moon, and asked him where he got the range—he said his brother had bought it of some per<lb></lb>son he did not Know, and he sent him after it to the Myddelton Arms—Sutton stepped off directly down Queen-street—my brother officer took him in a beer-shop.</p>

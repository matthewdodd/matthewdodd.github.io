                  </hi>. I live in Chancery-lane. On the 18th of May I was walking along the Strand, by Pickett-street, near Boswell-court, and felt a twitch at my pocket—I turned round, received information from a young man, and took hold of the prisoner, who was standing still, as I missed my handkerchief—he said, "What?" and directly ran up the court—he had heard the young man said that he had got my handkerchief—he broke from me, and ran up Boswell-court—he was pursued by Caley, and I followed, but he ran faster than I could—Caley caught him, without my losing sight of him—I have not found my handkerchief since.</p>

I must have seen it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was going along the Strand, from Fleet-street, and opposite the church, by Boswell-court, I saw the prisoner coming along behind the prosecutor; and when he came past me I saw him take the handkerchief out—he turned round and put it behind him—there was a lad standing close behind him, and a man behind him—I never saw the hand<lb></lb>kerchief again—I did not notice what became of the lad—I told the pro<lb></lb>secutor, and ran after the prisoner and caught him.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman at Clerkenwell-green. At half after four in the morning of the 12th of December, I saw the prisoner and another person with a sow and three pigs; the pigs were about three quarters old; I asked where he was going with them? he said to Smithfield. I told him it was too early, therefore I would stop him; upon which his partner ran one way, and the prisoner the other. My brother watchman went after the prisoner, and I pursued the other, and secured the pigs. Ruddle came up on the 12th and claimed them.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I asked the prisoner how he came by the pigs? he said he met a man who gave him a shilling to drive them to Smithfield. The next morning when he was before the Justice, he said he found them at Clerkenwell-green.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the pigs at Justice Blackborough's. They were shown me by Jefferson; they were mine; the pigs were black pigs; the sow had only one ear, Mr. Carter's dog having torn off the other.</p>

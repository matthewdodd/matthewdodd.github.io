            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 18th of March, I took the prisoner about one hundred yards from a stable at Hoxton, and asked if he had not got a cart to sell, he said, No, he did not deal in carts; I took him to the stable and broke the door open - I found the chaise-cart all taken to pieces - Mr. Williams saw it and owned it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did the prisoner tell you to whom it belonged? A. I heard him say he was employed to break it up, and I think he said, he did not know the man.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and have a stable at Hoxton. Two young men came to look at it about the 12th or 13th; the prisoner afterwards came with the person who took it; they called me up at one o'clock in the morning of the 15th; the other said his man could not get in, and the horse was getting cold; I got up, went down, and found the prisoner and the other man; the horse was out of the chaise. I went to take the irons off the gate, but the irons were gone; I forget the name of the man who took the stable - he appeared respectable, and referred me to a person at Shoreditch, but I did not inquire; I did not take notice of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not a superior looking man to the prisoner? A. Yes, very much so; his name was Brown, now I recollect.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Old-street. Brown applied to me. I think on Monday, the 18th of March, about selling a chaise cart - the prisoner came with him. I went to the stable in Huntingdon-street, Hoxton, to look at the cart, but did not like the appearance of it, and did not buy it - it was all to pieces - every bolt was taken out; he asked 5l. for it; I left the prisoner in the stable when I went away, and next evening he came to me with a message from Brown, saying he wished I would go and buy the cart, as they were very much in want of money - I cannot swear whether he said I or he.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He delivered Brown's message? A. I considered so. Brown was the only active man on the first occasion; I have known Brown for years, and all his family - he is very respectable, and highly connected.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed by this man to break the cart up; he came to me on the 14th, I think, and asked me to go with him to put up the horse and chaise; I said I would, as I was up, and went; he called in the morning, and asked me to break it up - when I asked for my money he said he had none, but would pay me in a day or two.</p>

            . I live at No. 40, Bath-street, City-road. I have known the prisoner two years; he lived in Baldwin-street. About one o'clock on the night of the 14th(I think) I was helping his wife to make a dress; I heard a horse and chaise stop, and some person called George - he went out, and returned in about half an hour.</p>

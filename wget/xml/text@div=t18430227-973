                  </hi>. I live on Ludgate-hill. About one o'clock on the 2nd of Feb., the prisoner came to my shop and tendered me a good half-crown—I gave him a pencil he had asked for, and two shillings in change—without looking at the pencil, he said that was not the sort he wanted, and described one that I never saw—I said I had not one, and he returned me the pencil, and two shillings—I saw that one of them was a bad one—he ran out but the pavement being slippery he fell down—I overtook and brought him back—he struggled violently to get away—I had one shilling in each hand—he strained both the backs of my hands, and I saw he swallowed something—my wife came to assist me, and he bit the back of her hand—I gave the bad shilling which the prisoner returned to me to the officer—I swear it was not one of those I gave him, as I had my money spread out on a green cloth under the sky-light, as I was going to send for the beer for dinner, and I can swear in the most positive manner that all the silver I had was good—I had four shillings, and one half-crown.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you inspect them at the time you gave them to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I called after you as you were going out—my shop is long—you might be six yards from the door when I served you—I called instantly after you—I think you heard me, and the attempt you made to go out proved it—you endeavoured to snatch the two shillings from my hands—I returned you the half-crown.</p>

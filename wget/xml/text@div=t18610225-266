I am the master of the <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi>, now lying at Grimsby—I live at the Bull's Head, Lower East Smithfield, when in London—on 31st January, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking down Upper East Smithfield—I noticed two or three different people, and the first two that I walked betwixt, they closed on me—the prisoner was on my right side—he pulled my watch out of my pocket—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Halloo</hi>, what are you up to?—he gave it a jerk, and broke the chain—he was buttoned up and I could not seize him by the collar—I seized him by the side and the other one gave me a rap on the head—I then fell on the edge of the kerb-stone—I jumped up and ran after the prisoner as well as I could—the farther I ran the farther I was behind—I could not catch the prisoner—the other men dispersed—I think the rap was done with his fist—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I was not with him two minutes when I got hold of him—I could see his face—I spoke to him—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father—I was coming down Smithfield on 31st January, and saw the prisoner taking last witness's watch—I went to his assistance—the prisoner ran away—I went to the station-house with the captain—the prisoner told me not to tell any one where he went—I am quite sure he is the man—I went afterwards, saw him with others, and picked him out.</p>

From information I received, I took the prisoner on this charge at a lodging-house in Keap-street, Spital<lb></lb>fields—I said, "I charge you for rescuing a prisoner, and assaulting me" I took him for being concerned in stealing the watch—I did not tell him, so at that time—when I went to the station, I told him that he was also charged on suspicion of stealing a watch—he said, "I know nothing about it"—about half-an-hour or so after that, I placed three or four others with him, something similar to him, and the little boy was then shown into the room—when he came in he said, "Yes, that's him," pointing towards the prisoner—the prisoner made use of a foul expression, and said, "It is, not toe, you have made a mistake"—on the Sunday night previous I went to a</p>

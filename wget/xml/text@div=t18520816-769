                  </hi>. I live at 36, Crown-street, Finsbury, and am a dentist On 17th June, I was in the King's Arms, in Bishopsgate-street, between 12 and 1 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—I had seen him before, at the Exhibition time, fifteen months ago—I had perhaps seen him once or twice since, in the same house—when I saw him on 17th Jane, he asked me to play at bagatelle—I said, "I can't play bagatelle"—I said I had got only 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—I lost 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said I bad got no more money—the prisoner came to me, felt my pocket, and said I had got more money—he took my watch—I was afraid he would break my guard—he took my watch and guard—I know no more—he went away—I never saw him any more—this is my watch, it cost 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it was a watch from my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Attenborough, a pawnbroker, in Crown-street.

            . I am junior house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. The deceased was brought there on Wednesday, the 30th of November, about an hour after the injury; I found a bruise in the lower part of the back of her neck - it appeared to have been struck by somethink very hard, just over the spine; the skin was slightly grazed - it was such a bruise as was likely to be produced by a blow from a small hammer; she said she had a bruise on her arm, but I did not observe that - I desired her to remain in the hospital, but she would not; I saw her next day, and she complained of a numbness on the right arm, and great pain in the right leg, which I thought depended on the injury, and next day it was rather increased; she complained both days of great pain across the breast, and great difficulty in breathing - the pain in the neck where the blow was was very severe; she complaned of great palpitation at the heart - these symptoms will arise from a concussion of the spine, which a blow with a hammer would cause: on the third day she could not come to the hospital - I attended her at home, and found the symptoms aggravated: on the 12th of December she came to the hospital, and was transferred to the care of Mr. Sabine- I attribute all the symptoms to the injury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she not appear in delicate health? A. She did not appear a good constitution - she would have had a better chance of recovery if she had come into the hospital; she lived two or three hundred yards off, and was able to walk, by leaning on another person.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. I attended the deceased from the 12th of December till the 24th, when she died; in my judgment she died from concussion of the spine - the numbness of the arms continued; there was a great deal of swelling on the back of the neck - she could not walk when under my care; there was no paralysis of the lower extremities - I examined her body on the Monday; there was nothing to be observed at the examination - there are several cases of concussion of the spine when nothing has been seen at the post mortem examination; I attribute her death to a blow on the top of the spine - a blow from a hammer would be sufficient to cause the symptoms, and produce the concussion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If in a struggle she grazed against a door, might not that cause concussion? A. If any hard substance struck her on the spine; she could have been attended to much better if she had come into the hospital at once - she would be seen much oftener.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you a doubt of the cause of her death? A. None.</p>

            . The deceased was my mother. On the 30th of November, between five and six o'clock, I had a dispute with the prisoner about the staircase window - the prisoner insisted on having it shut, and my mother, on account of the smell of paint and oil-cans on the stairs, wished it open; I met Martin on the stairs that evening - he shut the window; I opened it as I went up, and in three or four minutes after I found it shut - I opened it again, and as I came back Martin's room door was open, and he said, "You b-y set of thieving b-rs, I will be master!" I think he was sober - he went on with his abuse; my mother came out, and intreated me to go away; I did so, but had not turned my back a moment, before I heard my mother cry out "He is murdering me! help me!" I was not a yard off - I turned back immediately, and found him in the act of shutting his room door - I pushed it with my hand; he immediately came out, and struck me on the head with a small headed glazier's hammer, which he had in his hand - he is a painter; the blow cut my head open, and stunned me; he was in the act of striking me another blow, when Mrs. Clark came up, and parted us: when I saw him shutting his door my mother was standing on the landing - she did not fall; I helped her into her room - I examined her neck, and found a great swelling as big as my fist between her shoulders; the skin was grazed at the top of the spine - she went to the hospital by herself; I went to the office for a warrant, and when I returned I found her in bed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When your mother called out, did you hear a scuffling? A. Certainly; I heard nothing about his going to nail the window down with the hammer.</p>

            . I live on the second floor, in the same house, but am not related to the last witness; my children called me to hear what was going on - I was in my room, and after a short time I heard words between the prisoner and Avins; I heard the deceased say, "You mean, pitiful wretch, you shall have it," and from the sound of footsteps and voices it seemed as if she left the landing, and went into her own apartment - I immediately heard a violent rushing at the room door; I heard two or three violent blows, as if knocking against the prisoner's room door, or against wood - there is a small lobby between the two doors; immediately on that Murder! was called three or four times - I went from my own room up stairs and then the whole party were in Martin's room -Avins had his hand on his shoulder; Mrs. Avins seemed to be pulling her son from Martin - I went between them, and said, "Forbear, what is all this for?" they attempted to strike each other - I never saw a hammer in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You heard a rush, as if something was being knocked against wood? A. I thought so - I rather think it was a knocking against the door; the box of the lock has been loose ever since - it was not so before.</p>
               <p>MR. LONGSDALE. If she had fallen against the edge of the door the bruise might have occured, but I should think then she would have struck her head; the flat part of the door could not have done it - it was a round circular bruise, and appeared to have been given by a hammer; if given by the edge of the door I should say the surface would be larger.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you would be more decided in your opinion if you had seen the door? A. Certainly; it might have been caused by any hard substance, the key or the knob of the door.</p>
               <p>MARY CLARK. There is a knob to the door; I did not preceive any key - I am sure it was the deceased who called Murder!</p>

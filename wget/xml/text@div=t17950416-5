               <p>Q. The night of the general fast? - Yes; I put it out of my hands underneath the pillow of the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it laid in your breeches or open? - Open, under the pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any thing of it again? - On the 27th, it was produced by the pawnbroker, his name is Pearson.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know about the watch being missing? - The young woman at the bar came in in the morning, and asked me to lend her some tea and sugar for her breakfast; she lived up stairs in the same house with me.</p>

               <p>Q. What morning was this? - The day after the fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before this time missed your husband's watch? Did you know it was gone? - No, it was in the house at the time, it was gone after that; I asked her to be so good as to shop in my place, and mind it while I went out of an errand, and when I came back I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the tea and sugar as she desired? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this in your bed room? - It is all one room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you absent? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned was the prisoner in the room? - I met her at the door, the outer door of the house; when I came up to the door, she said, good by, Mrs. Gibson, I must go now, and I said, good by, Betsey; and when I went in I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch when you went out of the room? - Hanging over the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken it from under the pillow after you had got up? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And hung it up there yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of the prisoner that day? - As soon as I missed the watch I pursued after her, and found her at her cousin's in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the watch at that time? - She had pawned the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after she went away from the door, before you found her at her cousin's, in Bishopsgate-street? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see your watch after this? - I saw the watch the same day, at the pawnbroker's, who is here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to this pawnbroker's? - She went along with me to the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. Produce it. When did you receive that watch, and of whom? - On the 26th of February, between nine and ten in the morning; the prisoner at the bar brought it in, she asked eighteen shillings on it; I told her I would lend her fourteen shillings; she said, lend me another shillings; I told her no; she agreed to take fourteen shillings; I asked her then her name? she told me

            , and she lived in Half Moon-alley, that is just by where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that where you live from Lambeth-street, Whitechapel? - I suppose it is half a mile or more; she said the watch belonged to her father or brother, but I think it was her brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who her father was? - No, she did not, but I had seen her before several times in the neighbourhood, and at the shop; in the course of about half an hour after, she came in with one of the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did lend her the fourteen shillings in the name of Mary Barlet? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Gibson with the runner and her when she came to your house? - Yes, I believe she was; they came in with intent to buy the goods, the runner did, he said the girl wanted to sell it, so I shewed the watch, and he shewed it to the prosecutrix, and she said it was her watch, and the runner desired I would take care of it, as it was stole; and I told him I would; and desired me to attend the next day at the office in Whitechapel, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had the care of the watch ever since? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, I know it both by the name and number, and likewise by a dent on the spring, I have had it about nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the chain and key, and seal to it - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is the watch I left hanging up in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She gave me this watch to make some money of unknown to her husband, and told me to give her the money unknown to him; and when I returned with the money I see him there, and I did not give it her; with that she came to seek after me, and took me up because I did not come at the time she expected me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. The prisoner's defence makes it necessary for me to ask you whether you delivered the watch to her to pawn? - I never delivered the watch to her, or ever had any thought of delivering the watch to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell her to make money of it? - I never did, or ever had a thought about it, she is a wicked girl to say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lodged in the house? - About six weeks, she is a <rs id="t17950416-5-deflabel25" type="occupation">servant</rs>

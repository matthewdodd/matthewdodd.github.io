               <p>Do you mean by fainting, that you lost your senses? - Certainly, Sir, and my money too; he brought a knife in his hand to me, and told me, if I spoke a word, he would cut my throat; I fainted away when I saw him take the petticoat, and the knife in his hand; there was nine guineas and an half in gold; when I recovered, a woman was standing by me, and my petticoat on the stairs towards the street.</p>
               <p>How many other men were in the cellar? - Indeed I cannot rightly tell, there was not many; there were not above five or six at the most.</p>
               <p>How came the prisoner to know you had money in your petticoat? - He saw me sewing it in my petticoat on Saturday night; he lived with me two or three months; I never received my money.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after? - I did not see him till he was at the watch-house; he left his shoes, stockings, waistcoat, handkerchief, and hat behind him; he went away only in his breeches, and an old check shirt.</p>

               <p>Did he appear to have been up the chimney? - Yes, he was in the shirt with a handkerchief round his head, and all over soot; I carried him to the watch-house; he said, he bought some of the clothes the same day, and some of them the day before; the next day he was taken before the Justice, and was committed; I saw the constable take a pair of silver knee-buckles out of his breeches, before he gave them to him; and the constable took a pair of silver buttons out of his shirt sleeves; they were the breeches he acknowledged to be his, and a pair of stockings.</p>

               <p>I live in Little Russel-street Bloomsbury; I am constable; I suppose the boy calls upon me because I am in Court; this woman came to me, and said, she had been robbed of nine guineas and a half; it was in the beginning of September; I did not make any memorandum of it; she said, she had stopped a woman that lived there with her; I went and took the woman in custody in Buckerridge-street, and brought her up to Mr. Walker's office in Hyde-street; and there the woman charged her with taking this money; to the best of my knowledge, she said, that woman she supposed had taken her money, and knew that she sewed it in her petticoat; there was a little place in her petticoat that looked as if something had been put in it; I searched the woman, but she had no money at all about her; Mr. Walker discharged her; the prosecutrix then said, it must be a little boy they call Welch; she never mentioned a word about the knife, or about the boy coming about the bedside; but I believe our clerk took it down in writing, every thing she said.</p>
               <p>I wish you to recollect this if you can, whether the prosecutrix did not tell you that this woman must be connected with Welch? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Did not she tell you that she and Welch had kept company together? - I did understand it, that this boy and this woman knew one another.</p>
               <p>Did you understand it from the prosecutrix that they knew one another? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>When the prosecutrix made this charge, did you understand it to be a direct charge against the woman of taking the money from the petticoat? - I understood at the first giving the charge, that it was the woman.</p>
               <p>You are sure nothing was said about the knife, or of the boy's coming to the bedside? - I am sure of that; after the Magistrate discharged this woman, she said it must be this boy, and not till then.</p>

On the 28th of June I lost some potatoes from a coal and potatoe warehouse which I keep - I saw the prisoner carrying them in a direction from my warehouse under my window, at six o'clock in the morning; they were in one of my sacks - I got on my clothes, and hurried down; I missed the prisoner, but I went into an empty house, which I suppose he had gone through - I fastened it up, then went, and finished dressing myself: I then went down, and saw the prisoner coming back to my premises to go to work - I waited about, but said nothing till his mistress came down; I then got some officers, went to the empty house, and under the staircase, in the lower room, I found this bag of potatoes - I had not seen him in that house, but going towards it; I saw my name on the bag when he had it on his back - I had seen it on the Sunday morning in the place where my potatoes are kept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. How many bags had you of this sort? A There might be a dozen - here is my name on it at full; the empty house joins my premises; the prisoner has been my apprentice for three years - I did not receive any premium with him; I lost ten sacks I suppose; the prisoner had been to repair that empty house, as I had no boats to build at that time - I did not see him go in there that morning; the trees before my house prevented me - as soon as I had got my clothes on I followed him close, in two minutes: he had time to put it there -I called out, or very likely he would have carried it through the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.It was but two minutes to your following him? A. No, not at first - I found the door open, and followed him; I shut it. went back, and put on my clothes - he has borne a good character.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM THOMAS. I was on duty, and was called to go in search of some potatoes - I found these in an empty house under some stairs, surrounded with some paintpots.</p>

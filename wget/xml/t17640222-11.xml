On the 20th of January, near eleven at night (a very moon-light night) I was going home to Lime-street, I met the prisoner at the corner of Grace-church street, with another woman; she asked me a few questions; she asked if she might go along with me. I said there is room enough for both of us to walk, you had better keep at a proper distance and not come nigh me.

I went to look after her, but mistook my way and did not catch her. I never saw my watch since. I had been almost every night to look for her; and as I was waiting at a public-house on the 31st of January I saw her coming by. I took her up and charged her. She was taken to the watch-house in Leadenhall-street; there she charged me, and the Constable would not let me go without my answering to appear against her for stealing my watch.</p>

               <p>He came and laid hold on my shoulder, and turn'd me about, and said, you are the woman I am looking for; said I, for what? Said he, for robbing me of my watch last Friday night; I said, I know nothing of it; he said it was much such a little woman as I was. He took me to the watch-house and charged me. I am but 15 years old.</p>

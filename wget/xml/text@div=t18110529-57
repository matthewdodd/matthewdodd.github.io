I was at the public-house, I was in the parlour, I looked through the parlour window into the yard; I saw the prisoner strip, and the deceased in the act of stripping in the yard. They retired into a back room to fight, the deceased finishing stripping in the back room. I followed them into the back room; I followed them into the back room. The deceased was equal in height to the prisoner, but the deceased was thinner after being stripped. I saw a man draw a line across the ground for them to come up to fight, and there they met and shook hands before they began, and after they began they had a short round, the deceased fell; there were two or three blows exchanged, but of no consequence, as I conceived; the deceased was picked up, and they had another round; the prisoner's nose bled, and they fell both together; the deceased fell undermost, that round was nearly the same length as the other; I saw the prisoner strike him one or two blows in the body,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290046"></xptr>but not very forcibly to do any harm, as I conceived; he was then picked up and put on the bench, and the fight was put a stop to by Moiler the landlord coming in. That is all the fight there was; and all I saw. I went into the parlour where I came from; in about half an hour afterwards I had occasion to go backwards, I saw the deceased standing in the yard in the act of trying to make water, he said he could not, for he was troubled with the gravel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you to be much hurt - A. No, he did not. I left him then.</p>

            . I live at the Red Lion and Still. On the 24th of April, about two o'clock I came home, I heard that there had been a dispute between the deceased and the prisoner, I went directly into the taproom, the deceased was standing up with his fist clenched in the prisoner's face, the deceased called him a thief, saying he had collected money on a gathering and made use of it for himself; the prisoner denied the charge; the deceased called him a liar, and said he would fight him then, or any other time for ten pound; a man of the name of Jones pulled out a one pound note to lend to the deceased; I snatched the note out of his hand; I put one in one settle, and the other in another; they promised they would be quiet then; they were both very drunk; I left them quiet and went into the parlour, that is all I saw of it; I did not see the fight in the yard, the yard is detached from the house; I was told there was a fight; I went in and stopped it in the last round; none of the fighting I saw; they ceased fighting when I came in; I would not suffer it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the condition of the deceased at that time - A. I believe there was a sprinkling of blood about his nose. I observed no injury, nor did he complain of any; I only considered him in liquor.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw John Barrlett, about three o'clock, on the 25th of April, at his lodging, I understood from him and his wife that his principal complaint was want of power to make water; he seemed very languid; and the region of the bladder was very much extended, as if the bladder was very full, from the external appearance, and the whole of the belly in fact. I immediately proceeded to draw of the urine by a catheter. I drew off a pint and half of fluid, which appeared blood and urine mixed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told that he had been fighting the day before - A. Neither the deceased or the wife told me that he had been fighting; I enquired what sort of health he had before; I wanted to account for this appearance; he said he had a pain in his back, and had passed some gravel by urine. He was relieved by drawing off the urine, but remained very ill; he was getting very languid every time I saw him. I saw him two or three times the two first days, I found it necessary to use the catheter again, and the second time there was a smaller discharge; he continued growing worse and worse, and died on the Sunday morning following, the 28th. I opened him the same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the first thing that presented itself was a rupture of one of the intestines; a laceration of one of the intestines, and in that cavity which the bladder should occupy, there was a large quantity of grumous blood, which upon taking out, I discovered that the bladder was ruptured likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. From these circumstances you have no doubt that his death proceeded from the laceration of the intestines and the rupture of the bladder - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion as a medical man that the blows he received in the course of that fight could have occasioned the laceration of the bowels, and the rupture of the bladder - A. It is necessary for me to state that his bladder appeared to me to be in a diseased state, and that at one time of life he had great inflammation on the surface of his bowels, I have not a doubt of it, in consequence of which, what we call adhesions, had taken place - parts growing together, His liver adhered so close to his side that it required great force to detach it; the caul, which covered the belly, was almost obliterated, and what there was adhered to the sides. I consider the cause of his death to have been from a violent exertion, tearing away these adhesions; in this diseased state even if he had stumbled and endeavoured to recover himself, he might have done that mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps I understand you to say that you could not discover any appearance on the body that seemed to be occasioned by any blows - A. No, that might be done by a punch in the belly; I saw no marks, neither external nor internal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury I drank with the deceased some time on that day, he mentioned that I had gathered money for a sick member and kept it, this was proved to the contrary; then we became comfortable, and drank together again; he then said I was not so good a man to the society as he was, that I was no man; he put his fist three times in my face saying that was my master. If I had been sober I should not have fought with him.</p>

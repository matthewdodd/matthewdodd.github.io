            . On the 26th of April, I was at Mr. Smith's lodging. I went to bed about eleven o'clock. Smith has an outer door leading into the street, which I locked and bolted. I did not examine the shutters - there is a wooden partition between Mr. Smith's shop, and another shop, forming I believe part of the premises, kept by Mr. Wilson; but there is no direct communication from one to the other. About one o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by a noise at the street door, as if some person was attempting to get in; I listened for five minutes, when it ceased - in a few minutes it began again; I listened, and thought I heard some persons whisper; I slept on the same floor as the shop. I got quietly out of bed, and softly opened the door, saw something dark by the door, and found it was a chair - I saw the prisoner crushed up by the door, in a corner; I collared him, and demanded who he was; he did not speak - I struck him with the chair; a struggle ensued. I gave an alarm; the watchman came, and demanded admittance; I told him to force the door open, which he did. I gave the prisoner in charge of Foley. I got a light, but could not see how he got in. I enquired of him how he got in; I threatened him, and in consequence of what he said, I went and examined Wollat's shop, and found a pannel had been removed between Wollat's and Smith's shop - it was a very small hole, but a small person might get through - I should have thought the prisoner could not get through there; he could have got in no other way that I know of. I did not examine the shop when I went to bed, and cannot say whether any one was behind the counter or not. The shopman had left about half-past eight o'clock. I found Smith's door unlocked, and the key in my door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first time you saw the hole in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140013"></xptr>the pannel was on your return from the watch-house - A. Yes. I saw a young man much less than the prisoner, try to get through the hole, but he could not.</p>

             re-examined. I returned about eleven o'clock on the Sunday morning, and saw the opening in the pannel; it had been removed by boring holes round it, and then forcing it out. The holes were not bored all the way through; I should think the prisoner could not get through there. If the holes had been bored the night before, I think I must have seen them. I do not believe it was possible that the prisoner could be in the shop when I left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You think he could not pass through the hole - A. No; it was ten inches and a half square - he might; he is thin made about the shoulders.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the house at ten o'clock on Sunday morning, and looked through the hole in Smith's shop. I saw the pannel lying in Wollat's shop, and a chisel under the hole, on Wollat's side, some pieces of wood, and a gimblet. The pannel came against a counter on Smith's side; the aperture was about ten inches and three quarters square. Smith's shopman got through the hole into Wollat's shop, and opened the door - I went in, and found it was quite easy to get through when the counter was moved, as it was then open the full size of the pannel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. A person in Wollat's shop could not have removed the counter - A. No.</p>

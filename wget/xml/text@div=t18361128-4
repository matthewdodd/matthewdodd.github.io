                  </hi> I am a policeman. On the 12th of November I was on duty, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, in Plummer-street, Hoxton, and saw the prisoner near the door of No. 2, Swan pas<lb></lb>sage, in the parish of St. Leonard shoreditch, which I knew to be a bro<lb></lb>thel—he was leaning against the wall—I told him to go on—I do not know that he said any thing—he was going on—I then perceived some<lb></lb>thing under his left arm, and asked him what it was—he said a shawl, which he had found in the New North Road—I asked him to let me look at it—I took hold of it and perceived something drop from the shawl—I asked him what it was—he said he knew nothing of it—I picked it up—it was a cruet-stand—he than said it was wrapped up in the shawl which he had found, with a tumbler-glass which he had got in his hat—I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found two silver table-spoons, a silver tea-spoon, sugar-tongs, three cruets, a trinket-box, a gold ring, and a pair of coral ear-drops—I returned to the spot, and there found a table-cloth lying on the ground in the place where I stopped him—there was nothing in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Gloucester-street, in the parish of Shoreditch, on the 12th of November, from nine o'clock at night till six o'clock in the morning—the prosecutrix's house in No. 22, New Gloucester-street—at five minutes after five o'clock I tried the parlour shutters—they seemed to be close—on pulling them open I found the sash thrown quite up, and the glass broken where the catch fastens—one of the blinds was taken off the hinge, and the sofa pushed away from the window nearly a yard—part of the glass appeared to be cat and laid on the floor of the room—that would admit a hand to lay hold of the catch—I alarmed the family—the prosecutrix came down stairs—she got a light, and missed the property—there was a little boy, fourteen or fifteen years old, asleep in the front parlour—in the corner of the room where the robbery is sup<lb></lb>posed to have taken place—there was a bed on the floor.</p>

               <p>make a regular round of my beat—it takes me half an hour to go round—I had passed these premises twice after four o'clock—it was in con<lb></lb>sequence of trying the shutter that I found the window open—I tried the shutter at half-past nine, and again at one—it was safe then—the shutters had been newly painted, and stuck together when I pulled them open—it was a very rainy, wet night—the street is paved.</p>

I lodged in the two parlours on the ground-floor of Mrs. Mac Auliffe's house—I sleep in the back parlour, and use the front as a sitting-room—I went to bed between one and two o'clock—Cook alarmed us about five o'clock—he knocked at the door, and remained outside the window—I got up and observed the window open, and the policeman standing there—we proceeded to examine the premises, and missed a stand, three cruets, two table-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, a tea-spoon, a tumbler, a small box containing a pair of coral ear-drops, a broken wedding-ring, and some shirt-studs—I also missed a shawl of my wife's, which had been on the sofa the night before, and a table-cloth—the sugar-tongs, spoons, and cruets, belong to Mrs. Mac Auliffe—I have the use of them—I am sure the front-parlour window was safe when I went to bed.</p>

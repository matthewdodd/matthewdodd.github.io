                  </hi>. I shall be fifteen years old next October—I am clerk to Mr. Robert Hudson, Custom-house agent, St. Dunstan's-hill—I have been seven or eight months in his employment—he has an office in the lobby of the Custom-house. Last Saturday week I had occasion to pay 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into the treasury of the Custom-house—it was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a sovereign, a half-crown, and a shilling—it was Mr. Hud<lb></lb>son's money—I had to go across the long room up a small passage to the treasury—I had the money in my hand—I crossed the long room with it, and got about two steps from the door of the treasury—there are a great many people in the long room—I did not see any body near the treasury door—while I was about to enter the door a person came behind me, and gave me several severe blows on the head, and afterwards knocked me down and demanded my money—he said, "Give me your money" three or four times when I was down—I would not part with it—I held it firmly in my hand, and called out "Murder"—while I was calling out I heard some<lb></lb>body approaching, and then the person who attacked me ran away—he had a blue coat on—I did not notice his features—I noticed his coat when he was about a dozen yards from me, after he turned to run away—I am cer<lb></lb>tain of his having a blue coat—two or three moments after he ran away Cook and Kelly came up—I told them which way the man had gone—I was carried into the treasury, and sent for my employer, and then I put the money on the table—two or three minutes after Cook and Kelly came up, while I was sitting on the chair in the treasury, I heard somebody call out, "He is caught, he is caught"—I came out of the treasury, and saw the prisoner in custody—he had a blue coat on—my father came to the place afterwards, and said to him, "You vagabond, or scoundrel, how came you to hit a boy like that?"—he said, "I have not hurt him, I have not hurt the boy"—I have suffered a good deal from the violence, and I have been attended by a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the employ of the Customs. On Saturday week, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in the bench lobby near the treasurer's office—I heard a great screaming in the passage, and a cry of "Murder," repeated two or three times—I went to see what was the matter, and about two paces from the boy I saw a man in a blue coat running—I immediately ran after him—I lost sight of him, at he turned round a corner—there are several corners there—I only lost sight of him once, and I never regained sight of him till I found him in a coal-hole, not far from the staircase—there were some gentle<lb></lb>men standing on the top of the staircase—he must have been twenty paces from the staircase when I lost sight of him—he would have two corners to turn to get to that staircase—there was no way for him to get out of the Custom-house but by that staircase—in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing that passed with those gentlemen, I came back, and looked in the coal-cellar—I had ran past the coal-cellar to get to the top of the stairs—the coal-cellar is about eight or ten paces from the top of the stairs—after passing the coal-cellar I should have to pass one of the corners I have mentioned—a person going into the coal-cellar would be concealed from a person on the top of the stairs by the corner—a man named Salter ran as far as the prosecutor, who was lying down when we passed him—no other per<lb></lb>son went on with me—I then went to the coal-cellar, and found the door was not as it generally is when I have occasion to go there—I pulled the door open, went in, put my foot in behind the door, and felt a man—I then fas<lb></lb>tened the door back so as to keep him behind it, and hallooed out to Mr. Salter, who was coming up, that I had got him—the person I seized was the prisoner—he had on a blue coat—I had not heard at that time any thing from the boy about the person who assaulted him—I secured him, and said, "I have got you"—he said, "I know you have"—I then handed him over to Mr. Brunet, the constable—he was taken into a little lobby near the coal-cellar, and there kept some time—the boy was brought to him and shown to him—I did not hear him say any thing then.</p>

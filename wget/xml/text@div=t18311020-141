I have known the prisoner - he lived with his uncle, and was employed in removing goods with a van. On the 29th of March I delivered him two boxes, to take to No. 26, New Broad-street; one of them arrived safe, but the other did not - I spoke to the prisoner in May following, and told him to bring the other box to my situation; he said a City and west-end carrier had come for it - I never received it; it contained the articles stated, and a good many others - the prisoner was to keep that box till I sent for it, but I never had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You gave him this box to take care of? A. My landlord delivered them both to him - I told him to take the first box on the 29th of March, which he did; I did not want the other, as I did not know that my situation would suit me - when I wanted it I told him, and he said he would send it; he said afterwards that a carrier had had it - he said, as a friend, he would take them free of expence; I was not very intimate with him - I have been to the theatres with him; I have played at cards with him several times, but he was not a particular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200057"></xptr>acquaintance; he said a carrier, of the name of Thompson, had had my box, and when I went out I said, "It is Charles;" meaning the person where I lived, who, I thought, had fetched it in a joke - I did not say that I thought my landlord took it as security for a debt, and that he had threatened to kick me out of the house and detain my boxes - I remember living at Mr. Hodsoll's; I was there four months - I did not get a character from there; I went to a situation where it was not required; I never applied to Mr. Hodsoll for a character, and never was refused one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew something of this man? A. Yes; I had lodged at a coffee-shop, at Mr. Eyre's - I told him to deliver the boxes to the prisoner, which he did.</p>

The prosecutrix lodged with me, and left the two boxes; she asked me to let Gilmore, the prisoner, have them, which my wife did, on the 29th of March- I heard nothing more about them, till one day she happened to come in when the prisoner was there; he said to her, "What carrier was that you sent for your box?" she said, "I never sent any;" he said his name was Thompson.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner on the 7th of October - I went to Little Welbeck-street, where the prisoner lodged, over a stable; the prosecutrix there pointed out a pair of scissors - we then came down, and found this brush.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you know he lodged there? A. I was told so.</p>
               <p>CHARLES EYRE. I was told, by his uncle, that he lodged there - I went and saw him at work in the stable.</p>
               <p>ABIGAIL HARDING. I know the prisoner lodged there; I can swear that this brush is mine, by a scratch on it, and it was in the box which was lost - these scissors are mine, and were in the work-box, which was locked; the large box was only corded.</p>

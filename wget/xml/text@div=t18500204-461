               <p>eleven years. On 10th Jan. I was living in my brother's house, in New-court, Spitalfields—I had been living there six weeks—my husband was not living with me—about ten o'clock in the morning my husband came in—he asked me if my brother was in doors—he was not, but I said he was, for I was frightened at my husband—he asked me if I would go home with him—I said I would not, I was afraid of my life—he had his right hand in his jacket pocket, and on my saying I would not go home with him, he took his right hand out of his pocket and threw a brick, and cut me on the head—my head bled wonderfully—he then went towards the fire and took the fire-shovel, and I laid hold of the poker—he made towards my face with the shovel—I lifted up my hand, and received the blow on my left arm—I had the poker in my right hand, but it fell from me—my mother and sister were there—my sister told me to run away with my life and let him kill herself—I was taken to the London Hospital.</p>

Fitzpatrick—my sister and mother were living there—I and my sister and mother were in the room with the prisoner—when I got the blow I took up the poker, I did not take it up before—I did not call the prisoner any name, or abuse him—my brother, who keeps the house, is only growing up—they were not repairing the house—there were no bricks lying about—I was about two yards from the prisoner when he threw the brick at me—it cut me on the side of the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's sister. On 10th Jan. when he came to the house, he walked in quite carelessly with both his hands in his jacket pockets—he asked if ray brother was in doors—we said, "Yes, up<lb></lb>stairs," but he was not—he then asked his wife to go home with him—she said, "No," she was afraid of her life—he then pulled his hand out of his pocket and made a blow at her with a piece of brick—I afterwards took the brick up—this is it—I got up and found my sister's head bleeding—I took hold of the prisoner by the collar, and over my left shoulder I heard a blow with the shovel—I told my sister to save her life, to go out and let him kill me—she went out—the prisoner got from me, and he went out—I followed him, and he took a stone and swore he would have my life, or any persons is the house that he could get—I went in and closed the door—I did not go out till the man went—I held the brick and shovel till my brother came home—this is the shovel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—Ann Donovan was brought there on 10th Jan.—I found a lacerated wound on the left side of the head—it had penetrated to the skull, about a quarter of an inch deep—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with the edge of this brick—it must have been struck in a slanting direction—it had been bleeding very freely—it had nearly stopped when I saw it—I examined the wound on her arm—it was on the most muscular portion of the arm—it was about three inches in length—it had penetrated to some depth; I cannot say exactly how deep—as far as it went it was a serious wound, but not danger<lb></lb>ous—it must have required great force to have made such a wound with an instrument not sharper than this shovel.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the wound across the arm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, such a blow as a person holding up their hand to defend themselves might receive—I cannot tell what would be the effect of the force of that blow on the head—some<lb></lb>times a slight wound is of great consequence there—I should think it would not have penetrated the skull—I think the shovel would have bent against the skull—a blunt instrument would have been more likely to break the skull—the top of the shovel would have been more likely to have done it—if this shovel bad struck in a flat direction, it certainly would not have done it—it takes an amazing deal of force to fracture the skull.</p>

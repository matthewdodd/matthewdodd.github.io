                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in George-street, Stepney. On the 24th of March, near twelve o'clock at night, I was at the Queen Caroline public-house, in Brook-street—I took a sovereign out of my pocket to pay for some gin, and I had thirty-seven sovereigns lefl in my purse at that time—I put the silver into my trowsers pocket—the pri<lb></lb>soner was close by, in front of the bar—I left the house in two or three minutes, and went up George-street, under one of the railway arches—the prisoner met me, laid hold of my collar, and struck me several times on the head and face, and threw me down—we had a desperate struggle there—I felt him take my purse from my inside coat pocket—he then broke loose from me and ran away—I ran after him to the top of Butcher's-row, which is nearly 200 yards—I there caught him by the jacket and said, "You have robbed me"—he made no answer but turned round and struck me about the head and face—I threw him down—he got up again and struck me very furiously about the head and face—I threw him down a second time and got the purse from his hand, which, at the moment I thought contained the whole of the money—we had a desperate fight there—I took him back to the Queen Caroline to get assistance, telling him he thought he had robbed me, but he was too weak—the landlord closed the door, went to an up stairs window, watched me struggling with the prisoner, and would give me no assistance—I struggled with him in the street from five to ten minutes—a great many persons came up and took an active part for the prisoner, and I received some blows—I then made my escape home—I immediately ex<lb></lb>amined my purse, and there was only twelve sovertigns left, twenty-five were gone—I also missed my handkerchief which I had in my coat pocket at the time I changed the sovereign—this is the handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to it—there is a mark on it, and one hem is wider than the other, where it has had a tape through to be used as an apron.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Queen Caroline—the prisoner and prose<lb></lb>cutor were both at my house on this evening, drinking gin—I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor pull out a bag with some money in it to pay for a glass of gin—it did not appear to contain a considerable sum, I should say not thirty or forty sovereigns—afterwards, when the house was shut up, I heard a cry of "Stop him, stop him"—I went down and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner's jacket—he said, "You thought to rob me, but you find I am too strong for you"—the prisoner immediately replied, "I have not robbed you, search me"—I afterwards saw the prisoner sitting on a step crying—the prosecutor required no assistance—if he wanted any there was plenty of polico at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you called the attention of two police<lb></lb>men to the prosecutor as being drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, as he was so very tipsy—they would not come into the house, but said if I got him ont they would see him a little on his road—the prisoner was also tipsy—there were ten or twelve other persons in the road when the prisoner and prose<lb></lb>cutor were struggling—the prisoner got very much the worst of it—the mob said he was not half a <hi rend="italic">plucked</hi> one—on that he attempted to strike the prosecutor, but missed him and fell on his face, and the prosecutor immediately ran away.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

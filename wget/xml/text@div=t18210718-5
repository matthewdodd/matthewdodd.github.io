On the 30th of June I was in bed about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, and heard the window pushed up - it was on the ground floor; the window curtain was drawn aside, and in about two minutes I looked round, and saw six shirts taken off the line, and a gown, which hung near the window. A person putting part of their body in could take them. I heard somebody running away, and about eight o'clock that morning, we found four shirts and the gown.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Exeter-street. About a quarter before six o'clock in the morning of the robbery, I saw the prisoner, with another person, standing near the corner of Change-court, about ten yards from Horwood's house, standing under the narrow entrance, and saw the one who is not in custody, take an apron from the prisoner, which he had on, and both went up on tiptoe, towards Horwood's - shortly after I saw them both run down the court with something in the apron - I opened the door, ran out, and made an alarm, but being undressed, I could not pursue them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where were you - A. On the first floor, directly opposite the court. I saw the other man there a quarter of an hour before the prisoner joined him; they went up the court about five minutes after he joined him. I knew the other before.</p>

            . I live in Southampton-place, Strand. On this day I saw the prisoner running through Southampton-place, with another person - I am sure he is one of them. My house is but three minutes walk from Change-court. They ran down into my cellar, I went down stairs, and saw them; the prisoner's companion asked me if I would allow him to leave the linen in the dust-hole - he was then sorting it. I said it was a very improper place to put linen in - he said it was of no consequence, that he had been out all night, having a lark. The prisoner was then going away, his companion told him to stop, and go and have some coffee first. I then went up stairs to work. I afterwards heard of the robbery, and told Jackson about it - he was in the court. I asked him to mind my door, went down into the cellar, and found the prisoner still there, the other was gone. I found part of the linen in the dust-hole, and part down the privy. The other man had asked leave to go to the privy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your cellar always open - A. Yes; the prisoner did not speak - he heard the conversation. I should know the other again if I saw him.</p>

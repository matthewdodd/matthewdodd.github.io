On Wednesday evening, the 28th of November, a few minutes after seven o'clock, I was in Featherstone-street, about four hundred yards from this house - I saw the prisoner with a bundle in his hand; his hat appeared very heavy on his head - I knew him before - I went up and asked what he had in the bundle; he said two bonnets, which belonged to his sister, which he was to get cleaned - I said that might be, but I must see them - I took him to a public-house, examined the bundle, and found there were two bonnets - I then searched him, and found a quantity of trinkets, which I produce; he claimed the handkerchief the bonnets were tied in - I found on him two gold pins, a silver paste-brooch, a Queen Anne's half-crown, a silver 3d. piece, a copper 2d. piece, a scent-box, a diamond brooch, two scent-bottles, part of two watch-keys, a silver thimble, a small comb, a pen-knife, a large hoop ear-ring, and part of another, a small seal, a necklace of beads, a small chain, a small pearl brooch, and part of a pack of cards, the skirt of a green gown, a purple spencer, the body of a plaid silk gown, and a phosphorus-box - they were all in his pocket; and in his hat, was a silk shawl, and a China crape shawl; on going from the house, where I searched him, to the office; he told me to take the swag, and let him go, for he was sure, if he went to the office that night, the people would come against him - I asked why he should think so; he said because he had not been out of the house many minutes - I said I knew him to be a thief, and should take him to the office I did so, and then went round, and found about nine o'clock that evening, this house had been broken open - I examined the street door, and found it had been entered by force - I examined the room doors; the parlours had been opened apparently by the same instrument as the street door - I compared a chisel, which was found on the premises, and it exactly fitted; the chisel was broken: part of it was found near the front room, first floor, door-post, and the other part sticking in the back room door of the first floor; it fitted the marks on the doors, and the broken part of it fitted the marks in Buckthorp's drawers; about seven boxes were broken open in various rooms, and the remainder of the property strewed about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to a solicitor, and reside at 4, Rose Terrace, Wellington Road, Stoke Newington—on Saturday, the 17th November, about four o'clock, I was in Leadenhall Market—my attention was called to the prisoners by the witness Castle—he tapped me on the shoulder, and, pointing to Brown, said, "That boy has your silver snuff-box"—I looked round—he said, "I have not got it: you may search me"—Castle said he had passed it to the other—he denied it, and Castle said he had passed it to a third one, who was going across the other side of the court—I detained them, and gave them to a policeman—I had had my box about two minutes before; it was worth about a sovereign.</p>

I am clerk to a tea merchant, of 155, Fenchurch Street—I saw the two prisoners together, with another, on this day at the end of the poultry market following close behind the prosecutor—I dis<lb></lb>tinctly saw Brown put his hand to his pocket, and take something out of it—I was walking behind them—as I passed by I saw it in his left hand, and saw it was a silver snuffbox, about an inch and a half long—I saw Carter take it from Brown's hand—they then stepped back, looking at some meat—I tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and asked if he had lost anything—he said yes, he had lost his snuffbox—I told him to ask the prisoners if they had got it—he went up and asked them—they both said they had not got it; he might search them—I did not notice what the third man did.</p>

               <p>I am clerk in the Sheriff's office, I act for the secondaries, I have a capias.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the date? - The 7th of June, 1782.</p>
               <p>Produce the Sheriff's court paper? - It issued on Saturday the 8th of June.</p>
               <p>Do you know Daly? - I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Who was the Sheriff for Wood-street Compter? - Mr. Nicholson; I charged him with an escape warrant.</p>
               <p>When was he taken? - I am not sure.</p>
               <p>- KIRBY called.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to object to Mr. Kirby's being examined, I wish to ask him a question first: is not this prosecution carried on at the expence of the city? - No, at my own expence.</p>
               <p>Have you any interest in the event of the prosecution? - None in the world.</p>
               <p>Is the effect of it to discharge you from any suit on account of this escape? - There is no suit depending.</p>
               <p>Court. Then Mr. Kirby has no interest in this prosecution.</p>
               <p>- KIRBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am keeper of Wood street Compter, I remember Daly being in my custody under the Sheriff's warrant and many more plaints; he was first brought to my custody on the 10th of June, 1782, as appears from an entry in my book, I have an extract of it; I remember the prisoner, he was in my custody at the same time Daly was, I think he was brought in on the 2d of July, I think the prisoner was in about four days, till the matter he was charged with was settled; the prisoner frequently visited Daly after his discharge, I gave strict charge that Daly should be taken great care of, I was suspicious of him, and the night before his escape, which I think was the 16th of July, one of my men locked him securely in his room, which was pretty nearly over where I lay up two pair of stairs, looking into Wood-street; the next morning he was gone. My man Butt can tell you that I had two more witnesses, King and Tanney, one was the turnkey, and the other a watchman, and they are both dead; I have the smith here, I thought that room the securest in the house; the prisoner went to Ostend.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120103"></xptr>Prisoner. Whether Mr. Daly was taken on an escape warrant at Liverpool? - He was retaken in May following.</p>
               <p>Did none of your prisoners escape out of this room before? - Yes, and it was afterwards made secure, I thought it the most secure room I had in the prison.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was the wood sound that the nails were driven into? - I cannot say that it was altogether so sound as I have seen some wood.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time think it was secure? - I did.</p>

               <p>I am one of the turnkeys to Mr. Kirby, I know this room, the prisoner took out the middle bar that Mr. Lillie had put there the day before.</p>
               <p>Court. The middle bar was taken out? - It appeared to be drawn out by a chissel or small crow, and laying in the room when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Jury. Then it was very insecure, what length was it? - The nails were between three and four inches, and the crow eightteen inches; the wood was very strong; it was a crow with a flat top. I was at Mr. Daly's room at eleven, he answered me, and about a quarter before one I was in the lodge, and I was alarmed by a watchman, that a cord was hanging down in the street; it was a cord tied by many knots, I thought it was not a cord strong enough to let such a man down, it was some cord tied together; we went and broke open the door, the cord was fastened to one of the under bars, I found Mr. Daly was gone, and this bar laying on the floor; it was clear the man got out of the window by moving the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it possible to extract the nails with a crow, because it is charged in the indictment as a crow? - The edge of it was sharp like a knife; Mr. Bellis was in the room twenty times before the bar was put up, he used to come every day.</p>

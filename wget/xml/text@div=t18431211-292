                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Vinnicomb, a tailor, of Howland-street, Fitzroy-square, St. Pancras. On the evening of the 6th of Dec., between six and seven o'clock, I came up stain from the kitchen with a pail of water—at that time the street door was fast, as I was putting the pail down in the passage I saw a man looking out of the front parlour door—I screamed out—he rushed out at the door, threw up his arms and hands as if he was going to knock me down, and got out by the street doot—I ran after him—he was brought book by a policeman and a soldier—the policeman showed me a handkerchief, which was my husband's—I had such an one in the parlour folded together—the prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>

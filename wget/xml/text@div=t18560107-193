                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, and reside in Greet Marylebone-street, Portland-street. On Sunday, 1st July last, a relation of my wife's came to tea with us, and in the afternoon I accompanied her to Park-street—she lived at No. 115 at that time—I left my house at a quarter to 6 o'clock—how I know the time is, because, she wanted to be at home by 6 o'clock—it was perhaps a trifle past 6 o'clock when we got to Park-street—I might have remained at the house a few minutes—after leaving there I went up Park-street again, in the direction of Oxford-street—Park-street runs from Oxford-street, parallel to the Park, Perk-lane, and crosses Grosvenor-street at right angles—there was a crowd of perhaps about 300 persons at the crossing of Park-street and Grosvenor-street—I know Lord Robert Grosvenor's house—I believe it to be the house at the corner of Grosvenor-street, looking into Park-street—I did not know it at that that—I have heard so since—the crowd I speak of was at the corner near that house—I walked through the crowd, and all at once I heard an outcry, and there was a kind of rush—I stood on one side to let the crowd go past—they did pass me, and I saw, I should think, from fifty to sixty policemen pass me, after the people—I was then standing at the edge of the kerb, in Park-street, on the left hand side of Park-street, near Lord Robert Gros<lb></lb>venor's house, on the same side, the Park-lane side, the west side—I had not then passed Grosvenor-street—after the persons had passed me I was in the act of going on towards Oxford-street, when I received a tremendous blow in the back—I turned round as Well as I could, and had just time to say, "I am only a casual passer," and was struck in the mouth by a police<lb></lb>man's fist—I cannot tell what it was that struck me on the back—I should not think it Was a fist—I do not know who the policeman was that struck me in the mouth—there were several other policemen about me at the time; to the best of my belief five—I received ft succession of blows, both with the fist and the truncheon, until I was struck down in the street—I received several blows from C 84 (<hi rend="italic">the defendant</hi>)—he struck me several blows in the face with his clenched fist—the other persons who struck me were all policemen—I was struck with the truncheons repeatedly, between the shoulders—I had three blows on the head, several between the shoul<lb></lb>ders, and the lower part of the back, and also a hurt in the lower part of the stomach—I do not know whether that was from a blow with a truncheon, or whether it was a kick when I was on the ground—I believe I received a kick—I was on the ground when I received the injury—I could not pretend to say how long I was on the ground—I was on the ground very shortly after the assault first took place—perhaps it was not above a minute after, or not a minute—I could scarcely judge of the time—I believe I was struck down on the ground by a blow on the heed—I was beaten severely while I was on the ground, with truncheons I believe,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070052"></xptr>
               <p>until persons from the balcony and doorways cried out, "Shame! Shame!"—at the time this was going on I recognised C 84—I did not take his number myself—I recognised the man—I am rather near-sighted—(<hi rend="italic">the witness left the witness box, and went close to the defendant</hi>)—I have no hesi<lb></lb>tation in my mind in saying that is the man—I could not say how many of the blows I received were given by him, but I have no hesitation in saying that be gave me the black eye—when the people called out "Shame!" I was partly raised from the ground by the police, and partly by my own exertions; and I was again beaten, and dragged back from a doorway, where I endeavoured to go up, and called on some persons who were standing there for protection—I was dragged back on to the pavement from the door, and into the road, I could not say by whom—I then received more blows, until I became stupified—I have an indistinct remembrance then of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> passing, it being called by some one, and my being put into it, and their accompanying me—the back was torn out of my coat as I was being lifted from the ground, and also torn again as I was being dragged out of the doorway—I have the coat here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is in exactly the same state as it was that afternoon—no attempt was made to take me into custody—no one made any charge against me—when I became a little more collected, I found I was in Oxford-street, and I ordered the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive to Marylebone police station, to lay a complaint—I think it was a young woman who first stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had no friends with me—some strangers got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with me, and went with me afterwards to the Marylebone station—there were no policemen with me—no charge was made against me at the station—I charged two policeman—I had a yellow walking stick with me on this evening—I did nothing with that stick—I never raised it, nor had the opportunity of raising it—I was attended by Mr. Curtain, a surgeon, in consequence of this, for about ten weeks—my teeth were loosened, I believe by the first blow that was given with the policeman's closed fist—the blow in the back I feel at times severely now—my mouth was a good deal cut—I had three blows on the head, but nothing of any particular consequence—the hurt in the lower part of my body I felt for some considerable time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say a word about C 84 before the Commissioners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—Mr. Ellis put a question to me respecting it, and he told me it would save some trouble to state that C 80 was not there—I charged both C 80, and C 84 on the same night the assault took place, and also before the Commissioners.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 19, Lower-street, Grosvenor-square. On 1st July I was in Hyde-park, and from ten minutes to half past 6 o'clock I proceeded up Park-street to Grosvenor-equare—I know Lord Grosvenor's house—I saw Mr. Stephens there, on the opposite side, the North Audley-street side of Park-street, as I was coming down the opposite side—he was in the act of stepping on one side to let several policemen pass him that were going after some people, he stepped on one side to the centre of the path to let the police come off the kerb—I saw a police constable run up to him, holding his staff in this manner (<hi rend="italic">one end in each hand</hi>) and struck him with the centre of it, across the lower part of the neck, or the top of the shoulder, holding it cross ways; that sent him running a short distance, head down, he turned to see where it came from, and as he turned the policeman struck him two or three blows in the face with his clenched fist—at that particular time there was only the one policeman, but when he got into the centre of the road, from the man striking him, several others came up; but one in particular I noticed who struck him a blow in the face with his fist—I did not take the other policemen's numbers, but he was knocked down by other policemen, and while he was down he was struck across the back, and across the loins, and kicked in the side—the blows when he was down were struck with the truncheon—while he was down in that manner, one policeman laid hold of, him as if he was in the act of</p>

               <p>pulling him up, and pulled the back of his coat right out—with that he was assisted on his feet, and passed lower down the street—I saw no further what passed, because a gentleman on a balcony called on me to take the numbers, and I took the numbers of two, one I took correctly, but I was mistaken in the number of the one I took second—I took C 84 distinctly—while he was leaning over the man striking those blows, I stood over him and saw him all the time—the defendant is the man—I also took the number of another policeman, the number I am confident of, but I was mistaken in the number of the one I took second—I took C 84 distinctly—while he was in the act of striking Mr. Stephens, and I was calling, "Shame!" to him at the time—I noticed who kicked him, it was this man, C 84—he kicked him on the right side, down towards the hip, when he was on the ground—I saw nothing whatever in Mr. Stephens' hand—I called on Mr. Stephens next day—when I got down to Marylebone-lane from where I live, I saw Mr. Stephens coming out, and I went in and gave evidence of what I saw; he had been to make a complaint—he was an entire stranger to me, I had never seen him before the Sunday to my know<lb></lb>ledge—this was about a quarter of an hour after I left—I spoke to him at the station house, and gave in the numbers and what I saw—I next saw the defendant at the Court of Exchequer, before the Commissioners, he was then produced, and likewise C 80, who I at once said was not the man—I recognised C 84 directly—I saw Mr. Stephens next day, he called on me, and I went to Marlboro'-street with him—I saw the state he was in—I saw him get up, and his mouth was bleeding, and his eye was bruised; but next day his eye was black, and round his loins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter's apprentice. On Sunday afternoon, 1st July, I was coming down Park-street, towards Oxford-street, going towards Piccadilly—I do not know Lord Robert Grosvenor's house, but I believe it is on the left hand side, coming from Oxford-street towards Piccadilly—as I was going down Park-street I saw a crowd near Grosvenor-street, they were standing still—when the police came by I saw them move off all ways, towards Oxford-street, Piccadilly, and towards the Park—I believe they pretty nearly all dispersed—the police came from Piccadilly towards Oxford-street, up the street—after the crowd dispersed, I saw Mr. Stephens on the left hand side of Park-street, coming down from Oxford-street, the side furthest from the Park—when I first saw him he was at the corner of a street—I cannot be certain of the name of it, but I think it was North Audley-street—he was on the opposite side of the street to me, nearest to the Park—he was walking along towards Oxford-street when he was accosted by three or four policemen, who came from the other end of the street—they attempted to drive him away by hitting him on the back with their staves, and pulling him about—he got away from those policemen and advanced a little farther towards Oxford street—policeman C 84 came from the other end of Park-street, Piccadilly, and took hold of Mr. Stephens when he was behind him, turned him round face to face, and then struck him three or four blows in the face with his fist—he was holding him with one hand by his collar, while he was striking him with the other—Mr. Stephens then was, I believe, knocked down by him with his staff, but that I cannot say as I had to more off, and did not see him on the ground—I was about five yards from them at the time Mr. Stephens was struck, but I cannot be certain—I next saw Mr. Stephens in the gateway of a private house in Park-street, on the left hand side of the way, and while he was at the gateway, policeman C 84 struck him with his staff on we back—I did not see Mr. Stephens go to that gateway, he was there when I returned—I came back down the street, and the policeman was then at the gateway<lb></lb>after he had struck Mr. Stephens at the gateway, I believe he tore his coat—I saw the coat torn afterwards, and I believe it was done by that blow—I had again to go away, and after I returned I saw Mr. Stephens getting into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the policemen had not all gone away then—I believe some of them were still there—I went with Mr. Stephens to the station in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I gave information that night against some policeman—I saw policeman C 84 before the Commissioners in the Court of Exchequer—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector C.</hi> On Sunday, 1st July, I was on duty in Park-street—I had some sergeants and men there under my command—in consequence of the increase of the number of persons round Lord Robert Grosvenor's house, I sent for the detachment reserved at Stanhope Gate—at the time the reserve came up there was a great crowd—they were violent, hissing, and throwing stones—I did not myself see any stones thrown—at the time the reserve came up I was standing at the corner of Grosvenor-street and Park-street—that is the side on which Lord Robert Grosvenor's house is situate—there was a great crowd following the reserve as they came from Stanhope Gate—when they came to Reeves's-mews they halted—a portion of the reserve went back after the crowd that was following them, and the others came on towards me, dispersing the mob as they passed—there was room for the crowd to pass on the pavement—the police took the centre of the street—some of the crowd passed up Grosvenor-street and Park-street, and got away as well as they could—a portion of the reserve</p>

               <p>went up Park-street, beyond Grosvenor-street—when I say a portion, per<lb></lb>haps some half dozen men, finding there was a halt at the corner of Park-street, that is the opposite corner of Park-street and Grosvenor-street, the Oxford-street corner, went over to disperse that crowd, and went a little way up Park-street—there is a house on the right, further up Park-street, with a balcony—some of the men went up as far as that, but not the main body—to the beet of my recollection, the rear, that is those that went back to the crowd that was following them from Stanhope Grate, did not return further than Reeves's-mews—I saw Madgett—I saw him at the corner of Grosvenor-street and Park-street—that is near the corner where Lord Robert Grosvenor's house is situate, about opposite there—I saw him strike no one—he bears a good character in the force, as a man of mild, good tem<lb></lb>per—I have had an opportunity of seeing him—he lives in the station house, with fifty others, and I have had an opportunity of watching his conduct—I believe him to be a man of good temper, and a mild, inoffensive person, more so than many that live in the same house—I did not see him strike any one—I did not see him further than Lord Robert Grosvenor's house—there was a great deal of excitement—my opinion was then, and is now, that had not the reserve come up at the time, and taken the step they did, the windows of Lord Robert Grosvenor's house would have shared the same fate as others did—there were a great many thieves and vagabonds about.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that when that was called out, no blows were being struck by the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must consider I was at the corner of Grosvenor-street—that is nearly opposite Lord Robert Grosve<lb></lb>nor's house, and where this occurred was some seventy yards from me, I should think; I mean where the people were crying out "Shame!"—it was from a balcony at the opposite corner of the street—it was a corner that would command a view of the mob in front of Lord Robert Grosvenor's house, and near enough for me to hear the cries of "Shame!"—still there were people between me and the police—I did not see what caused those cries; I could not see—there were a great number of persons between me and them—I did not see any truncheons lifted up—I saw truncheons drawn</p>

               <p>—I did not see them lifted up at that time, nor at any time—I did not see them in the act of striking at that time—as the police came up from Reeves's-mews to the corner of Grosvenor-street, where I was standing, I saw them with their truncheons drawn, and desiring the people to go on, and so on, but I did not see any blows struck—I swear positively there were none—I did not see a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> there.</p>

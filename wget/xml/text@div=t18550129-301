                  </hi>. I am foreman to my father, a timber merchant, at No. 1, Bear-lane, opposite Mr. Ede's yard. On Thursday, 11th Jan., I saw a waggon, loaded with timber, drive up to Mr. Ede's yard—my attention was particularly called to it; there were three very large trees at the back of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290103"></xptr>
               <p>the waggon—it was not a timber carriage, it was a sugar waggon: what they use for carrying hogsheads of sugar, and it drew out and expanded, and the front part of the waggon had a beam across it, and two of the trees laid upon it—the back of the trees extended four or five feet above the sides of the waggon, so that they could not draw into the gateway, and Mr. Ede's men had to cut the limbs off—the timber was fastened on by a rope and a chain, which bound the three trees together—I did not notice whether one of the trees was lying on the other two—they took off one branch and drew it down into Mr. Ede's yard—they must have undone the rope and chain—I did not see them actually do it—I did not notice how many pieces were cut off—I lost sight of it for an hour and a half—I went about my business—I saw it again about 1 o'clock—I then saw the carman back<lb></lb>ing the two horses, pushing them back one in each hand—by the carman I mean the prisoner—he was backing them to get farther off, apparently to draw the waggon into the yard—I then went into my own place—I did not see the accident occur—I heard the waggon move, and then heard some<lb></lb>thing fall; it might be in about a minute or two afterwards—I went out and saw the tree on the ground, in fact two, and under it was a little girl, about thirteen or fourteen years old—after I got the girl out, I saw the de<lb></lb>ceased underneath, and the tree on her head, she was dead—the girl was hurt but very little—the waggon was then in motion, and I did not notice it then—I attended to the tree—I was about six yards from it when I came out of the gateway—I assisted in taking the woman to the workhouse—Bear-lane is a very great thoroughfare for foot passengers—I did not notice where the persons were standing before the accident occurred—when I saw the woman on the ground she was on the pavement, at least there is no pavement, or very little just where she fell, there are two or three very small flags—she was on the footway, and about fifty or sixty yards from the gateway down which the waggon was going.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, living at 34, Gravel-lane. On Thursday, 11th Jan., I went to Mr. Ede's—I arrived there a little before 1 o'clock—the men were then cutting off the limbs of the trees—they were on what is called an expanding trolly—I think there were no chains round the trees at that time—after the limbs were no cut off the trees I spoke to the carman—I should not have recognised the prisoner again as the man—I said to "him, "Young man, which way are you coming in this gateway with this load; because if you are going to turn round, you have very bad ground to go over; and I would recommend you to look at the ground before you start"—he was then under the carriage, and I believe he said, "Oh, I think we shall be all right"—the ground lays considerably on the incline there, and the pavement is in a very bad condition—my fear was, there being very large holes in the pavement, that the trees not being chained, would jolt off—I believe the load was not secured—I went to the back of the carriage and took a second survey of it—I then spoke to the old sawyer who stood there—I do not think the prisoner could hear what I said to him, he was under the carriage—the old sawyer said he thought it would be safe to go over the ground—if the three trees had been bound together by means of a chain and a rope, I do not think they would have fallen off—they were three walnut trees, very crooked—if they had had a binding chain round the carriage, I think they would have been perfectly safe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Ede, of No. 37, Bear-lane. I remember a load of timber coming on 11th Jan.—I cannot say in whose care it was—the prisoner, I believe, drove it—I understood he came from the North Western Railway at Camden-town—there was a book carrier with the prisoner, but whether he was in charge with him I do not know—I should say he was about twenty years of age—I cannot say what his duty was—I never saw either of them before—the waggon was drawn by four horses—there were three walnut-trees on it—it was too wide to admit it into the gateway, and two limbs of the trees were obliged to be cut off to let it in—Bear-lane is a great thoroughfare for foot passengers—I saw the carriage turn to go back into the gateway—I was coming up the yard when he started from the gateway—I had been to put one of the limbs on the pile, and as I was returning he started from the gateway—I did not see him until after he had turned the horses; he was then at the head of the horses, and the carriage was in motion—I saw the underneath tree shift, and in a few seconds it fell, carrying a second one with it—I saw a child entangled underneath one of the trees by its clothes—it had a scratch on the face—whether it was hurt or not I cannot say—I saw a female under the same tree—I assisted in lifting the tree off her—she was totally dead by the time we got the tree off—I dare say the tree weighed from a ton to 30 cwts., as near as I could judge—I did not see how the timber was secured when it arrived—it had arrived there some time previous to my coming to the gate—they were not secured at the time they fell—I did not see any rope or chain belonging to the carriage with the timber—if the trees had been bound together by a chain and rope I should say it would have passed in with safety.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How do you know she is his wife? A. I have since seen her in custody - I knew she passed as his wife at the time; and I have seen him with her - I have known them for three years.</p>

            . I pawned the things in St. Martin's-lane - the prisoner was my master; and his wife sent me to pawn them - he was not at home at the time - I took them at different times - he was never at home when I took them - I pawned them in Mrs. Roy's name.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS JAUNAY re-examined. The handkerchief does not belong to me - this linen belongs to me; the two napkins, table-cloths, and cannon belong to me - these spoons are mine - here is a mark on one of them - I had no conversation with the prisoner about them - I have not seen him since; he was in custody before they were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I do not see a mark on the spoon? A. One mark was put on one by my servant - it had been scratched by the bar-maid - I know the linen perfectly well: there is no mark on it - I do not find any marks - here is one napkin with my name on it; and here are two others with marks - they are marked F. J. - when I first discovered this I had the wife apprehended, as she had the duplicates in her possession.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STONE re-examined. I found the duplicates in a chest of drawers in the kitchen - the prisoner was in custody at the time - Hobbs was with me - it was on the 19th of December.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. I am a policeman - Stone and I went to the prisoner's room together, and asked Mrs. Roy to let us look at the duplicates which we had seen the day before - she said they were in the drawer, all safe - I said nothing to the prisoner about them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>John Rogers, boot-maker, of No. 18, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

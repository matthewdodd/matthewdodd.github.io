            . I am a silversmith, and live at No. 265, Oxford-street. On Monday, the 24th of January, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I bought old silver - I said we did, and he put into my hand two silver bowls of tablespoons - I saw they had been recently broken, and asked him whose they were; he said his own - I said I could not buy them, but must stop them, and he must give me his name and address - I asked his name, and he said Ford; I told him to wait a moment, but he ran out of the shop; on his going out I heard a quantity of silver rattling in his coat pocket - I therefore pursued him, calling "Stop thief!" he took the first turning out of Oxford-street, down two short streets, and was knocked down by a carpenter; I came up to him immediately - I found he had more plate in his pocket, and told the carpenter to hold one pocket; I held the other, and we took him to Mount-street watch-house - he was searched there, and I saw taken from him four more bowls of silver spoons, six handles, and six table-forks of the same pattern; I asked him whose they were: he said they were his father's; I asked if that was his father's crest on them; he said if I would go to his father it would be all right - he then gave me his right name and address, but I could not find his father, as he was from home; I saw his mother: I have kept the two which he offered to me, and the officer has the others - I consider the value of the whole, before the spoons were broken, would be 12l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have they not been used? A. Yes, a considerable time - the value depends on the weight: I am certain they would be worth more than 6l., if not 7l. for melting - I have not weighed them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What would they be worth to sell second-hand whole? A. Any body would give 9l. for them; old silver is worth 5s. an ounce - I weighed the two bowls; they were rather more or less than 2 1/2 ozs. - I think it was more.</p>

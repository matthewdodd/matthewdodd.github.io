As we past by the Prisoner and another, who were leaning against a Post, the Prisoner said to the Deceased, Make haste home, young Man, or your Master will be angry, and won't give you another Holiday to Morrow. The Deceased answered, Suppose I have no Master, and what then? I was afraid of a Quarrel, and desired the Deceased to go along and not mind them. But he said, As I affront nobody, I won't take an Affront from anybody, and I'll revenge my own Cause. This occasioned more Words on both Sides, and I still urged the Deceased to go, but he bid me not be afraid, for he would do no Hurt. By this Time our three Friends were gone a pretty Way forward, but to prevent Mischief I called to them. Mr. Austin cry'd Hoy! and the Deceased cry'd Hoy to him again, and said to the Prisoner, Honesty, I was not alone ; I have got Company. Our Company came back, and Mr. Porter asked what was the Matter? I told him the Prisoner had affronted the Deceased, and he resented it. Upon this some angry Words past between them, and the Prisoner struck Porter in the Face, and the other Man struck the Deceased, and so they fell to fighting. In the Scuffle, the Deceased and the other Man were got on the other Side of the Way. The Prisoner and Porter fell together, and when they got up the Prisoner went off, and Porter staid to look for his Hat and Wig, but I had taken them up. Then the Deceased called to Porter, and said, Jemmy, Jemmy, I am stabb'd. I went over and took hold of him, and he said, That Man has stabb'd me. He did not name what Man, but the Prisoner was nearest him, for the other Man was gone. I called to our Acquaintance; the Prisoner ran; I cry'd Stop him, and they pursued him down Duke-street. I carried the Deceased to an Apothecary's Shop just by; the Apothecary's young Man advised me to go to Mr. Stevens the Surgeon, and coming out, I met a Croud with the Prisoner. - He lived but 21 Hours afterwards.

The Grissel between the Ribs was divided in two Places, the Caul hung out of one, and part of the Guts, as big as my Fist, out of the other: I reduced them. Next Morning, I found he had the Hick-up, from whence I concluded that his Stomach was wounded, and that he would certainly die. I then ask'd him who struck first; and he answer'd, I cannot be certain, the Quarrel was very sudden, and I might strike first.

            . My Master is an Apothecary, and lives in Piccadilly, against my Lord Sunderland's. I heard a great Noise and opened the Door, and saw two Men running a-cross the Way towards me; the foremost, (who I suppose was the Prisoner) was in a light Coat, and the other, (who was the Deceased) was in a dark Coat. I saw the foremost turn short and strike the Deceased in the Side, but I saw no Knife: The Deceased presently cry'd, Jemmy, Jemmy, I am Stuck.

             came over the Way, and brought the Deceased into our Shop; a Puddle of Blood ran from his Side, and I advised her to take him to Mr. Stevens the Surgeon, and so she led him him out; my Master followed them, and brought home this broad Clasp-penknife ; but where it was found, or who gave it him, I cannot tell, nor would the Deceased own it; but it was a little bloody.</p>
               <p>Mr.Powell. The Deceased was my Servant and Nephew, I went to see him abou an Hour before his Death, and ask'd himf he knew me; he said, Yes. You are my Uncle. I ask'd him if he thought he should die; he answered Yes. Then I ask'd him who was the Aggressor; and he said, I never saw the Man in my Life before that Night he Stab'd me, and then I was not engaged with him but with the other: I neither struck him, nor he me, till I received these two Wounds. - Here is his Coat, here is his Waistcoat, and here is his Shirt. These long Cuts on the left Side were made when he received those Wounds.</p>

            , the Deceased and a young Woman came by, and it being Holiday Time, I said, So, young Man, make haste home, or your Master won't let you have another Holiday. Sirrah, says he, I'll let you know that I have no Master; and with that he hip'd to his Company before, and they came back, and all fell upon me and knock'd me down. I got up again and ran away, but they followed me; and if I did this thing it is more than I know; for by the Blows and Bruise I received I was so disordered, that I was not then sensible of what I did, and am not able to give any Account of it now.</p>
               <p>Court. Fox swears that one like you ran cross the Way, and being pursued by the Deceased, turn'd short and gave him a Blow.</p>

I am sure it must he broke; for you might have heard the Sound of the Fall 20 Yards off.</p>

The deceased was my husband—on 30th August, about 7 p. m, he left home—I left home at 9.50 and met him at the Admiral Harvey, near Greenwich Hospital—I was walking home with him about 11.2, accompanied by an uncle and aunt—when we got to the corner of Trafalgar Street and Nelson Street I saw the prisoner and two others—my husband said "Good night" to his uncle and aunt at the comer, and we turned to go down Trafalgar Street, passing quite close to the prisoner, who said something to my husband about a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then seemed to be putting up his hand as if to strike my husband, who put his hand to ward off the blow, and Mason struck at him somewhere in the face, and he fell on the back of his head on the kerb—he came down a most terrific blow, striking his head—he never spoke—he was insensible just as if he were dead—a young man named Knight and another young man assisted to tale him away to the Dreadnought Hospital—he was bleeding a little—I after<lb></lb>wards went in and saw that the doctor had bound up his head with lint—the doctor told me to take him home, lie him on his side, and he would most likely be better in the morning, but if he were not I was to send for a doctor—one of the officials there said he was intoxicated—I took him home, and about 7 a.m. he was taken in a most fearful fit—I was frightened, and sent for Dr. Forsyth, who attended him until he died, on Sep<lb></lb>tember 8th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the Admiral Harvey from 9.50 till nearly 11, but not in my husband's company, I was in a different part of the house—I saw the prisoner with my husband there, but was not near enough to see what passed—they were together for about an hour—I left with my husband at the time the house closed, because four of us went out together—I did not see the prisoner leave—it was only a few minutes' walk from the public-house that he spoke to my husband—prisoner was standing in the roadway and I was walking with my husband, but I did not hear what the prisoner said—I was not noticing where my husband was—I was not between him and the prisoner—my husband and I were side by side; I was nearest to the kerb—I said before the Magistrate, "I was turning away to go on"—that was just after Mason spoke I saw him strike my husband—I said "Some one struck him before the Magistrate, but it was Mason—my husband was not intoxicated.</p>

Strike me?"—Mason ran away; Hollow followed him calling, "Stop thief"—I had been to the Butler Lodge—I did not hear the bet made; it is a large room.</p>

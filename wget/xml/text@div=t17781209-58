             Sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Wandsworth . I came to London by water, on the 10th of November, to see my father and mother. I thought it would be more safe to return by water. After I had spent the day in town, I went to Queen-hithe; I saw the prisoner there with his boat.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any children? - I have four. The prisoner asked me if I was going home; I told him I was going by Westead another <rs id="t17781209-58-deflabel342" type="occupation">waterman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17781209-58-defend688 t17781209-58-deflabel342"></join>. Moody said he had been gone sometime,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090075"></xptr> and therefore I might as well go with him.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I have known him many years. We both lived at Wandsworth .</p>
               <p>Had you ever been with him before? - I have . He told me to go into the house, and he would call me when he was ready. When he was ready to go, I went into the boat; it was then about four o'clock, and was rather dark. The beadle of Fulham went into the boat when I did; he found it cold; he landed by Westminster-bridge, and said he would go by the stage.</p>
               <p>You was then left alone with Moody? - I was. He stopped at the Spread-eagle, at Millbank; he asked me to get out there, which I did. As he was a neighbour, I did not think of any hurt. He called for a pint of hot.</p>
               <p>Did you go into a publick or private room with him? - We sat in the publick room.</p>
               <p>What was the hot made of? - I believe of gin and beer; I did not drink much of it because it is a liquor I do not care for.</p>
               <p>Did he press it upon you? - No. We staid there about half an hour. He stopped at the King's-head, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>What was his behaviour from the time the beadle left the boat till you came to the King's-head, at Chelsea? - Nothing but civility.</p>
               <p>He did not kiss you did he? - Not once. When he stopped at the King's-head, he said he wanted to have a pint of beer. He persuaded me to go out of the boat with him. I had not got my pattens; he said, never mind your pattens; I said I did not choose to leave them in the boat, as I had once lost a pair. We went into the publick bar. He had a pint, but I did not drink of it.</p>
               <p>Did he press you to drink with him? - Yes; he asked me two or three time, but I did not drink any.</p>
               <p>Did you drink any other strong liquor on your passage? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - I was. We got into the boat again. Just before we came to <placeName id="t17781209-58-crimeloc343">Battersea bridge</placeName>

               <p>Are you used to sing? - No. I said, I cannot sing; I am not so light-hearted.</p>
               <p>Did that frighten you? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by not being so light-hearted? - My husband is out of his mind; he has been in the mad-house, and was turned out incurable; it lay on my mind.</p>
               <p>Does he live with you? - No; he is in the work-house. On my saying I was not so light-hearted, he swore if I could not sing I should do the other thing; with that he pulled me down. I cried, for God's sake. -</p>
               <p>Was you in the stern? - Yes. He pulled me down in the bottom of the boat.</p>
               <p>Was there any tilt in the boat? - Yes; it was not up, but was put round my back. He pulled me down. I cried, for God's sake, Moody; upon which he said, if I mentioned his name, or screamed out, he would throw me over.</p>
               <p>Were you near land at this time? - Not to my knowledge. He pulled me down, tilt and all together; the tilt was over me.</p>
               <p>Did he use any violence? - He took hold of me by the hips and pulled me down.</p>
               <p>Did he pull up your petticoats? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you struggle? - I struggled as much as I could do.</p>
               <p>What did he do with his oars at the time? - They were laid down in the boat, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did he penetrate your body? - He did.</p>
               <p>How did he get your thighs open? - By main force. I was in the bottom of the boat; I had no command.</p>
               <p>As the boat must be wavering, how did he keep himself steady upon you? - The boat was to all appearance steady enough; it was a very calm night.</p>
               <p>Then the boat did not shake about in the struggle? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you find any emission from him? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long might he lie with you? - I can't tell how long; it was some minutes to be sure.</p>
               <p>He had the same carnal knowledge of you that your husband has? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you scream out at this time? - I did frequently.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you make all the resistance that was in your power? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you yield to him through fear of being thrown over-board, or by reason of his overpowering<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090076"></xptr> you? - With my struggling, I was almost gone.</p>
               <p>What did he then do? - After it was over, I set myself up, and said, Moody, I will expose you to every body I know.</p>
               <p>Did he throw by his oars when he first began to attack you? - He never rowed afterwards till he had laid with me.</p>
               <p>Which way was the tide going? - To Wandsworth .</p>
               <p>Did you receive any bruises from him in the struggle? - Only on my shoulder that went off.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you told him you would expose him? - He swore he did not mind being exposed.</p>
               <p>Did he row on quietly after that to Wandsworth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he carnal knowledge of you after that? - No.</p>
               <p>When the boat came on shore at Wandsworth, was there anybody on the causeway? - Only a little boy.</p>
               <p>Is Moody a married man? - Yes; his wife lay-in at the time.</p>
               <p>What passed when Moody came to the shore? - He said to the boy, pull the boat in. I took a shilling out of my pocket, and said, Moody, pay yourself. He made answer, the woman is a fool, and swore, and said I paid him once before; I said I had not. He would not take the money.</p>
               <p>In what kind of way did you part? - He said the woman is a fool; she paid me before; I said I had not, that was every word that passed. I immediately went away. I went directly to my own brother's, Mr. Fermage's; I knocked at the door; Mrs. Fermage let me into the shop; it was then about half after seven o'clock. I related to my sister how I had been used.</p>
               <p>Did you relate it of your own accord, or did she take any notice of your having been tumbled? - When I went in I was full of tears; I could hardly speak. She asked me what was the matter? She took me into another room, because my brother was in the shop, and I told her how I had been used; after that, my brother was acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner? - The day after; that and the following day I was in London, and the next day they said he was off.</p>
               <p>What was the occasion of your coming to London? - I came for a warrant. I first went to the Rotation at the Swan tavern in the Borough; they said it was the wrong side of the water, and they sent me to Sir

               <p>What day was he taken up? - I cannot tell the day of the month. It was better than a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Had you a warrant on the 12th? - Yes. Enquiry was made after him, and he was gone away.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts was the boat when he made the first attack upon you? - On the Chelsea side near Batersea bridge .</p>
               <p>Was you near the shore? - In the middle of the stream.</p>
               <p>He pulled you down before you came to the bridge? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you know the man in the barge? - I did not at first know him, but we knew one another afterwards.</p>

She appeared to have been very much tumbled and mousled about, and she appeared to be very much agitated in her mind. I asked her what was the matter several times before she told me. We were then in the shop, and my husband and a little boy were likewise in the shop. I took a candle and lit Mrs. Bethell into another room. I did not know what to think; I knew she had been to see her brother, and I imagined her brother was dead, seeing her in such confusion. When we got into the other room and had sat down, I asked her what was the matter; she said she had been used very ill by

               <p>Did she go into any fit? - To all outward appearance she must have been in a sit in the boat, for her face and cap were stained as if she had been fetched to with water.</p>
               <p>She had no sit in your house? - No; none at all. As soon as she had related the case to me I sent for her father, and I acquainted my husband with it. When her father came, my husband told him that

My son came to me, and said, Sal is in a terrible condition. I went to my daughter; I saw her in a terrible condition, which struck me very much indeed. She said, Moody had used her very ill. I said I will make him suffer for it as sure as he is born; he shall have what the law directs. I went to the Rotation at St. Margaret's-hill the next morning. As I was going by my son's house, at about nine in the morning, Moody came out, and said, for God's sake have compassion upon me! consider my wife and children. I told him he should have what the law would allow him. My daughter and I went to the Rotation in the Borough. One of the clerks asked her which side of the water she was on; she said she was sure it was the Chelsea side. They said they could not grant a warrant, we must go to Sir

               <p>I keep the King's-Head at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prosecutrix and the prisoner drinking at your house on the 10th of November? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection whether she drank with him, or no? - She did. I sat close by her.</p>
               <p>Were they apparently upon good terms? - Very agreeable.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the expression she made use of when she asked him to go? - She said, Mr. Moody, will you go; he replied yes, my dear, I will directly. The pint was three parts empty; he drank up what remained, and they went out of the door arm in arm.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from the bridge? - Hardly so much as an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Court. What had they? - He had one pint or two, I cannot rightly say which. She asked after some person in Chelsea; I do not know who. Some of the men in the taproom said the person lived in London.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she drank of the porter, or only put her lips to the pot? - I cannot say whether she drank, or not. I saw her put the pot to her mouth.</p>
               <p>Did any thing familiar or indecent pass between them? - They were very agreeable; they seemed very sociable together.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is the King's-Head near Mr. Milward's brewhouse? - Close by it, on this side the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Jury. That is then above an hundred yards from the bridge? - When it is low water, from our causeway to the bridge, I believe it is not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any of the conversation that passed between them? - I cannot say. I was in and out of the tap-room; but when they went out, some of the men wished them good luck, because they saw them very sociable together.</p>
               <p>Were the men who wished them good luck in the room and heard their conversation? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. When you say they were very agreeble with each other; do you mean to convey an idea of any particular familiarity? - I was backwards and forwards in my business. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the prosecutrix? - No. She never was in my house before as I know of.</p>
               <p>Does the prisoner often use your house? - Yes; he plies at our stairs, when he comes there and wants a fare. He called at our house on the Friday, after the rape was committed; he asked me if I recollected his calling there on the Tuesday; I said I did. He had a man went in his boat from our house that night.</p>
               <p>A WATERMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>You was upon the river in the evening of the 10th of November last? - I was. Moody came within four or five boats length of me, between six and seven o'clock; he was very merry; he was singing. That was near the Two Blue Posts, at Chelsea. It was after he had been at the King's-Head.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body scream out or make a noise? - No.</p>
               <p>If there had been any noise, must you have heard it? - I must, for I had an old woman in my boat that must take me a minute landing. I put off directly, and neither I nor my passenger heard any noise. I went directly to Wandsworth .</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090081"></xptr>How far is the King's-Head from the Two Blue Posts? - I imagine about forty yards. They passed me at forty or fifty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had lain a quarter of an hour upon his oars must not you have passed him? - I must have run upon him.</p>
               <p>Was there time for a man to lie upon his oars a quarter of an hour? - He could not be got fifty boats length a-head of me when I put off.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What distance is the Two Blue Posts from the bridge? - A hundred yards, or better.</p>
               <p>Is it not 500? - I cannot say; I speak to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When you first saw Moody, was he on his passage? - He was rowing, and somebody was sitting upright at his backboard; I cannot tell whether a man or woman. He passed by my boat as I was landing; I never overtook him.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose he had left his boat to be driven by the tide, would he have got through Battersea-bridge before you? - No; I must have been through first if he had lain on his skulls.</p>
               <p>How long would the tide have been carrying him up from the King's-head to Battersea-bridge, if he had not rowed a yard. - It might take five minutes from the Two Blue Posts where I was.</p>

               <p>Did you hear a screaming, or outcry, or any noise made by a woman? - None at all.</p>
               <p>If the prisoner had rowed; he must have got through the bridge before you quitted your boat? - Yes; he might have rowed through bridge in two minutes and a half with pleasure.</p>
               <p>Was it a still night? - The wind was rather in my favour, if there had been any noise, to have heard it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you in the King's-Head while they were there? - Yes; when they came in and when they went out.</p>

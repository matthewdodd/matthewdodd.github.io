On the 10th of September, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; Rabbitts first came into the shop, and enquired of me to look at a silver watch, which he pointed out, I am confident he is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody in the shop besides yourself? - No one but myself; he begged to look at a four pounds silver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040052"></xptr>watch, which I took down and shewed him; while I was waiting with him for this watch Brown came in, and requested to look at a chain, I begged him to stop a little, being engaged with this Rabbitts; while Brown was in the shop and Rabbitts was looking at the watch, Beazley came into the shop to enquire of me where one Simpson lived, with a loose great coat over his arm; there is such a person lives in the neighbourhood, and I directed him accordingly; Rabbitts disapproved of the watch; I offered to get him another, I proceeded to get him one that was half a guinea more; while I was procuring this watch, Beazley went away; I brought one back with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave your shop? - Part of my body being in the case to get the watch, the major part of the shop was hid from my view. I got it out of the front case of the window. Beazley in consequence of my information, left the shop while I was getting the other watch; when I had drawn my body back from the case Beazley was gone; on offering Rabbitts the watch of half a guinea more he disapproved of it on account of its price, and wished me a good morning; he refused it; I put both the watches into the case.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you shew him in all? - Two; one which he pointed out to me, and one of half a guinea more. The person Driscoll came in immediately on his going out, Driscoll came in and enquired of me if I had got the silver watch which he begged of me to get a fortnight ago; he did not come in till after the other two were gone. I recollected Driscoll's enquiring of me about a watch of that nature, and I told him I had not been able to get him one; and I was then proceeding round the other side of the shop where the small case with watches flood, to shew Brown a chain, who had been waiting all the while in the shop; I then missed this small case of watches, while Brown and Driscoll were there together; it was a wainscot case glaized, I suppose worth seven or eight shillings, there were watches in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the watches in the indictment in it? - There were about seven identified, but there were supposed to be others.</p>
               <p>Q. Some are laid to be your property, and some the property of Coward? - Only one my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the one of your property in this wooden case? - Yes, and six of Mr. Coward's.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not something else? - Yes, there is a watch chain and seals. I made known my loss to these two men, and I enquired of Brown if he saw Beazley take out any thing in his great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there were more things in this case than these seven? - I do not; I know there were seven, that I can swear to; how many more I know not. I asked Brown if he observed the man take any thing with his blue great coat? he told me no; he asked me what I had lost?</p>
               <p>Q. Which man did you refer to? - To Beazley. On which I told him I had lost a case with a few watches; which immediately brought on a conversation, which I was surprized at; Brown and Driscoll enquiring of me the particulars; they sympathized with me, and after some little conversation Driscoll went away, and Brown remained to be shewn the chain; Brown remained and I shewed him the chain; he bought one of the value of half a crown; I gave him change for half a guinea, and he went immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of your property? - No, never at all</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had seen Driscoll before? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040053"></xptr>Q. Do you mean to speak for certainty as to Rabbitts, Beazley, and Brown? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Rabbitts before? - No, not before he came into the shop.</p>


               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Beazley before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor had you ever seen Brown? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively to their persons? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they be altogether with you? - I suppose the whole was compleated in less than a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see either of the prisoners, and where? - Not till I was desired to attend at Bow-street, about a month afterwards, I attended there in consequence of being sent for; I was informed that the prisoners were in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you see? did you see the three prisoners and Driscoll? - No, not first of all. I went there about this robbery, after waiting some time I informed Mr. Addington of my business; he then ordered the three, Driscoll and the other two, Brown and Beazley, to be brought up; they were brought into the sitting room at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the room besides him? did you know all the officers? - Not any of them, Mr. Addington took me on one side and made me point out who they were; I did not know the others were officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these people? were they in irons? - They were</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean to ask you this question, before you know them at all, did you know before you made up your mind about it, that they had irons? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known them by their faces any where, if you had not met them in that place? - I believe fully if I had met them in the street I should have known every one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give evidence against them before the magistrate? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were committed? - I conceived they were, I informed the magistrate the particulars that I have told your Lordship; Rabbitts I saw the second time, I am not sure whether it was the second or third.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - I see him at Bow street in the sitting room, the room was full and the other prisoners with him, two, if not three, I believe it was only Beazley and Brown, many people were there, at first I did not particularly recollect him, I did not that day, I was not perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any idea at all that he was the person? - I had an idea that he was, but I was not certain, the second time that I saw Rabbitts, it was that Rabbitts had his hearing, I saw them in the same room, the sitting room, Beazley and Brown were there; on examining further that time I had no doubts remaining in my own mind, but he was the person that had first come into the shop when I was robbed; I told Mr. Addington that I believed it was the same man and could be positive; first of all I was doubtful, the first time, but at the second time I told him I could have no doubt about the man, from his size and features, which I described before; I accordingly swore to him. That is the whole of my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Driscoll brought up that night? - No, he was not, I do not remember seeing him till the fourth examination I was informed that he was admitted a King's evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You had never seen Rabbitts before? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040054"></xptr>Q. And you had never seen the person that you supposed to be Rabbitts till he was taken up at Bow street? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. That I believe was the 21st of October? - I believe it may.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, I ask you this, Rabbitts there was brought up in irons, was not be? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - No, I have nor.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the chains I dare say rattle? - I not only heard them, but I saw they were hand cuffed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then being brought up in chains and hand cuffed, you had no doubt when he first presented himself that he was a suspected person; and yet though you saw him in chains, and though you saw him hand cuffed, you was asked to determine whether he was the man that had done you this injury? - I was, the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the first time that you saw him being desired to answer on your oath, you looked very attentively at him, it was your duty so to do? - I looked at him, but not attentively, there was no oath put till the second time, I was sworn the first time with respect to the three, but not with respect to Rabbitts; Mr. Addington he asked me, do you know him? I said, I do not immediately recollect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Addington informed you that he was a person taken up on suspicion for your robbery, and though you was asked whether he was one of the persons, you could not immediately recollect him? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time that a person fees another is the time that he is called upon to recollect him? - I told him that I had not many doubts, but I could not be positive. My reason for saying that was I would not take my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. A very good one too, because no man will take his oath of what he does not believe to be true. If it had been true that you had been certain, you would have taken your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first time when brought up in chains you would not fix on him then; you have never found any of your property again? - Nothing at all that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you now only speak from the recollection of a man which you had not seen for a month? - The second time I was confident.</p>
               <p>Q. There is only this recollection of your's as to his person, that is to decide whether this man is to die for this offence or not.</p>

Rabbitts went in, after Rabbitts went in we desired Bartlett to go in and ask for a chain; Beazley took the opportunity of going in afterwards to ask for a fictious name where a person lived; Beazley informed me before he went in that he would ask for a person of the name of Simpson, whether the person in the shop could inform him where he lived; Beazley went in and asked for that name, I was at that time out of the shop, I saw him throw his coat down as it were on the counter, the gentleman of the shop being engaged; it was a blue bath great coat, a rough kind of a coat; but instead of throwing it on the counter, I see him throw it over the small glass case that lay on the counter; I was standing at the glass window that was in the door, I saw him coming out of the shop with the glass case under his coat, as he came out of the door I went in; I asked the gentleman of the shop whether he had that watch that I spoke to him about some time before, about a week before; he being busy with Rabbitts, to shew him a watch, and in agitation to shew Bartlett a chain the gentleman did not make me an immediate answer to what I asked; Rabbitts disapproved of the watch and made some kind of excuse that it did not suit him, and walked out of the shop; Rabbitts going out disapproving of the watch, he went round the counter to shew Bartlett a chain, then there was only Bartlett present, and me, and as he came round to the opposite side of the shop across the counter he missed the watch case and watches, the gentleman of the shop immediately says, good God, did you see any body go out of the shop with any thing? he said that to Bartlett and me; he seemed to press us both with the question; we always answered no, we had seen nothing; I said when I came into the shop there was only a little man asking the price of a watch, and this man here, pointing to Bartlett, I was apprehensive at the time that he would stop me on the account, and so I made an idle excuse, the gentleman said it was very extroadinary, it was there a little time before, a person came down stairs he asked him if he knew any thing about it? he said no, he knew nothing at all about it; I then brought it out about the watch that I had spoke about some time before, in order for an excuse that I might get away without any suspicion, he said, he had not got it, and if I would call again he would see about it. Bartlett stopped afterwards, and when I saw him again he told me that he bought a chain which he gave half a crown for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have been in the medical line it seems, it is a great pity that some time ago you was not in the Sheriffs line, it would have held you a great deal faster, you have just escaped that rope that they hang convicted men in? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that you have saved yourself from hanging by these confessions? - I harbour this opinion in my own breast. I was informed that if I gave up the right parties that I was concerned with, I should save my life and be useful to the public.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there is a more notorious thief than yourself for this year and a half past, we will try your modesty? - Yes, I do think there is. I am an unfortunate young man, I have been seduced by the greatest villains in this kingdom.</p>
               <p>Q. You left your place a year and a half ago, for what honest trick did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040056"></xptr>leave your place? - Through running in debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as soon as you came to London you commenced thief? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you commence thief when you came to London? - No, I did not immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in London before you began thieving, on your oath? - I cannot justly determine that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons have you knocked down since you was in London? - I don't know I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. I will begin first of all with a small number, we will put it down at thirty. How many more than thirty? - I don't know that I have done it to so many.</p>
               <p>Q. Poor Mr. Eaton who lost his life was not he knocked down by you? - I do declare that I was not the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Woodcock you knocked down who was afterwards robbed? On your oath did not you knock down Mr. Woodcock?</p>
               <p>Court. That is going into particulars not relative to this trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I would ask you how many robberies do you think you have commited within this year and a half? - I have never minuted down what robberies I have been concerned in.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have you or have you not minuted down the robberies that you have committed? - Every robbery that I have recollected since the commencement of my trouble, I have minuted them down.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath how many have you committed as you have minuted them down? - I cannot tell the number.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you lived as a common thief? - It may be two years; I am an unfortunate man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you that book with you in which you have minuted these robberies? - I have got it about me(produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Here are only the heads I perceive it is going on I suppose like the gentleman's magazine? Then we are to depend on such a character as Mr. Driscoll for the veracity of what you say or not? - No, I would not have you depend on me, but on the facts which the other witnesses prove.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or do you not know the circumstances attending this robbery? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is in your power to fix them on what persons you please? - No, it is not in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not in your power to commit perjury? - I should be sorry to commit perjury.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your sorrow commence when your friend Randall died at the last Sessions?</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. At the end of this transaction do you reccollect any man coming down stairs at your shop? - Yes, there was a man came down stairs during the end of this transaction, he was an upholder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown to Smith. Up at Bow-street when we were doubled ironed and hand cuffed together this gentleman was brought forth, he told me he was persuaded to swear positive to us by the evidence, Daniel Driscoll.</p>
               <p>Smith. I had no conversation with Driscoll about this man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the impression of your mind that they were the persons, from any conversation you had with Driscoll? - Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. He swore to a watch chain taken out of my pocket by Mr. Miller, the first time, and afterwards he did not.</p>
               <p>Smith. The first time I said when it was handed up to me, that I believed it was the one I sold him, then afterwards the second time I said, as I was not positive I would not say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Middle-row, St. Giles's; I am a rope maker and flax dresser. I have known Rabbitts from a child, I knew his father. His father was a wheelwright; I always understood that he learned that trade under his father. His father died when he was young, and bequeathed him about 1000l. after that, he lived with his brother on his means.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown to Driscoll. In the first place, consider my life is at stake, will you positively swear, and take upon yourself to say, that I was the person that was in the shop? - I will. He was the very identical person that asked for the chain, I am very positive of it, I saw him. I would not say any thing that was wrong.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. In the second place, you would wish to save your own life, and to hang us; though you wish to save your own life, do not swear false; God forgive you.</p>
               <p>Driscoll. God forgive you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. I was dragged away, and had not money to employ counsel, or any thing; and that man that stands there, he knows, that I am innocent of the very charge that he lays against me.</p>

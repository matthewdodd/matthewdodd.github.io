               <p>Q. What had he with him? - A. A bundle of paper upon his shoulder; directly he got out of the market and came into Lime-street, he wanted me to take the paper from him; I said the paper was too heavy for me, I could not carry it; then he desired me to tell my master that he stopped a man in the market, and took it from the man for me; he came home with me, and went up stairs to his work, and before I could get an opportunity to tell my master, the servant called my master down stairs, and told him. (The paper produced.)</p>

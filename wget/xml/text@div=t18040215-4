             sworn. - Q. Did any thing happen to you on the 23d of January? - A. I was in company with a lady, walking over Canonbury-fields, about three o'clock in the afternoon, towards London. I was stopped by a man masked; it was a brown paper mask; there was one eye appeared through it. He was alone, on foot; he had a brown common coat on, and a silk handkerchief round his neck, and a dirty linen apron on. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150005"></xptr>saw his knife tucked in his apron-string; he presented the knife to us, and demanded my purse. He told us, if we were not quick, he would cut us to pieces. I gave him my purse; it contained about 12 s. and a seven-shilling piece. He told us to walk on, and go back, when we gave him our purse. We went back towards Canonbury-house; he went towards Islington. I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the mask on his face all the time? - A. Yes, all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I need not ask you whether you could swear to him? - A. Impossible.</p>

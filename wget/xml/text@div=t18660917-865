On 27th August I was in the Wal<lb></lb>worth Road—a woman made a communication to me, and pointed out the prisoners, who were talking together—the male prisoner crossed Walworth Road, and went past Messrs. Penston's shop—the female went in the opposite direction—the male prisoner afterwards returned, looked into Messrs. Penston's shop, crossed the road again, and went into a draper's shop—he then went back up to Messrs. Penston's, went in, and purchased something—I saw Masland give him change—my brother constable went in, and I followed the man when he came out, and saw him go across the Walworth Road and join the female prisoner—I went up to him, and saw this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his right hand—I took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. coppers from him, and found in his breast pocket a purse con<lb></lb>taining one half-crown, three florins, and seven shillings, and in his waist-coat pocket 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I also found on him a new knife, a chain and flash cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

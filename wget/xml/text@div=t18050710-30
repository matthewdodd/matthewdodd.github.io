               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Rogers and other officers against the prisoner? - A. Yes; on the 12th of June I informed them of it, and on the 13th I went to make a purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to? - A. I went to the Jacob's Well, Barbican; the prisoner lived in <placeName id="t18050710-30-crimeloc174">Paul's Alley, Cripplegate</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at home? - A. Not when I first went in, his wife then said he would be in in a few minutes; I found him at home on Thursday morning the 13th of June, about nine o'clock; I asked him if he had got any of these things; he knew what I meant; he asked me whether I wanted any half bulls, as he called them.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew what half bulls meant? - A. Yes, bad half crowns; he asked me how many I wanted; I told him I had only cash for a couple at present, which is two shillings worth; I asked him if I could have any more if I called the next day; he said I might have what I liked; I appointed to meet him on Friday the 14th, at two o'clock; I went, and he was not at home, his wife told me if I came at three o'clock I should find him at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to the next morning? - A. I went and communicated this to the officers; and we appointed to meet at the Castle at Moorgate the next morning, the 15th, between eight and nine o'clock; there Mr. Rogers gave me half a guinea, it was in a seven shilling piece, and 3 s. 6 d. in silver; Mr. Rogers marked them in the presence of me, Brown, Oliver, and Mr. Clark; he gave them me, and I put them in my pocket, I had no more money about me; then I went to Bray's in Paul's alley, about nine o'clock, the officers waited at the bottom of the alley; I went into Bray's, he asked me how many I wanted, I told him I would have half a score, with that I gave him a 7 s. piece and 3 s. for them; he pulled them out of his left hand breeches pocket, they were wrapped up in paper with a great many more, but how many I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There were many more than what you bought? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. After he had given you the ten bad half crowns, what did he do with the remainder? - A. He wrapped them up, and put them into his pocket again; then when I had done that, I came out; I was to give a signal to the officers, which I did, and we returned into the house immediately; I went in first to make some apology, and Brown came in directly, and laid hold of Bray, the other officers came in, and they searched him and the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ten half crowns that you had bought? - A. The City Marshal found them in my hand, and took them from me in Bray's house; I told him that I had them from that man pointing to Bray.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were bargaining with the prisoner, was there any other man in the shop? - A. There was a man a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation about that man? - A. I told him, when he was getting the things for me, that that man took notice; he said, never mind, he is up, meaning that he knew what business he carried on.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that Clark took the half crowns from you, what became of the marked sixpence? - A. I had it then in my pocket, they searched me, and I believe Mr. Rogers, one of the officers, took it from me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What shop does the prisoner keep? - A. It is a kind of a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is it not a green grocer's shop? - A. No; they do not sell greens, they sell bread and butter, and things of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Your name is Coleman; the prisoner keeps this chandler's shop - how long have you been acquainted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100047"></xptr>with Bray? - A. About a twelvemonth or more.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, entirely for the sake of public justice, you went to make this purchase, you had no other motive in view, you meant to discover his abomination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A wire-drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. They tell me that is a very good trade? - A. Yes, but when it is flat.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean now it is a bad business with you, I call this wire-drawing; you never served your apprenticeship to wire-drawing? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When have you worked at this trade? - A. A good many years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you worked at wire-drawing within a month past? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. No. 1, Steward's rents, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the master that employed you in the month past? - A. Mr. Brown, in Love-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. He has the misfortune to have your assistance in the wire-drawing way - how long have you got your livelihood by working for him? - A. I do not get my livelihood by working for him; as I am a working man, I work at what I can get, sometimes I work at my own country business making of lace.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since you yourself were taken up for smashing, for putting off bad money? - A. I was once taken up about a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since you were taken up before this? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to get out of prison because of this prosecution? - A. I was ashamed entirely of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was doing the public more justice in this way? - A. I thought it was a blackguard and scandalous thing; I got out of prison without this.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in prison for smashing? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said there was a person in the shop at the time you were buying this bad money? - A. There was, and I asked him if he had any of those things, he knew very well what I meant, he said I might have what I liked.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid him how much? - A. Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. And that person was a stranger to you? - A. He came to me on one side of the shop and asked me in a whispering manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell us that when my friend asked the question: then he was attracted by your pretty face, he came round the counter and spoke to you, and then you asked him for those things, you are sure that was your expression; now attend to me, sir, I ask you, upon your oath, did you not ask him for those things which you had left with him yesterday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you, upon your oath did not you say to the prisoner, I will thank you to give me those things I left here yesterday? - A. It is wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to persist in that answer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been to the man's shop the day before? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You had bought the two half bulls the day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had committed an offence the day before, why was it necessary to lead him into another offence the next day, if you wanted to do it for the benefit of the public? - A. I was but one, and that was not sufficient evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, you mean to say your evidence nobody would believe? - A. I had no marked money to correspond.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you been in prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been dismissed from prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you dismissed from prison before you charged the prisoner with this, and before you charged two women? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you gave information of any body else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you at large now? - A. There was no bill found against me.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been in prison? - A. Never but that once in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. That was for smashing, and that was the only time you have been charged by any body; do you know Mr. Turner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever taken up upon any charge of robbing him - whether you have not been in custody before you have said you have not; I ask you, were you not in prison upon a charge of robbing Mr. Turner of Little-Britain? - A. I was a month.</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer of Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the money was marked? - A. I was at the Castle at Moorgate; I saw Mr. Rogers mark the money, he gave it to Coleman; upon Coleman giving the signal, I followed him immediately; I saw Bray behind the counter in his shirt sleeves, I immediately laid hold of him by both of his arms; Mr. Clark came in immediately after me, and when Mr. Rogers came in, I brought him from behind the counter, and Mr. Rogers searched him; I saw him find in his breeches pocket twenty-four counterfeit half-crowns in paper, and in his waistcoat pocket he found a counterfeit half-crown and a counterfeit dollar; he found a seven shilling piece marked on Bray, and three marked shillings; Mr. Clark searched Coleman, and he found ten counterfeit half-crowns; Mr. Rogers searched Coleman further, and took from him the marked sixpence which had been given to him before; then Mr. Bray mentioned some circumstance, and said the old b - r had done him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope this conspiracy will come out before you go out of Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100048"></xptr>Court. Yes.</p>
               <p>Brown. We then sent Oliver away with Coleman; Mr. Clarke, Rogers, and I went with Bray to the Compter, and as we were going in the coach, Bray said, that old rascal knew where he had them from as well as he did; that they came from Birmingham, and the value of them was no more than threepence a-piece, but before he would tell who it was, he would be hanged himself; I searched Bray's house, and upon one of the shelves I found this melting-pot.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You might find more very often.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is a crucible? - A. (Brown.) Yes, he said he did a little in that. It is plate melted; I fancy that he meant he was a fence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. A fence is a cant term for receiving stolen property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner said he had done a little in that way, you have given us the interpretation, that he was a receiver of stolen things; who was in the coach with you? - A. Mr. Clark and the other officers.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was foolish enough or led away by your appearance, to tell you that he did a little in that, meaning, that he was a receiver of stolen goods; and that they came from Birmingham, and he would be hanged before he would tell who the person was he had them from? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was all voluntary on his part? - A. Yes; and he said he could not have more than a twelvemonth for it; he knew his punishment.</p>
               <p>- CLARK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer of the City - Did you go with the other officers to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes; I searched Coleman, I took from him ten half-crowns and a sixpence; I produce them; I saw Rogers take the money from Bray.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the last witness Brown, with Bray to the Compter? - A. I did; he said he had purchased these articles from Birmingham, and he had charged a shilling a-piece to Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing else that Bray said? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I have the same opinion of you as I always had - You do not mean to put any false colouring upon this business; I understood you to say you never heard him say he would lose his life before he would tell who was the manufacturer? - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard Brown swear it by wholesale? - A. He did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then now you and I a little differ - You recollect it now I put it in your mouth? - A. I did not recollect it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that coat on when you took him in custody? - A. No; if I came after you I should not have it on; I knew him twenty years ago.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer; I marked a seven-shilling piece, three shillings in silver and sixpence, at the Castle, in Moorgate; upon the signal being given by Coleman, I went into Bray's house; Brown was close by Bray.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Bray before? - A. I had heard of him; I searched Bray's pocket, I found, I think, twenty-four pieces resembling the half-crowns that Coleman had shewed me before, they were folded up in paper so as not to work off the colour; I found this dollar; he said, it is good; I think it is counterfeit, and this sixpence which I believe is good; when I made further search, I found a seven-shilling piece, and three shillings of the money in his pocket which I had actually marked at the Castle, at Moorgate; I said to Coleman, you have not given me all the marked money; said he, I have not given you the sixpence; I told him to give it to Mr. Clark; I looked at it and found it was the same sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Bray say any thing? - A. Bray said, the old b - y rogue had done him; I went into the coach with him to the Compter, and Oliver went with Bray; I produce the whole of the counterfeit money and the marked money; I marked the money in the presence of all the officers; (the marked money identified by Rogers, and shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You, sir, are employed by the Mint; I will give you first the ten half-crowns that were found on Coleman - Are they all counterfeit? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they correspond with each other? - A. They are of two dies, six of one die and four of another, they certainly correspond with each other.</p>
               <p>Q. Now have the goodness to look at these, these are the twenty-four that were found on Bray, and the dollar? - A. These half-crowns are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there of them? - A. Thirty half crowns, they are all counterfeit, of the same dies as the other, and the dollar is a bad one.</p>

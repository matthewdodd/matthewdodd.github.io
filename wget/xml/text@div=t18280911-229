            . I am the prosecutor's brother, and was working in the house. On Saturday, the 28th of June, I saw the prisoner in Sun-street, Bishopsgate, with my brother's coat on; I spoke to him for some minutes, and a person came by - I collared him, and asked that person to assist me; the prisoner said it was all nonsense - we had a scuffle, and he ran away; I pursued, and cried Stop thief! he was taken by Sapwell.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the 27th of June, come out of that house with a flag basket and a bundle; he hung the basket on the pales, and then got over and took it away; I believe the workmen were gone to dinner - it was between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

On Saturday, the 28th of June, I was at tea, between four and five o'clock; I went out, and saw the prisoner running down Lamb-alley - I pursued, and took him; Robert Fish came up, and said he had got his brother's coat on; I said, "How do you know it is your brother's?" he said, "If you look on the right shoulder you will see it is sewed, which it is; the prisoner said he bought it in Petticoat-lane.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from the Londondocks, and went to Petticoat-lane; I bought this coat, and exchanged my own old one; I then went up Sun-street, and stopped Robert Fish; I talked to him a little while, when he said I had got his brother's coat on; I said it was all nonsense, and walked away - he called Stop thief! and I ran, not wishing to be locked up all day on Sunday.</p>

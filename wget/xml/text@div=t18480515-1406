                  </hi> I am a private in the Royal Marines, at Woolwich The prisoner was a private in the same company. On 11th March, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I went into the kitchen to dry my towel, and he accused me of having taken his stock and handkerchief, which he had lost—I denied it, and said I had not seen them—he directly struck me with his fist—I struck him again—there was a blow or two between us, and he took up a knife which was lying on the dresser and stabbed at me three or four times at the bosom—it did not wound me—it was blunt—a young man took it away from him—the prisoner then made a rush at me, and we fell, I undermost—he knelt on my breast, took a uniform knife and stabbed me in several places on my head and face—the knife is not here, but here is one of the same sort—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—each man in the company has one severed out to him—I lost a good deal of blood—I was taken to the hospital, and was there six weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He came behind me and struck me in the ear; I had the knife in my hand, and just struck him across the nose with the handle of it; he fell against the dresser, and the dishes fell and cut him; his evidence is a spite for reporting him to the sergeant of the guard, for stealing some money from an Irishman. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not see whether the knife was open or shut—I did not fall against any dishes.</p>

                  </hi> I am a private in the marines. I heard the prisoner accuse Sutton of stealing his stock and handkerchief—Sutton denied it, and the prisoner immediately, struck him with his fist—he had nothing in his hand then—they struggled, and the prisoner seized a knife from the dresser, caught Sutton round the waist, and tried to stab him in the bowels several times—my fellow-cook took the knife out of his hand in a moment or two—the pri<lb></lb>soner rushed at Sutton again, and took a uniform knife from his trowsers<lb></lb>pocket—they both fell, Sutton being undermost—the prisoner knelt on Sutton's breast, and kept <hi rend="italic">jobbing</hi> him on the head and face with the knife—it was shut—Sutton bled so that he could not see—I helped to take him away—I told the prisoner he had a knife in his hand—he made no answer, but tried to put it into his pocket—I caught hold of it and took it away from him.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant-surgeon at the Royal Marine Hospital, Woolwich. Sutton was bought there, bleeding from two trifling wounds in the head—they might either have been produced by a fall, or by coming in contact with anything sharp—the edges of such a knife as that produced would very likely produce them.</p>

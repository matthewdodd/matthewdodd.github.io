I then gave the constable charge of him; he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same dollars you had marked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been with you? - A. Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he behaved himself? - A. He had behaved himself well all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any relations? - A. He had only a mother; I had him from a person who said he was a very good lad.</p>
               <p>JOHN OSBORNE sworn. - I am a constable: I work for Mr. Adams. On the 10th of October Mr. Adams called me out of the shop into the accompting-house, about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You took charge of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I searched him and found no property about him except a shilling; Mr. Adams was very positive in his mind that he had robbed him; after some conversation with him for about ten minutes, he confessed; he said he would go up stairs and shew me where the dollars were; directly he got up stairs he put his hand and took out six dollars from the unburnt dirt lying there, and put them into my hand; and then, at a yard's distance, he took out two keys from the further end of the dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what these keys were for? - A. No; they were keys of the box where the dollars were in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, James Richard Stedman, in Mile End Old Town, Stepney. On Tuesday, the 30th of May, I went to an empty house of his opposite ours, which was under repair, and missed two short Venetian blinds, and one long one, from the parlour window—I was there before on the Saturday—they were then safe, and fixed with screws to the window.</p>

On Friday night, the 30th of May, I was in the tap-room, between six and seven o'clock—the prisoner came in and asked for a man named Taylor—the reply was he was not there—he then went over to an empty house belonging to Mr. Stedman, which was under repair—I saw him go in at the front entrance, and come out at the back, in about half an hour, with the blinds under his arm, and a flannel jacket wrapped round them—I said, "Halloo, old <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>"—he said, "I am waiting for the master"—I went and got my supper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grave-digger of Stepney, and lodge at the World's-end. On the 30th of May I saw the prisoner enter the prosecutor's premises, after the men had done work—after that Symons told me something—I went to Mr. Porcas, and he sent his boy to Mr. Stedman's—I afterwards saw the prisoner on Mr. Stedman's premises—they are empty houses—I went in at a front entrance, with Mr. Porcas, and found the prisoner in one of the up-stairs rooms—I asked what business he had there—he said he was placed there by Mr. Searl, the master, to watch the premises—I asked if he was going to stop all night—he said he did not know that he should—I asked how the back gate came open—he said he did not know—he came down then directly, and we went out-he fastened the door-I went to the house again Mr. Stedman, and searched round the premises with a light, and there was no one there—the prisoner could not have got out of the back entrance—he must have come out at the front.</p>

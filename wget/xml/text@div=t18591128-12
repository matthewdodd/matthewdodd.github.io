I am a clerk in the London joint stock Bank—on 15th October this order was produced to me; I believe not by the prisoner—Mr. Groom, whose name purports to be signed to it, had an account with us—in consequence of that request I gave a cheque-book to the person, and he signed the name of Roberts to our book—this is the cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

I am an insurance agent, 9, Lime-street—the prisoner was formerly in my service as clerk for about two years—he left me about four years ago—while he was with me I banked at the London Joint-stock Bank, as I do now—the prisoner was aware of that—he was in the habit of going to the bank for me—I never gave him or any one else authority to present this request—I do not know whose writing it is—it is different to the hand that the prisoner used to write while with me—I have never seen this cheque-book.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 20.) On 8th November I went to Little George-street, Hampstead-road—I saw the prisoner come out of a house there—I followed and apprehended him—put him into a cab and got in myself—I ordered the cabman to drive to Bow-lane station—in going along Cheapside the cabman did not known the turning—I put out my head to direct him, and when I drew in my head again, I saw that the prisoner had lost his hat—I said to him "Where is your hat?" he hesitated a little and then said "Oh, it is of no consequence, it has fallen outside"—I said it might be of very great consequence, and I ordered the cabman to stop—at the same time I saw a gentleman pick up the hat; I called to him and he gave it to me—I looked at it and found this cap inside it—the prisoner said "Give me the cap"—I took it out to give it to him and found this cheque</p>

               <p>book under the cap in the hat—I said, "Oh, here is a cheque-book," he said, "I know nothing about it, some one must have put it there"—it was right at the bottom of the hat under the cap.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is all through prejudice that Mr. Barton has come up against me; it is three years since he saw any of my writing. I went to him after being with Mr. Groom, and I was with him as many years as I was months with Mr. Barton, and surely Mr. Groom must be better acquainted with my writing than Mr. Barton; and he says, it is nothing like my writing. Mr. Barton comes against me because I gave information of different swindling transactions, in which I had been compelled to assist him while in his employ.</p>

I will keep him clear;" they lifted my arms right up, and lifted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090004"></xptr>me up - I immediately missed my watch; I noticed their persons - Berry was one of them I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he was engaged as one of those who were pushing you about and hustling you? A. I am; he was very close to me: finding my watch gone a person came to me, and asked if I was robbed - I said Yes, of my watch; he said he thought he knew the party - the prisoner was then gone, and I was looking after him: he had got out of my sight - he was taken within an hour and a half: I was not present then - I received information, went to the watch-house to look at him, and identified him immediately; I am certain he was one of the party - I did not know him before; I saw my watch at the watch-house - my name is on a silver seal which is attached to it, and I have two letters on each side of the case.</p>

            . I am a journeyman boot and shoemaker, and live at No. 22, Goswell-street. I was near King-street on the 9th of November, and saw the prosecutor there, between three and four o'clock; there was a considerable crowd in the neighbourhood - I did not know the prisoner before this, but am positive I saw him there - Andrews was coming along; the prisoner and five or six others, whom I had been watching for some time, and seen attempt to hustle several other people, surrounded Andrews, shoved their elbows in his ribs, and shoved him about backwards and forwards - I am sure the prisoner was one of the most active among them; they at last lifted him right off his legs, and one of them took the watch out of his fob, and handed it to the prisoner - they then let Andrews go, and all began to laugh at him; Andrews said to the one next to him, "How dare you touch my body?" or something of that sort - when he got outside, I told him he had lost his watch, and that I knew the person who had got it; I went with him down to Basinghall-street, but could not see an officer, and while we were talking the prisoner and two others came along the other side of the way - I said,"There they are, don't let them see you, I will follow them, and give me your direction;" I followed them down London-wall, into the Circus, Bishopsgate-street, Liverpool-street, Camomile-street, Sun-street, the Minories, and into White Lion-street, in Houndsditch - the three met two others, who were with them at the time of the robbery; they got to Rosemary-lane - the prisoner and two others went down an archway; I saw the street-keeper, and asked him if it was a thoroughfare - understanding it came into Mill-yard, I went up the yard; there is a house there, which leads through into the yard - I went into the house, and saw the prisoner and the other two with the watch in their hands; they were in the house, and all talking about it - a Policeman came up, and wanted to go into the house, but I said they were coming out, and presently I saw the whole five in White Lion-street; we followed them - the Policeman took the prisoner in Leman-street, and charged him with it; he took the watch out of his hand, and handed it round to the others - they handed it from one to the other; I took hold of it, and said, "That won't do" - the others got away directly; I know them - one of them is a Jew, and had a bag under his arm; I should know them again - we secured the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house - the prosecutor recognized his person, and claimed he watch.</p>

            . I am a constable of Ratcliff. On the 9th of November. I saw Toole in White Lion-street - he gave me information; I said if they were gone through the archway it was all lost - we afterwards saw them all five together; he pointed to the prisoner, and said that was the man who had got the watch - I went up, and we took the prisoner; the others all went away - I followed another for a quarter of a mile, and got his hat and handkerchief, but not him; he ran too fast for me - I saw the watch passed out of the prisoner's pocket; he was trying to shift it away - I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

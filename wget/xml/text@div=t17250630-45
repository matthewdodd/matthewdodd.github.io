               <p>Mary Sylvester thus deposed: The Prisoner lodged about a Month at my House with one of my Servants; and sometimes had Let Victuals there. I took her in out of Charity; and in Return for it, she took an Opportunity of going away with my Goods, one Day when I was gone a visiting: But upon Enquiry I found her in Long-Acre with some of the Goods upon her. When she saw me, she fell on her Knees and ask'd my Pardon, and confess'd that she had brought the Cloaths away. I have indeed lent her a Smock or an Apron, or so; but not any of the Things that she stands indicted for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark thus deposed: The Prosecutor Sylvester keeps a notorious Bawdy House in Bond street. I have taken Whores out of her House many a time. She was indicted for a Bawdy three Sessions ago. - She served her Time with Mother Needham.</p>

             thus deposed: Sylvester decoy'd the Prisoner away, and own'd to me that she put these Cloaths upon her in order to receive Company. She told me too, that the Prisoner gave her a Note for 15 l. and was to allow her 12 s. 6 d. a Week for her Board. And tho' the Prisoner is yet but a Child, she has been Clap'd and Pox'd again and again in the Prosecutor's House; from whence she has been sent to the Hospital, and gone thro' two or three Salivations; and now this wicked Bawd wants to hang the poor Creature, because she has run away from her.

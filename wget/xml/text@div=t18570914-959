                  </hi>. I am an errand boy, and live at No. 40, Phoenix Street. On Saturday night, 23rd Aug., about 12 o'clock, I went into an ice shop in the Hampstead Road—after I had been there a little while, the prisoner came in, with his wife and brother-in-law—he was drunk, but not very drunk—he fell asleep; the shopman, Benzonelli, tried to wake him, but could not—he woke him up at last; I think that was about 2 o'clock—he tried to wake him first by throwing some water in his face; then they got a piece of ice and put down his back, but that did not wake him—he then put another piece of ice; that shook him a little, but he did not wake—a little while afterwards the master of the house, who had been asleep, woke</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140066"></xptr>
               <p>up, and then they got him off the chair, and he fell down—he got up, and got on another chair, and then Benzonelli went and got the shutters, and pushed him, and then he got up and went outside—Benzonelli then went and put up the shutters, and came in doors; the prisoner spoke to him, but I did not hear the words, and hit him on the side of the face with his right hand—Benzonelli tried to kick at him, but he did not kick him; he kept following him up, trying to kick him—I did not see the prisoner do any<lb></lb>thing then—Benzonelli then turned back and got a stick; while he was gone to get it, I heard the prisoner say, "Let him come"—I did not hear anything else—Benzonelli tried to hit him with the stick, but he did not hit him—they ran in together up against the shutters, scuffling; they had hold of each other—then two policemen came up, and the prisoner was taken to the station house—I followed—as I was going along I saw a knife dropped by the prisoner's wife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I picked it up, and gave it to another boy.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I keep an ice shop, at No. 17, Adam's Row, Hampstead Road. The deceased, Gallo Benzonelli, was in my employment; he was twenty-one years of age—on Saturday night 23rd Aug., the prisoner came into my shop with a man and woman—he placed himself on a chair, and went to sleep, from about 2 o'clock until 3—while he was sleeping I do not recollect that anything happened; the deceased was doing his duty, and the prisoner was sleeping—it was about 3 o'clock when Ben<lb></lb>zonelli asked me whether he was to shut up the shop—I said, "You may do so, and tell the people here that they must go away"—he went to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and as he could not express himself better in English, he only said, "Come, get up"—the prisoner's wife also said to him, "Do not make a fool of yourself, but come along"—when I saw that the words of my servant were of no use, I stepped forward myself, and said to the prisoner, "My lad, this won't do; it is late, get up, and go"—he got up, and began to swear, and said, "I will crack your head"—I went to the window to see if I could see a policeman to put him out—while I was standing behind the bar, I gave a glass of ice to a man named Wood, and then went and lighted a cigar, and I saw the prisoner's wife pulling him by the coat, and the deceased pushing him behind—when he was once out of doors, the deceased</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140067"></xptr>
               <p>came in doors to get the shutters to put up, and when he was outside put<lb></lb>ting them up, the prisoner said, "You are a b—Frenchman, and a b—rogue," and he gave him three blows behind his ear; the deceased defended himself by giving him some kicks—I can only say that he endeavoured to kick him, but I could not see clearly whether he did kick him, as I was too far off—I then went out of doors to endeavour to separate them, and bring the deceased in—after bringing him in, he took a stick, and walked out with it, lifting it up—whilst he was standing in that position, the prisoner rushed upon him with a knife, as I suppose, but I did not see the knife, and the deceased gave him a blow with the stick on his back—I then took the stick away—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the policeman then came—I desired the deceased to come in doors, but he cried out, "I am wounded"—I afterwards saw the wound, and the intestines coming out of it—I went to the hospital to see the deceased; he was then dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 17, Middlesex Place, Somers Town. On this Sunday morning, about 3 o'clock, I went to this shop to buy an ice—while I was being served, I saw Mr. Baretta run round the corner, and, looking up, I saw the prisoner spring at the deceased, and strike him with his left hand on the right side of the cheek; that was out<lb></lb>side the shop—I then saw the deceased try to kick him; he did not kick him, and he went in and got a stick—when he came out with the stick, I heard the prisoner say, "Let him come, I have got a knife;" with that I saw him pull a knife out of his pocket, and open it—the deceased ran at the prisoner to hit him with the stick, and then, in the struggle, I saw the prisoner's hand, which had the knife in it, go towards the deceased's thigh; the deceased did not hit him with the stick—there was a kind of scuffle; the prisoner <hi rend="italic">cuddled</hi> one arm round the deceased's neck, and the other hand was down so, with the knife in it—I saw his hand go towards the deceased's thigh—I was close to them at the time—I saw the knife in his hand at that time, and saw him push it into the man's thigh—this is the knife; the other lad picked it up, and gave it to me, and I gave it to the constable—I do not know what became of the stick—I am certain the deceased did not hit the prisoner with it.</p>

I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and was house surgeon at University College Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 23rd Aug., at 3 o'clock in the morning—I examined him when he first came in—I observed a wound in the right inguinal region, and protruding from the wound was a mass of bowel—I measured it, and it was six inches in length; that wound was exactly an inch in length—a knife would cause such a wound—he died on Tuesday, the 25th—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I followed the course of that wound—I discovered that there was a corresponding wound on the internal surface of the abdomen, it was longer than the external wound; in the cavity of the abdomen there was evidence of intense inflammation; there was a large quantity of sero purulent fluid there—the intestines were much inflamed, especially that part which protruded on another part called the large intestines; the coats were partially wounded, but were not entirely penetrated—the cause of death was inflammation of the peritoneum, caused by the wound—I examined the other vital parts, and saw nothing to account for death—the inflammation arising from the wound was the cause of death—I was present on the Sunday night when the policeman was there; the deceased was then sinking; he was informed of his state, but not, I believe, until after his deposition was taken.</p>

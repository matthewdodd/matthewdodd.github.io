On Friday, the 14th of December, between five and six o'clock, I served a customer, and closed the shop door, and sat down in the parlour behind the shop; the door was on the latch - I am certain it was latched - I left all the cannisters safe on the shelves, about two yards from the shop door - I heard the door slam about half-past five o'clock - I immediately went into the shop, and missed a cannister - I saw nothing more, till I heard the prisoner was in the officer's hands - I had not been out of the room after leaving the cannister safe - I had been from the shop about ten minutes - on the afternoon following Webster, the officer, brought me the cannister it contained about 2 1/2 lbs. of 6s. black tea. I am certain of the cannister.</p>

            . I am an officer of High-street, Mary-le-bone. On the 14th of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Stingo-lane, within two hundred yards of the prosecutor's house; he was running sharpish, with this cannister under the flap of his coat, but I could not see what it was at first - I said, "Halloo! what have you got here?" he stopped, and said, Oil - I said, "Nonsense, you cannot have oil;" he said, "Yes, it is" - I said, "What, in a cannister? I must look at it" - I took it out of his arm, looked at it, and said, "Why, it is tea;" he said, "I don't know what it is, a man gave it to me at the corner of Seymour-place" - I took him to the office, and found nothing but two keys on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Cove, a carpenter, living at No. 2, Payne's Place, Kentish Town Road; we occupy the front room ground floor—the prisoner lived in the back room ground floor—he came there about 11th October last with Mary Ann Piper and three children; the eldest child was a girl about 13, named Emily Piper, the next was a boy, Charles Piper, about 11, and the third was the baby, Louisa Piper—Mrs. Mead occupied one of the rooms upstairs—the woman Mary Ann Piper used to go out to work the greater part of the day; she used to go out at all times, mostly early in the morning, and return in the evening—the eldest girl, Emily, was out during the day, she had a little place; the boy was mostly at school during school hours—the prisoner was usually at home with the baby—I first saw the baby about a fortnight after they came, on a Sunday, I saw her going out along with the elder sister—I noticed the appearance of the child; I noticed bruises on the side of its little ear and scratches on the side of its face—in our room I could hear distinctly what took place in the prisoner's room; there was only a partition door between the two rooms—he has knocked the baby about when the woman has been at home, but he has beat it most shamefully when she has been out—I could hear every word that was said—I heard him beating the chili about a fortnight after they came, and he called her dreadful names; he used to call it a little bleeding mare—on one occasion he said to the woman she would have the pleasure one of these days, of seeing the bleeding mare lying under his feet and dash its little guts out before her own eyes—when he has been alone with the child, I have heard noises as if he was slapping its little bottom, and as if he has thrown the child against the door, and I have heard the child make a kind of squeaking noise, it would not last a minute—this used to occur more or less every day—when I heard it I have hammered at the door and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to use a dear baby like that—he made the reply once that he would rip my b——face open—the child died on Monday, 1st December—on the Friday before that he was brutally ill-treat—the child whilst the mother was out, slapping it, and as if he was jobbing it on the floor, and he threw it up against the partition door—the child only made the squeaking noise, and it would die off into little sobs; you would not hear much of its crying—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, if he went on much more of it I would fetch in a policeman—he came out into the passage and told me to mind my own b——business, it was the mother that had done it—on that Friday the mother was there; she did not say anything; she came out—I don't think the prisoner heard what passed between us, because she was too frigtened he should hear it; she went into the back yard for some water—on the Saturday before the child died, he was ill-treating the mother all day long, as well as the baby—on the Sunday the child had wetted in front of the fireplace, and he said the bleeding little mare had taken a warm place for it; it wanted to go to the po, and he broke it against the door and threw the child on to the po—the child broke into a</p>

               <p>little sobbing cry, but it was soon over—on the Monday morning, a little after 9, I heard the mother crying; I knocked at the door and asked what was the matter—I ultimately went into the room; the mother was dressed to go to work, the prisoner was just getting off the bed putting his trowsers on—the child was lying on the side of the bed, its little arms drawn up—I tried to lay them straight as well as I could; it was quite dead—I said "Oh, you poor little murdered creature'—the prisoner stood against the fireplace—Mr. Mead was present at the time—the prisoner said "Make matters as well as you can for me, Mrs. Core"—the woman did nothing, only stood crying—I noticed that the child's head was dreadfully bruised, there were two bruises on its head; it only had on a little shirt—the mother and I went and fetched Dr. Brown—the mother had placed the child on the side of the bed where she and the prisoner used to sleep; it usually slept on the floor on two pillows—I showed the woman the bruises and asked her how it was done, and she said it fell off the po; she afterwards said that the prisoner had done it, that on Sunday he picked it up three times by the hair of its head and threw it on the floor, that she picked it up and tried to stand it on its feet and it could not stand, that he then kicked her into the corner of the room, that he was coming across, as she thought to hit her again, and she said "Oh, don't, Charley, you have done it for me this time," and he said "Nonsense, you want to make me believe something now," and then he knocked her down—she said the bruises were caused as the child was going to get up off the floor, he hit her on the side of the head and the head came in contact with the door, and that the child was never sensible afterwards—she was telling this to me, and the prisoner said "Oh, it is all nonsense."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never called in a policeman; the other lodger did, about a month before the child died; I was not present—the prisoner was not taken up by the policeman—I have seven children—I was there about a month before the prisoner came—there were other lodgers; all the rooms were occupied; there are six rooms—I never went into the prisoner's room but once—the woman Was too frightened to speak to any of us in the house—what I have told is only what I heard; I never saw anything take place—the prisoner Was nearly always at home; I never knew him to be at work; I never missed him out of the place above an hour or half an hour during the day; I am perfectly sure of that—t am sure he was not at work on the Friday fortnight before the child died; that is the Friday I have spoken of, not the Friday before the death; if I slid so it must have been a misunder<lb></lb>standing; it was the Friday week before, and on the Saturday and Sunday before it died—I don't know of anything particular that took place on the Friday before it died—on the Saturday and Sunday the woman was at home all day—as far as I could tell she was very fond of the children—I never heard her beat them—I have never seen the prisoner, only when he has gone past the window and come back again—I could not tell from his manner whether he was drunk at times; I never had any conversation with him; I could not tell whether he was drunk or sober—it was on the Sunday after<lb></lb>noon before the child's death that I last heard anything particular; at that time the mother was in the room; it was on that occasion that the mother was knocked in the corner against the door—it was on the Friday week before the child died that I called Mrs. Mead down into my room; that was one of the occasions when he knocked the child against the wall; on that occasion the mother came out of the room and said it was she who had been</p>

               <p>knocked into the corner of the room—I cannot tell you when it was that he said she should have the pleasure of seeing him place the child at her feet and dash its guts out under her eyes, because it was every day's occurrence; it is impossible to remember the dates—I don't mean that I heard that expression every day; it was on the Friday fortnight before the child's death—I forgot it when I was before the Magistrate; I believe I said it before the Coroner—on one occasion, when I knocked at the door and complained that he was knocking the child about, the mother did not come out and tell me that I was mistaken; the prisoner came out and told me so—it was after that that she came out and said that she had been thrown against the door; she said she was thankful to think that I had interfered—I could not exactly say the last time I saw the child before it died; I think it was about a month before—the scratches I saw on the face were not like sores, just as if it was from finger-nails—I had no opportunity of seeing how the other children were treated—I never saw the prisoner nursing this child or the others—I never went into the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was always on good terms with the woman when I spoke to her; I had no occasion to be otherwise; I have had no quarrel with either of them—on the Friday, when she came out and said she was glad I had interfered, she was crying; she said he had knocked her into the corner because she had taken the baby's part.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Thomas Mead, a plasterer, of 2, Payne's Place; we occupy the first floor back, directly over the prisoner's room—I was living there on 11th October, when the prisoner came to live there—about a fortnight after they came I heard the man smacking the baby's bottom; I was on the stairs; the mother was not there at the time—about six weeks previous to the child's death Mrs. Cove called me downstairs, and we went close to the door of the prisoner's room, and I heard as though he banged the baby on the floor; once the child gave a kind of moaning cry, and after that it seemed as though he threw it against the partition; the child only gave the same kind of moaning cry—I said, "You brute, you are knocking that child about again, while the mother is out earning the bread to put into your mouth"—the mother was not there then; she was out at work—he told me to mind my own business, and he would like to serve me in the same way, he would like to put the heel of his boot on my a—; after that I went upstairs—the same evening, about 5 or 6, I went downstairs for some water; at that time the woman was at home—I heard the prisoner swearing; it seems the mother was undressing the child to put it to bed—he said, "Do you know what I would like to do to her? I would like to lay her down on the floor stark naked, a—up<lb></lb>wards, and thrash her till she could not move, and let her lie there and not have anything to eat until she died"—I heard this through the window; I could not see into the room; the glass was papered up—I said to him, "Do you know what I would like to do with you if I had my will "I would serve you in the same way; I would get a cat-o'-nine-tails to you"—he told me to mind my own business, and I had no business looking under his window—a night or two after that I was again outside the window, and heard him swearing at the mother and the child—I heard him say to the boy, "Undress her, Charley, and put her to bed out of the way"—some</p>

               <p>time after that, it might be a week after, I was passing up the stairs; apparently the baby was on the po; I heard him say, "This is the second time, God help you the third; if you don't do it this time I will do for you"—I think that was between a fortnight and three weeks before the child died—on the Saturday before it died he was swearing all day at the mother, through something he did not like in the child's doings; I did not hear distinctly what he said—all day on the Sunday it was the same, he and the mother continually grumbling at each other—during the whole of the time I never saw or heard the mother ill-treat the child—she was there when I spoke to him about the cat-o'-nine-tails; she did not speak—on the Monday morning, 1st December, about 9.15, I was fetched down into the room by Mrs. Cove, and saw the child on the bed dead—it was very much bruised about the forehead and about the body; it had on a little shirt—I told the prisoner he was the instigation of it—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Missis</hi>, how can you say so?"—I said, "Because I do"—the mother said that on the Sunday she went to stand it on its feet and it could not stand; it fell down, and he hit it on the side of the ear as it fell-down; he lifted it up three times by (he hair of its head, and sat it on the floor; that it fell over against the chair, causing the wound on the forehead, and that it was not sensible after that—the prisoner said, "Nonsense, nonsense," nothing more.</p>

                  </hi>, L.R.C.S. I live at 1, Bartholomew's Road, Kentish Town—on 1st December I was called to Payne's Place, and saw the deceased child; it was very much emaciated—I made these notes of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—it weighed only 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">lb.</hi>, and the usual weight of a child of that age is 301<hi rend="italic">b.</hi>—there was a bruise on the right forehead, and the left cheek was swollen and hard—there was a scratch on the right cheek, a sore on the top of the head with a scab on it, three scratches at the back of the neck, a bruise on the left forehead, three raw wounds on the right buttock, each about the size of a threepenny piece, a similar sore over the right knee joint, and also on the back of the leg—the bruises were quite recent—the worst one was on the right forehead—the internal organs were healthy; there was nothing to account for death—the inner surface of the scalp had considerable extravasation of blood, which was the result of bruises, and under the bruise on the right forehead was a slight amount of congestion of the brain, not sufficient to cause death by itself, but it would decidedly do so combined with such treatment as I have heard to-day—the stomach con<lb></lb>tained no food—I found the mother there when I first went, and spoke to her; the prisoner came in afterwards, but I did not speak to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The woman gave me an account of the bruises on the forehead—I did not call the sores on the legs "cinder sores;" I only said "sores"—I think they were the result of neglect—that applies to the greater portion of them; I mean neglect in cleanliness, but if the child had been scratched, and had picked it, very likely it would cause sores—I Said before the Magistrate "Those marks might be caused by violence, or by the child rubbing itself on the floor, and scratching the wounds afterwards"—the sore on the head might be caused in the same way, from a pimple—the room was very poor; I did not inquire of the prisoner or any one else as to whether there was any food there—the bruises on the forehead might have caused the congestion, but the congestion was not sufficient of itself to cause death—to produce the congestion there must have been concussion first, and I think the shock to the nervous system arising from that was the cause of death in a weakly child—the immediate cause of death was the shock to the nervous system; that sheck must have been caused by violence of some sort, and that violence must, in my opinion, have been inflicted within 24 hours of death—I presume that the death was from shock, because I could find no other cause—I think the child had been very weakly from its birth—I think the mother said at the inquest that the father died from cousumption, but I am not sure—the condition of poverty Would be likely to make the child worse—I did not notice that the children had nothing but their clothes to put on their beds—I think I have understated the weight of a child of two years at 301b.—I do not think the prisoner was</p>

               <p>present when the woman gave me an account of the bruise on the forehead; he came in before I left the room, but I think she had told me how it happened before he came in—I do not think he was present when she told me—she said "The child fell from the po and bruised its forehead"—a child of those tender years falling a short distance might receive a severe bruise on its forehead, but it would not produce three bruises—I think the child simply falling would scarcely account for the severe bruises on the forehead, but I cannot speak for certainty—I do not think that a child weakly from its birth falling forward in a helpless condition on its face would receive such a bruise as was on this child's forehead, but I should not like to swear it would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw no symptoms of consumption, except that the mesenteric glands were a little enlarged, but not in a state to cause death—the state of its body would come from neglect—I should expect to find sores in a child weighing 13<hi rend="italic">lb.</hi> which ought to weigh 30<hi rend="italic">lb.</hi> if it was not properly attended to—scratches from anything on the floor, and the child picking them afterwards, would account for the sores on the legs—I think the bruise on the forehead was the result of considerable violence.</p>

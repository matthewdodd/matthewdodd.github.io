                  </hi>. I keep the Fishmonger's-arms, 13, Holles-street, Clare-market—on 13th August, Donoghue came in and read the newspaper for a quarter of an hour—Kirtland then came in with a woman and child, and several other persons, but whether they were in his society I do not know—Donoghue ordered a pot of porter, which came to threepence—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him ninepence out—I had seen Kirtland give him something, but do not know what—Kirtland and some of the others drank it—I put the shilling in the till, there was no other shilling there—about half an hour afterwards Donoghue called for another pot of beer; it came to threepence—he gave me another shilling, I gave him nine-pence change, and then discovered that it was bad before putting it in the till—I flew to the till where I had put the first shilling, took it out and found it to be bad also—I kept one shilling in each hand, and said, "Leave that beer alone"—he said, "Why?"—I said, "You know why; you give me back that ninepence I gave you"—I took the beer from him—he said, "I have not got the ninepence"—I said, "How can you say so, when I have just this moment given it to you"—I told him he had given me a bad shilling—he said, "That man gave me the bad shilling," meaning Kirtland—I said, "Where is the ninepence?"—he said, "That man has got it"—I demanded it in a very peremptory manner from Kirtland, and he gave it to me—I had not put any other shilling into the till in the meantime—I said, "This sort of thing will not do, this is not the first one you have palmed on me this morning"—I sent for a policeman and gave him the</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop in Clare-market, just opposite Mr. Elliott's—on Saturday, 24th August, Donoghue came in for half an ounce of tobacco, it came to three-halfpence—he gave me a shilling—I put it in the detector, bent it, gave it him back, and told him it was bad—he put it in his mouth, bent it straight and went out leaving the tobacco—he came back almost immediately with a good sixpence—I gave him the change, and he left with the tobacco—he did not say where he went to get the sixpence—a few minutes afterwards I saw a mob at Mr. Elliott's, and was informed that Donoghue was taken in custody—when he brought the sixpence back, he said, "Do not take the three-halfpence out of that because it is not mine".</p>

I went to Covent Garden-market to buy some fruit for my wife on this morning, and if I had had bad money I had more chance of passing it there than in a public-house; I brought the things home to where she has stood for sixteen years, and then went into this house to have a little refreshment. I believe a costermonger has more chance of getting rid of bad money among market people than anybody else; I laid out 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the market, in gold and silver.

               <p>Q. In consequence of any advertisement, did you go to No. 22, West-smithfield - A. I did. I went first into an outer office, from there I was shewn into an inner office.</p>

            , and a person of the name of Smith. I told them I had come in consequence of an advertisement of a clerk's place. They asked me then, whether I could obtain a good character from my last place. I told them I could have the best of characters. They then asked me to give them a specimen of my writing, which I gave them, my address.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write it there - A. Yes. The specimen that they asked I gave them, which was my address. Smith took it up, and looked at it, and said, it would do very well. He said, I had better go home, and write a letter, and bring it them directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Nutt present all the time - A. He heard all that passed. He told me to go and write, as if I was writing to persons at Norwich. I went home and wrote the letter, as if I was writing to persons at Norwich. I went home, and wrote the letter, and brought it to the office. I saw both in the office when I brought it. Smith opened it, and read it. He said, it was a most masterly hand, and he had no doubt I should gain the place. Nutt was there when he took the letter. They both spoke at the time, and said, I should have to pay the postage. Smith directed the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how it was directed - A. Yes. Messrs. Jones and Co. He wrote something in the middle, which I suppose was, merchants. I paid eleven-pence for the postage of a letter. I threw down a shilling. Smith took the shilling up, and said, I have no change, sir: I suppose, you have no objection for a penny to the porter; those that carry the letter. I said, no. He put the letter in a desk, and the shilling he put in a drawer. There were more letters inside. I could see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there these times did you see many persons assemble as enquirers - A. Yes. I suppose ten or twelve. Two or three would go out, and more come in.</p>
               <p>Q. After you went with the letter, you were induced to go back, were not you - A. Yes. I went into the inner office. I saw both Smith and Nutt. I told them that I had met a merchant in the city, and I had engaged myself. They looked at me, and said, sir, your letter has been gone ever since two o'clock. He said, a great many letters had gone to the Post office, with mine, which I knew was false. They both said, my letter was gone, with a bundle of other letters, which I knew to be false, because it was past two o'clock when I went. I only thought it was false.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any application to Nutt and Smith, for a place - A. I did, in West Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to make that enquiry - A. I saw the Morning Advertiser, at the Black Swan, in the Borough, where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to No. 22, West Smithfield, did you see the defendant - A. Yes, I saw him and another gentleman. Mr. Nutt was sitting at the side of a desk. I told them, I had called there in consequence of an advertisement I had seen in the Morning Advertiser. I handed over the reference for a clerk's place, in a wholesale concern, in the county of Norfolk. I gave them a reference for my character. Mr. Smith asked me, whether that was my writing. I said, it was. I knew book-keeping, both single entry and double entry. Nutt and Smith both told me I must return and write a letter, and they would address it. I went and wrote a letter, I brought my letter and gave it to Mr. Nutt. I thought it necessary to tell Nutt that I was born in the neighbourhood of Boston. Mr. Nutt said, he would befriend me, as he was a Lincolnshire man. He certainly would recommend me. I asked him, what was the business. He said, bankers and corn-factors. My department at the accompting-house would be in the corn-business. Smith asked me, whether I was a married man. Nutt said, what matters that, the salary was sufficient to support a wife and family. Nutt said, the salary was two hundred pounds a year. They said, they would use every interest in their power, as I was a Lincolnshire man. They both promised to interest themselves in my interest. They told me that they were people that transacted business with respectability. They were not like the Echo-office.</p>
               <p>COURT. They represented that their office was more respectable than the Echo-office - A. That was what they said to me. Mr. Smith then said, Mr. Johnson must pay the postage. I said, what is it. He said, eleven-pence. I gave a shilling. Smith said, God bless me, I have not got a penny: I will give it Mr. Johnson on Tuesday. I saw them address the letter. I cannot tell what. He took the shilling and put it into a small box. There were more letters where he put mine.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went there what time of the day was it - A. About half past eleven. There was nothing at all in the shop. It was empty. There were four persons there besides myself. These four were in the outer room. They were there before me. I waited for my turn about twenty minutes. I went into the inner office. I saw Nutt and Smith. I said, I was come with respect to an advertisement in the paper. They said, oh, yes, sir, you are right. It is for a clerk, to go down to Norwich. They both said, to go into the corn trade. I told them that I had not been used to the corn trade. Nutt replied, you can write down an hundred quarters of wheat, as well as an hundred pounds. Smith asked for a specimen of my hand-writing. I wrote my name there. He said, it would do very well. I told him, if he wished to have my address, I would give him a friend or two that I knew at Norwich. He said, that would be in my favour. He said, I must go and write a letter, and return by four o'clock. I returned with the letter about half past three. It was directed, 22, Smithfield. Smith said, I should not have directed it there. He dashed the address out, and opened the letter, and began to read it. Nutt requested to see it. He read it. He said, he thought that my stating the person I did, in the letter would be something in my favour. He put it then in the desk. I was going out, and Smith called me back, and told me I must pay the postage. I asked him, what that was. He said, eleven-pence. I threw him down a shilling. He said, he was sorry he had got no change: he would give me the change when I called again on the Tuesday. This was on Thursday. I went there on the Tuesday, between nine and eleven in the morning. I saw Mr. Nutt in the shop, and another gentleman. I told him, I was come respecting a situation. Nutt said, he was very sorry it was engaged the night before. I told him, I believed he was indebted to me a penny. He rang, and a boy came. He told him, to fetch a penny. The boy fetched me a penny. I wished him good morning.</p>

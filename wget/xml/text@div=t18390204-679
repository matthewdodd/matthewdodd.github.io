                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Andrew Pilgrim, he keeps a broker's shop in Old-street-road. On the 23rd of January, we had a table outside our house fastened with a cord—about ten minutes before eight o'clock I heard a noise—I went out and saw the prisoner going off with it—I overtook him, and took hold of the table with one hand, and his coat with the other—he put it down and ran off—before he got to the corner of the street he threw off his hat and knot—when he got to the corner he then kicked off his shoes—I caught him, but he got away from me and ran off—I saw him again in about an hour and a half—I said he was the man—he denied it—I asked him to pull his shoes off, which he did, and I felt the bottoms of his stockings were wet, which convinced me that he had been in the mud without shoes—I have no doubt whatever that he is the person.</p>

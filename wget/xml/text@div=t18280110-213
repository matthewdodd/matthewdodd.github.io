            . On the 8th of January, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoners with another person in Chiswell-street; they tried about fifty shops - I watched them to the Pavement, saw Hanson go to the shop, lift up the ham, and take it away down Short-street - I followed, and took Hanson - I heard one of them whistle, which I think was Malvaney, as he was near the door-post, and I think he was going to take another ham. I heard one say it was all right.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If you followed Hanson directly, could you see what the others were doing? A. No; but as I brought Hanson back, Malvaney was at the top of Short-street - Harrison took him; he was at the door when I followed Harrison.</p>

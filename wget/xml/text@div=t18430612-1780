                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Johnson, a shoemaker, and live in Alfred-terrace, in the parish of Stepney—it is his house—we slept in the front room, ground floor, the window of which has outside shutters—on the 15th of June my husband was up last—between two and three o'clock in the morning I was awoke by the sliding up of the window, and saw a man's arm inside the window, taking off a pair of cloth boots by the bottom pane—I called out, and he ran away—I directly awoke my husband, and shut the window and the shutters again—the shutters were opened, and the window was down at the top, and up at the bottom—the boots were gone—I am certain they were there the night before—the shutters were quite close when I went to bed, but not bolted—the window was closed, and the bottom sash was fastened—there are two fastenings, one in the middle, and one at the side—I cannot say whether the middle one was fastened, but the bottom one was—my husband got up, and dressed himself—as soon as he was dressed I heard persons passing by and talking—I directly ran to the door, and saw two young men walking near the corner, three doors from our house—it was quite light—the arm that was put into the window had on a light jacket, and one of the two persons I saw in the street had on a white jacket—he went round the corner—the other waited for him against the public-house door—the other then came back, and both went down the street together—I watched them till my husband put his boots and hat on, he went after them, and brought them back—I saw no other persons outside the door but them.</p>

                  </hi>. I was awoke by my wife—I counted the boots, and missed three pairs off the top part of the window, where I had seen them about eleven o'clock the night before, when I went to bed—the shutters were then quite closed, but not bolted—the window was also shut, and fastened at one corner, so as to fasten one sash—when I awoke I found the top window <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down—it had been quite closed the night before—I went to the door after my wife, and saw the prisoners walking down Alfred-street together—just before I got up to them they separated—one went to the right—I came up to Harris, who was in the light jacket, and who crossed to the left hand side of the road, standing with his face towards the wall—when I came up to him, he said, "Halloo, master, what is this? here is two pair of boots"—I picked up a handkerchief at his feet, and found it contained two pairs of my boots—I said that he or his mate had got another pair, which he denied—Fisher came up, and I immediately took them back to the house—I said, if he would produce the other pair of boots, I would say no more about it—he would not, and I and two young men took them to the station—as we were</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in Mr. Johnson's house. I walked with him and the prisoners to the station—as we went along Alfred-street, I saw Fisher take the boots off a window-ledge in Alfred-street, and give them to Mr. John<lb></lb>son, saying, "Here are the boots, what occasion is there to go to the station-house now?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners in charge, with the boots—as we were walking along, Harris said that they saw a bundle lying on one side; that the prosecutor was walking after them; that he turned round, and said, "Master, here is a pair of boots"—they gave their addresses at the station—I made inquiry there, but could not find any one that ever knew or saw them.</p>

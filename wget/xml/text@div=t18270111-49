            . I am a clerk in the Two-penny post department of the General-post; letters brought from the country-office, for delivery by the two-penny carriers, are brought to our office in a box; and account is taken of the postage before they are sent out. A letter put in at Leicester on the 22d would arrive in town on the 23d, and would be delivered that morning; the postage of a single letter from Leicester is 9d. - it is my duty to separate double and treble letters from single ones; an entry is made of them in the North East division. The prisoner is one of the persons employed in the delivery of letters in that division.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this book, is there the entry made on the morning of the 23d, of the double and treble letters for delivery? A. Yes - there are fifteen letters in number; the persons to whom these letters are delivered, sign their names against those they take charge of - three of these letters were delivered to the prisoner, which he is charged with the postage of; here is the entry - (reads) -

            , Prospect-place, Cambridge-heath, post-mark Swansea, 11d.; the prisoner has acknowledged, by his signature, that these three letters were delivered to him: 2s. 3d. would be the postage of a letter from Leicester, containing two bank notes; the post-mark on this letter was imperfect - I could not read it; he would have many other single letters to deliver; this is a security we take from the carrier, to acknowledge what double letters they receive - this rule at that time was only applicable to that division.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many years have you been in the office? A. Seventeen; a great many persons are employed there - there are six carriers in that division.</p>
               <p>Q. Irregularities have crept into the office, which led this new regulation? A. Yes; I am not aware of any men being suspended - I believe some have been - I have heard so, but that circumstance does not come to my knowledge; mistakes certainly do occur in sorting letters for delivery. I did not hear the prisoner give any account of this matter; I heard him examined before the Magistrate - he was bailed, and has surrendered here today; the letters are sorted in a large room - I should think from fifty to sixty persons are employed there, in and out - In the out parts the General letters are delivered by the two-penny postmen; I cannot say how many General letters he would have - they would be in addition to the twopenny ones; this regulation of signing the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110032"></xptr>book has been made about six weeks - the entry is in my writing; after entering them I lay them on a desk, and send for the letter-carriers respectively - he would be in the carrier's office, not in the office where I enter them; I send only for the carriers of his division, which would be five or six; the letters remain before me - he would then take the letters, see the amount was right, and then sign the book, which he has done - he does not bring his bag with him, but takes them away in his hand; he signs the book after taking the letters, to see that they belong to his delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not often occurred, since this regulation, that the carrier takes your word, and relies on your accuracy, without comparing the letters with the entry? A. No - I always order them to examine them with the entry, and think I can safely swear they never sign the book without comparing them, for I always order them to examine it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen a degree of negligence in the men which has surprised you? A. I have seen it, but I always say, "See what you have got before you sign;" I only know that he had the letters which he has signed for; the carrier always takes the letter before he signs it - I never knew them sign first - complaints have been made before of the non-delivery of letters - in this division there are six persons who deliver.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Was that complaint the cause of this regulation? A. Yes. I cast up the postage after entering them; a sub-sorter sorts them for me to enter - his name is Burt - I cast the postage myself, and the men account for the postage to Mr. Barret; I give to the Presidents' assistant a paper, called a docket, charging the carriers with the postage, and the carrier accounts to Barrett for the money; it is the carrier's duty to look at the letters, to see that they are within his walk, as he can tell better than the sorter. I now understand that Bird-cage-walk is not in the prisoner's walk - it is his business to see they are in his delivery before he signs - they are not delivered to him with the single ones, but separately.</p>

I have a docket - they report to me verbally, and if that report agrees with the docket I put it down; he reported to me, on the 23d, that he had three double letters, amounting to 4s. 6d. His is called the Bethnal-green walk - I believe that adjoins Bird-cage-walk, Hackney-road, but his walk does not include that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say it is not in his particular walk? A. I believe not; the account I have is what the carriers are responsible for, for the double letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he had the letter or not you would expect to received that sum? A. Yes, but he reports to me, whether he agrees with the account - if there was a mistake, my docket would not be correct; I receive that from another person, but compare it with his verbal report; if his report was not accurate it would not agree with my account; I expect him to pay the amount on the docket, he having reported it to be correct.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had afterwards told you he had not received this letter, through some accident, would you not expect him to pay for it? A. I expect him to pay according to the docket.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. The charge is made and a check given to you, the carrier comes and says how many he has, and if it agrees with the docket, you mark it? A. Yes, and not without; if a man says there is a mistake it would be inquired into - if he had stated nobody would take the letter in, and he could not find the man, the postage would have been allowed him.</p>

            . I am a President in the Twopenny department of the Post-office. In consequence of an inquiry respecting this letter; the prisoner was called before me on the 1st of December, when Mr. Poole applied - I went into the sorting-office, referred to the book, and found an entry made of this letter; I then sent for the prisoner, and asked him if that letter came to his hands - I do not think I showed him the entry, but asked him if he had a letter for Mr. Poole, Bird-cage-walk, Hackney-road; his answer, to the best of my recollection, was, "No, it is not my delivery - I don't go into Hackney-road;" I said, "Are you sure the letter did not come to your hands" - he still said, No; I said, "Have you no person of that name in your walk, where you could have delivered it, supposing it to have come to your hands;" he said No, but I do not think I showed him the book; he still said he had not received it. I allowed him to go out of the office, but not out of the building; I went and reported it to the solicitor - he was taken before him, and the book produced - when he was shown the entry of the letter which he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110033"></xptr>had signed - he said if he had signed it, it must be a mistake - he did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your receiving an intimation that it had not been delivered, you had the means of discovering in whose hands it had been, from the book? A. Yes; I knew his signature acknowledged the receipt of the latter - I did not question him with a view to catch him, but that he might recollect himself if he had made a wrong delivery; I knew it was not in his walk, which made me question him more minutely.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your object to detect whether he had stolen it or not? A. Very probably - it was my duty to discover whether he was guilty or not; I was certainly anxious to discover the guilty person; if I had told him he had signed the book, he might have gone away for what I knew; I meant that the conversation between us should be given in evidence, but in every inquiry I make I do not immediately think of coming here; the questions suggested themselves from the nature of the business; I cannot sayy what impression I had on my mind then - I did not commit this conversation to writing - I trust to my memory.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord, the case I am now charged with I am innocent of. I have been in the employ two years, and deliver General-post letters in several walks in town and country, and had many opportunities of committing robberies, without signing my name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The day before I entered on this walk there was a letter lost - it was sent into the East division, and belonged to the North East: the carriers saying it did not belong to them, took it into the clerk's-office, and got it changed; it was lost, and when the gentleman applied about it the note was found to have been received at the Bank; this was the day before I went to that division - it belonged to Mr. Blundell, of Bethnal-green.</p>

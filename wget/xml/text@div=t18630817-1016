                  </hi>. I live at 121, Middlesex-street, Whitechapel, and am a glazier—about 11 o'clock on 29th June, I was going along Ferry-street, Millwall, with some glass for repairing windows on my shoulder, the prisoner broke my glass with a stick he had in his hand, and then hit me with the stick on the head, knocked me down, and took 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my waistcoat pocket in a purse—somebody said the police were coming, and he ran away in the field—the value of the glass was about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I next saw the prisoner at the station on 23rd July—the police came for me—I told them what had happened—on the Monday after this happened, I was going down the field, and an old man saw me and said, "Glazier, I want you; my son broke your glass," and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "You are a poor man; you cannot see my son, he is a long way off"—that was a week after the robbery.</p>

On Monday evening, 6th June, I got a shilling from him—I marked it, and put it on the shelf—on the next evening my brother called me, and said it was the same man he took the shilling of—I saw the prisoner then—I had seen him the night before—my brother said, "This man was here last night"—I asked the prisoner where he got the half crown; he said his wife gave it him—my brother gave me the half crown—I marked it, broke it, and gave it to the officer, and the shilling too.</p>

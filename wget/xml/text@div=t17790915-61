I had a suspicion that the prisoner had robbed me, which suspicion was grounded partly upon the time when he left me, which agreed with the time when I missed the books, and partly upon the prisoner having access to my quire warehouse, which nobody else then had. I had him apprehended. He had a lodging in Oxford-road, where he had set up a bookstall. I had his lodgings searched, and there I found all the books mentioned in the indictment, and many more, all which I took to be my own, except as many as might be worth about 20 s. When the prisoner was taken up, he did not account how he came by those books, but set me at defiance, and said I could not identify the books for want of marks. The books were stolen in sheets, and he had done some of them up in boards for sale, or in order to disguise them the better. In binding the books in boards the prisoner had used some of my paper to put before and behind, which cost twice as much as the paper commonly used for that purpose. Nobody would have bought such paper for that purpose. There are no marks in most of the articles, but, from their correspondence with my quire-stock, I cannot have a doubt of the whole being mine; but some of the articles which are damaged or tied up in a particular manner I can speak to with certainty. Here is also a Field's bible, that I found at a bookseller's in Middle-row, which I know to be mine; it has the name of the gentleman I bought it of in it. I know that I had never sold it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's lodgings, and found the books which are produced in the prisoner's lodging, and a great many more, that Mr. Fox swore to. The prisoner said he bought them at one place or another, but could not tell when, nor ascertain of whom he bought them. Mr. Fox in my presence asked him whether he could ascertain any one person he bought any of them of; he said no. A soon as I found the books I took the prisoner to Sir John Fielding's office; he was examined there, and committed for further examination. On the Wednesday following we attended at the publick examination day. Mr. Fox swore positively to these books; the prisoner was committed, and I was bound over to produce the books.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Will your lordship please to ask the prosecutor whether he can, upon oath, ascertain these books to be in his shop when I came to work with him on the 1st of October last? - My lord it is impossible all these articles could then have been wanting without my missing, in the course of that time, some one or other of them, or a multitude of them; these books must have been, some or other of them, taken away since, for if they had been taken away before I must have missed them. The first article I missed was Kenrick's dictionary. I can swear I must have missed some one or other of the articles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether, upon oath, he can declare that he had never a servant in the house since the 1st of October last but me? - I had no other servant in the house when I missed the books. When I turned him away I took a maid-servant. I do not much live in the house myself; I go out. She came about a week after he went, I believe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you mean that never since the 1st of October you had no other servant, during the time that I lived with you? - I think not, if there was, it was a few days when he first came, and if she had taken them I must have missed them much sooner than I did, but to the best of my recollection I think she was gone before he came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he had an officer with him when he took these books he lays to be on the premisses? - The officer has himself sworn that.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not material.</p>

            , who came along with Mr. Fox. I told them as to pointing out every particular article belonging to Mr. Fox I could not do it, but if he could certainly swear to any of them, or could with safety to himself claim any of the property he found upon my premisses he might take them in the name of God. Upon the strong persuasions of my friends; the promise made by the prosecutor not to appear against me; the horrid apprehensions of a prison, and the natural love of liberty worked upon me to deprive myself of my property, and to risque my life. I delivered up an order to the prosecutor to go and take such books as he chose to take, which he thought he could claim.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses? - Yes, to prove that about this time twelve months, when I kept a shop in Peter's-street, Saffron-hill, I was afraid of my landlord. I took that shop about this time two years. Being afraid of my landlord, and the tax-men, I moved off the principal of my shop-goods to a friends of mine, who is ready to appear; but having unfortunately lost my catalogue among the other effects, which sell into the hands of the broker, and after the sale I could not procure it, I am therefore deprived of showing to you the number; denomination; the quality; the time when, where, and at what price, I have bought my books, being deprived of that happiness, I had nobody to recur to but my friends to prove that I had these books; they cannot possibly ascertain the value, but I moved a great quantity of books upon my friend's premisses about this time twelve months. I was obliged to serve the prosecutor as a porter; he hired me to sold and few, and put books in boards for him. It was on the 29th of September last I left off, and the books I had not time to remove unfortunately fell into the hands of my landlord. I removed what I could of my books to a friend's in Bridgewater-gardens, intending to re-assume my profession afterwards.</p>

               <p>Had he a good stock of books? - A great stock. About this time twelve months he brought to my house a large chest, containing, as he told me, books. I did not know it then, but I knew it a week afterwards. He brought so large a chest, I wonder he stood under it, for my apprentices and I had much a do to get it off his shoulders. He brought some more in a sack, in which sack I saw a parcel of books, such as pamphlets and old magazines; he said he was obliged to remove them for fear the officers of the parish should take them for parish dues; they might be there two or three months.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether these books now produced are some that were in the sack? - I will not pretend to say that I know any of them. I am certain these were not; those were in blue covers.</p>
               <p>Were there any books larger than pamphlets? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did they seem to be new books or old books? - Those I saw seemed to be new books. I can say nothing as to the contents of the trunk. I have known the prisoner ten years; I never heard any thing bad of him; he is an honest industrious sober hard working man, and took care of his family.</p>

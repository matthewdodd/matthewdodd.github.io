                  </hi>. I am nineteen years old, and live in Sadler's-row. On the 18th of May, I had been to a wedding in Leman-street—I left it about three o'clock in the morning, and was returning home—as I was going down Rose-lane, Spitalfields, the prisoner came from the door of a house, flew upon me, caught hold of me, by. the handkerchief, made use of a very bad expression, and said, "I must have your money, I have come from Stratford, and have no money"—she put her hand into my right hand coat pocket and took out a half-sovereign, and one shilling—when I was at the wedding, I had asked my uncle to oblige me with change for half-a-sovereign—he had not change, and I put it back into my outside pocket—I had my money in my hand, and my hand in my pocket, when she caught me by the throat I pulled my hand out, as I thought I should be strangled, to try to save myself—she put her face very near to mine at the time—I went into the house afterwards, but the passage was so dark, I could not perceive where I was. going—I came out again, and left the door a little way open—I got a policeman—I saw the prisoner about two hours afterwards, at the corner of Rose-lane, and he went into the same house which she had come from when she assaulted nw—the policeman went in and took her there.</p>

I was on duty in Wentworth-street, on the morning of the 19th of May—the prosecutor came to me, and told me he had been robbed—he was quite sober—I went with him to a house in Rose-lane—I could not find the prisoner there then—I was with him about two hours afterwards, and he pointed out the prisoner to me, going into the same house I had been in before—I followed her, and told her she was charged by the prosecutor with stealing</p>

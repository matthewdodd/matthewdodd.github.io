Goff and Bray went up stairs and searched the house, I remained below; Goff called me up stairs, we discovered the counterfeit tokens concealed in the stairs, a part of the stairs were cut away; I brought this away, it formed a box when closed, and in that box there laid twenty eight dozen three shilling tokens, and several dozen eighteen penny tokens laid in rows. I found nothing else, The prisoner Phillips said she lived there.</p>

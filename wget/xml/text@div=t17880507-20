               <p>I am a working silversmith.</p>
               <p>Have you any spoons? - No, they are melted.</p>
               <p>To Ingram. Has Mr. Turton ever been examined before? - Yes, before Sir Sampson Wright, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Turton. The prisoner came to me on the 21st of April, with one spoon; he said, his father was a master taylor, that he was in distress and sent him to sell it; my partner bought the first spoon, but I was present; he came afterwards with another about a month ago, almost with the same story; I asked him, if his father had got any work, he said no; my partner came in just as I gave the boy the money; says<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070016"></xptr>he, I cannot tell what to make of it; I sent our boy to watch him.</p>
               <p>You had some suspicion then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to melt the property when you had a suspicion it was stolen? - I did not know how to find out the owners; I kept them a week before I inelred them down; we take silver in exchange for our work, and we have as many spoons as any thing.</p>
               <p>And do you buy of any stranger that comes to the shop? - No; but this boy came with so plausible a story, that, I did not doubt the truth of it.</p>
               <p>When you suspected him then you melted it down? - I kept it a week first; I did not mean any harm.</p>
               <p>Buying plate of strangers in this way, and destroying the evidence, is very improper conduct? - I promise you I shall never do the like again, and I am very sorry my name should be brought in question now; we work for some of the most capital houses in town.</p>
               <p>You must be very careful for the future? - Indeed, I will.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had not been examined before, I certainly should not have examined you now.</p>

               <p>I did take the spoons, and sell them at Mr. Turton's.</p>

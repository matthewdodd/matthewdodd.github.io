            , about ten years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they married?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. At May-fair.</p>
               <p>Q. In a chapel, or where?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I believe it was in a publick-house, where they used to perform the ceremony.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they married according to the ceremony of the church of England?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. They were, as much as I was, as far as I can recollect. I have been married, and have seen others married, and I look upon it they were married the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them afterwards?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I believe they did not immediately live together?</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I think she did not consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever live together as man and wife?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I am not sensible that they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go as his friend or hers?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I went as his friend, he desired it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was there?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. There was no-body else there but the clergyman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in a clergyman's habit?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a licence?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the banns published?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I fancy not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a ring used?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. There certainly was a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see one?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I can't positively say there was one; I thought it a marriage as much as I did any I saw; but it is so long ago, I do not remember every particular circumstance. I think he took her to a publick-house, and wanted to lay with her, and she refused it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the marriage?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I am not certain how long after; she was young.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was she?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I believe not at age, I mean 21.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be a girl, or a woman grown?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. Rather girlish.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176105060031"></xptr>Q. Was she ten, or twenty? Or which was she nearest?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. Nearest twenty I look upon it; she had but a slight acquaintance with him, but it was her opinion that she was married.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day were they married?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. It was in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her last?</p>
               <p>Ravenshaw. I saw her this day.</p>

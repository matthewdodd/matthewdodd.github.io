            , JUN. I was carrying home some work - I met my father at the Dolphin, public-house, between four and five o'clock, and had a pot of beer and a quartern of gin; it rained very hard, we went into another house, and had about six pots of beer; we left there about eleven o'clock. When we got to Crown-street my father called out, I was behind him - I ran up to him, he said he had lost his silk-Sims was standing over him; he said my father had charged him with robbing him, but that he had not; I took him to the watch-house, he went willingly-Cole and Colebrook came up, and struck me several times-when the watchman came up they left me. The next night I found them at the Flying Horse, public-house, and had them secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We had a quartern of gin at both houses - I was sober - I do not remember the watch-housekeeper refusing to take the charge.</p>
               <p>JAMES RICE. I am a watchman. At twelve o'clock at night I saw six men at the corner of Crown-street - I dispersed them, and went away. I came up again, and saw the prisoner, Sims, and the two witnesses - They gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was no attempt to rescue while I was there, or any noise; the prosecutor's son was not so drunk as himself.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARKE. I am constable of the night. I heard a noise, and came out, and heard a man say,"Clarke is coming, we will go;" May, Cole, and Colebrook went away, they were with Sims; Sims was brought to the watch-house, the bobbins were found on the ground. Gallaway, jun. had a black eye, which he said one of the men gave him; he was not in liquor. The prosecutor said he lost his watch, but found it in his pocket. I think the son was sober.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM ATFIELD. I am an officer. I searched the prisoners Cole, Colebrook, and May, and found nothing on them.</p>
               <p>SIMS'S Defence. I went to help the prosecutor up; in a little time after he said he lost his silk, and I must know about it-his son collared me.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GALLAWAY, JUN. re-examined. When I went up, Sims was assisting my father up.</p>

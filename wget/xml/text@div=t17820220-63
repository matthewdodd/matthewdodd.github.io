               <p>That note is thrown off from the plate, Mr. Hevey ordered you to engrave? - Yes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200082"></xptr> I will take my oath of that, he intended this plate for the use of M'Carty only, and was to have the second for the use of the house likewise; I was ordered to take out Smith and put in M'Carty, Mr. Hevey paid my bill after he had been examined at Guildhall, it was three guineas in the whole.</p>

               <p>Mr. Read senior, deposed, that was the watch he sold to the prisoner Hevey; that he had never been paid any money for it, and had received nothing but the bill; that he went to receive the cash when it was due, but found the people were all run away or gone; it appeared afterwards they were both in prison, that they were taken up, the one on the 1st of December, the other on the 3d.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Dutton. Is Hevey a solvent man or not? - I had him arrested in the beginning of the year 1780, he was liberated from the King's Bench by the rioters, he owed me 238 l. for brandy and rum, I have never been paid, I considered him as an insolvent man.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the prisoner objected to the indictment, that the charge attempted to be brought against the defendants was not warranted by the penal law; that conspiracy (the crime imputed) like all other crimes, has a clear definition and description annexed to it; that conspiracy in antient times was different from the modern; the first conception which evidently came into the view of the legislature, was a combination to charge persons with some crime, and possibly in its extent, subjecting them to trial, that some perilous consequence must attend it, and therefore it is evidently distinct from fraud, the crime now imputed fraud is not a conspiracy, and it is impossible to say it amounts to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Read junior was called again, and the following question put by the court.</p>
               <p>When you went with the bill to Great St. Helen's and saw the prisoner Beaty, what question did you ask him respecting the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200084"></xptr> bill? - I asked him if it was a good bill.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make? - He said it was a very good one.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him any farther questions? - I asked him no farther.</p>
               <p>Court. There is in this indictment a distinct substantial charge, that

             wrote the acceptance of this bill, and no evidence has been given of the fact, or of the hand writing of Beaty.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the prosecution said, it was not necessary to produce any farther evidence than Read junior had given; for if a bill was tendered to a man, which bill purports to be his acceptance to be wrote by him, and he looks at that bill and says it is a good bill, it will be paid when due, that is a proof of his acceptance, sufficient to support an action in any court of justice, and therefore sufficient in this case.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the defendants said, it was begging the question to say, if a note is tendered to a man as an acceptor, if he says it is a good bill it will be a good acceptance; there is no doubt of that, but there is no evidence in this case of the man pretending to be the acceptor, he only looked at it sometime and said it was a good bill, and that which would not be evidence to charge a man in a civil suit, cannot be evidence to affect him in a criminal prosecution.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the prosecution said in reply, the man himself taking the note in his hand, holding it a minute, then returning it and says, it is a good bill, it will be paid; that is an acceptance to all intents and purposes, it is acknowledging that acceptance to be his acceptance; in this case it was as much as to say I have wrote R. B. upon it, and will pay it when it comes due.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no doubt at all, if no acceptance had been written at all upon this bill, what Beaty said, if he is proved to be the person addressed, would unquestionably amount to an acceptance; and if it had been charged in this indictment that this bill was drawn as it is stated to be, and that

             did fraudulently declare was a good bill, upon the bill being presented to him so purporting to be accepted by him (Beaty) but my doubt is, if in an indictment for a crime you take upon you to state distinct substantive facts, which are not essentially necessary to make out the crime, that is the subject and the gist of the indictment; you shall not be permitted to treat that as surplusage, and say, though we have charged an unnecessary fact, the indictment is good without it, we may consider it as struck out of the indictment, and we need not give it in evidence; the contrary of that I take to be clear and settled law. Here Mr. Recorder cited a case in which he was counsel some years ago in the King's Bench, in which upon an indictment for perjury, the writ of declaration was stated, and all the proceedings prior to joining the issue; that he called upon the prosecutor's counsel to produce the writ and other proceedings; that the counsel on the other side said, it was not necessary, and it was no matter whether the writ issued or not, it was totally immaterial; if that cause was called on for trial it was equally perjury of the witness if he was called upon to give evidence; lord Mansfield said it was very true, but as they took upon them to state the writ and other proceedings, they must produce them, and they must be proved to correspond with the issue upon the indictment; and though in this case it is only said to affect the person out of whose mouth it comes, it likewise affects the other, and though this is part of the offence of Beaty, it is as necessary to be proved against Hevey as him, upon the principle that what is stated in an indictment must be proved. If the jury are of opinion upon the evidence as to the merits, that the prisoners one or both are guilty, I shall reserve the point for the opinion of the judges.</p>
               <p>I think there is no weight in the objection made by the prisoners counsel at the outset, upon the nature of the charge itself, whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200085"></xptr> the evidence amounted to a conspiracy; he stated that which is true, that in the old law the word conspiracy in general, was appropriated very much to confedracies, formed to make false charges against people either in criminal or civil suits, and the antient writ of conspiracy at common law lay only in those cases; but it is equally true, that besides that kind of conspiracy for which the antient writ of conspiracy lay; at all times by common law it was an offence for more persons than one to confederate and unite together, in a plan to commit any fraud whatever, and the word conspiracy has been constantly applied to that kind of confederacy; I conceive there can be no doubt at this day, there are many precedents for it, that an indictment to charge persons with conspiring, confederating, and agreeing together to commit a fraud, is a good indictment, and I am clearly of opinion upon the general point, this indictment is well laid against the prisoners for that offence.</p>

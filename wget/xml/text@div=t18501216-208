                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Thomas Vesper; he has one partner; they are outfitters, at Limehouse. On Saturday evening, 23rd Nov., between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked if we cashed seamen's notes—I replied, "Yes," and he presented this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has my writing on the back of it—it is a note purporting to be from a master of a ship, directed to a firm, and payable to bearer or order, provided the seaman sails in the ship—he said he would lay out money to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and selected goods to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I handed him the difference, 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not say the name of the ship, but I understood it, and said I would send the things on board on the Monday morning, at one o'clock, when he said he would be alongside to receive them, and he consented to that—I asked him who wrote the note—he said, "The captain"—he called on the Monday, at ten o'clock—I had previously ascertained that the note was a forgery—I did not send the things—I made the prisoner make his mark on the back of the note—he said he could not write—I asked him how he managed when he signed articles—he said he touched the top of the pen, the captain holding it—I asked him his name, and he said, "Henry Cook," which is in my writing on the back of the note—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>: "Advance note. 23rd Nov., 1850.

               <p>George Bruce is the master; he is now gone on a voyage; he sailed this day week for Jamaica. The signature to this note is not his writing, and does not hear the slightest resemblance to it—on 23rd Nov. the ship was in port—I have examined <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Register of British and Foreign Shipping,</hi> and there is no other ship of the same name, or any J. Bruce—there is not, to my knowledge, any firm in Philpot-lane of the name of Bright and Green—I know Philpot-lane well—I have a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Castle Lackland's</hi> articles, which contain the names of the seamen—I do not of my own knowledge know their names—the original articles are gone to sea with the captain—I know of no such person as Henry Cook being on board the vessel—I was on board the ship nearly every morning for a fortnight before her departure, and saw nearly all the crew—they do not all generally join before the ship gets into the locks, going into the river.</p>

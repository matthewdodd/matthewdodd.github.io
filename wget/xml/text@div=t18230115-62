            . I am shopman to the prosecutor. On the 30th of December, the prisoner, myself, and the boy, were in charge of the shop. About eight o'clock in the evening, I asked the prisoner what money we had taken; he said about 8 l. I knew there was a good deal more, and asked how many sovereigns there were; he said six, I knew there were seven. I had counted the money myself, several times in the course of the day, and know that he knew there were seven; this excited my suspicion. Soon after this, he went to the till, and counted the money, and put it into a paper bag, then into a plumb-drawer - money was not usually kept there; this was an hour before shutting up; he then said he wanted to go out, and borrowed my hat, saying, he did not like his own, because it was a white one. When he was gone, I took the bag out, and counted the money in Holt's presence, and found six sovereigns wrapped up in paper, at the top then, 4 l. 12 s. 6 d. in silver, and a sovereign at the bottom, wrapped up in paper, by itself. I called Holt to notice it. I received one sovereign, and 1 s. after I had counted the money. I took it out of the till, and put the sovereign with the six others in the paper, and 3 s., with the silver; I left the one sovereign seperate as it was, there was then 4 l. 15 s. in silver, seven sovereigns, and one sovereign separate of itself; I replaced the bag in the same drawer, so as not to excite any suspicion; he came in about half an hour after, and said it was time to shut up; I asked him where my hat was, he said he had left it up stairs; I went up for it, leaving him in the shop, and when I came down, which was in about two minutes, he had got the money counted out on the counter, he asked me to count it after him, which I did, and only found 11 l. 0 s. 6 d. which consisted of seven sovereigns, and there was 15 s. deficient in the silver; I said nothing to him, but let him take the money to Mr. Loveridge; I told Holt and the porter what I had observed; and said I would go to Mr. Loveridge's after supper.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150033"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. When sovereigns were taken, were they wrapped in separate papers - A. No, there are two tills which have no locks to them; I had not heard of its being likely that he would leave; I know seven sovereigns were taken, as he counted six, and I took one after in his presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come from - A. Buckingham. I was in trouble there, about shooting at the Duke of Buckingham's carriage, to frighten the horses, about three years ago; they made a bungling job of it, and I was acquitted, and lived there for twelve months after, with Mr. Adams, whom I was with before.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long after the Queen's acquittal was this firing - A. A week after, it was occasioned by her acquittal. I was charged with a riot.</p>

            . I am shop-boy to Mr. Lowman. On the 29th of December, my master left town. Next day we were in care of the shop. Dancer called me to see the money counted, while the prisoner was out, about eight o'clock; it was in a plumb-drawer; there were six sovereigns in one paper, and one in a paper by itself; the money was on the counter when he called me; I did not see him take it from the plumb-drawer, I afterwards saw him put it into the plumb-drawer, he added a sovereign to the six in the paper; some silver was also taken out of the till and added to it; a sovereign was at the bottom of the bag, the silver on that, and the seven sovereigns at the top. The prisoner soon after returned and ordered us to put the shutters up, and soon after he took the money and went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the shop all day - A. No, I was backward and forward; I think I remember seeing the prisoner count the money out of the till. Dancer called me to see him count it; I was in and out afterwards. I did not know that the prisoner was likely to leave, but I thought Dancer would not stop long. I think the prisoner was out about an hour, I did not see him go out; the prisoner was a superior servant to Dancer.</p>

            . I live two doors from the prosecutor's, the money taken in his shop while he was absent, was to be brought to me. On the 30th of December, about ten o'clock at night, the prisoner paid me 11 l. 0 s. 6 d., it was seven sovereigns, and 4 l. 0 s. 6 d. in silver; Dancer called about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and made a communication to me, and the next morning I wrote to Mr. Lowman to come to town. I produced the money delivered to me, and the account of it, he put down 15 s. in copper which he offered to bring; I said he need not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Lowman was at your house the next night when the prisoner came - A. Yes, he was apprehended; he brought 12 l. that night, and was not charged with any deficiency in that.</p>

               <p>SIR - This comes with hopes of forgiveness from you. I am given to understand that it lays with you and Mr. Dancer, whether I have a trial or not, for I understand you can throw out the bill of indictment, when you go to file it. I wish to see you to-morrow, if you will have the goodness to come to me. I never was in Newgate before, and never will be again, if you get me out, which you can. For God's sake forgive me, for the sake of my wife and child.</p>

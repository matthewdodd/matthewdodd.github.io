                  </hi>. I live in Gravel-lane, Southwark. The prisoners lodged in my house—I missed from my back kitchen the table and other things men<lb></lb>tioned—the prisoners had left me on the 8th of Nov.—on the 11th of Nov and my witness hid ourselves in the coal-cellar when my son went out, at six o'clock in the morning; and in a quarter of an hour afterwards both the pri<lb></lb>soners camen—I heard them pass—they went up stairs, opened the door, and turned down the stairs again—I opened the coal-cellar door, and caught John Brown in the passage—he had not anything with him.</p>

I received charge of the prisoners on the 11th of Nov.—I went to No. 9, Pump-court, which was the address given by both the prisoners—I there found the table, the basket, the frying-pan, and other things which the prosecutor had lost—they are all here but the table—the prisoners claimed some duplicates and money which I found in the room—they applied to the Magistrate, and he ordered me to give up the duplicates to them—the woman did not say that he was her husband, and he never said she was his wife.</p>

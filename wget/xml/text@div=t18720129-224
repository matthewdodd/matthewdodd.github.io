               <p>stranger to me—on that day he called at my office, Walworth Road, and applied for a loan—I advance money on bills of sale occasionally—he offered, as security, a bill of sale on his furniture, at Norman Road, Stock<lb></lb>well—the understanding was that it would run over twelve months, but he said that it would only be a short time—I went to see the furniture, and asked him if he owed any rent—he said no, he had only been there a quarter, and the rent was paid up to Michaelmas—an appointment was made on the 23rd for the 25th—I asked him for the receipt for the rent at the settlement, and he produced this document, in Mr. Harris's pre<lb></lb>sence, which I believe to be genuine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An accountant—you called at my office and asked me if I lent money on bills of sale, and wanted a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not lend my own money on this occasion, but it was money at my banker's, and mine while it was in my possession—I asked you to make out an inventory, and when I saw the furniture I made out a bill of sale for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the absolute cash which you had was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a lump sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was charged for the twelve months' interest and expenses—I never stamped the bill of sale, because you wished it not to be re<lb></lb>gistered, and said you should take it up before it was due—it was not paid off—I charged 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you certainly did not tell me that the rent was not paid—when I could not get into the house, Mrs. Roach, your next neighbors, looked at the receipt, and said that it was not Mr. Garstin's writing—I had a man and a van outside, but did not clear every thing out—we seized under the bill of sale—I went into the house and asked Mrs. Webb for the 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and as she could not pay it we took the things, because we saw your trial at the Middlesex Sessions, in the newspapers—I have a list of the things I took away—the value of the fur<lb></lb>niture was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">informed, the prisoner that he was injuring himself by his cross-examination</hi>)—you first summoned me for utter<lb></lb>ing a document, calling it a valuable document, with intent to defraud, but the summons was dismissed—I first wrote out the document to receive these goods on 26th December—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is signed on the 23rd, but I wrote it on the 26th—it is signed by George Lee, the mortgagee, on the second bill of sale—I went to him on Sunday, the 24th, and told him what I had seen—I dated it the 23rd, and it was signed on Sunday the 24th, but I filled up the body on the 26th—it was signed before it was written—I gave Mr. Doey authority to seize on the morning of the 26th—I saw Mr. Gars tin, as near as I can possibly tell you, on the 28th—Mr. Lee charged 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I charged it to you for expenses you put me to in the first bill of sale—I did not take proceedings against you at once when I found that the receipt was a forgery, because you took pro<lb></lb>ceedings against me—I swear I paid you 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on November 25th—I swore in my deposition that I paid you 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was the money you took away—I retained money to redeem a pianoforte, which was at the Pantechnicon—this is the bill of sale and the inventory (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the whole of the bill of sale.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know, or were you told that the rent was paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him and he told me it was paid, and handed me this document—no reservation of money was made for the quarter's rent, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that I gave you that receipt after the deed was executed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I had not paid the money—you took it out of your pocket—I did not show it to Mr. Harris, but he was at the</p>

               <p>table, and I presume he saw it—Mr. Lee took no part in removing your furniture—I did not swear at the Court that the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was at my banker's—there were two bills of sale and two sets of expenses—I charged for mak<lb></lb>ing the deed—I have sized, but not for rent, and somebody else has got the pianoforte.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mrs. Dewsbury, whose money I lent to the prisoner, is my wife's sister—the actual amount the prisoner had, was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 25th November, and he was to get 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he got the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Mr. Harris's private office, where it was settled—I gave him the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 29th—I would not have parted with either of those sums if I had known the rent had not been paid—I always require the receipt when I lend money on a bill of sale—the charges the prisoner made against me were gone into before Mr. Ellison on six different days—the prisoner was assisted by a solicitor—he swore that he had not had more than 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had had 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me in hard cash—the claim was for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was the whole money involved in that matter—the furniture in the bill of sale was not entirely his own—he described a portion of his property, as being at the Bedford Pantechnicon.</p>

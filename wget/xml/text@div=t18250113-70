On Saturday, the 11th December, I went outside the door, and saw him take this money out of the till - I had some marked money in the till; there was 1 l. in silver there, when I left the shop - I had made a cross on the head of the silver; there was nobody in the shop, but him - I saw him go behind the counter - I did not see him take the money; but I came into the shop, and saw the till partly drawn out - I had left it close, when I went out - I examined the till, and found only 15 s.; I had left 20 s. in it - I charged him with it - he denied it; he then said, if I would not tell his father, he would deliver the money to me; he pulled out a half-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence - they had the mark which I had put upon them; no customer had come into the shop, from the time I left it, till I saw him go behind the counter - I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge.</p>

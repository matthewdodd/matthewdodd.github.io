On the 17th of November between eight and nine in the evening, I and my maid were in a little room backwards; I looked through a little window, and saw the prisoner taking three cheeses out of my shop window, he was within my shop; upon my calling out he was then got into the passage; he turned and threw them into the shop, and was taken before he got past my window, (a Cheshire, a double Glaucester, and a single Gloucester cheese produced in court;) these are the three cheese; I had a full view of the prisoner by the light of a lamp, and a candle in the shop.</p>

            . I was going in at Mrs. Watson's with a bill for small beer; when in the street I saw the prisoner take these cheeses up out of the window; I took him to be a porter; there was a companion of his stood close by the door; the prisoner was got out of the shop into the passage; Mrs. Watson called out; he flung the cheeses down on the floor just within the shop; I laid hold of him as he came out at the door, and secured him; the other man went off immediately.</p>

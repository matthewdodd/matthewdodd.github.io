I hare been 2 years buyer in the fancy department of the Bon Marche at Brixton—I gave orders to the prisons to write tickets, which he did at home—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of 29th December represents a genuine transaction—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice for one gross of blue and gold tickets delivered before 29th December, 1879—on his presenting it I initialled it and wrote "twenty-five shillings" in words, which is my usual practice, and I then handed it back to Shien I—I have nothing to do with paying the money—I ordered no gross of blue and gold tickets after the 29th, nor did I ever get such a supply—these are the initials of my name on the order for 12 dozen blue and gold tickets, 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 14th February, but they are not written by me or by my authority, and I never had the goods, or authorised Childs to present this for payment—I had not a gross of blue and gold tickets on 9th March—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my order, nor is this of February 5th for six dozen at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these initials are not written or authorised by me, nor did I order or receive the goods.</p>

               <p>days a week, and then I gave Mr. Redgrave authority to sign for tickets if any were on order—other persons may have ordered tickets at Christ<lb></lb>mas time—I have personally ordered about fourteen dozen of tickets from all parties since 28th December up to the time the prisoner ceased to work—I speak from memory only—there is no date upon the invoices when they are initialled; the date is furnished by the prisoner's receipt—after he ceased to work for us I saw him in Brixton Road—his ¦father has a toy-shop next door to us—we do not "cut" one against the ¦other—I have not given orders in public-houses, or initialed them there. Re-examined. Mr. Sackey was called by the prisoner at the police-court as his witness—I said to the prisoner "As it was ordered it is only just to you that the tickets should be received, so bring them, and I will sign for them," and he brought in a gross of tickets—he did not say that there was an order outstanding then—when the order was given the department I was mentioned—I did not order more than 18 tickets of Shiers from 29th December up to the time of his ceasing to be ticket-writer—we discovered the forced signature on 10th March; I was not there on the 9th—I never received 288 tickets from him in the fancy department—Redgrave is shop—I walker; he is in a different grade from the other assistants—when my I assistants sign in my absence the tickets are sent back for me to counter—I aim—I was not there to see whether the money was parted with—Mr. Abdy was an assistant on 1st January; he has initialled 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the I ticket—I no not know whether the shopwalker's signature is sufficient for I the cashier without my countersigning—I never saw 28 dozen blue and I gold tickets delivered in the fancy department after 12th December, and they could not have been there without my knowing it—there is no rivalry between our establishment and the next shop.</p>

John Davidson. I am a cashier at the Bon Marche; my office is on the ground-floor—it was the ordinary course for Shiers to bring me his account, and receive the money when it was signed by the buyer—I was not the cashier on 29th December, but I have the entry of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid to Lawrence who acted up to February 28th—I saw this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the police-court—the other part of it has been lost—it has Shires's signature; he presented it, and I paid him 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believed that these were Mr. Marney's initials—I should have paid without the initials if it was signed by someone in the department—I should not have paid unless I had believed that these were Marney's genuine initials—I should expect the person signing to put his true initials and not Marney's—these initials are an imitation of Marney's—I allowed Marney the initials the next day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There are two persons in the fancy department whose initials I should countenance, Mr. Marney and Mr. Redgrave—we do not allow the office boy to initial—I only pay three times a week—I paid the prisoner on 8th March 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the fancy department, and I do not see any other entry in March up to the time of the forgery—I paid for ticket for the other departments.</p>

                  </hi>.

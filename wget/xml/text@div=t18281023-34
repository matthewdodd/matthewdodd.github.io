               <p>DAVID HIATT. On the 19th of July, I and a friend named Goddard, went to the Lancers public-house, on <placeName id="t18281023-34-crimeloc220">Hounslow-heath</placeName>

               <p>Q. What makes you say it was Godwin? A. Because I knew his face. It was about one o'clock in the morning; I could see five or six yards, well enough to know any one - he was a stranger before, but I am certain he is the man: I lay still after he said that, and they took two sovereigns from me, a knife, a tobacco-box, a leather cap, and a black beaver-hat, also two or three halfpence; I wore the hat, and had the cap in my pocket - I saw Richard Pinder there, he was on the top of my hip, and helped to hold me down; I did not know him before, but am positive of him - we ran to the gate, hallooed for the watchman, and cried Murder! they got away, I do not know which way they went - Goddard and I went for assistance, and met Hall, the watchman; I described to him the person who held the pistol to me; he took me to a house where I saw a man and woman, I knew the man; I said I thought I knew him, but should know him a good deal better if he had his clothes on; he was undressed - he shut the door, and we went for Stevens, a constable, who returned with us to the house; the man came down stairs half-dressed, with his coat on his arm; I said, "That is the man who had the pistol;" I am sure he is the man; Hall told him to put his coat on; I said I knew him to be the man who had the pistol - we went into the house, and saw a pistol on the mantel-shelf - it was very much like the one which was held at me. Filby shewed me my hat next morning (Monday.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This took place about one o'clock in the morning? A. Yes. I was dozing off to sleep; the affair lasted four or five minutes - I was much alarmed and confused; I was taken to a public-house at Hounslow on the Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, and one of the constables pointed out Pinder and Mitcherson to me; they were in the same room as me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not as good an opportunity of pointing them out to him? A. Yes; I was three or four yards from them; there were five or six people there - I said I did not know Mitcherson - I said he was not one of the men, and he was let go; he knew I was making a charge of highway robbery; he was taken up on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. You say Pinder and Mitcherson were pointed out? A. Yes - I was taken into the room and asked if I know any of the men in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GODWIN. Q. The first time you came to my house I came down, and you said it was a younger man who robbed you? A. I said there was one in a flannel jacket, whose face I did not see, but he seemed to be a young man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you been at work for some days before? A. I had been reaping rye for Mr. Layson; I finished work about twelve o'clock on Saturday, and received my money; I then went to Belfont, got a job, and went to the Lancers about nine o'clock; Goddard and I were drinking with two more who came from Belfont - we had six pots of beer between four of us, and I had a glass of gin coming out; the landlord turned us out, and we were at the door for a few minutes - there was a considerable disturbance caused by the people wanting to get in, but it was not us, and then the woman took us; to the rick - she appeared a common woman; I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of these people were in custody in July, and examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and committed for trial; I had notice to attend at the September Session to prosecute them, and was bound over in a recognizance of 40l., but I did not attend; I went home to Brittle in Oxfordshire, two or three weeks after I was examined before the Magistrate - I was cutting oats during that time at Belfont; I received 3l. 5s. to pay my expences to Oxfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that to induce you to go away and not appear against them? A. Yes; I accepted that at the risk of forfeiting my recognizance - I was at home all the time; Filby, the constable, came down and fetched me here.</p>

            . I am constable of Hounslow. I was out on duty on Saturday night, the 19th of July, three or four hundred yards from the hay-rick, and four or five hundred from Godwin's house, when I heard loud cries of Murder! I waited a few minutes, and heard it again; I ran down the town towards London, in a direction towards Godwin's house, and when about forty yards from his house, I heard a door either open or shut - the sound came from Godwin's house; I ran along the back of the town, turned round our watch-house, and met Hiatt and Goddard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230026"></xptr>and from what Hiatt said I took him to Godwin's house, and called Godwin up; he made his appearance at the door undressed, as if he had come out of bed - Hiatt was close by - I said "These two men have been robbed, and you are suspected to be one of the men;" this was before Hiatt had said any thing - Godwin said to both of us, "If I am the man, say so;" I told Hiatt not to swear to him without he was certain; Hiatt then said, "I don't much think he is the man;" he said nothing more then - Godwin then shut the door; we went a few yards, then Hiatt said something; I then went and called Stevens - we all returned to Godwin's house, having been absent half an hour or more - we knocked at the door, Godwin looked out of window; we said we wanted to speak with him again - he came down directly, as soon as he could, and opened the door; he had got his trousers on and his jacket on his arm - Hiatt immediately said, "You are the man that lay on my breast, and put the pistol against my head;" (Godwin put his jacket on after that) he said,"If I was the man, why did not you say so before?" Hiatt said, "I can swear to you better with your clothes on than I could with them off," this was before he had his jacket on; I asked Hiatt if he was quite sure he was the man - he said he was; we had a candle; I do not think there was any candle the first time - if I recollect right, there was a light the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing take place about his jacket? A. No, not that I recollect; he put it on because I told him to put on the rest of his clothes, as I must take him into custody - this was after the conversation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then that was not to enable the prosecutor to judge whether he was the man, but because he was going into custody? A. Certainly - Godwin said several times that he was not the man; I said nothing to Hiatt after his jacket was put on. On the shelf, nearest to the fire-place down stairs, there was an old pistol and a little saw; I afterwards searched the hay-rick and found an old hat, which Goddard claimed - a purse was afterwards found, which Hiatt owned.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hounslow. - I was called up by Hall, about two o'clock in the morning of the 19th of July, and went with him, Hiatt, and Goddard to Godwin's house; Hall knocked at the door, and said "Godwin, we want you" - he looked out of window and said he would come down directly; he did so and opened the door - he brought no light with him, and we had none; I could see him - he was in his shirt; I do not believe he had any thing else on - he was just as if he had got out of bed; he said if we would wait while he put on his clothes, he would come down; this was at the door - we waited at the door: he went up and came down again with his trousers and waistcoat on, his shoes in his hand, and his coat on his arm; I had run home and got a light by that time - we then all went in and searched the house: Hiatt said that was the man who robbed him - that he presented a pistol at him; I believe he made no answer - he was very willing to go with us; he denied the charge, and said he was not at the place - he said he was at the Cricketers, public-house, and left there at six o'clock, and had been in bed ever since; we found a few shillings on him - I saw an old pistol in the house; Hall and I searched the hay-rick, and I think it was he who found the bag or purse - he picked it up and took possession of it; I was present when it was shown to Hiatt, who owned it - there was nothing in it.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. Did you carefully search Godwin's clothes? A. Hall did in my presence - we searched all his pockets carefully; the pistol was an old one - an old apron or something of that kind, was over it.</p>
               <p>Q. The first proposal about dressing came from Godwin himself? A. Yes - I was bound over to appear at the September Session, but could do nothing, without Hiatt; we afterwards found he had been bribed to go out of the way - I am certain the proposal to dress, proceeded from Godwin and not from Hiatt.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Pinder exceedingly angry, as an honest man would be? A. He was very angry; I did not hear Hiatt say Mitcherson was not one of them - I was not present all the time, as I took Pinder to the cage; Mitcherson was let go about half-past six or seven o'clock, and taken again about seven next morning.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You were bound over to prosecute? A. Yes, and attended at the September Session, but Hiatt had absconded; I went down into the country and asked him to come up, and he came - I did not make him a prisoner - I prosecuted Godwin, Pinder, and Mitcherson for a riot in the Mgaistrates' room; while I was giving my evidence, Pinder came and said "You bl-y little rogue," and struck me.</p>

            . I am high-constable of Hounslow. I have a hat which I received from Cox; I have had it ever since - the prisoners Godwin, Pinder and Mitcherson have been in custody ever since July; they were indicted for a riot, but have not been tried, as a principal witness was not present.</p>
               <p>DAVID HIATT. It is my hat, and the one I had on the night I was robbed - here is my neck-handkerchief; it is torn - I did not lose that.</p>
               <p>Godwin put in a written Defence stating that on the 19th of July, he went to bed between six and seven o'clock, being unwell, and slept till he was awoke by his wife, on the prosecutor and officers calling him, and that on his going down, both Hiatt and Goddard said he was not one of the men, as they were younger.</p>

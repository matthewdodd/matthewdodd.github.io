                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the public drawing-office of the Bank of England. On 9th July the prisoner came and presented this bank post-bill for payment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a seven-days' bill, and was due when presented—there was a crowd round the counter, and I requested him in a general way to receipt the bill with his name and address—he went to a desk which is there for that purpose, and a few minutes after presented it again with the address on it—it now has, "Received the within amount; A. Churchill, 3, Park-place, New North-road"—the bill is endorsed payable to Allnutt and Arbouin, and that is signed, "Henry Bolton"—it occurred to me that the endorsement was not correct—the word "Bearer" is not distinct, and knowing Messrs. Allnutt's to be a London firm, my impression was that it should have come through a banker—I conferred with Mr. Hodgkinson, the principal of the office, and he came forward and asked the prisoner if it was his bill—he said he was sent by a party to receive the money—Mr. Hodgkinson asked him by whom he was sent—he said by a person in a coffee-house, in Bishopsgate-street, and that he was desired to write that person's name on it—Mr. Hodgkinson sent for an officer, and the prisoner immediately fainted—the officer came, took him to a private room, and I left him in his charge—I had not looked at the bill when I told him to receipt it—when I received it again, the receipt was apparently recently written—it is payable to Henry Bolton, or order.</p>

On 9th July, about 2 o'clock, I was called to the public drawing-office, and found the prisoner there—he had fainted—I received this bill from a gentleman in the Bank, and when the prisoner came to, I asked him how he came possessed of the bank post-bill he had just presented for payment—he said a person had given it him outside a coffee-shop in Bishopsgate-street, who he had never seen before, and did not know, and he was to meet that party in the evening, and give him the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and retain the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. himself, and he was to write the name of "A. Churchill, 3, Park-cottages, Islington," on the bill—I saw the bill was payable to Allnutt and Arbouin, and I asked him whether he was not in their employ—he hesitated at first, and then laid he was—I asked whether he did not see when he wrote the name on the back of the bill, that it was payable to his masters—he said not before he got to the Bank, and that was the reason he fainted—I took him to the station.</p>

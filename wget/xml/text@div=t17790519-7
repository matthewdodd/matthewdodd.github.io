               <p>On the 2d of February I supped and spent the evening at the Red-Lion, at Barnet, with the Northampton corps of officers. Between two and three in the morning a part of us came for London. As we were to come over Finchley-common, I put my property in a small pocket-book, to the amount, in money and notes, of 51 l. 10 s. 6 d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190008"></xptr> came to Mr. Wood's hotel in <placeName id="t17790519-7-crimeloc40">Covent Garden</placeName>

               <p>You had a lodging at this hotel for some time before? - Yes, all the winter; but the prisoner had not been porter all that time. I enquired if he had found any pocketbook in my boots; he said he had not; I told him if he had, I would reward him properly for it if he would deliver it to me, he still persisted in declaring he had not seen it; I enquired of the other porters and the people about the house, and they all denied it. I mentioned it to Mr.

             the next morning; he advised me to advertise them, which I did the next morning, offering ten guineas reward for their restoration. I sent into the country the next morning, and had an exact description of the notes. After receiving that description, I went to the Bank and stopped the payment of the bank post-bill; I went to the banker's, where the Bath bank post bill was payable, and stopped the payment of that. A fortnight or three weeks after I received a letter from Mr. Langston, a banker in St. Clement's-Lane, where the Bath bills are payable, informing me, that such a bill I had given him notice of had been offered for acceptance. Upon the receipt of that letter, Mr. Wood (who has indeed been indefatigable in the matter) attended me to the banker's. They said a porter had brought the bill, who said, he came from the Cannon Coffee-house. We went there; the porter there denied it; we took him to the banker's; the banker could not identify the person of that man; but from a great many circumstances, we presumed it was the prisoner. I was informed by the constable in the evening, that the bank post bill was found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you loose any money. - The pocketbook contained eight guineas; a bank bill for twenty-seven pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence; a Bath bank bill for five guineas and a bank note for ten pounds; in the whole fifty-one pounds ten shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect where you pulled your boots off? - In my own room.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect who took them? - No. There is one circumstance I should mention: as I came in very late, and was a good deal tired, I desired the chamberlain to undo the boot, because it was fastened in a particular manner at the knee; and then I recollect the boots being upon the ground subsequent to the chamberlain's being in the room, but whether he took the boots away or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You sat up very late, was you perfectly sober? - I cannot say that I was perfectly sober, but I was well enough to recollect every circumstance that passed.</p>
               <p>Did you ride on horse-back to town? - No, in a chaise.</p>
               <p>Was the pocket-book in the leg of the boot or under your foot? - I put it below my calf, it is a very small pocket-book, what is called a Newmarket pocket-book.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect when the chamberlain went out of the room? - I do not recollect who took the candle out that night.</p>
               <p>I understood you, that when you rung the bell for the porter, and the prisoner came up, he told you he had taken your boots down and had cleaned them? - Yes; but it is usual some times for the chamberlain to come in, and take the boots out of the room, and put them out at the door.</p>
               <p>I suppose it is not usual for the porter to be in the bed-chambers? - It is an unusual thing to see a porter in a bed-chamber, unless he is rung for to light the fire or so. The prisoner has had it in his power to take property of mine to three times that amount; my box was always open, and he was frequently backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This happened on the 2d of February? - Yes</p>
               <p>Did not you go back the next day to the inn at Barnet from an apprehension that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190009"></xptr> might have left the book there? - I did; but I had not the least doubt in my own mind where I had left it, but Mr. Wood said possibly I might have dropped it in the chaise, or have left it there.</p>

               <p>On a Saturday morning when I returned from market, Captain Phillips told me he had lost his pocket-book, and mentioned the circumstance he has now related to the court. The prisoner at the bar was the porter whose turn it was to sit up that night; I charged him with taking the pocket-book; he denied it strongly. I laid before him all the consequences of such behaviour; and we offered all the servants a reward for the pocket-book. They all said they knew nothing about it. I advised Mr. Phillips to go back to Barnet, that probably he might have left it at the inn or in the chaise; but we could hear nothing of it for some time. About a fortnight after I turned the prisoner away, we received a letter from Clement's Lane of the five guinea Bath bill being stopped; I gave the letter to Captain Phillips; we went there. I asked if they could recollect what kind of man it was that brought it; they gave a description which nearly answered to the prisoner; they told us the porter said he came from the Cannon coffee-house; as I had turned the prisoner away the day before, I supposed he was gone to live there. We went to the Cannon coffee-house; we saw the master of the house; he produced a porter much resembling the prisoner. We took him back to the banker. When he came there they thought him much like the man that brought the note, but could not identify him. We asked the porter several questions, whether he knew the prisoner; we found he knew him very well; he also knew one Matthews who had formerly lived with me, who likewise was very intimate with the prisoner. I sent for Matthews; he came about eleven o'clock at night; he said he had seen the prisoner; having been rather kind to the young fellow, I said, Do you know Will that lived with me? Yes, I do. When did you see him? I saw him yesterday. I said I have been no bad friend to you, I insist upon your telling me the truth; have you seen any notes upon him, or seen him full of cash lately? he said yes; a Bath bank note.</p>
               <p>Is that man here? - Yes; he said, he received the note from Stout to get it accepted, but it had been stopped.</p>
               <p>Did he say how much the Bath bank bill was for? - Yes; for five guineas.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he went with it to get it accepted? - To the banker's in Clement's Lane. I asked him if he had seen Stout with any other bills or with money; he said, yes; there was a bank post bill for twentyseven pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence, which he had to carry to the bank; he said he mistrusted something, as the banker refused to accept the bill; he was therefore afraid things were not right, and he returned it again to him; I asked him if he recollected where the prisoner lodged; he said, he did; and had no objection to go with me to take him. I called upon Mr. Prothero, and we both went and took him in bed at his lodgings; we charged him with the fact; he produced the bank post bill, and gave it up, and he seemed sorry he had not given it up before.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner four years.</p>
               <p>When did you receive any notes from him? - He came to me on the 20th or 21st of April; he called at my lodgings, as my landlord informed me; not being at home, he came to me at Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</p>
               <p>To Wood. Was that after you turned him away? - I believe the same day.</p>
               <p>Matthews. He called me out; he took out this note of five pounds five shillings, as we were going along Portugal-street. He told me he had left Mr. Wood's.</p>
               <p>What did he take it out of? - Out of his pocket; it being cut in two, I told him I did not think it was good. I went to the banker's in Clement's Lane, it being three minutes past five o'clock, they bid me call in the morning; I called in the morning; they said it belonged to a gentleman that had lost it; they asked me where I brought it from; I said from the Cannon coffee-house; I called upon the prisoner, and asked him to take a walk with me, because I wanted him to speak before witnesses; I wanted to ask him him how he came by it; then he pulled out the other note of twenty-seven pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Should you know it if you was to see it again? - I dare say I should; it was in two pieces.</p>
               <p>(The note shown to the witness.)</p>
               <p>This is the note to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner desire you to do with that note? - As we were going along, I asked him how he came by that? he said he found it, and he wanted me to pass it; we went before this to an acquaintance where I asked him the question how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - One Mr. Allen in Tottenham Court Road? the prisoner said he found them and the four guineas at the foot of the stairs, in Mr. Wood's house.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether he found this loose, or how? - He said he found the pocket-book at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any thing of a pair of boots? - Not at that time. I asked him if Mr. Wood, and the Gentleman, never asked him about them; he said, yes; but as he had once denied it, he would never own it; and he wanted to persuade me to take this note of 27 l. 17 s. 6 d. back to Mr. Wood, and say I found it; I told him I would not, but if he would return me the pocket-book with all its contents, I would take it back to Mr. Wood, (as I had the pleasure of living once with him) and tell him I found it; he said, he knew nothing of the 10 l. note, nor the four guineas, as the gentleman said he had lost a 10 l. bank note, and eight guineas, and he found only four guineas. I went to Mr. Wood; he was not at home; I waited till he came home, and told him all the knowledge I had of it.</p>
               <p>Was you present when that was found upon him? - I was.</p>
               <p>Then you did not take him up; you did not stop him at that time? - No; I immediately applied to Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190011"></xptr>- ALLEN, sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in John-street, Tottenham-Court Road.</p>
               <p>Are you intimate with Matthews? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he and the prisoner come to your house on the 21st of April last? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>What passed between them? - I was out when they came, but they waited till I came home; and Matthews told me a story that the prisoner had drawn him in by giving him this Bath bank bill of 5 l. 5 s. to change; the prisoner said he found it in Mr. Wood's house, and a bank post bill of 27 l. 17 s. 6 d. and likewise four guineas in money. We advised him to take the money, pocket-book, and notes, back again; Matthews said, if you do not like to go yourself, if you will give me the book and its contents, I will take it back to Mr. Wood's; the prisoner wanted to persuade him to deny it; Matthews then said he would go and inform Mr. Wood of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood. The prisoner did not deny any thing at all in his way to the round-house; he made it appear, that there were a bricklayer, and carpenter, who saw him pick the book up in the morning, whom we know had part of the money. He was very ready to give up every circumstance; it was the bricklayer had the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>For the PRISONER.</p>
               <p>A witness sworn. I have known the prisoner ten or a dozen years; I never heard any thing of him but what was very good; I was his fellow-servant at the time.</p>

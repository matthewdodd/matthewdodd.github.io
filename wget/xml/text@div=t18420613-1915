                  </hi>. I have a partner, and keep the Crosby Head, in Pit field-street, Hoxton. The prisoner was my barman—I marked eight half-crowns on the Saturday, and on the Monday four half-crowns, eight shillings, and four sixpences—Inspector Shackell saw me mark them—on Tuesday night, the 17th of May, the prisoner went to his supper—I placed the four half-crowns, eight shillings, and four sixpences, in the till, clear<lb></lb>ing the whole of the money that was in the till previously—he finished his supper a few minutes after nine o'clock, and went into the shop—at ten o'clock I cleared the whole money from the till, with the exception of the nine shillings—I examined it, and found a deficiency—I called Inspector Shackell and Brannan, and gave the prisoner in charge—he was searched, and some money found on him—amongst it was two shillings which I had placed in the till on that Monday night—I had marked no shilling on Saturday—Brannan asked where he got it from—he said he had taken these two shillings in change for half-a-crown last week, and then he hesitated, and said on Saturday.</p>

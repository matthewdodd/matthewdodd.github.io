As I receive my money in the day, I put it into a cash-box, which, at night, I keep up stairs under my bed - I take an account of what I receive at nigh (reads)."On the 28th of March, I had 8l. 7s. in silver, 1l. 8s. in copper, and thirty 1l. bank notes." On the 29th of March I had occasion to pay 7l. - I brought my cash-box down about half-past ten o'clock in the morning - I took out 6l. or 7l., but did not count it then. About twelve o'clock, a person called for some money - I opened the box, counted the money, and found I was 8l. deficient, 6l. in notes, and the rest in silver. I accused my shopman of it, and discharged him - I did not suspect the prisoner - I had marked my notes before I put them into the box - I believe I marked them all - I marked those which were stolen. In consequence of something that took place on the 12th of May, I went to Mr. Scovell's, to whom, I understood, a payment had been made, and received five 1l. notes of him (I produce them). They have my mark on them,"28th of March, 1817", in my hand-writing, which enables me to say they are part of the notes I put into my box on the 28th. I got an officer, and told the prisoner I wished to go into her bed-room-she went up - I told her I wanted to search her box-she unlocked it, and I told the officer to search it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and her about the robbery - A. Yes - I asked her how she came by the five 1l. notes she had lent my wife that afternoon; she said they were her own. I told her not to tell me a falsehood, for they were the notes for which I discharged the shopman - She paused a moment, denied it at first, but afterwards acknowledged they were the notes, saying, she had found them on the stairs at the time we went to search the young man's box-it was above six weeks before that that I searched his box-the officer then asked her why she did not give them to her master then, as she knew they were his property - She made no reply. I asked her if she had any more property about her, and she told me no, not a farthing-the officer then said we will search her person. She turned her pocket out - We found a purse, containing twenty shillings in silver - I called my wife up to search her person - She found nothing on her-my wife said she had seen her on Saturday with a handful of notes; she replied, that she had received a pension; I did not know she had any pension to receive. The officer said he would search the bed; she replied, "keep the five 1l. notes, and let me go." The bed was searched, and an apron of the prisoner's was found, made into a bag; it contained a paper bag, which had fourteen 1l., and two 2l. bank notes; 15l. 12s. in three shilling tokens, 2l. in half crowns, 2l. 12s. in one shilling and sixpenny tokens, 2l. 9s. in shillings, and four sixpences; she had not received a farthing in wages from me while she was in the house. During the time she lived with me, she cut her finger, and went to the doctor with it; she returned, crying; her mistress asked her what was the matter; she said the doctor had charged 3d. for her finger, and she had not got a farthing to pay him for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I made out the account that very day. I keep a young man and a boy. I never kept two servants(looks at the note). This is Tabernacle, 28-3, on one of them, which means, I took it of Tabernacle, on the 28th of March; I did not tell her she had better confess. I had turned away the shopman and warehouseman. The warehouseman had not been in the house on the 28th.</p>

             re-examined. (looking at the notes). They are marked with my hand-writing. I had them all in my possession on the 28th of March-there are two dated the 28th of March; the others are marked, but not dated. I am sure the two are part of the 8l. that were taken out of my box on that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The dates denote that they were in my possession on the 28th of March. I did not pay any money away after I took them. I did not receive them until four o'clock in the afternoon. I received them from Tabernacle, who pays me after he leaves the India House. I did not pay any money away after that or give change. I might have changed a 1l. note in silver.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q.When you get up, do you put the same clothes on - A. I do; but sometimes leave the key of my box behind me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. On the morning of the 29th, when you missed your notes, did you discover that you had lost any of those you took from Tabernacle - A. I particularly remembered I had lost five 1l. notes which I had taken of him; only two which have been produced to-day have his name on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Among those you found in the bed were there any of his - A.(looking at them). These two were with his name on them, but only one with the date. I receive money from him every month - I must have received them of him at the same time, although it is not dated, because I do not keep my money so long. There is another of Tabernacle's dated the 28th. I leave my room at six o'clock in the morning, leaving my wife in bed.</p>
               <p>HANNAH CLARKE. I get up about eight o'clock. I cannot remember what time I left the room. I do not remember returning to my room after I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My room-door is not locked; I have lodgers in the house. I have seen the prisoner wear the apron out of which the bag is made; I knew it by the pattern. There is no female in the house but myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi> 5). On Saturday, 18th January, I went with a brother constable, named Chamberlain, to 26, Sidmouth Street, Gray's Inn Road—I had received information from my superintendent to apprehend Clancy as a deserter, but not to be charged until further directions—I watched outside 26, Sidmouth Street—about five minutes past seven in the evening, the prisoner came out of the house, and we followed him to Tottenham Court Road, then to the corner of Bedford Street, where he crossed the road and went and looked in a brush shop immediately opposite Bedford Street—I was on his left side, and Chamberlain on his right—I asked him if his name was Clancy—he said, "I don't know you"—I then asked him again if his name was Clancy—he said, "No, my name is Reed"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "In Great College Street, Camden Town"—I asked him if he had just left there—he said, "Yes, and I have come by the way of the Gray's Inn Road"—I said, "I shall take you into custody for being a deserter from the Royal Engineers"—we were both in plain clothes—he immediately tripped up my heels with a stick or umbrella between my legs, and threw me down on the kerb—when I got up, I saw him running along Bedford Street as fast as he could, and Chamberlain following him towards Bedford Square—I cried, "Stop thief," and at the end of Bedford Street, turning round the south side of the square, I cried "Stop thief"—he deliberately turned round; I saw his face plainly, and I heard something whizz by like a bullet close by my hair—I then saw a flash and heard a loud report—I was about fifteen or twenty yards from him—Chamberlain was nearer to the prisoner than me, but more to the left, running across—the prisoner turned to the right, and ran round the railings of the square towards the left—after running a short distance further, he turned to the left—I had gained ground on him by that time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240025"></xptr>
               <p>when he discharged another barrel at Chamberlain—at that time Cham<lb></lb>berlain fell; he was about twelve yards from him when he fired the shot—when he fired the second shot I saw something shining in his hand like a revolver—I saw his face blaze from the flash of the revolver at that time—I still ran after the prisoner, crying, "Stop thief"—Chamberlain got up again and also ran after him—we pursued him some distance further, and Cham<lb></lb>berlain got within five or six yards of him—he was stopped by a coachman, named John Hurst—just at that time Chamberlain caught him up, and while doing so, I heard another report of the revolver and saw a flash—when I got up, the prisoner was on the ground—I saw Chamberlain strike him on the head with the butt end of the revolver—Chamberlain's face was blackened from the powder; his whiskers and hair were singed from the flash of the powder—one of the bystanders said to the prisoner, "You rascal, did you intend to shoot me? what did you want to shoot me for?"—he said, "I did not intend to shoot you"—he was asked who he intended to shoot, and he nodded to Chamberlain—he was taken in custody—I kept him on the ground until we got sufficient strength to take him to the station—I was much exhausted—I walked on one side of him to the station, and some<lb></lb>body else on the other, and Chamberlain behind—on the way to the station the prisoner said, "Are you two police officers?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, I think I fought a very good battle in a very fair duel; I am only sorry I have not got payment for it"—I saw the pistol produced by Cham<lb></lb>berlain at the station; it was a revolver with six chambers, three of them were loaded and three had been discharged—it appears that the revolver did not revolve properly at the time, it passed out here—this pin projected and caught the last bullet—I know that it is one of the bullets he is supposed to have fired on this occasion, because if the bullet had been there before, the barrel could not have revolved at the two first fires—I searched the prisoner at the station, and took from him three keys—I accompanied my superin<lb></lb>tendent and inspector with them to the address in Sidmouth Street and made a search—they opened one drawer of a chest of drawers in the room—the inspector found some things; I did not see them all—I found some powder and other things.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 163). I was with Chown, watching the house in Sidmouth Street, and saw the prisoner come out—we followed him through Regent Square to Tottenham Court Road—he had got about fifty or sixty yards before we began to follow him—he looked round when he came out at the door, then he went in the direction of Tottenham Court</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240026"></xptr>
               <p>Road, and we followed him—we came up to him at the end of Bedford Street, Tottenham Court Road—Chown asked him if his name was Clancy—he said, "I don't know you"—he asked him again, and he said, "No, my name is Reed, and I live at Great College Street, Camden Town—Chown then said, "We are two officers, and shall take you into custody for being a deserter from the sappers," or "engineers," I do not know which—almost before he said the words, the prisoner put his umbrella between his legs and tripped him up, and ran away—I followed him; but just as I started, two gentlemen came in front of me, just between us two—the gentlemen stopped me a minute or two from running after him, and then I pursued him—he ran into Bedford Square and turned to the right—I saw Chown follow him—he was just behind me, at my right, rather nearer to him than Chown—I was on his left—after he had run about fifteen yards past the corner of the square, he turned to the right and fired at Sergeant Chown, who was about fifteen or twenty yards from him—I heard the report, and saw the flash as well—I was within four or five yards of him when he started—he then turned back and started off again, and gained ground of me—he ran about forty or fifty yards, then turned round to the left and fired at me—just at that time I stepped in a gully-hole and almost fell down, near a railing—I was ten or twelve yards from him—he was in the road, a little in advance of me—I think my falling in the gully-hole was the only thing that saved me—I saw the flash—Chown was following—I got up, and he gained ground of me again for a short distance; then I gained ground on him very fast—it appeared that he could not run very much after that—he was turning round to the left—I was within five or seven yards—he was just in the act of turning again, and I saw Hurst coming up—I called to him, and he caught hold of him and twisted him round to the road, and by that time I bad got hold of him—I tripped him, and just as he was in the act of falling, I saw a revolver in his right hand—I had got hold of him by the right shoulder with my left hand, and saw the revolver straight up, close by my ear—I caught hold of it with my right hand and pressed it, so, and just at that moment, I was slipping at the time, it went off, exploded—seven, eight, or ten persons were present at the time it went off—he had then hold of the handle of it, though I had hold of the barrel, and the coachman was going to take hold of it at the time—I did not feel the shot, but it blackened my face and whiskers, and my coat was scorched by the powder—it looked blue—I took the revolver out of his hand, and struck him on the head with it twice—a gentleman who has a shop in Endell Street came up while he was still on the ground, who said, "You rascal, did you intend to shoot me?"—he said, "No"—just as he was getting up, he said, "I did not intend to shoot you; it was him, calling to me"—he said, "No harm," nodding towards me; I could not exactly catch the words—I went with him to the station, and had hold of him a short distance—some gentlemen came up and assisted—on the way to the station, I heard him say something about having fought a good battle—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the revolver I took from the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. On 18th January, about eight in the evening, I was passing through Bedford Square—I heard the report of a pistol, and I believe I heard a cry of "Stop thief," or "Stop murderer," or something of that sort—I turned round, and the prisoner ran up to me—I caught hold of his collar, but he swung himself from me—I seized him again a second time, in the road, and at that instant he fired—Chamberlain came up, and we took him between us—he was thrown into the road.</p>

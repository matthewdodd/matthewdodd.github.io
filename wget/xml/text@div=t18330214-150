No, we only had a pot of beer between seven, and it was so bitter I could not drink it; the landlady was close to the bar when the prisoner laid hold of me, and three or four men in the tap-room called out, "Don't hurt him" - they were looking at him when he took the money; they were all of the party - I know they were of the party, because they called out his name, they said,"Do not knock him about, Chaplin;" I think I gave the same account before the Magistrate - I cannot say exactly, as it is a month ago; I had not seen the prisoner before that night - I did not see him give any money, but I saw him give something into the hand of another person, who walked off with it; I lost every game - I was taken to the watch-house, but not charged with being drunk - I cannot tell how the prisoner was dressed; I had been knocked about terribly before I lost my money, but I had no idea about its being taken from me; no angry words passed between me and the prisoner - I do not know what has become of my money; I got it by my work - I have worked for myself the last two years; I had 3s. 4d. in my pocket, and 10d. was in halfpence - I had spent 2d. before I went to the public-house, and then I spent 4d. for beer, and had lost 3d.</p>

            . I was at that time shopman to Mr. Sears, a hosier, No. 32, Barbican, next door to the Red-cross-tap - there is a passage at the end of our window which goes up to the Red-cross tap. About twenty minutes after five o'clock on the day in question, I was behind the counter; I heard a noise as if some person had been knocked or had fallen against the window - I looked and saw the prosecutor knocked against the left-hand doorpost, by the prisoner, with his face covered with blood; as soon as I got round to the door, I saw the prosecutor forcing his way up the passage - there were three persons resisting him, and would not let him pass; the prisoner then took hold of him again by the collar, or by the ears, I cannot say which, and knocked him against the wall in the passage, and it seemed to me to be with violence - the people gathered round, and some persons called out"Don't hurt him," or "Do not hurt the man;" the prisoner then dragged him out of the passage, struck him twice, and the last time, he knocked him against the window of Mr. Borringdon, the grocer - the Policeman then came up, collared the prisoner, and took him into custody; there were several persons round the prisoner when he was taken - I did not see either of them walk off, nor could I see where they came from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk? A. He seemed to me to be sober. I was within arm's reach of him - I could not say whether it was a quarrel, but it came from a very noisy bad house; I rather think the prosecutor kicked the prisoner.</p>

             (City Police-constable 78). I was on duty at Barbican, at half-past five o'clock; I took the prisoner - I had seen him knock the prosecutor off the pavement into the road, and I took him to the station; I asked him why he struck the prosecutor - he said it was only done in a bit of a lark; I asked the prosecutor what he had been doing to the prisoner - he said they had been gambling at the Red-cross tap; he said he had lost 2s. 6d. and 1d., and the prosecutor had robbed him of it - I asked the prisoner whether he had got any money; he said No - I searched him, and found a key on him, but no money - there were two men came to the watch-house, and the watch-house keeper would not let them in; they said the prisoner was innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took the prisoner were there any more about him who could have received any thing from him? A. O, no, my Lord, not within ten or twelve feet; I have heard what the prosecutor has said about his handing something to another man, but it was quite impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took the prisoner was any body near enough for the prisoner to reach, to whom he had an opportunity of handing any thing? A. He had an opportunity, certainly, there was a crowd about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the prisoner by the arm? A. No, by the collar - I am in the habit of keeping a sharp look out on prisoners; I had not two minutes walk to take him to the watch-house - I particularly observed what he did as we went along - I did not see him hand any thing to any one; if he had done so I think I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent - the prosecutor kicked my master on the knee, and **; I took him by the collar and pushed him down in the passage; I was merely taking my master's part.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Reynold's-court, Ropemaker-street, Finsbury; I am a painter and glazier - the prisoner works for me. On the 18th of January we were in the Redcross parlour with a person named Stevens, having something to drink - the prisoner and I had occasion to go into the back yard, and we heard a dispute in the coffee-room; we went up to it, and it was with the prosecutor and some others, about a pot or a pint of beer, which the prosecutor had lost and would not pay for - they instantly began pushing him about, one to the other; he was pushed into the yard, and then into the tap-room and there some person, but I cannot say who, struck him - and I suppose he mistook me for the person, as he instautly at that mo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140068"></xptr>ment gave me a severe kick on the knee - he then kicked me on the ***; and after that, but not before, I certainly, slapped his face with my open hand - I had not struck him when he first kicked me, as I made the remark, "You are a deformed man, and I will not strike you;" after I had struck the prosecutor the prisoner took him by the shoulders, and turned him down the passage, but I did not see him throw him against any thing - I was in the tap-room, but I did not see him throw the prosecutor across the seat.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not throw him across the seat? A. No, I did not see it; whether it happened or not I cannot say - I was among them; I swear postively I do not know that it was done - when the prisoner took him and turned him down the passage he went out at the street door, and I went into the parlour; I had not been playing- I know the character of the house, but I did not see that part of it; I had been into the parlour, and went into the tap upon hearing the noise, and crossed into the coffee-room, which belongs to the tap - there are two parts of the house, and a passage in between them.</p>

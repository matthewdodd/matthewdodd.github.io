               <p>Q. In the last month, and some time preceding, had he been thrashing in Warehall barn - A. Yes. The only person. I had entrusted him with great confidence; it was his business, when he had done work, to lock up the barn, and to bring the keys to my house, and to come for them in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of gates are there to your barn - A. A large pair of gates, and the yard is inclosed by a high wall, and large gates to the wall of the yard; the gates of the yard and of the barn are on the same construction, and the same sort of fastenings, and a wicket to each of the gates; the wicket is locked by a key, and she gates are fastened by a bar and a pin.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 19th of March you, I believe, had been out late - A. Yes, I had been in town, I came home about twelve o'clock, I sent my boy with the horse, he returned, and said he found the gates open. In consequence of that I went to the barn, I found the gates open, I went into the barn, there was a large heap of corn, it was visible that there had been a quantity taken from the bulk.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not given him any directions for carting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080072"></xptr> any of that heap, had you. - A. No, he had not been working there the day preceding, nor any other person whatever. On the next morning the prisoner was taken in custody, I went to his house, his wife came out, I told her that I had come to search for property that I had lost; in a shed attached to his house I found a quantity of wheat in two sacks, about two bushels in another sack. I found about two bushels of peas and beans, and one sack marked with my own name, I also found a fat hog feeding upon clean wheat, which I had no doubt is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of wheat at that time - A. Fourteen or fifteen shilling a bushel. It is a thing that is never done, to feed hogs upon wheat, the wheat the hog was feeding on, it was the same kind of wheat as that in the sack, I compared it with the sample of the bulk remaining in the barn; I have no doubt it is my wheat.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. Q. I believe you went with Mr. Whitbread to search the prisoner's house. - A. Yes, his account is correct.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

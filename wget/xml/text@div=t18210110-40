             to take care of it. I left a lodger in the house. We ordered Marsh to take care of the house every Sunday. I returned about nine o'clock at night, and found the house robbed and completely ramsacked. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, and found fourteen locks broken. It appears some small wire or instrument must be put through the door to raise the latch, the wood of the door was broken to admit the wire. The doors were broken open by an iron crow, which was found on the premises. The property lost was worth above 100 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Marsh was always sent to take care of your house - A. Yes - a great quantity of goods were packed up, and not taken away - what was taken away were light goods, which would go into the pocket - it might all be done in twenty minutes, or half an hour.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Smith's house at five o'clock this Sunday evening, all was then safe - I did not continue long - about a quarter of an hour - I then went home - I returned about ten minutes, or a quarter past seven o'clock with my child - I had a candle when I put the key in the counting-house door - I heard a scuffle inside and called out, who is there? I then went to the street door, found it open - I pushed it from me, it was snatched violently from me by a man who rushed out. I put the candle to his face and knew him. I knew him before, but could not mention his name - I called out</p>
               <p>"I knew him," he put his fist in my face. I am positive the prisoner is the man - I knew him before very well, and had seen him frequently in the neighbourhood. I saw nobody about the door that I knew. I never had any quarrel with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Ought you not to have remained at the house till Mr. Smith returned - A. They always told me to go home to tea and put my children to bed - he used to come home about half-past ten o'clock. I had the key. I always stopped till he returned, but always went home to put the children to bed - my house is only across the way - I then went to the counting-house door, which I came out at, but hearing the scuffle I did not open it, but went to the street door. Before I left the house I tried all the room doors that I had the keys of, and they were safe - I made it a rule to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate the man had a brown great coat on - A. I said a dark great coat. I never said it was brown. I knew the prisoner a great while, but could not name him. I have had the care of the house for three years.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner at a public-house in New-street, Fetter-lane, at his lodgings. The prosecutor charged him with breaking into his premises - he said it could not be him, for he was at home all day; immediately after he said about half-past five o'clock he went to Norris to look<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100019"></xptr>for a job. Norris lives about thirty yards below Mr. Smith's house.</p>

Kirby, Beard, &amp; Co.—I entered the defendant's service in the commencement of January, 1867, and remained up to the time of their bankruptcy—I was a commercial traveller—about a month before the bankruptcy Bennett asked me if I would mind helping Bodman with the books—I am not sure as to the time, it might be a month or a fortnight before the bankruptcy—I said I would rather do that than stop in London doing nothing—up to that time I had had nothing to do with the books—after that conversation I saw this book (<hi rend="italic">The Ledger</hi>) at Mr. Bodman's house, Jackson Road, Holloway—most of the entries in it were made by me in the parlour at Bodman's house—I made them from Mr. Bodman's direction—Bennett came there once or twice—in the account of Elbra &amp; Co., in this ledger, the first line is "Balance of folio 165: 688<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 ½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 688<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 ½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is struck out and 339<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is written over it—I did that by Mr. Bodman's orders—all the other entries in that account were written by me from Bodman's directions—on page nine<lb></lb>teen is an account with J.

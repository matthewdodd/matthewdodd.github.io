I keep the Albemarle Arms in South Audley-street—on 21st April, I saw my niece serve Townsend, and in his presence she showed me a bad half-crown which she had taken from him and bent—I asked him if he had got any more—he said, "No"—I asked him where he got it—he said, "At the steam-boat at London Bridge"—he said he had no other money—I then gave him the half-crown back, and he went away without drinking the beer he had asked for—I suggested to a Mr. Godfrey who was in the bar, to follow him, and he did so.</p>

I am a reporter—on 21st April I was at the Albe<lb></lb>marle Arms, and saw Townsend leave the house—I followed him—he walked up and down South Audley-street for about ten minutes—I never lost sight of him—he then went into Hyde-park, and was there joined by Druce—they sat down together about a quarter of an hour, and then went across the head of the Serpentine and out at Park-place by the barracks—I went out at Albert-gate, and there met McLeod, 18 B——I made a communication to him, and we both watched the prisoners—they went into the Brompton-road for some distance, and then separated—Townsend went direct across the road to a baker's shop—I followed into the shop, and he was in the act of receiv<lb></lb>ing a half-crown back from the young woman—I heard him say he did not know it was bad—I said he must have known it, because he tried to pass one in South Audley-street—he made no answer—McLeod took him in custody and received the half-crown.</p>

On the 9th of July, I saw him at seven o'clock in the morning, in Covent-garden, he was passing the Hummums, the sash windows was open, there were two gentlemen sitting there, and he said, Sodomites; for God's sake, said I, don't say so, it is dangerous; says he d-mn your blood, what do I care, I will blow up for a sodomite, for half a farthing. Then we walked on as towards Hatton-street, as I was going that way home; and the prisoner said that he would go home along with me, for he must have some money of me; I said, I had none about me; he said, then I must go home for it, and he would go home with me, and if I did not give it him, he would go home and blow me up. I then, through fear, went and obtained three guineas; I thought he might stain my character in calling me a sodomite. I did not go home, I went near home and turned back again, and went to a public house, the Cock, on Snow-hill, that was where he waited, while I went for the three guineas; I did not go home for the three guineas, I went to a friend and borrowed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before you gave him any money? - He said, d-mn your blood, I must have some money; and he told me what he wanted it for, that he was going down to Barnet; he said, he must have the money, or he would say I was a sodomite. I went to Mr. Stevens, a person in the City, for the three guineas, he is not here, he is abroad at present. When I got the three guineas, I went back to the Cock public house, and I found the prisoner there waiting for it and I gave it to him; he said, he would see me again to-morrow, and he would return the money; I told him the consequence of doing what he did; he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170054"></xptr>there would be nobody more hung for extorting money since the affair of judge Buller's son, for he was obliged to run away for bringing the men to trial, or words to that effect. I left him there at that time; I saw him again in about three days, as near as I can recollect; he sent for me to the Globe Tavern, in Hatton-Garden; I went there, and found the prisoner at the bar there; he was in the coffee room; there was nobody else there besides us two; he asked me to fit down; I refused it; he seemed very much offended; he asked me to drink; I refused it, but at last I did drink. He happened to turn his eyes round, and saw my partner at the door, through the glass; he asked me if that was my partner? I told him yes; says he, d-mn my eyes, I will blow him up too for a sodomite; I says to him, only consider the hazard you run, supposing he was to hear that; and he said, he must have some more money; he made use of the same words as before, he said, he would blow me up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that? - I understood it was more to terrify, than what he intended to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that the effect of terrifying you, so as to part with your money? - Yes, it really had, to part with three guineas more.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you three guineas with you then? - Yes, I had it in my pocket, but I went out to make him believe that I went out for it, because I had told him that I had none; he said, he should not think of gentlemen tradesmen not having money.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you mention this business to any body? - I did not mention it to any body till I had him apprehended, which was the next day or day after, when he sent for me again to the same public house; then he stood at the bar and asked me to drink; now says he, I have settled my business all but making a compliment to my attorney; and then he was taken up, and I mentioned the business to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned it to any body before you mentioned it to the justice? - No, nobody at all. He upbraided me then of being afraid of him; no, says I, I am not afraid, if I had I might have run away since the first time I see you; says he, if you had, I would have murdered you the first time I met you.</p>

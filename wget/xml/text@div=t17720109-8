            . I am sixteen years old next July. I was along with Mrs. Tooth about three minutes after eight in the Park; the two prisoners came up and demanded our money; I told one of them that I had but a shilling; I gave him that. I went down Park-lane, and met the two prisoners coming out at Park-gate. Knowing them both again, I dogg'd them into the Golden-lion at Hyde-park corner; then I got my father, and secured them; I said these are the two men that robbed me and my aunt in the Park; they said they had not been in the Park for four years, for that they were deserters. I knew the regiment they belonged to by their cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see that?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamps?</p>
               <p>Salmon. There were lamps in Park-lane; I could see by the light from them. A man came by whom they offered to stop, but he got on pretty briskly, so got off.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from your aunt?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Not a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Ward, and which Randall?</p>
               <p>Salmon. That is Ward, I believe, and the other Randall. (Describing them wrong.) They were searched; one had three six-pences, a shilling, and some halfpence.</p>

            . I am a horse-grenadier; I was at the taking the prisoners at Hyde-park corner; they were at the public-house before I came; they said they had not been in the Park that day, nor for four years before.</p>

               <p>Q. How near is the Golden-lion to Hyde-park corner?</p>
               <p>Pugh. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. to Salmon. When you came down the lane, where did you see the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Pugh. They were just on the outside of the gate, coming towards the Golden-lion.</p>
               <p>Randall's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never was nearer the Park than the Golden-lion; I had been drinking with some of my comrades in Brigg-street, which is pretty near half a mile below the Golden-lion.</p>

               <p>Ward's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was along with Randall; I am quite innocent; Salmon described our dress wrong.</p>
               <p>Salmon. I said you had got a pair of white stockings, and that the other had garters on. I thought it had been so by the appearance in the dark, but it turned out to be dark-coloured stockings.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We had witnesses to prove that we had been at Brigg-street, and how we got the money; our serjeant was to have brought them, but he has not.</p>

               <p>Salmon. They were going from the Park-gate towards the Golden-lion, and were not going from Brigg-street towards the Golden-lion.</p>

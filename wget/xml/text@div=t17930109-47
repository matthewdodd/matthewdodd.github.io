On the 15th of December we went up into the room, and we had a suspicion that the things were gone, and I asked her where they were? and she said, they were in the room; she was in the room; I insisted on seeing of them, and threatened to fetch an officer; on that she quitted the place; I searched for the things and they were missing; she came again in the evening and said, if I would let her have the duplicates out of the room she would get the things; I am sure I let her the things with the room; she had the duplicates, and I never saw her till the next evening; I found the duplicates in the apartment on Saturday evening; on Tuesday evening I took an headborough with me, and I found her at the Jolly Sailors in Ratcliff-highway at a public house; from thence I took her down to Mr. Staples's office, and on searching her the duplicates were found, Mr Staples committed her till the Thursday evening following, when the things were brought up before the magistrate by the pawnbroker; the things are here.</p>
               <p>Q. You let her go at first when you first went up into the room? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You then insisted on seeing whether the things were there or not, and when you found them not there how came you to let her go? - She went away not known to me; she came back again of her own accord on the evening, and then said they were pawned, and said, if I would give her the duplicates she would fetch the things; she once pawned things before of mine, it was a sheet, and I don't know whether it was fetched out or left in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the 15th of December? - I cannot tell exactly; but I believe it was got back.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know she had pawned it? - By going up stairs and missing it; my wife knew that it was pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came and desired you to let her have the duplicates, you let her have the duplicates expecting her to bring the things, you did not consider her as having stolen them? - I only gave her the duplicates supposing that she meant to return them back again, I conceived so.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife is not here? - She is not.</p>

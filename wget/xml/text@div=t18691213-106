                  </hi>. I am an attorney, at St Martin's Court, St. Martin's Lane—I acted for Mr. Lewis in the matter of "Lewis against Clark"—I attended at the Sheriffs Court when the case came on, on the 2nd August—Mr. Lewis was with me—I saw Mr. Hey there—he told me that Mr. Wood was the counsel engaged, and then I spoke to Mr. Wood with reference to making terms—in the midst of my conversation with Mr. Wood the case was called on—Mr. Lake was then absent, having gone to his office, and Mr. Wood asked for an adjournment—the case was then adjourned to the 12th August—the same day, after the adjournment, Mr. Wood and myself agreed to settle the action upon Mr. Lewis, paying 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the costs upon the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I think Mr. Wood endorsed his brief to that effect—we then went to the registrar, down stairs, and arranged to have the order drawn up upon the terms agreed; but a clerk in the office said that, as it had been called on and adjourned, we must attend on the adjournment day, unless a written notice was forwarded by Mr. Lewis to the Court; in the meantime a written consent was given—I went into the office; the prisoners went in as well, I think, I am not certain of that—they were about the Court, at any rate—I did not know them before, and I did not know their names—I did not know Mr. Biggenden before I saw him at the Guildhall Police Court—in the interval between the adjournments the consent paper came—Mr. Lewis signed it, and it was sent to the Court on the 12th, the adjournment day—I did not attend on the 12th—I got the bill of costs about ten days after<lb></lb>wards, and I went with Mr. Lewis to the taxing-master's office, to tax it on his behalf—both the defendants attended on the other side—the bill of costs was set out upon the higher scale, and I objected to it, and ultimately the taxing-master taxed it on the lower scale—the defendants wanted it taxed</p>

               <p>on the higher scale—the taxing-master rejected that bill, and said he would tax under the Act of Parliament, under the scale of allowance—he put that bill on one side, and allowed them only the lower scale—I acted throughout under the belief that there was an attorney in the matter, and that Mr. Biggenden was the attorney because his name was at the bottom of the brief, and at the bottom of the bill of costs—that was the only reason—the practice at the Sheriffs' Court is, if there is no attorney there is no taxing; the costs are allowed in Court—the bill of costs does not profess to be signed by Mr. Biggenden; but it is usual to put the name at the bottom of all the papers.</p>

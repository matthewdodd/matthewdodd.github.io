               <p>for about four years prior to my apprehension—Saville was my assistant—he used to come in to help me—Mr. Craddick was the sexton—he kept the keys—I recollect digging a grave in Stratford churchyard, in the summer of 1855—there were a good many dug about that time—I was digging one on a Tuesday, and Saville said, "What do you say, Jemmy, to having Mr. Dr. Taylor's coffin out?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Never mind, let us have it out—will you have a drop of beer?"—I said, "I do not care about it"—he said, "Come on, let us go and have a pot," and we did at the Coach and Horses—he then went home and fetched his tools, a bag, a hammer, and a chisel—he went down into the vaults first, and I went after him—the gate into the vaults has never been locked since I was there—that is where you go down to the tool-house—the wooden door is always locked—when you get through the wooden door, the iron gate is open—you then have access to the various vaults—Mr. Craddick kept the key of these doors—it was necessary to get the key from him when we wanted to get our tools to dig a grave, but sometimes he did not have the wooden door locked all night—I did not have the key on this occasion—the door was open—when I went in, I found Saville breaking the brickwork of a vault open—after it was broken, I went into the vault with him, and he wrenched the coffin open, and took out the copper one—the shell was not opened—he replaced the shell afterwards—he could not take the shell out from the copper coffin without opening the lid of the shell—he tore off the copper part of the lid—I helped him with the copper coffin, and we took it to another empty vault at the side, and left it there—it was then in good large pieces—we then went out and finished a grave—this was between 6 and 7 on a Saturday morning, either June or July in 1855—we did nothing more that day—we let the coffin be there till Monday, and then he went and found a man who would take it, named Brett, who lived at Stratford—he fetched the man's truck down to the church, and some bags, and we took it up to the man between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in two or three bags—the truck was brought out of the churchyard to the gate which looks into Essex—I saw nothing more of the copper afterwards—I did not break it up, but I was with Saville in the vault when he broke it up—I got 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my share—I went with Saville to sell it—I was just outside the door—I did not see the dealing between Saville and Brett—we then went to the beer shop—I knew the name of Brett when I was before the Magistrate—he was apprehended, and I saw him there—I did not know his name before that—I only knew him by sight, but I heard him charged as Brett.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>into the gaol where I could see them, but they could not see me—they came to ask me how I was getting on—they did not ask me whether I would have anything to drink—they could not get it there—they asked me about it, and asked me to confess—they did not tell me that Saville had peached, or anything to that effect, nor did anybody else—nobody had told me that at any time—nobody told me in gaol that Saville was about to turn evidence against me—I swear that—they wanted me to tell the truth about it—they did not say that if I would, it would be better for me—they said that they should lose their places if I did not give evidence—I said nothing to that—they did not come again, or anybody else—they did not tell me when I was to give my evidence—I told them that I would do so—they were with me a quarter of an hour—I told them that we had done the job—Saville was not there—I said that it was done by 6 or 7 in the morning—we had one pot of beer at the Coach and Horses before we began.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Holloway-court, Stratford, and am a labourer—I know Saville—on 24th August last, I was standing in my little garden in front of my house with my wife and my daughter Sarah—Saville was in his garden which is next door to me, and List is next door to him—Saville said, "What do you think I had thrown in my teeth this day, I had thrown at my teeth this day, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> I stole a copper coffin out of the vault underneath Stratford church, but I know nothing about stealing of it whatever, and," pointing to List's house next door, he said, "That is the b—<hi rend="italic">as</hi> stole the copper coffin out of the vault, and after he stole it he whitewashed it over; and I am the b—as sold it—but I do not care about myself, though I know I shall be transported for it, as long as I can bring List into it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, and lived in the same room as the prisoner, in Bury-street, Commercial-road, and slept in the same bed for six weeks. On Thursday, the 26th of May, my money was locked in my box—I left the prisoner in the room for two minutes by himself, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning—I came up again and went down again—the prisoner left the house before me—he had time to open the box—I missed my money about an hour afterwards—nobody else had been in the room—I found one things broken off the box, and the sixteen shillings and four sixpence taken—he did not return to the lodging—I met him in Club-row on the Sunday morning, and asked how he came to take my money—he said he had not—I asked him how he came to take the best of his kit (meaning his tools)away—he said, "If you won't hurt me, Bill, I will tell you"—I said I would not hurt him, but at last gave him into custody.</p>

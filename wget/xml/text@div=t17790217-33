On Wednesday the third of February I went there and found that the house had been broke open. A very large nail which I had driven in a back window towards the garden, had been forced. Upon entering the house I missed a great many things. On Thursday the fourth, I saw the curtains, two bottles of wine, and two waistcoats, at the office in Litchfield-street, which I knew to be mine; I described the marks on the bottles before I saw them; the marks were found to tally exactly as I described them. I left them all in the house when I came to London. I had not myself seen them for near three weeks before the time when they were stolen. The gate before the front door of the house had been forced; the box of the lock was broke.</p>

The watchman stopped me in Cockspur-street; he asked where I was going with that bundle; I said I was going home with a bundle I had picked up; I went with him to the watch-house without making any words, and carried the bundle upon my back.

               <p>Mr. White. A person came from Kensington to look at the prisoner. She said she had seen people catching birds the day before about there, when she saw the prisoner she said she had not seen him before.</p>
               <p>Dixon. A bricklayer and some other people offered to sit up in Mr. White's house, expecting the thieves to come the next night. The bricklayer said he saw two men, and when he came out they ran away. That is what the prisoner means, I believe.</p>

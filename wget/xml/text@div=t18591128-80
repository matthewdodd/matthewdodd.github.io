                  </hi>. I know the defendant, Mr. Henderson—there was an assault made on me by Mr. French—I gave him in custody, and I was told on the Sunday that I was to appear; but I made up my mind not to appear—I had been told at the station that I was to appear the next morning—I saw Mr. Henderson on the Monday morning—I don't know what he said to me—he asked me about the charge made against Mr. French—he asked me what sort of an assault it was, and I told him—he offered me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said it was all settled and I need not appear—he said the man had been bailed out—this was about half-past 9 o'clock in the morning—he was with me on that occasion about half an hour—on Monday night a paper was served upon me by Mr. Carpenter—I showed it to Mr. Henderson, and he took it away—this is the paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I had a paper like this—Mr. Henderson called on me again on the Tuesday, and I showed him the paper which Mr. Carpenter had brought, and he said that I was to go away, and the summons was a mere nothing—I believe he used the word "summons"—I am not sure how long he was with me—I believe we were talking about this matter the whole time—he said he would call in the evening, and he would see the lawyer about it—I saw him again that evening, and he said it would be best for me not to go again—I went away—the reason I went away was, he said he had been to Brighton and seen my uncle and aunt and they would be very angry if I did appear.</p>

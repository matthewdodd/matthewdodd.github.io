                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, living at 13, Church-street, Greenwich—on Saturday last the prisoner Meadows was in my employ as errand boy—I have a warehouse at the back of my shop—in consequence of some losses, I marked eleven bladders of lard, by the instruc<lb></lb>tions of a policeman, but not in his presence, and put them in the ware-house last Saturday morning—between 8 and 9 that evening the policeman came to me bringing the two prisoners and a bladder of lard, which was mine, and was one of the eleven that was marked, and safe in my warehouse in the morning—there is a back door from my warehouse, so that any one might go out of it without passing through the shop—I had not sold nor authorized any one to sell any lard from the warehouse—the bladder of lard is worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 122). Last Saturday night I was in North-street, Greenwich, where the female prisoner and her husband keep a marine store shop—I saw Meadows come out from there—I stopped him and asked him what he had been there for; he made no reply—I took him back into the marine store shop, where I saw two little children sitting by the fire in the shop—I asked where their father and mother were; they made no reply—I went into the back room, and saw a light up the staircase—I called to some one up stairs; the female answered—I then took the boy up-stairs and met the female prisoner on the landing—I asked her what the boy had brought there; she made no reply—I then took the boy on to the landing and said, "What does he do here? he has been here for some pur<lb></lb>pose"—she then went into the back room, which was a sort of lumber room, full of rags and bones and different articles; she said, "Come in here and I will give it you"—I followed her in and she took this bladder of lard from among some rags and handed it to me—I said to the boy, "Is this what you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270163"></xptr>
               <p>have brought?"—he said, "Yes"—we went down stairs, and I asked where the husband was—Noakes said he was not at home—I asked the boy, in her presence, if he had ever been to the shop before—he said he had—I asked him what induced him to go there—he said that Noakes' husband had asked him to get some fat—he said, "A few days after, I brought a bladder of lard"—I asked him what was paid for it—he said, "One dulling"—that was for the first of the six; he said he had been there six times and had taken six bladders, for each of which he had received one shilling, each bladder weighing from 8lbs. to 10lbs.—this was all in Noakes' presence—I asked him whether he had ever taken anything else—he said, "Yes," he had also taken a quantity of chaff and corn to Noakes' husband—I then asked Noakes to to go to the station with me; she began to cry and said she could not go, as she had no shawl to put on till her husband came home—the boy said to me, in her presence, that he had not been paid for this lard; that he was to call on Sunday morning for a shilling—Noakes, at the same time, said that she had not bought the bladder of lard; she had not paid for it—I said, "That's no matter at all about paying for it; I found it in your premises concealed"—on looking round, I saw her shawl hanging on the bed—I said, "Here is your shawl; put it on, and come with me"—she did so—on going outside the door, I met her husband—he said, "What is all this about; what's the matter?"—I then told him that the boy was in custody for stealing a bladder of lard, and his wife in custody for receiving it—he said, "I know nothing about it"—the boy repeated his former statement in the presence of the husband and the female prisoner—she said nothing then, but the husband said he had never had anything of the sort, and had never received anything—the boy said, "Yes, you have; and more than that, you have sent a little boy up into the Mews to ask me to get some chaff and corn for your donkey"—he denied that he knew of anything of the sort—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bladder of lard—Meadows made a similar statement at the police-station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that Noakes' husband keeps the marine store shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the room where the lard was was dark—I could not swear positively whether the lard was on the rags or covered over; but I believe it was covered over—I was close to her when I went into the room.</p>

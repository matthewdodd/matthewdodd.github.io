                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in Tothill-street, Westminster. On the 27th of August the prisoner came to purchase a cabbage, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and offered a bad shilling—I told him it was bad—he said he would go and get another—he went away—I kept the shilling, and put into my left-hand pocket—I afterwards gave it to the policeman—I had no other shilling in that pocket—he came again between four and five o'clock, and gave me another bad shilling for another cab<lb></lb>bage—I called my father from the desk, and said, he was the man who passed the other shilling—I called a policeman in who was passing—my father kept the second shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of the last witness. On Saturday, the 27th of August, I was in the settling an account, about half-past four o'clock—my son showed me a bad shilling, and said, "He is the man who passed the other bad shilling"—the prisoner heard it, and said it was a good one—I sent for a constable, but could not find one—I told the pri<lb></lb>soner I should take him into custody, and while my son went for a police<lb></lb>man he ran away—I had shown him the shilling my son gave me, and asked him what he meant by it—I kept the shilling in my hand, marked it, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

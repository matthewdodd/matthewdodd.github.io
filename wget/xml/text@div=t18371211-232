                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Cotterell, a pawn I broker, living at No. 163, Oxford-street. On Saturday, the 21st of I October, about seven o'clock in the evening, the defendant Harris came I into my master's shop—he was dressed in a similar way to what he is I now, except that he had a silver guard-chain round his neck, a brooch in his shirt, and a ring on his finger—he had quite a respectable appearance—when he came into the shop he took this watch from his guard-chain, and this ring and brooch from his pocket—he was not wearing them on his finger and shirt—he said, "Will you lend me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on these; I am going to a concert» and don't like to go without a few pounds in my pocket"—and he said, "I bought this ring of you about three years ago, and the brooch I bought in Paris"—on examining the watch, I saw something which led me to suppose that the Hall mark, which represented the Goldsmiths' mark on both cases, the inner and outer, was a forgery; and on pulling back the case, I broke it off the hinge—I said nothing to Harris about it, but said, "Does the watch belong to you?"—he said, "No; the watch belongs to Mr. Knowles, and in fact they all belong to Mr. Knowles"—I said, "You told me just now you bought the ring of me, and the brooch in Paris"—he said, "I meant to have said the ring was bought of you, and the brooch was bought in Paris"—the ring had not been sold in our shop, because all our diamond articles are booked—this is a little rose-diamond—it is worth altogether about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14t.—it is one of the commonest description of rose-diamonds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it have been a pledge, and sold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If so, it would be sold at the sale-rooms—we could have bought it in at the sale-rooms; but if we had done so, it would have been entered, and I should know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he said, "In fact they all belong to Mr. Knowles?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I asked him where Mr. Knowles lived—he said, "At No. 8, Paddington-street"—I said, And where do you live?" and asked him his name—he said his name was Harris, and he lived at No. 15, Lower-street, Lambeth (but I believe it is Lower-marsh)—I said, "Have you any objection I should send somebody with you to see that Mr. Knowles does live there, the man who sent you with these things?"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183712110006"></xptr>
               <p>said, "Oh, I will go and fetch him," and turned round quickly, and went out of the shop, leaving the property behind him—he walked very sharply out of the shop—I was behind the counter—I went to the door, but he was out of sight—it was dark at the time—he did not return that night,—next morning I went to No. 8, Paddington-street, and found Knowles did not live there—I have examined the watch—as it is only a metal one, we should not be able to get of a private person more than 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—it would depend very much on the quality of the work—it is a lever movement—if it was not for the quality of the works it would not fetch more than 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this description of movement would not fetch more—if it was made to order, it would come to more; but if bought in the shop, not more than 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the way of trade it would not be more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should think a watch-maker would charge 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, if an order was given for it—the brooch is worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is gold, but I take it to be common gold—there is a way of gilding common gold, colouring it, to make it look like fine gold—there is a stamp on this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not this a French mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it is an English mark—it is an English made article—I believe it to be gold—the stone is an amethyst, but it is a common one, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—not more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Monday did the other defendant, Knowles, come to the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the 23rd, between eleven and twelve o'clock—he said "I have called for a watch, brooch, and ring, which I sent Harris to pawn for men Saturday"—I asked him what it was—he said a kind of metal or silver gut—(I did not know him at that time—I think I have seen him repeatedly before, but not to swear he is the man—I did not know Harris before at all)—I asked him his name—he said Knowles—I asked him where he lived—he said at No. 1, Woodstock-street—(I found that <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be correct)—I asked him where he got the watch from—he said he bought it of Mr. Husted, at Machin's sale-rooms; that he owed Harris 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he told Harris to pawn them, and pay himself—Mr. Cotterell had in the meantime taken the watch to Goldsmiths'-hall to ascertain about the mark—I did not tell Knowles that, but I said Mr. Cotterell was not in the way, and if he would call again to-morrow he could see him—I did not ask him any thing about Harris, or where he lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of a watch is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A patent lever—it if a <hi rend="italic">duffin</hi> watch, made to deceive the public—there has been about 300 pawned about the trade within three years—it is an old-fashioned lack lever—it has a jewel in it—a watch could be jewelled for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in that way—it is gilt upon brass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, you told him Mr. Cotterell was not at home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and said would he call the next day?—he said he would—next day a person, whom I have since ascertained to be Charles Skymsher, came to the shop, and produced a note, which I have here—on reading it, I told him he could not have the property unless he brought the man who had left it on the counter—I had not seen Harris from the time he had gone out, leaving the property on the counter, up to that Tuesday—on the following Wednesday Skymsher brought Harris to the shop about eleven or twelve o'clock in the morning—I said to Harris, 4 We have ascertained that the watch bears a forged hall-mark"—he said, "Knowles sent me with it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183712110007"></xptr>
               <p>I did not offer it for gold"—I told him he had offered it at a gold price, and I could not let him go without taking him before a Magistrate—he then said, I did not offer it for gold"—I said he had at a gold price—the policeman was there at the time—there is a very great deception about the article—I did not discover any thing myself till after I took the movement out of the case to weigh it, to see what weight in gold there was, and in doing so I ascertained it was not gold, from something I saw in the case at the time I weighed it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this watch on the face of it calculated to deceive a person who had it in his hands for a few minutes only?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it very much re sembles a gold watch—our shop is not a quarter of V mile from Padding ton-street.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any thing in giving an address as No. 8, Paddington-street, which would at all lead you to go to No. 1, Woodstock-street?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not at all—Harris said he did not know the article was not gold, and he had brought it from Knowles to pledge—he took it from a silver guard chain to which it was attached by a swivel—he had it in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the Irish hall mark?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That has the harp in addition to the crown—this does not at all resemble the Goldsmith's Halt mark or the Irish mark—the pendant and lever is silver, and has the genuine Hall mark on it.</p>

On the 25th of October went to Mr. Cotterell's shop, and found Harris there with Skymsher—Harris was delivered in charge to me for offering, to pledge a watch, fearing a forged Goldsmiths' mark—on our way to the station-house he told me Mr. Knowles had sent him with it, and that he wished to go to Mr. Knowles—I said he must <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to the station-house first—T took him to the station-house—Skymsher was with him at the time—I went to Skymsher's brother, at No. 120, Oxford-street, and there I found Knowles—Harris was not with me, he was at the station-house—I told Knowles he must consider himself in my custody, as a party concerned about this watch—he said he bad bought the watch of a person named Austin, at Debenham's sale-rooms, and that he was then there, and he had better go for him—he did not state to me whether Austin lived at Debenham's sale-rooms, or whether he bought them of him there—I told him he must go to the station-house, and on our way there he said there had been a good deal said about the watch, but he believed part of it was gold, and part was not—he did not say what had happened to the watch before—I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found several articles of jewellery on him, which have since been delivered up by order of the Magistrate—I do not think he said what he gave Austin for the watch—I do not recollect—he said nothing more that I recollect—I found on Harris a <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> guard-chain, and silver watch, a brooch, a pin, and a silver tooth-pick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 35, High-street, Kensington. I have seen the metal watch which has been produced—it was pawned with me on the 23rd of June, 1836—I know what is meant by a <hi rend="italic">duffin</hi> watch—it is an article with an appearance given to it for the purpose of deception—I advanced 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this watch—1 thought it was a gold one—I afterwards caused it to be sold at Machin and Debenham's—it I was never redeemed—I do not know who pawned it—it fetched 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Machin and Debenham's—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the watch found on Harris</hi>)—this sil<lb></lb>ver</p>

               <p>watch is also a <hi rend="italic">duffin</hi> one, but it is a bettermost sort of one—there are different descriptions—this is worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you tell me whether this silver watch has a silver case or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it has the genuine hall mark—I call this a <hi rend="italic">duffin</hi> watch, because it is not made by any particular maker—I cannot point out any other particular circumstance.</p>

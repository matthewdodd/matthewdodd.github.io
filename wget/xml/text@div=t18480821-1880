                  </hi>. I am a dealer in bottled beer, in Crutched-friars. I was at the counting-house on Saturday, 22nd July—I saw a man named Williams—he spoke to me—after he was gone I went and asked Brooks if he knew anything of Williams—he said, "Very little, but there is a man outside, named <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, who knows him"—<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> is a porter—I spoke to <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, and told him not to let any goods go out of the cellar, as I was not satisfied with the man Williams, and to let no goods go out unless I was there—I can very seldom go to my place on a Monday, as I am engaged for a brewery—I went on the Wednesday, about twelve o'clock—Brooks ought to have been there, but he was not—there was no one on the premises—I waited till nearly six—Brooks did not come—I undid the hasp of the door, and found in the cellar a lot of straw—I missed some ale and some stout and two baskets—the sell<lb></lb>ing price of the ale is about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, the stout about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and the pints are 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is, to the trade—I live in Charles-street, Islington—I left a note, and the next day Brooks came to my house—I said to him, "Henry, how is this about these things in the City?"—he said, "I suppose you think I know something of them"—I said, "Certainly; how can I think otherwise?"—he said, "Oh, if you think that, I will fetch a policeman, or something to that effect—I said, "No; I will make further inquiries"—I said, "If things were wrong, why did you not come and tell me?"—I gave him into custody—the usual way when goods were sold, was for me to make a bill, and he to bring back the counterpart, signed—he was never to sell in my absence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tysoe-street, Spa-fields. I occasionally assist, Mr. Hobson in a friendly way. On Monday, 24th July, I went to his pre<lb></lb>mises—I saw Brooks, he said to me, '" Williams has been, and wanted to see my master"—I said, "Then he must wait"—Williams came to the counting-house about ten minutes afterwards—I did not see that he had a cart with him,—he came into the counting-house—Brooks was there—Williams asked if Mr. Hobson was there—I said, "No"—he said he came to see him about some ale and stout—I said, I could not say anything about it—he went. out and returned in about half an hour—he asked if Mr. Hobson was there—I said he was not—he said it was all <hi rend="italic">humbug</hi> his waiting about like that—I said I knew nothing about it, I could not help it—he said, "You can take the money for the ale, can't you?"—I said, "Yes; if you are going to pay for it on delivery"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Very well"—Randall, Brooks, and Williams then went out of the counting-house, in the direction of the cellar—(Randall was there with the cart when Williams came the second time)—in about ten minutes I went into the cellar myself—I found Brooks and Randall there—Brooks was taking the ale and putting it into a dozen baskets, and Randall was carrying it to the cart for Williams to pack—Williams was with the cart then—Brooks said, "He has got three dozen"—they still went on till they had got eight dozen of ale—Williams then came off the cart into the cellar, and asked me about the stout—I said, "It is use<lb></lb>less asking me about the stout; I am sure you have not bought it; if you had, I am positive Mr. Hobson would have made it known to me"—while Williams was talking to me about the stout in the cellar, Randall took the cart away—I turned round, and saw the cart was gone—I said to Brooks, "What is the use of going off with half the load; why did be not wait till Mr. Hobson came?"—he made no answer at all—I gave them leave to pack some stout against Mr. Hobson came, and if it was incorrect, it was to remain there—I remained till they had packed two dozen, and then went to the counting-house to speak to a gentleman—Brooks came in and said, "Williams is gone to borrow some prickles"—I looked out, but I could not see anything of him—Williams did not come back—I directly went down into the cellar with Brooks, and told him he was very stupid for letting the man go without my knowledge—I said, "You have let the man go, the goods are gone, and where will you apply to for the money?"</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you employed yourself in making a bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>. No; the cart went away befure I saw it go—I thought while I had got Williams there I was safe for the money—the stout was still there—I told Brooks, if the man returned, to be sure to ask him for the money for the ale, but not to let any more goods go off the premises—while the men were there I asked Williams what he was to pay for the ale and stout—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the ale, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stout quarts, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the stout pints—I said, "you did not buy the stout at that price, I am very well satisfied."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 57.) I went to Randall's on 27th July—I asked him if he had removed some ale and stout on the Monday previous from Mr. Hobson's, in Crutched-friars—he said he had—I asked where he took it to—he said the first he took away was a load of bottled ale which he took to Ratcliff-highway, by order of Williams, that when he got halfway, the paving was up, and he could not get any further, and Williams went and fetched a truck, and took it away, but where he did not know—I asked if he knew where Williams lived—he said he did not—I went to Randall's again on the 30th, and asked him where he took the load of stout to on the Tuesday previous—he said not anywhere, a load of stout had been left at his house, and Williams came and fetched it in the morning in his own horse and cart—I said I had evidence to prove that he had taken it to a house himself, and I should take him into custody—he said he did take the load of stout to Rawlinson himself, but the reason he did it was he did not want to get Williams in trouble—I afterwards searched his house, and found two bottles and three baskets, but he had admitted to me that the baskets were at his place—they are Mr. Hobson's baskets—he admitted that he had taken the ten dozen himself to Mr. Levitt's, in, and that what he said about the pavement being up was all false.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter—on the 10th June I was walking along Mount Pleasant, Clerkenwell about 7.15 p.m—there was a good light—the prisoner and five or six other young fellows were playing and dodging about—the prisoner walked alongside of me; he had no crutch; he walked lame—he struck me a violent blow on the chest and grabbed at a pin I had in my scarf—I put my hand there and found it gone—I asked the prisoner what he struck me for; he said "Who struck you?"—I said "You did; I shall accuse you of stealing my scarf pin"—the other persons came round and said they would give me a punch if I accused the prisoner—they ran off, and I was afraid to follow—it was a back-handed blow the prisoner gave me—I gave information to the police, and gave a description of the prisoner to the inspector—the fol<lb></lb>lowing evening I went to the same spot—I saw the prisoner lounging against the window of a public-house, I went for a policeman and he attempted to make off—the blow almost stopped my breath.</p>

About 11 o'clock on 17th June the prosecutor made a statement to me—I went to Warner Street and saw the prisoner—as soon as he saw us he went away as fast as he could—when I caught up to him I told him he would be charged with stealing a gold pin from a gentleman's scarf—he said he knew nothing about it—I never saw him before.</p>

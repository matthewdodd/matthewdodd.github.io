                  </hi>. I live in Charlton Street, Somer's Town—I was passing along the Thames Embankment on the night of the 23rd of November, between 11 and 12 o'clock—I had come from the Canterbury Music Hall; I came over the bridge on to the Embankment—on my way home, I met Vary and two females; they came up to me; one of the girls asked me if I would go home with her—I told her that I did not want to go home with her, I wanted to go to my own place—I told her to go away from me, or the first constable I came to I would give her in charge; she came up to me a second time—I told her again to go away or I should give her in charge; Vary came behind rue and knocked me down—when I was down I had a kick in the head; I was stunned—Vary kicked me—I re<lb></lb>member</p>

               <p>the constable coming up; my eyes were blinded; I could just see it was a constable—I said "Take him in charge"—I walked to the police-station as well as I could—I asked for my cane, which was lost—I had a watch with me; my chain, I found, was hanging, and my watch gone—when I came to my senses, the chain was broken just on the crook—I did not have any words with Vary; I did not strike him—I said something to the girl, because I would not go home with her, and that was the commence<lb></lb>ment of the row.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was coming from the Canterbury, I came over West<lb></lb>minster Bridge, and then along the Embankment—I was going to my place in Charlton Street, that is the nearest way; I know it was between 11 and 12 o'clock—I did not speak to any woman before I went across the bridge—I was not in the Blackfriars Road, that night at all—I was at the Canterbury, by myself—I came across the bridge without speaking to anybody—the, girl that spoke to me in the Embankment, was not speaking to me before—I bad got down the Embankment, about half-way before I was spoken to—the girls were walking steadily along with Vary—they were all three very close together; I did not notice them before they spoke to me—I passed them; one of the girls came behind and touched me on the shoulder—in the course of a few yards they came up again, I told them I would give them in charge; one of the girls came up alone; she continued speaking for some minutes—when I stopped Vary and the other girl came up alongside—it was when the three came up together that the altercation took place—my cane was worth a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I did not strike Vary with it—I did not know he was behind me—when I was knocked down it was whisked away from me—. I lay senseless when a constable and a gentleman came—when I came to my senses I saw Vary and the girl standing by—I do not know what became of the other woman—as-soon as I came to my senses I cried out for! my cane—I charged Vary with assaulting, me, and throwing my Malacca cane away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I fainted away at the police-station, for about an hour, or an hour and a quarter—there were two women and Vary—the woman that spoke to me had been in Vary's company before he came up to me—I saw both the women it his company before he came up to me.</p>

At a quarter-past eight o'clock last Friday, I saw the prisoner go into a marine-store dealer's shop in Union-street, Lambeth; I saw some lead on the scale there—I went in, and asked where he got it—he said, "What is that to you?"—I told him I was a police-constable, and he then said, "My master gave it me"—he said his master was Mr. Inglis, of Lambeth-walk—I took him into custody, and at the station he told me he got it from Frazer's yard, that he had been employed with others clearing it out, and he found it there.</p>

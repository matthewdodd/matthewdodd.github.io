                  </hi>. I am a brass-founder, and live in Shoe-lane—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my employ. In consequence of suspicion, on the 30th of August, I sent for an officer, and as the prisoner was coming out to go home in the evening, he was searched, and an ingot of brass and some copper found on him, which he had had out of the warehouse that day to melt in the foundry—this is it.</p>

About four or five o'clock, on the afternoon of the 30th of August, I saw a bit of copper lying near the prisoner's jacket, which was not its proper place—I in<lb></lb>metal, formed my employer's son—in the evening I saw the prisoner with some and instead of putting it into the furnace, he put it down by the side of the rumble, and from there he shifted it to where I found the other bit.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 1st of July, I saw the two prisoners in the street a little to the left of my door - they were quarrelling with a man, and asked him if he was a pensioner: he said what was that to them; Rolfe then struck him and knocked his hat off; I stepped off the stones, and said it was shameful to use a man in that way; they turned from him and followed me, and before I got into my door they knocked me down senseless; I was got in by my wife and sister; I had 1s. 4d. in my right-hand trousers pocket, and when I came to myself, my wife said,"Your pocket is turned out;" I then felt, and the money was gone; I was quite sober when I went to the door; after I had got into my house, they repeatedly said they wished they had me out they would kill me; after it had struck eleven o'clock, they came back with a great many other people and broke open my door; I am a Chelsea pensioner, and carry on the umbrella business; I am quite sure the prisoners are the men who ill-treated me; there is a gaslight near there, and it was quite light enough for me to see them; I have repeatedly seen them in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROLFE. Q. How long did you see me and the other man fighting? A. I dare say for five minutes; I did not knock you off your second's knee with the leg of a bedstead; Croft came afterwards and gave himself up.</p>

            . I live in the same house with the prosecutor. On the night of the 1st of July I was standing opposite my lodgings - between ten and eleven o'clock the two prisoners came up to me; Rolfe struck me and knocked my hat off, Croft took it up and ran away with it; Rolfe and I fell into a house, he was stronger than me, and threw me on the ground; Croft then came back and kicked me; Tunny came out, and said it was a shame for them to illuse me in that way; they turned round from me and both struck him; he returned towards his own door - the prisoners and others followed him; there was a great row, but I did not see anything done to his pocket; his wife and sister came out and drew him into the house and shut the door; I dare say, at that time, there was half the people in the street round the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROLFE. Q. Were you not standing at the door of the Three Crowns public-house, quarrelling with a man and woman? A. I was standing opposite my own door advising a drunken man to go home with his wife - I did not touch you; I did not fight at all - I struck in my own defence as well as I could - I did not pull my jacket off.</p>

            . I am sister of James Tunny. I was at his house on the night of the 1st of July, I was putting the children to bed - I heard the quarrel and came down; I saw the two prisoner's hitting my brother, (who was then on the ground) on his right arm - I and his wife went to his assistance; she was beat off; Rolfe struck me and gave me a black eye; I kept hold of my brother and his wife - I dragged him in and got the door shut: I did not observe whether anything had been taken from his pocket I was in so much tremor - there were not many persons about when we got him in, but they returned afterwards and broke in the middle of the door, threw stones in, and broke the window between the parlour and the shop; I am quite sure I saw the prisoners, by the light of the lamp at the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near was your brother to the house when you went out? A. Close to the step; it was an oil lamp, but light enough to see the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROLFE. Did you see any blood on my head, or jacket, or handkerchief? A. No, I did not - I was trying to get my brother in.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any blood on your brother? A. Yes, on his face, where a woman kicked him twice; I saw the prisoner kick my brother till I thought they had kicked the life out of him.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I took Rolfe on the 4th of August, at No. 4, College-street, Chelsea-common; I found this box of tools nailed down under his bed - I asked him what they were; he said his own tools, and he made bird-cages with them; here is a stock and two centre-bits, some chisels, and files.</p>
               <p>ROLFE'S Defence. I was coming up the row with a man named Stoner - we heard a piece of work at the Three Crowns; I went and asked Callaghan what was the matter - he said, what odds was it to me, and struck me; we had five or six rounds - Stoner picked me up, and I was sitting on his knee; Tunny came up with a leg of a bedstead and knocked me down - I have the mark on my head now; when I came to myself he was gone into his house, and there was a mob of fifty or sixty people there - and they said, "Break the door open;" some persons did throw stones at the door - and I saw Tunny with a drawn sword, saying he would cut down any man that came near him.</p>
               <p>CROFT'S Defence. I was coming by the prosecutor's house, and saw Tunny; I said, "Is there a fight?" he said,"It is no odds to you," I saw him go up to Rolfe and knock him off his second's knee; I said it was a shame - he struck me, I had a struggle with him, and got the stick from him; he then went to his house: I saw some persons follow him, but I went home - I took the stick to the officer, and he has it now.</p>

            . I was going up the row with Croft, and hearing a piece of work we went back, and got against Tunny's door - I did not see the first of the piece of work, but I saw Tunny come out of the door with a piece of a bedstead, as it appeared to me, and he struck Rolfe over the head with it - he was very much covered with blood; Croft said it was a great shame, and went to take the stick out of his hand - he hit Croft on the arm and on the side; after a few minutes Croft got the stick from him - he then ran in doors, and fetched out an old rusty sword, as it appeared to be, and said that the first one that came near to him he would run him through - that was on the threshold of his own house, not in the passage; the street door of his house was open - I do not know whether it had been broken; I had before that seen him lying down near the step of his door - I believe Croft was then washing Rolfe's head at the next door but one; I did not see any person kick him - I was not in the house with Rolfe when he was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES TUNNY. Q. Did you see this witness? A. Yes; she kicked me on the cheek as I lay on the ground; she lives with Croft - I am sure she is the person who kicked me, and she was fined 14s. for it at Queen-square; I did not come out with any bed-post - I had no sword in my hand at all; I could hardly draw my breath - there were people about me directly; I could not see who took my money - I had changed half-a-crown in the afternoon, and had 1s. 4d. in my pocket; the pocket was turned out - there was no fight between Callaghan and the prisoners - he only struck in his own defence, and I said it was a shame for two to be on one; I was then going back to my own door, and just as I got there they knocked me down - I have no doubt they intended to take my life; I never struck either of them at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROLFE. There were two men taken up with that woman for breaking the door, and they had a fortnight each.</p>

            . On the 6th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner in company with another woman came into my shop; the other woman purchased three yards of flannel and a yard of cotton lace; she paid for them, and they went away; after they were gone, we missed a remnant of thread lace; I desired my young man to pursue them and bring them back, he did so; we searched the prisoner, she untied her apron and laid it on the counter, my young man found it in her apron. When she was brought back her apron was folded up on her left arm.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>

The young woman put the lace and the flannel into my apron; I knew nothing of it till the young man tapped me on the shoulder, he said I had got something in my apron; I says, I have not; I untied my apron and gave it into his hands; I knew nothing about it, nor never saw it.</p>

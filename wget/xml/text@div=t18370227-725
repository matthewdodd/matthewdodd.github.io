                  </hi>. My father is a baker, in Seymoar-place, Marylebone. On the 31st of January the prisoner came to our shop for a penny loaf, and gave me a shilling in payment—I looked at it, and saw it was bad—I went to the parlour door and called my father out, and gave him the shilling—he came to the counter to the prisoner, and lent me for a policeman—I could not find one, and came back—the prisoner then went out—I followed her for about seven minutes—I then met a policeman, and he went with me down Edgeware-road—we saw her run<lb></lb>ning, and stopped her at the corner of Berkeley-street—I had the bad shilling in my hand—my father had returned it to me—I gave it to Marlow.</p>

My son called me into the shop, and I saw the prisoner there, and no one else—I asked how many shillings she had of the same sort—she answered me very improperly—I said, unless she could give me some account of herself, I should put her into the bands of the police, as I suspected she was a passer of base coin—I said, "You will certainly give a good account of yourself at the police-station"—she said, "Perhaps I may, and perhaps I may not"—I sent my son for a policeman,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday evening, the 31st of January, I met Thompson and went with him after the prisoner into Edgeware-road—I there saw her running—I overtook and secured her—the shilling was given to me by the boy in the shop—I marked it in the presence of the father and son and the prisoner—she said, in going back to the shop, "Had I known that young b——had been following me I would have lamed him"—I said to her, "I think I have seen you before; is not You r name Hayton?"—she said, "No, you are not far from it; it is Yates," or something—she was searched at the station, and a good shilling found on her—she said, "They can do nothing to me, for there is only one piece."</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to his Majesty's Mint. One of the shillings produced by the officer is counterfeit, and the other is good—the counterfeit one is not of the same impression as the genuine one—it is Bri<lb></lb>tannia metal. (The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she was not aware the shilling was bad—that she remained a quarter of an hour in the shop for a policeman before she left—and it beginning to rain, caused her to run.)</p>

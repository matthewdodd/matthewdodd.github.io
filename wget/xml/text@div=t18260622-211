On the 16th of May, at half-past one o'clock, I was in the shop - a friend came to read the newspaper; I then-went to dinner, and at a quarter before two o'clock I opened my shop door, and saw the prisoner's hand within my window; I said, "Good God, I am robbed again;" I ran through the shop, and turned to my right; I collared him, and brought him back - I found nothing on him, but I had lost four gold watches, which cost me in manufacturing about 90l., and a movement, which cost twenty-five guineas; I found a runner dropped into my area, which is here; I have found nothing else since - I had seen the property about fifteen minutes before, laying on a tray; a piece of glass was cut out of the window, and the prisoner's little finger was cut, and bled profusely; I do not suppose it had been ten seconds from my first seeing it and taking him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me by the side of the window? A. I saw your hand in the window, and then ran to the door; I then saw you walking very leisurely down the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know that the hand which you saw was the prisoner's hand? A. I cannot swear to that; I had not lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking through your window did you see anybody but him? A. I saw his hand - I ran out and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I running or walking? A. Walking.</p>
               <p>Q. You said at first, that I had been trying to cut your window? A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you think I would lay in a prison if he came and offered me money to tell him where the property was? Witness. I did not - I have never seen him since he has been committed, nor any human being from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you bring an old woman with you, and she said, "That is him" - and you told me I should get acquitted if I told you? A. No.</p>
               <p>ANN HEDGES. I was passing Mr. Ham's door on the 16th of May - I was standing by the window for a moment, as I had a bad cough; the prisoner and two other young men were there - they said something about me; I went to turn back, and the window snapped; the two others then went down Holborn-hill, and the prisoner staid; when I heard the window crack I went away directly; I saw Mr. Ham come out and collar him; I was going to speak to the beadle, but he came and took him; the prisoner is the man who had his hand in the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I say? A. You said you did not want any coughing old b-s there. I saw Mr. Ham coming, or I should have gone in and told him; he collared you, and your finger was bleeding.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HAZLEWOOD WORRAL. I am an officer, and took the prisoner into custody; the prosecutor accused him of having his finger cut, and taking some watches; there was nothing found on him - he said he lived with his mother, at No. 19, Union-street, and she kept a stay-shop - I went there, but there was no such person. Here is the runner which was found in the area.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a holyday on Monday and Tuesday, and went out to take a walk - I was passing that gentleman's window; I was twelve yards off when he came and said I had been trying to cut his window.</p>

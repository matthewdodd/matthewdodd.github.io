            . I am an auctioneer, and live in the Hackney Road. On the 4th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw a cart with two horses in motion; the prisoner who drove was by the side of the cart, away from the horses. I heard people cry out</p>
               <p>"Stop the cart," and women screaming. I looked at the fore part of the cart, and saw a child, between two and three years old in the road, about a foot from the wheel; but at that time the prisoner was by the side of the shaft horse, and I think it was impossible he could see the child, who was on the off side of the cart; he was by the side of the horse at the time the wheel went over the child.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the cry of</p>
               <p>"Stop the cart!" was he near enough to have a contronl over it, to stop it - A. I think he could have stopped the cart, if he had seen the <rs id="t18220522-54-viclabel292" type="occupation">child</rs>

I saw the wheel go over the child; its arm was wounded. I saw blood on the ground. The people got round the prisoner and abused him; he said he could not stop the cart. I gave him my address, saying I would speak on his behalf. I am confident he could not help it.</p>

               <p>"The child will be run over!" I looked and saw the child about two yards in front of the wheel; it passed over it, and injured it much in the arm and thigh. A gentleman snatched it up; the prisoner seemed concerned, and said he could not help it. It appeared a healthy child, and was two years and five months old. I think the prisoner did not see it till it was run over, and could not back his cart. He said he was very sorry it had happened.</p>

            . I live in Union-street, Hoxton; I was in Bunhill-row, and heard a screaming; I looked round and saw the child bleeding; and went with it to Dr. Roper's, in Bunhill-row, it was taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>- I am apprentice to a surgeon, at St. Bartholomew Hospital, the child was brought there; I examined it, its arm was severely lacerated, and its legs bruised; it died in ten days. I have no doubt that the accident caused its death.</p>

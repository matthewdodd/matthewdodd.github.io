I kept it that night, and on the morrow morning I presented it for payment, and it was refused; I did not see the prisoner for half a year or more, until he was taken up and at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at the bar ever tell you where he lived, and what he was? - He informed me he was a cheesemonger in Covent Garden, and dealt in the wholesale way.</p>
               <p>Did he say what part? - He did not, but he gave me this written direction as his address.</p>
               <p>(The direction produced.)</p>
               <p>What else did he say at that time he bought the horse? - He said he had nothing to take the horse home with, on which I lent him a pair of spurs and a bridle.</p>
               <p>After you found the note was refused at Mess. Prescotts and Co. what did you do in consequence of that? - I went immediately to New-street, but could not find any such person there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You had a conversation of some length with the prisoner at Waltham-abbey fair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He bargained very hard about this horse? - Not very hard.</p>
               <p>He offered at first twenty pounds? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>What was the price? - I informed you before.</p>
               <p>You asked him twenty-five pounds, and he said it was too much? - He did.</p>
               <p>How long might you be settling, or endeavouring to settle at the fair? - When he came to Enfield we settled in a very short time.</p>
               <p>First of all answer my question; you did not agree at all at Waltham-abbey fair? - We did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he offer you as low as twenty pounds at that fair? - He did not.</p>
               <p>He did offer you something less? - He did.</p>
               <p>You gave him your address at Enfield, and he came to you? - He asked me for it.</p>
               <p>You was some time before you could agree at Enfield? - No, very little time.</p>
               <p>You know there was something, you did not agree, and he went over to the inn? - Yes, but he soon returned.</p>
               <p>So, in point of fact, there were three conversations about the horse, before you agreed together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, at the time he gave you this draft, did not he tell you he could not be able to make up the price unless you would take a draft he received at the fair? - I am certain he said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not say he received it at the fair? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not he tell you he had not cash enough to pay for it? - I cannot say whether he said that, I understood that I was to have had money for it; but appearing to be a creditable person, I thought the note would be equally the same.</p>
               <p>He said he had not got money enough, and he gave you the draft? - He did.</p>
               <p>You say he told you that he lived in Covent Garden, and you went to New-street, how came you to go there? - From the directions he gave, which said New-street, Covent Garden.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130007"></xptr>Mr. Prescott has a considerable seat in your neighbourhood? - He has, and therefore I did not doubt the credit of that note.</p>
               <p>You heard afterwards of your saddle and bridle, that it had been burnt in the stable where the horse was lodged? - There was such a thing mentioned.</p>
               <p>Did not you learn it from the prisoner himself? - He told me so.</p>

               <p>Then, in point of fact, there had been a fire in some stable where the prisoner had deposited this horse? - I cannot learn that as a fact, he said so at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did not you learn there had been a fire at the stable where he had deposited the horse? - I never heard of the horse.</p>
               <p>Did not you learn, in point of fact, that the stable where the prisoner had deposited the horse had been burned? - I never learned it, I knew there was a fire in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. How long after the sale of the horse at Enfield, did the fire happen in Long-lane? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner on the 7th of September - A. Yes, a little before two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a watch upon her - A. No; when I proceeded to search her she stooped down, and when I had searched her I begged her to move, and the watch was found under her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you search her - A. At No. 45, Charles street, Drury lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she an opportunity of laying the watch down where you found it - A. Yes, when she stooped down she stooped close to the floor; the watch has been in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in bed that night; between eleven and twelve o'clock a woman that lived in the next room to me, she had a child about six years old that was very ill; she called to me and asked me to get her a light; I went down stairs to the watchman to get a light; as I went down there is a staircase window that goes down into the next house; as I went down by the light of the night I saw a woman run through the yard; I went to get the light, and when I came to the street door this man laid hold of me and said I had robbed him. I work hard for my living. The woman that I came down to get a light for would have been here, but she is in St. Bartholomew's hospital.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the woman that was in the court with me, and nobody else.</p>

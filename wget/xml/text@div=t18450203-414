                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) I was living at No. 7, Wellington-buildings, when I was taken into custody on another charge—on the 2nd of Jan. I was opposite the prosecutor's shop a little before seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner take down the shutter, and do some<lb></lb>thing with his finger to the glass—I presently saw the pane of glass in his hand—he went about twenty yards, put it down in the gutter, came back, and took something out of the window, and gave it to a boy named Brown, he went back again, took something more, and ran away—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> some<lb></lb>thing down like a box, then went up Markham-street, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> something over the school ground—the box was thrown down in John-street among a lot of stones, and made a rattling sound—something was thrown over a gateway in Waterloo-place—I lost sight of the prisoner and Brown—next day I heard I was suspected, and went to the prosecutor's—I told him what I had seen—I went with him, and pointed out where I had seen things thrown away—I saw him find some pencils in the school ground.</p>

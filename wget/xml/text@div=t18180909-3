I was alarmed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090004"></xptr>by the watchman about twenty minutes after three o'clock, and got up; I found the kitchen window cut it was not light the window and shutters were shut, and a tablecloth put in the hole which was cut it was not cut overnight; so that if a person had a candle in the house, it could not be seen outside. The hole was large enough for a person's hand to get through, and they could reach to unfasten the window. I searched about the house, and found every place open, and a great many things taken. About half-past four o'clock we made another search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was not light when I was alarmed. I had a candle to search the house. The watchman was in the house his lanthorn had a light in it.</p>

            . About twenty minutes before three o'clock in the morning, I found a liquor bottle stand, and a pair of trowsers, in which was a note directed to Mr. Dawson's house-it was not light. I immediately went there it had struck three o'clock when I got to the house it was then getting light. I went into the kitchen, and found a hole cut in the shutter, and the table-cloth put into it, which was large enough for an arm to get through. I suppose it had been cut with a chisel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If you had met an acquaintance in the street at the time, should you have known him A. The light would not have enabled me to have known his face. I found the things about twelve yards from Mr. Dawson's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 113, Bishopsgate Street Without, and assist at an eating-house there—on 8th September, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came in for some cold veal and bread—he gave me a half-crown—I put it into the till, and went to my mistress for change, as she had just cleared the till—I got change, and gave the prisoner a florin and threehalfpence, and he left—he called again and had fourpennyworth more refreshment—he gave me a half-crown—I bent it, and took it to my mistress, who bounced it on the table, and said that it was bad—a customer spoke to the prisoner, and said, "I would not mind laying a sovereign you have more about you"—he said, "No, I only have two"—I went to the till, and found the half-crown—there was no other money there—I fetched the prisoner back, and he was given in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not say at the first examination that after I had gone out you remembered taking another half-crown, and that you took it to your mistress, who told you to fetch me back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never said that I had taken two bad half-crowns from a party—I pulled my mistress's dress when she was giving her evidence, but it was only because she was speaking too fast—you did not say that you got the half-crowns at a public-house—you said your employer gave them to you—I remember a butcher then saying, "Then, if you knew where you took it, if the party does not take your word, you may refer him here, where it is nailed to the counter."</p>

               <p>cleared the till, and soon afterwards Mary Kelly came to me for change for a half-crown, which she had put into the till—I gave her change from my pocket—half an hour afterwards she brought another half-crown—I looked at it and said, "Who gave you this?"—she pointed to the prisoner—I said, "I am sorry you should take an advantage of a child "—he said that he was very sorry to have it in his possession, as he got it from his employer—I told my young man to break it in two, and said, "It is not legal to give back bad coins, lest they should be passed again; I shall give you part of it, and your employer can come and see the other part "—a man then said, "Now, my fellow, I think you have got it hot; I will bet you have yet some more "—the girl then went to the till and found the other—I gave him in charge, with the two half-crowns—he did not name his employer.</p>

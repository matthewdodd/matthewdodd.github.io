            . I am one of the patrol. As I was patroling Hatton-street between eleven and twelve at night, of the 4th of this month, I saw somebody fastening the window of Mr. Willermine's house, I saw the hand of the person that fastened it. Going my rounds between one and two, or near two in the morning, I looked down the prosecutor's area, and observed the sash of the kitchen window pushed up; the inside shutter was open, and I saw a man's legs on the outside of the window, the rest of his body being within the house: I made an alarm with my rattle, and two or three watchmen came, who guarded the area till the prisoner was taken: when I gave the alarm with my rattle, the man whose legs I had seen on the outside of the window, sprung from the window like a dart, and concealed himself in the area under the steps of the house till he was taken: the prisoner is the man that was taken in the area, he had then boots on, and spurs in his pocket, but there were no implements for house-breaking found about him, nor any weapons.</p>

            . I am a watchman: I heard an alarm of thieves; when I came up Sanders told me there were thieves in the area, upon that we called up the people: we were let into the house by Godfrey; we went through the house into the area, and there took the prisoner under the steps that lead into the house: there were no implements for housebreaking or weapons found upon him.</p>
               <p>GODFREY. There was nothing at all lost; the man was detected as he was getting into the house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Sanders the patrol told the justice a different story at the time I was carried before him; for then he only said he saw the shadow of a man in the area; and did not say any thing of seeing the legs on the outside, or body of a man being below: Godfrey said before the justice that the bar was bent, and did not say any thing of the shutters being forced open. The reason of my being down the area was, I was going by at that time of the night, when some men came by and knocked my hat off into the area: I was a little in liquor; I went down into the area in order to recover my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Godfrey. Did you give a different account before the justice, to what you have given now? - I believe the bar was forced open by the force of a push, it was forced out about seven inches, and lodged by a bit of moulding; and the window shutters were open about a foot; the bar being bent, the shutters were forced as far as the bar would admit of; but the bar was not above a foot and half high from the bottom of the window. I did not give any different account before the justice.</p>
               <p>SANDERS. I did not give a different account before the justice. I not only saw the shadow of a man, but I saw the man himself.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether the legs you saw had boots on or not? - I did not.</p>

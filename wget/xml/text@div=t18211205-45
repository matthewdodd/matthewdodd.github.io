               <p>MR. DYKE. (Looking at the assignation book for 1815.) The first entry made of this suit, is on the bye day after Trinity Term the 2d of June, 1815, that only shews that the cause was pending. I find by the Court caveat book, that script A. was exibited on the 5th of September, 1815, script B. was propounded on the 22d of November, and repropounded on the 31st of January, 1816 - script A. was propounded in September, and abandoned when B. was produced. Neither A. nor B. bear any date.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any thing done in the suit before the 26th of September, when script A. was propounded - A. Nothing, but the usual assignations were made, there was an order, that unless further scripts were produced, the Court would pronounce against A. if paper B. had been pronounced, we should have proceeded again on paper A. there was no unnecessary delay with reference to script A. I had notice from the other party, that unless I proceeded on the 5th of September, they should move the Court to grant administration - the notice is dated the 23d of August, and on the 5th of September, A. was exhibited, I gave notice of to my correspondents at Hull. There was no unnecessary delay.</p>

            . Q. You reside at Hull - A. I do; the prisoner also lived there, I have known him since 1810, and some years before that; between that time and the present, I have known him intimately, he came into my service as manager of my white lead works, in 1810, and remained till 1816 - he was principal manager; very important interests were entrusted to him, he always conducted himself exceeding well - he might have defrauded me of thousands of pounds without being detected, and I believe he never defrauded me of a penny, but behaved with fidelity.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did he leave you - A. About August, 1816. he went to reside at the end of the town, and commenced business on his own account, as agent for the sale of lead, he might have done business for himself while with me. I gave him 150 l. a year, house rent, taxes, and coals - he had a wife and two children. I knew where he lived. If there was any change in his mode of living after he left me, it was for the worse, there was no improvement. I believe he lived at Hull, up to the present time, except being abroad a short time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he was forthcoming if any application had been made for him - A. Yes. There was no appearance of his having increased in wealth. He was abroad two or three months.</p>
               <p>The deposition made by the prisoner at Doctor's Commons, was then put in and read: - It stated in answer to the third article of the assignation put in by the opposite party, the deponent says, on the 30th of April, he called on the deceased after dinner, about three o'clock as was his usual custom, and found him ill, of the illness of which he died, the deceased was sitting with Eliza Robinson, and having enquired of him about his health,

The script A. was brought in on the 5th of September, 1815, the Court gave me time to consider whether I propounded it, and in the course of that time B. was brought in. In September Gosling gave notice of his intention to oppose script A. being propounded.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the mode of commencing a suit - A. One is by a caveat being entered by a party (interested in the testator's effects) against the will being pronounced without their knowledge. The other is calling on the parties to bring in a decree if they have any. The caveat is entered in a book kept at the Commons, it is not here. After the caveat we give notice to the Proctor who enters it, to appear to say why he opposes, and he enters his reason. The entries which have been referred to are all subsequent ones.</p>

I produce the witnesses in Court, they are then sworn by the Judge, and the Proctor hands the interrogatories over to the examiner. No witnesses were produced on the the other side; it appears by an entry in the book that time was allowed the opposite party to bring witnesses - none were brought. I prayed publication on the 8th of May, 1816, and on the 1st of June, Mr. Gosling declared he gave no allegation except objecting to the witnesses; the case then stood for them to give their objection to the witnesses; and on the 26th of June he declared he gave no objecting allegation.

Yes; it was respecting a man abroad having a right to oppose, by the assignation book it appears it was ordered on the 8th of December; the termination of the suit was in July, 1816, as the party did not appear in that interval. The letter enclosing script A. is dated the 2d of September. I have no doubt of script B. being the paper pronounced as the will, or that the allegation and depositions refer to that paper, it is deposited in the Prerogative Office with the clerk of the papers before probate.

               <p>Q. At all times that was the state of their behaviour - A. At all times. I knew the prisoner perfectly well; after Mr. Robinson's death I was the only servant, I attended the door and did every thing. Mr. Robinson died six or seven months after I went there. I recollect Mr. Saxelbye being there only once in that time. I do not remember whether it was on a Sunday or week day. I do not know what he came for.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home on Sundays, or had you leave to go out - A. I went out after tea, sometimes every Sunday, and sometimes once a fortnight. It was not usual for Saxelbye to come to see Mr. Robinson on a Sunday. Mr. Robinson was taken ill on Monday, the 1st of May; I remember the day before that (Sunday) Mr. Lockwood was with him most of that day, he came in the morning before ten o'clock, or a little after, and continued till one o'clock, and in the afternoon he came again, a little after two o'clock, and continued till six o'clock. Between twelve and one o'clock, Mr. and Mrs. Ballan called, they might stop half an hour. They dined at half-past one on that Sunday; Mr. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson, Miss

             sat down to dinner. When Lockwood came dinner was off the table - I believe there was some wine on the table. Miss Hewson went away, and Miss Philipson stopped, they continued all in one room together, and drank tea about six o'clock, I never saw Mr. Robinson go out of the room. Mr. Saxelbye never came into the house during that day. Mr. Robinson was not particularly ill on that day - he made no particular complaint, he complained of the coldness of the day. Mr. Martin his attorney called next day, and his clerk came, they both saw Mr. Robinson together. On Monday night, at eleven o'clock, or half-past, he was taken ill, quite deranged, and died on the Monday following; he was generally light-headed all that time, and had a nurse for two days.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after his death did you see Mr. Saxelbye at his house - A. Perhaps six or seven weeks after; he was frequently there, two or three times a week for a long time. I never heard him talk with Mrs. Robinson or any one about the will. I knew Messrs. Galon and Wilson, the attornies, Mr. Galon frequently came to our house, I cannot recollect whether he was ever there when Saxelbye was. I took a note to the prisoner at Mr. Picard's office from Mrs. Robinson, six or seven weeks after Mr. Robinson died, it was before he came to visit so frequently. I was ordered to deliver it into his hands, and ask what time he would call, which I did.</p>

             is dead, Miss Ann is living - Miss Hewson is Mrs. Robinson's sister, and Mrs. Stevenson was another sister, she is also dead. This was the first place I was at in Hull. I saw Saxelbye in the house once before my master died, but did not recollect his person till Mr. Robinson mentioned his name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him once when Mr. Robinson was alive, did you at that time know his name was Saxelbye - A. I did afterwards, for I heard Mr. Robinson mention Mr. Saxelbye many times over after he was gone.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT HULLOCK. Q. Mr. Robinson was not particularly ill in April - A. No; he had been ailing some time, he was not very ill, he could go out on business; he was not out on Sunday, but on Saturday he went out airing, in a post-chaise hired for that purpose; he had walked out within a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. How often will you swear he was out walking within a week of the 30th April - A. I will swear he was out once, but will not swear to more than once. I cannot say on what day it was. That was the first time of his going out in a chaise. Mr. Young was his medical attendant. Mr. Robinson had sent me for him once or twice before the 30th of April, it might be a week before, he was not there on the 30th.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At no period of that day between ten o'clock in the morning and ten at night did you see Mr. Young there - A. No; I did not let him in nor see him, he could not be there without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear distinctly he was not there on the 30th of April - A. I do, nor on Saturday. I was not out after tea on the 30th of April, nor at any time in the day. Mrs. Philipson was there.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not go out on that day about three o'clock - A. I did not, nor did she let me in. Mrs. Stevenson has a son, he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Robinson having some celery on that day - A. There was no such thing in the house, if there had I must have seen it, I never remember it being sent at any time by Mr. Stevenson, he was not there on that day; nobody could let themselves in and out without my seeing them, for the kitchen door is right opposite the street door, and it was always open, if I shut it my master always opened it; I must see every body who comes in if I am in the kitchen, the street door is the only entrance to the house. Mrs. and Mr. Robinson did not live affectionately together.</p>
               <p>Q. Robinson could have left the house if he liked - A. Yes. They went out airing together. I left Mrs. Robinson in 1819, she died in 1820. I still reside at Hull.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined before to day on this matter - A. Not in Court. I was not examined at York, I was there last Assizes, but was not examined before the Grand Jury there, nor at Hull. I have known Mr. Rushworth, the attorney, above a year, I cannot say when I first saw him on this subject, it was better than a year ago; he applied to me - he did not say how he found me out - I had lived with Mrs. Robinson nearly down to this time - I was never asked about this before that. I was here in October on this business - I have been twice before the Grand Jury, but only once before this time. I left Hull last Sunday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050028"></xptr>and was in London a month or six weeks before on this business, they were the only times. The first time I communicated this to Rushworth was twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate any thing to any one on the subject before you left your mistress's service - A. No; I first mentioned it eight or ten months after. I believe Mr. Lockwood first questioned me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did Lockwood come on Sunday - A. A little after ten o'clock, and continued till near one; he returned, and was there till near six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he knew every thing that took place during those hours, and must have known that you knew as well as him what took place - A. Yes; I let him in and out; the first time he applied to me was eight or ten months after I left Mrs. Robinson's. I believe I left at the latter end of April, it might be the 27th, it was on a Thursday. I saw Rushworth about two months after Lockwood applied to me; he came to me, I did not know him before - I told him what I have stated to-day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have been examined before the Grand Jury within the last few days - A. Yes; and once before that, only these two times. I did not leave my mistress on any ill terms - I have had no quarrel or dispute with the prisoner. I left my mistress in April, 1819, I did not tell Lockwood or Rushworth about this business till I was enquired of about it. I have been in service ever since I left Mrs. Robinson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whose service are you now in - A. Mr. Ansell's, he is single, his wife is dead, she was not living when I went; he has four children - I am the only servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether you were out on the 23d of April, 1815 - A. I cannot recollect; nor whether Lockwood was there on that day, he is a merchant. I do not recollect whether there was any company there on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you were out on the 17th A.- I do not; I was not out on the 7th of May, there was company on that day, several people came to see Mr. Robinson, some of them saw him. Before I went to Robinson's, I lived in service at York - my father's name is

            , and knew his mother-in-law, Eliza. I first became acquainted with him in 1812; he lived with his mother-in-law occasionally, I was on terms of intimacy with him, and visited him. He sometimes lived in the country, and sometimes with his mother-in-law, principally with her - I visited him frequently there.</p>
               <p>Q. How often before his death, used you to go and see him - A. Perhaps once or twice a week, he came to see me, and I went to see him. I cannot exactly tell when he died, I do not know the day of the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at his house a short time before he died - A. Yes, on Sunday, the 30th of April, 1815, and saw him on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after the Tuesday - A. Yes; he was virtually struck with death then, he was not dead, but his senses were taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. That circumstance enables you to recollect that you were with him on the Sunday preceding - A. It does; I do not recollect being with him on any preceding Sunday, I might be. On Sunday, the 30th of April, I went to his house about half-past ten o'clock, and to the best of my recollection, staid with him till about twelve o'clock, or a quarter past. I went again about two o'clock, and staid till about five o'clock or half-past, to the best of my recollection. Miss Philipson and Miss Hewson were sitting in the room with him. I cannot remember whether they remained there all the time or not - I did not see the prisoner there on that day, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was not there between two and half-past five o'clock - A. To the best of my recollection, he was not. I think I met him there once, about twelve months after Mr. Robinson's death. I never remember meeting him there before his death, I was there frequently - I saw Bailey there on the 30th.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of observing on what terms Mr. and Mrs. Robinson lived - A. I thought they were usually quarrelling - I have seen Mr. Robinson write once or twice, and am able to speak to his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the signature to this paper, (script A,) is that his hand-writing - A. I do not believe it is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at the other paper; do you believe that to be his - A. Yes, I do. Will your Lordship allow me to explain. I have sworn now that I believe it not his, but before yesterday, I should have come into Court and have sworn and believed it was his writing, in consequence of the s being entwined in the first part of the R in the high part of the letter R, but when I observed last evening another paper with the same blundering son to the latter part of it, and without a turn, and the T not taken over the ho, I am compelled on my oath to say what I have; that I believe it not to be his writing. I did not visit Mrs. Robinson after his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. What do you mean by a general commercial agent - A. A broker, I have been so ten years, I think I have seen Mr. Robinson write once or twice - I have seen him sign a cheque to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. And on that knowledge, you come to prove a man guilty of forgery - A. I do not come to prove a man guilty of forgery, I am come to prove it is not Mr. Roinson's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen some paper yesterday, you would have said you believed it was his - A. Yes. I should; I told the Grand Jury I could not take on myself to swear it was not Mr. Robinson's writing; I only swear it is not now, from the reasons I have given. I have known Mr. Rushworth twenty-two or twenty-three years - I never spoke to him about the hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now will you swear that - A. Mr. Robinson asked me about it, I might have spoken to him about it. I was a witness before the Grand Jury, at York, last assizes, on an indictment for perjury, it was for perjury on this business altogether, on the facts of it being wrong, I was to prove I was there at the time Saxelbye swore the will was made.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The letter T on each of these is the same as on the document - A. The very same. In his usual way of writing he turned the letter n over, and it is not done here, and but for that, I should have thought it was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT HULLOCK. Q. You were examined several times before Grand Juries, Mr. Rushworth was always attorney - A. Yes; I did not tell him what I was prepared to swear. I first saw the paper last October twelve months, in Doctor's Commons, I saw Rushworth before I came up to see it. I came up on purpose to examine it, when I returned, I told him that on the first flush of the business I considered it

               <p>COURT. Q. You did not see them before you went to the Grand Jury at York - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT HULLOCK. Q. Do you mean to swear you did not see the papers till you went before the Grand Jury at York - A. No. I saw some before, Rushworth shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, on your oath, you had not inspected those papers before you went into the Grand Jury room at York - A. No, not one half of them, there was a score of them, I examined about six.</p>

               <p>MR. SERJEANT HULLOCK. Q. Do you mean Rushworth only shewed you six, has he not shewn you fifty at different times - A. No; he has not, perhaps he has shewed me half a dozen, I always told the Grand Juries I would not swear it was not Thomas Robinson's writing, and told Rushworth so all along, he might have sent me before the Grand Jury for other facts, I was not sent for that exact purpose. Rushworth's servant paid my expences to town, I never told him I could swear it was not Thomas Robinson's handwriting. Mr. Martin shewed me a paper last night, Mr. Goodey was present, I altered my mind from the signature to that paper. The name at the head of one of these papers would confirm my opinion that it was Robinson's writing, but the others would not.</p>

I did not know Rushworth when I lived there, I have known him about three years, I went to York with him last October. I have seen the paper produced four times, I first saw it at York, last August, and again in September, before the Grand Jury here, I came up again in October, and saw it again on Saturday, I came free up and down, and at York I do not know who paid my expences, or what they came to; Mr. Martin and Goodey did not shew me any paper yesterday. I live fifty miles from Hull, I went to Cottingham in 1812, that is only five miles; I sometimes received a note from Robinson there.

               <p>Q. You said before that you thought one was his, and the other two not - A. Now I think they are all three his writing, and I think the signature to the will may be written by the person who wrote those three documents.</p>

I had seen him execute a release before this; I cannot say I was well acquainted with his hand writing, I saw him write six or seven times in 1810, when he was of age, and settled with his father's executors - I can only give an opinion of his writing, from a comparison with other documents; I can speak from my memory of what I saw him write.

When I first saw it in Doctor's Commons, I could not give an opinion on it - I compared them together afterwards. - I found a total dissimilarity between that and the signature to my letters, and from that I have come to the conclusion that it was not his writing, it is not at all like his writing, I allude to his writing in 1810, and when I last saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not professionally employed for the next of kin when you went to examine the will - A. Yes, I was desired by my partner Schofield to go and examine it, I think it was in November. I know Rushworth, he was clerk to Mr. Wilson, in Hull - his clerk sent me eight guineas with my subpoena. I was at York in August, on this subject - I was here last October, and gave evidence before the Grand Jury, I saw Goodey and Lockwood last night.</p>

             on the top of this, has certainly some resemblance to the signature in the script, and the T in this receipt has the same character as the script, but in the documents I referred to, it is different, and it appears that he had a coxcomical way of writing, he would write Tho at the end of a letter different to what he would write at the beginning of a note.</p>
               <p>Q. If that T had been at the end of the script you would have judged that it was his writing - A. No; the son is distinctly different from the three receipts, and from my documents, the son in the script wants a period, and it is quite different from this. The signatures to my documents are uniform.</p>
               <p>Q. Lockwood said you shewed him a document with a T which changed his opinion - A. I will produce it; the T in that is more like the forgery than any of the others which I have. He appeared to have a great command of his pen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are subscribing witness to some of these documents, perhaps if it was not for that, you would not be so positive to them - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. These papers which you have attested are written in 1810 - A. Yes, I have a deed which was executed in 1815, it is a lease, release, and a receipt, and was all signed by him on the 1st of May, they have the same variations from the script as the others - all my other papers are dated 1810, they are signed exactly like the deed.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not an attorney always pay the expences - A. They ought.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. And the attorney may be a great loser if he has not somebody to repay him - A. Yes. I think the deceased had a great command of penmanship - when he wrote a letter, the T was very different to when he signed anything, but signatures to his letters were the same characters as these documents I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the script in November, 1815, if at that time you suspected it to be a forgery it would be your duty, to communicate it to your clients - A. A communication was made to them, and we were before the Court, but we could not meet the proof, and did not plead, we had not the means to prove it forged - we could not contradict the prisoner's oath; the documents were in the hands of Mr. Horner, the executor to Robinson's father.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew of that then - A. Yes, but I did not interfere in the suit, my partner conducted the suit. I knew who the deceased's banker was.</p>
               <p>Q. Hold this in your hand, (a stock receipt), and then take the lease, compare the two together, and say if they are not very different hand-writings - A. Yes they are.</p>
               <p>Q. The T at the bottom of the deed, has the head of it continued to a considerable length, but in other respects the hand-writing differs very materially - A. They differ, but not very materially.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the script and say how that differs from the deed - A. The T. on the deed appears to be written from the bottom, and the one on the script from the top, that is the only difference as to the name Thomas, the son at the end of the name is materially different, and the R varies a little, and the o in the script, differs from the deed - the bin appears to be the same character. The deed is signed the same as the lease.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is the same difference between the one and the other of them - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did his mother-in-law and him live on good terms or otherwise - I believe quite otherwise. I have heard both him and her declare it many times, I have heard them speak very disrespectfully of each other. I know Mr. Robinson's hand-writing, I have seen him write on many occasions. (Looks at the script.) I have seen him write many score times, to the best of my belief this signature is not his writing.

               <p>Q. Who supplied the money for this - I at first supplied him with money, but I found it more than I could do. I am not in advance at all now. One Carter advances the money, he is a gentleman, he did keep a public-house at Hull, and lives in that neighbourhood now; he has advanced all the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go with Carter to try and get 200 l. on the strength of this business - A. No; Carter went. Wilson asked me to join him in a note for it, but I declined. I said the suit would cost 1000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say it should cost 1000 l. more - A. No; I expect nothing whatever.

               <p>A. You paid some of the expences to town this time - A. Carter gave me money to bring to town to the attorney, when Rushworth told me who to pay it to, I did; I gave him the money, and he returned what I was to pay.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first interfere in the business - A. As soon as the person arrived from abroad. He was an acquaintance of my wife's before he went abroad. I have been married thirteen years, my wife is fifty-two years old, she was intimate with Thomas and Richard - Thomas now lives about four miles from Hull; he never applied to me, nor gave himself any trouble about it; but when Richard came from abroad he called and requested me to enquire about it; that was in February or March, 1820. I applied to Mr. Frost, an attorney, he said he was engaged for the other party. I did not apply to Mr. Rushworth. I have seen Mr. Robinson write letters, and he has shewn them to me, and asked my opinion on them, he has shewn me letters which he had received, and his answer to them, the script is dissimilar to every signature of his letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Then no person who knew his writing could be mistaken - A. I should think not; I said so the moment I saw it. I have compared it with other signatures, and if I could have found one like it I would have done nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these and say whose writing they are - A. I think two of them are his, and two not, I should think they are not all written by one hand. I perceive a complete difference between them and the script, in the T, R, and n, they do not differ so much as other signatures which I have seen, but are still so different that I should give my opinion that it is not his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you advance money at any time - A. At first I advanced I think 100 l. in different sums, I never expected to be rewarded unless he succeeded in the suit. I think I met with Carter in June or July, and he paid me what I had advanced; I think he has advanced 500 l. and upwards, besides the 100 l. he paid me. I think he advanced 150 l. before the summer, and about 100 l. in September.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in October - A. I do not recollect, there was an advance, I think, to Mr. Rushworth - He sent up 150 l. by me for this trial. I do not know what bargain Mr. Carter made. I expected nothing besides what I advanced.</p>

            . I believe it began in Doctor's Commons, in May, 1816, or the beginning of June. The prisoner came many times to our office respecting the suit, I had very little to do in the business, and am not able to say when he first came. A paper marked A, was sent up to town, but I never saw it, we corresponded about it with our agent in town. A paper, marked B. was afterwards sent, the prisoner came to the office between the time the first and second were sent, I think he came a month or two after the first was sent up, he was a witness in support of both the testamentary papers, he was at the office several times before the second was sent, I had no communication with him at all, I had nothing to do with the suit. I know he repeatedly fetched the letters from the Post-Office, to our office, and gave them to me, or Mr. Galon, I never knew him open letters, he had no other business at our office that I know of, My partner had the entire management of the business, he died on the 19th of Sepetember, 1817.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence - My LORD - I must request your indulgent permission to read the short statement I have to offer in my defence, because I am wholly incompetent to address you by speaking, not only from being overpowered by the awful situation in which I stand at the bar, but because it is foreign to all the habits of my life to speak before a public Court. My Lord, it is my unhappy lot, at the age of seventy-three years, to be put upon my trial, on an accusation affecting my life and character, before a Court and Jury, far distant from my own home, and far distant from the place where even the fact for which I am to answer is alleged to have been committed, instead of being brought to trial before a jury of my neighbours, who know my conduct and character, and (which would be far more important for my interest,) who equally well know the character of my prosecutors. Although I now stand here before the Court, a poor miserable old man, accused of a most base offence. I have in earlier life known the bounties of fortune, I was once in an easy, and I may say, in a wealthy condition; and although by the vicissitudes incident to men, who are highly engaged in commercial concerns, I am now comparatively poor, yet until this accusation was raised against me, my moral character was never impeached, and so all my neighbours would have known, without producing witnesses, if I had been brought to trial before a Jury selected from amongst them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the facts of the case are shortly told; the testator, Mr. Robinson, whose will I am accused of forging, was an intimate friend of mine, and I was in the habit of continual social and friendly intercourse with him. In the early part of the year 1815, he was in declining health, and on Sunday, the 30th of April, in that year, I called upon him, as I frequently did. Finding his situation as I thought precarious, and being alone with him, in friendly talk, I asked him if he had made any dispositions of his property, he said he had not, but that he wished his step-mother to have it. At the same time, he added, he would be glad if I would get a will drawn out for him, as I knew he had very strong aversion to any intercourse with lawyers himself, I promised him I would get it done, and accordingly wrote down on a slip of paper his directions, by way of instructions, from which to get a will formally drawn up, and that is the paper which has been produced in evidence. I believe I wrote as nearly as possible in the very words he uttered, I then read them to him, he said it was right, and signed it. I took away the instructions, meaning to get a formal will drawn up from them, and to bring it to him for his signature. At that time I did not consider Mr. Robinson to be in immediate danger, and being particularly occupied the next day, (Monday,) I had not an opportunity of getting the will prepared. On the following morning, (Tuesday,) I learnt that Mr. Robinson had become delirous, and as he never afterwards recovered from that state of mind, I thought it useless to proceed further. The paper remained unnoticed in my possession, as I conceived it a thing of no value, not then knowing or supposing that a little loose memorandum of that sort could have the force of a formal will.</p>
               <p>A day or two after Mr. Robinson's death, another paper was found in his desk, altogether in his own hand-writing, by which it appears, he bequeathed to Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18211205-45-person560">Robinson</persName>
             the purchase-money of a house, he had then lately sold it, and was doubtful whether the papers did not make Mrs. Robinson universal legatee, and I understand, the opinion of Mr. Hart, the Chancery barrister was, that it bequeathed to her the whole of her son-in-law's property. Under this paper, accordingly Mrs. Robinson claimed Mr. Robinson's property, but the will was deposited in Doctor's Commons, by the testator's relations. On hearing these circumstances, I thought the paper which I had written, under his direction, might be important, and therefore I sought for it but was unable for some time to find it, at last, in the month of September following, I happened to discover it among some loose papers, and I immediately gave it over to Mrs. Robinson. Until that suit was instituted, I never conceived that this little slip of paper would in law amount to a will. Gentlemen, in that suit I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050034"></xptr>called upon to make a deposition, which I did, stating the same circumstances as I have now stated to you; and although that is all I have had to do with the business, I am now called upon to answer, at the hazard of my life, the charge of wilfully having forged that will.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I would ask you, what motive I had to be guilty of such a crime? I got no legacy, nor a farthing benefit under the will. There was nothing improper in the conduct of the testator, in leaving this property to his step-mother in preference to his uncle or aunts; for although he was not the actual son of Mrs. Robinson, yet she was married to his father when he was about a year old; and from that time, until the hour of his death, with the exception of a short absence at Shields, he had continued to live with her. She had, throughout his infancy and youth, been an affectionate mother to him, as he frequently acknowledged, and he, apparently, had all the affection of a son towards his mother; insomuch, that it was not till after I was intimate with him for several years, that I learned she was only his step-mother; and indeed, from their conduct to each other, I had, until then, always supposed her to be his natural parent. The paper which was found, altogether in his hand-writing, will sufficiently prove his affection for her. Of his uncle, Thomas, he had often said, he would waste whatever he had; and with respect to his uncle, Richard, it was not at all unnatural that he should overlook him entirely. In truth, he had known nothing of that uncle, who had been long absent at Botany Bay, to which place he had been transported for a felony, which he had committed many years before, when his nephew was not more than a year or two old. This uncle, and his attorney, Mr. Rushworth, and other persons, disappointed of expected legacies, are my prosecutors. I can believe the uncle may be disappointed at the loss of his nephew's property, but it is awful revenge to seek the destruction of my life and character, because I was the unfortunate hand to write down his nephew's last wishes.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will bear in mind that this is not the first time the validity of this paper has been questioned. After a long suit in the Ecclesiastical Court, where all the evidence which my now prosecutors could bring forward to impeach the paper, and shew it to be a forgery, might have been legally heard, and deliberately considered, that Court decreed the paper to be a genuine instrument, and established it as a legal will. Nor did it rest there. Early in the present year, the prosecutors applied to the Ecclesiastical Court, to re-hear the case, but after hearing all the allegations which could be further adduced, the Learned Judge refused the application, and confirmed the former sentence, thereby establishing the genuineness of the instrument.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, after an ample investigation of this matter, before a Court of competent jurisdiction; I should have thought my prosecutors would have been satisfied of my innocence of the crime which they now allege against me, but you may judge from their subsequent harassing conduct towards me, whether they are actuated by motives of justice, or of revenge, for disappointed expectations. Five years after the will had been established, by the Decree of the Ecclesiastical Court, which was in the year 1816, they preferred an indictment for perjury against me and Mr. Stephenson, at the York Assizes, against me for making the deposition of the facts, under which I wrote the paper, and against Mr. Stephenson for deposing that he believed the signature to be the testator's hand-writing - as these indictments were prefered in my own country, where all the parties were known, myself, the prosecutors, and the witnesses, I readily and cheerfully prepared to meet the charge, but the first delay the prosecutor interposed, was the removing the indictment by certiorari, which delayed the trial for the late then assizes - In dus course, however, they stood for trial at the last York Assizes, in August, and again we were ready to meet the charge, but on the evening before the day of trial, the prosecutors withdrew the records - in the mean time they came to London, and at the last September Session, they presented a bill for forgery against me, before the London Grand Jury, but this bill was thrown out - again in the last October Session, they presented another bill, which is the one I now stand here to answer.</p>
               <p>Thus, Gentlemen, I have detailed all the instances of this case, and I earnestly but humbly intreat you to give them your attentive consideration. Consider the disadvantages I am placed under; called upon to answer so heavy an accusation, at a distance from the place where the fact is alleged to have been committed, and before a Jury to whom my former life and character are unknown. Consider too, that my prosecutors have evaded bringing the matter to trial before a Jury of that county, where both they and I are known. Consider also, Gentlemen, that the whole business has been already fully canvassed before a Court of competent jurisdiction, who have patiently heard all that could be adduced against the paper, and that having established it by their decree, they have thereby virtually pronounced that I am Not Guilty of the charge imputed to me by this indictment. But above all, Gentlemen, I pray you to remember the time at which I am called upon to answer for this supposed offence; It is now near seven years since the date of that transaction - in the course of that time, death has removed from my aid three persons who would have been material witnesses for me on this day - Mrs. Robinson, the mother of the testator, Mrs. Stephenson, and Miss 
               <persName id="t18211205-45-person561">
                  Jane

            , the two latter were witnesses in the suit, in the Ecclesiastical Court, and spoke to material facts respecting the testator's intercourse with his mother. With regard to Mrs. Robinson, as it is clear I took nothing by the will - it is insinuated I must have had some bribe from her, she rests now in the silence of the grave - death has sealed her lips, and she cannot now give testimony in my favour to prove the falseness of that accusation so long as she lived; no charge whatever was made against me.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, these are the circumstances under which I stand before you, and although I am greatly weighed down, and depressed by the magnitude of the accusation, knowing that both my life and character depended upon the issue of your verdict - yet I do not despair, I have voluntarily surrendered myself to take my trial, I know and feel my own innocence, and I have the firmest reliance on your justice. But above all, knowing that there is a God who judgeth the world in righteousness, I cannot believe he will desert me in my old age, and deliver me a victim to the malice of my disappointed enemies.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you a knowledge of his writing after 1805 - A. No; I had no conversation with him after that; I have very often seen him sign papers.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Hull, and was in the habit of attending Mr. Robinson, professionally, for eight or ten years preceding his death. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, and the son Thomas, who died in May, 1815, his mother lived with him at that time, I attended him for the last fortnight before his death, at least, twice every day; I can undertake to say I called regularly twice every day for a fortnight, his disorder took an alarming turn about the 26th or 27th of April, I believe he went out on the 26th. On Monday, the 1st of May, he became delirious in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. On the preceding day, (Sunday,) did you call - A. Yes, twice, once before twelve o'clock, and then in the evening. I do not recollect who let me in, for I frequently opened the street door and walked in. I had intimated to him, during his illness, that it was always right to have his affairs settled, this was a few days before the 1st of May, he said he should do so, but never mentioned the nature of the distribution. I have frequently seen him write, and can form an opinion of the general character of his writing. I believe the signature to script B. to be his.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you remember being there on Sunday the 30th of April - A. Yes, twice, before twelve o'clock, and between seven and nine o'clock. I have seen the prisoner at the house during his illness. I was examined at Doctors' Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear in you deposition that you had no recollection of having seen Saxelbye at Mr. Robinson's during his illness - A. If I did, I believed it to be correct at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, do you know whether it is Mr. Robinson's writing - A. I think it like it, I think it resembles the signature to B. I am not accustomed to examine minutely, there is a little difference in some of the letters, but such a difference as I have frequently made in writing my own name.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your wife derives property under the will of Mrs. Robinson - A.

She administered to Mrs. Robinson's will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know they lived on very bad terms - A. No, I frequented them much during the latter part of his life, I might go there two or three times a-day. I lived within a few yards of the house.</p>

When he was himself, very comfortably, but when he had too much wine they at times quarrelled; she quarrelled with him because he was in that state. She used to fret, and say "Thomas it will ruin you." Mrs. Robinson paid the house-keeping, I have repeatedly heard her say he owed her three years board, and say "Thomas you pay every body but me," and he said, "Well, mother, I shall give you what I have." He had been very poorly for six months.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What relation were you to Mrs. Robinson - A. None. I had a legacy of 20 l. which I have received. They dined at one o'clock on Sundays, and took tea at five o'clock. I think on that Sunday it was a few minutes past five o'clock, as the servant was late. I washed the celery and took it into the room between four and five o'clock, Mr. Robinson eat it then, just as it was, I cannot say how many heads there was, it was a large plate. Mr. Young came about half-past eight o'clock, I think Bayley opened the door to him; when he came in, I went up stairs. I do not remember whether there was any wine on the table when I went in. Nobody drank tea there besides him and me. I went there every night all the week, Mr. Robinson was poorly then, he did not go out, that I know, but I was not there all day. I never missed being there on Sundays.</p>

               <p>MR. SERGEANT HULLOCK. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at Mr. Robinson's - A. Frequently; I have seen him there at tea at different times. I have seen him and Mr. Robinson together talking about business. I saw him there with two little boys about a month before Mr. Robinson died.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was that the last time you saw him there before Mr. Robinson died - A. No; I saw him there after that, both on Sundays and week-days, I frequently saw him call on Sundays as he went to church, and sometimes he has stopped the afternoon there.</p>

            . I was sister to the late Mrs. Robinson. I knew that from Mr. Robinson's infancy he generally lived with her, except three or four months, when he was at Shields. I was very frequently at the house, they lived on terms of friendship, except when he got a little wine. He was ill some time before his death. I have been in the habit of receiving letters and notes from him (Looks at scripts A. and B.) I believe them to be his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you residuary legatee to Mrs. Robinson - A. Yes; she left her property to all her relations.</p>

             being taken delirious on the Monday night. On Sunday, the 30th of April, I was at his house, I got there about one o'clock, and went to dine there, only him and his mother were there, I remained there till three o'clock; after dinner Mr. Stevenson came, and staid about half an hour. Mr. Robinson was regretting that he had not a head of celery at dinner, and Mr. Stevenson sent some, I understand, but I was not there when it came. Before I went away, (about three o'clock,) Mr. Saxelbye came, I let him in, I saw him through the window, and opened the door to him; he went into the parlour where Mr. Robinson was, I left the house a few minutes after, leaving them together. I did not see Mr. Lockwood there. Mr. Robinson was in the front parlour all the time I was there. I have often seen him write (Looks at scripts A. and B.) these signatures are his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long were you there before dinner - A. They sent to me to say dinner was on the table. I am sure Mr. Lockwood was not there on Sunday, the 30th of April, and did not dine there. Bailey assisted at dinner, it was over about two o'clock, and I left about three o'clock. Saxelbye came before I went.</p>

            . I am clerk in the Custom-house of Hull. I was acquainted with Mr. Robinson, and on the 30th of April, 1815, I went to his house about half-past one, or a quarter before two o'clock, and found him in the front sitting-room with his mother and Miss Hewson. I staid till half-past two o'clock, and did not see Mr. Lockwood there during that time. Something was said about celery, I went home to prepare some and sent it him. I knew him very well, and have often seen him write, I believe the signature to scripts A. and B. to be his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is that the way he usually signed, or did he sign differently - Q. I have seen him sign different ways, the scroll of the T is different from this - I have often seen him write like this.</p>

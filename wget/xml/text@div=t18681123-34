                  </hi>. I live with my step-father, a tobacconist, at 392, Caledonian Road—on 28th October I served Johnson with half an ounce of tobacco—he gave me a shilling—I gave it to my step-father, and said in Johnson's presence, "I think this is a bad shilling."</p>

I am step-father to the last witness—I followed her into the shop, as Johnson appeared to be drunk—she gave me the shilling—I bent it up and said to Johnson, "This is a bad shilling"—he said, "Is it? I had it from my employers on the North London Railway this morning; if you will return it, I will take it back"—I said, "Have you no more money about you?"—he said, "Yes, but I do not require the tobacco"—I gave him the shilling, took back the tobacco, and he left the shop—I went to the door, saw a constable, and gave him directions, and shortly afterwards the two prisoners were brought back by two constables.</p>

               <p>Jer. Neal. I live in Ratcliff-highway. I lost the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) on the 19th of December. I found one of my shirts on the prisoner's back, the evening Mr. Wyn stopped him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wyn. I keep a sale-shop. The prisoner came to my shop, and told me, he was an unfortunate man that had lost his ship in Yarmouth-roads. He appeared in a creditable manner. He brought this cardinal, and asked me a guinea for it. I said, You never bought it, or you would know better what to ask for it. He said, his wife bought it, and she was dead. I gave him seven shillings for it. Two or three days after, Mrs. Neal came to my house and described it. I shewed it her, and she swore to it. I said, if the man comes again, I will stop him. The prisoner came again, and I stopped him, and before the justice the prosecutor owned the shirt he had on; and the justice ordered him to take it off.</p>

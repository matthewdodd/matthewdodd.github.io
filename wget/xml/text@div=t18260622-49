            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. - On Saturday, the 27th of May, I went, in company with Edwards and Kerby, to a house in James-street, Golden-lane, in the parish of St. Luke, Old-street, at a quarter before eleven o'clock at night - I found the street door open - I and Edwards went up to the third floor, leaving Kerby below; there is only one room on a floor - we found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220027"></xptr>door on the latch, and opened it; there was a fire in the room: the prisoner was standing by the fire, with his coat off, and his shirt sleeves tucked up; we entered the room- I took him into custody, searched him, and found ten bad shillings in his waistcoat pocket, and 2s. 6d. good money in his other waistcoat pocket; four of the bad shillings were more fit for circulation than the other six; they had been rubbed down, and four of them have been heated with a hot iron; Kerby came up stairs. The prisoner said, "You have no occasion to take any further trouble - there are some on the bed - Kerby went and lifted up the bed-clothes, and took something like shillings out- the prisoner said there were some in a hole by the side of the bed, and Edwards found something there; there was a jug on the mantel-piece, with a liquid in it and two shillings - this piece of bent iron was in the fire, red hot(producing it.) I produce the base coin found on his person; his hands were very dirty, but the tips of his fingers were very clean.</p>

            . I went up with Limbrick to this room, leaving Kerby below, to watch; on entering the room I saw the prisoner standing by the fire, without his coat, and his shirt sleeves tucked up; we handcuffed him; by the side of the bed was a small candle stuck on a chair, not burning, but it appeared to have been recently lighted, and two powders, which contain different ingredients - I have tried one of them on a half-penny - it colours it completely like silver; on a nail by the side of the window hung a bottle of aquafortis; the prisoner said, "What you want there is some more of in a hole in the wall by the bed;" I pulled the bedstead aside, and found in a small hole three bad shillings, in the state they come from the die, and four sixpences, each in separate paper, ready for circulation. Kerby found some shillings in the bed; I found a piece of sand paper by the bed - it appeared to have been used; it is used to rub down the coin. A piece of red hot iron was in the fire.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. - I accompanied the witnesses to the door of this house; when they got up they gave me a signal; I went up - there was a light on the mantel-piece, standing against a jug; the prisoner told us to look on the bed for what we wanted; I turned down the clothes, and under the blanket found nine counterfeit shillings loose; they appeared to be fit for circulation; they have been polished and rubbed down, and blacked over; he told us to look into a hole at the head of the bed, and we should find some - Edwards went there, and took something out; I found in the jug on the mantel-piece two shillings in water; I produce them. Nobody but the prisoner was in the room.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin. The two shillings found in the jug are both counterfeit - they are milled, and struck with a die, and have been rubbed down with sand or glass paper, to take off the sharp edge of the die, and make them look as if they had been in circulation; they appear to have been silvered or coloured, not cased; those nine found in the bed are counterfeit, and appear to have been struck from the same die as the two; they have been rubbed down, coloured or silvered, greased and blacked, to appear as if they had been in circulation; candle grease will do that, but sometimes they use the marrow of an animal, then rub them with lamp-black or the snuff of a candle. The ten produced by Limbrick are all counterfeit - six of them have been rubbed down or prepared, but not coloured, and the other four have been rubbed down or silvered, but not greased - they are also of the same die. The four sixpences are counterfeit - they are rubbed, and completely prepared for circulation; here are three counterfeit shillings in the state in which they came from the original coiner, from the die; one powder will produce the colour of silver on copper or brass - the other is cream of tartar, which is used as a light acid wash afterwards, to give them a new appearance - the liquid is water with a slight portion of cream of tartar, and a small portion of the silver powder, which has come from the coin when washed in it; the shillings are all from one die, and the sixpences from one. In order to make them ring like silver they at times lay them on hot iron, which hardens the metal.</p>

            . I am a moneyer of the Mint. These nine shillings are counterfeit, and fit for circulation - four more are counterfeit, but not coloured; the four sixpences are counterfeit, and coloured ready for circulation; the two shillings in the jug are counterfeit, and all appear to be from the same die.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The room belonged to me and another man named Budgeon, who is now in prison by the name of King; I came home about nine o'clock, and about ten he came in, and was doing something over - he blew the candle out, and went out, saying he would come in at half-past ten, and about ten Edwards came in; I said, "All the things you want are on the bed;" I had nothing in my pocket but 2s. 6d. in good money, nor did the bad money belong to me. Limbrick knows Budgeon has been at Hatton-garden for passing had money.</p>

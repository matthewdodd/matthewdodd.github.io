                  </hi>. I live at 81, Ground-street, Surrey, and am an iron tube manufacturer—I became acquainted with the prisoner in the early part of August, this year—in that month I had several interviews with him, to receive from him such information as he could collect, relative to a man of the name of Maher, who had swindled me (see page 832)—I went to the prisoner about it—in several interviews that I had with him, he constantly drew my attention to a pattern of a machine for splint cutting, and making pegs for the Admiralty—he said that it was a patent machine which gave him considerable advantages over anything of the kind, by which he could realize considerable profits, but that he wanted a little pecuniary aid to carry on his contracts—he said he had contracts with Bell and Black, in Bow-lane, City, and with the Admiralty, for the supply of pegs—he said that the patent was his, and that it was his invention, and that he had had an offer of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and could have disposed of it for that, but he preferred to keep it, as it got him considerable profit, and it was then his—he has had 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me on different occasions—I advanced the sum of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about the 9th of September—that was wanted oppressively for a bill at his bankers—it was in consequence of the representations he made to me about his contracts that I let him have the money.</p>

COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you anything else besides an iron tube manufacturer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is all I profess to be—that is what I am—I have never, for twenty years, been anything else—I was then carrying on business as a merchant in London—I never had anything to do with a Life Office—I did not know anything about the Rosemary Branch, until I went there to get information about John Maher—I know there is a society called the British Mutual Loan Society—I have a life insurance there—I have nothing to do with the Board there—I never suggested to the defendant to insure his life there for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I once suggested to him to borrow money there—I said, if he could satisfy me that I should run no risk I would have no objection to be one of his sureties—there were some collateral securities for money, advanced afterwards—he signed three bills, two of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has had 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of that—I do not hold bills for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were put into the hands of a Mr. Sullivan, a tradesman who advanced the money, not a lender of money—I did not lend the money—it was only advanced on my responsibility—he said that the service he had promised to render me in finding Maher was deserving of some remuneration, and he should feel obliged for such assistance as I could render him in his business—it was partly for his business that I lent him the 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his bills for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>the hands of Mr. Sullivan—the prisoner was to have further advances—he was to have the money in the space of two years—the bills were merely collateral securities in order that I might be quite safe—the direct security for the money was the transfer of his property—he has signed over to me his patent, his machinery, and everything—he had 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. includes the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I lent—it was all abandoned about his getting his money at that office—I had no occasion to try whether they would take me as a security—I am an agent for iron tube manufacturing—I sued the defendant for 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in the Lord Mayor's Court—the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which I have now indicted him was included in that; but there was a fur<lb></lb>ther sum advanced without my knowledge, making it more—the action is pending now in the Lord Mayor's Court for this 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the daughter of the prosecutor. On Wednesday last was three weeks the prisoner came into our shop and enquired for some stockings; she did not buy, but went out again. I missed a 'pair of stockings; Harding, the apprentice, was sent after her.</p>
               <p>- HARDING sworn.</p>
               <p>I went after the prisoner; I found her at some distance from the shop; she was sitting down, and pretended to have the stomach-ache. I made her get up, and behind her I found a pair of woman's stockings; as I was bringing her up the lane, a pair of white linen gloves dropped from her; after that another pair dropped from her; one of the pair of gloves has Mr. Lingham's marks upon them; I cannot swear to the other, nor to the stockings. I had the day before put fifteen pair of black stockings upon the counter, when we came to tell them there were only<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210012"></xptr> fourteen pair; it was impossible to miss the gloves, there were so many pair there.</p>

               <p>I had been to Westminster; coming along I found a black stocking, and these gloves were pushed into it; I did not know what it was, but I pushed all the heap in together; I picked them up, and sat down on the first step I came to; I dare say the young man knows I sat down looking at them, and had nine cock's heads in my apron; the things were in my lap; I do not know that I was in the shop; I do not know where the gentleman lives.

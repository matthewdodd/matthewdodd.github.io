                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer and cabinet-maker, in partner<lb></lb>ship with my brother. The prisoner came into our employment about two years and three—quarters ago—he came under a written agreement, so as we should understand the nature of the terms—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's writing—this is the letter that we were to make a copy of and send him before he took the situation—he was taken on the terms of that letter.</p>

               <p>handed to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made a copy of it from this letter, and sent it to him—I cannot exactly say whether this is a copy or the original, but I believe it to be a copy of what I sent—before the prisoner came, he said it would be necessary to have some understanding, and said, "I will write you a letter, and you write me a copy of it"—this is the letter he sent to us—I did not, to my knowledge, after the letter was sent to us, execute any agreement—all that I did was to make a copy of this letter and send it to the prisoner—that letter was signed by myself (<hi rend="italic">the letter produced was stated not to be</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this letter being received as any evidence as to the term of the prisoner's engagement; it was nothing more than a draft of an agreement, or, if it was, its not being stamped would render it inadmissible. The letter written by the prosecutor was in the prisoners possession, and no notice had been given him to produce it.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">proposed to use it as an offer made by the prisoner, and would prove by parol that he was taken</hi> on <hi rend="italic">those terms.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">My present impression is, that if it is necessary in the course of the case to prove the exact terms, this document is not admissible; but, being in the prisoner's writing, it may be read as a step towards establishing the relation of master and servant.</hi>)</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—"21, Lower Belgrave-street, Belgrave-square, Jan., 1847, Sir,—We agree to engage you to take the entire management of the auction, estate, and house-agency valuation, distraint, &amp;c., transacted at our office, and agree, in consideration of your doing so, to allow you one-third of the amount of all the business so transacted by you or through your introduction; and also a weekly sum of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in addition thereto: and also to advance the money required for expenses, attendance, and so on in the transacting of such business as aforesaid. We also agree to allow you five per cent. on any upholstery, funerals, decoration, &amp;c., introduced or obtained by you, when-ever it shall amount to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or upwards—your engagement is to commence on the day of February next, and in the event of either party requiring to give notice, two clear months' notice is to be given."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> say you received that about two years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years and three-quarters—I received it about the time I received this letter—I had some conversation with him as to the business he was to be employed in—he was to undertake the management of the agency business—that was at the time of his coming to us, I think before the writing of this letter—I do not know whether I saw him on the subject after I sent him the letter—my brother, who is here, saw him first, and frequently afterwards, and he advised me to accede—in the course of our business we let houses for gentlemen, and the prisoner was in the habit of collecting the rents for them—my brother used to collect them occasionally—on the evening of 25th Aug. Mr. Liddell called on me—in consequence of what he said, I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner," Have you seen Mr. Liddell?"—he said he had, and he gave him Mrs. Burgoyne's check for the rent that morning—Mrs. Burgoyne had been occupying Mr. Liddell's house, but had left it—I do not know the date, but I believe it was some time in Aug.—I afterwards saw Mr. Liddell, and after that saw the prisoner again, told him I had seen Mr. Liddell, and what he had said to me was false, for he had never received the check at all—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170070"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner then burst into tears—I do not know what excuse he made exactly but he said he would go up-stairs and explain the matter to us, but he did not—if he received 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, on account of the house, of Mr. Harris, he has not paid either of them over to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you recollect the case of a person who got into a tenement of yours by some false representations, and ran away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect—we had a clerk, named Reader—I do not recollect hearing my brother say to the prisoner, with reference to such a transaction, "This is a bad job of Trutch's; we shall lose 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it, and that will knock down your share"—I do not recollect saying anything to the prisoner about Trutch's running away—I swear I did not say," This is a bad job of Trutch's; we shall lose 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it, and you will lose your share"—I do not recollect it, but I will not swear it did not pass—I do not recollect the prisoner saying, in reply," Never mind; the sharpest people are deceived sometimes, and we shall soon recover the loss by other jobs"—I will not swear it did not pass—the prisoner was to have one-third of the money made by the business, and the firm the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you net, before the division into thirds, deduct any losses that occurred in the course of the transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have never deducted any<lb></lb>thing yet—it has never been settled up—we did not deduct his share of the loss of Trutch's business, we never settled—we have not arranged it in any way—I do not know that the prisoner was to lose his share of it, nor do I know that he was not—we used to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, to draw on account—that was on account of his third—I do not know that he received any salary but that—all he has received has been on account of his third—I have not represented him as Mr. Mares—if a gentleman came and asked for Mr. Mares I asked the nature of his business, and if he came concerning a house, I have shown him to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I have great difficulty now in saying that you must not show the exact terms of the agreement. It is impassible to say that the relation of master and servant is clearly shown; it is left in ambiguity, and therefore it is necessary to prove the exact terms which bound the parties.</hi>)</p>

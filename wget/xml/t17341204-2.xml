               <p>Matthew Hebert, the younger. Last Tuesday, Mr. Stonehall (who lives with my Father) told me that he mist a Guinea, and a Moidore out of his Till. He had mist Mony before. We had some suspicion of the Prisoner, and therefore, to try him, Mr. Stonehall put some more Money in the Till on Thursday Morning, and then went up to Breakfast, and when he came down again he mist 3 Guineas, upon which he charged the Prisoner with taking them: The Prisoner confest the Fact, and returned the Money. We had a good Character of him when he first came to live in our Family.</p>
               <p>William Stonehall confirmed the former Evidence, and added, that the Prisoner had hid the 3 Guineas in his Stocking, from whence he took them out and returned them.</p>

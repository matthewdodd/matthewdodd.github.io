                  </hi>. I am a wholesale slop-seller, and live in the Mino<lb></lb>ries—the prisoner was in my employ. On the 29th of October, I had reason to suspect I was robbed, and yesterday morning, at about half-past seven o'clock, I was called down—when I came into the shop, I found the prisoner, his sister, and a policeman, and my foreman all together—my foreman said, "This is the way we have been robbed, Sir," and I imme<lb></lb>diately gave the prisoner in charge—I had suspected him for the last month—until then I could give him the best of characters—he lived six years and a half with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutor—the prisoner was the porter. I watched him in consequence of suspicion, and stationed my<lb></lb>self at the end of a court in the Minories about fifty yards from the house—I saw him go to the house in the morning, and ring the bell, then go in, and open the shop, and shortly after, I saw his sister come out of the shop with a bundle—I pursued, and took her with the bundle containing the articles named in the indictment—I took her into a public-house—sent for an officer, and took her into the shop—I have every reason to believe the prisoner was in the shop, when his sister came out—I had not seen him come out—I had seen him in the shop a minute before—I took the sister twenty or thirty yards off—the bundle contained the property of my master and had his mark on them—they were kept in the shop where the sister came from—no other person would be in the shop besides the prisoner—minutes before seven o'clock, and had been taking the shutters down—I could not see into the shop—I had a view of the door, and saw the sister come out of the door of the shop—when I returned the prisoner was just outside, cleaning the window—the sister was in the habit of calling on him every morning, I believe, and she occasionally brought his breakfast—she is about eleven years old.</p>

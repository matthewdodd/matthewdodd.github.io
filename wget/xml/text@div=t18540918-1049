                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hughes; we live at Barking; we keep a beer shop. Jackson was in my employ in June and July—I did not know the other prisoner, only she used to come there to see Jackson—Jackson was in our service two months—she left me a fortnight before I missed the things, which was on the Monday before 19th Aug.—she had left at the beginning of Aug.—I missed a plaid dress, and part of my chintz bed furniture—I afterwards saw Quarterman at a neighbour's house, and she had my dress on—Jackson was outside the door at the same neighbour's house—I told Jackson I had lost a plaid dress, and part of my bed furniture—I asked if she had seen it—she said she knew nothing of it—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to a policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jackson. Q.</hi> Did you not take part of the shilling that I got for pawning your dress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of it; I paid you no wages, as I took you out of charity—you said you would be satisfied with board and lodging, because the father of your child allowed you half a crown a week—I did not allow you to bring men into the house, and take money of them—my Husband has a licence for lodgings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jackson.</hi> Quarterman has lodged in the house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She has lodged in the house, but I was not aware what was going on—you first came and asked if I would let you have a bed, and afterwards you said you would do my work—you had this child when you came—Quarterman came after<lb></lb>wards, but I do not know anything of her—Rose Elmore lodged there—she came with the girl Quarterman, but I know nothing of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did Elmore lodge there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A few nights; I cannot say how long—Quarterman paid me for her lodging for a few nights; I cannot say how many—it might be a week—she did not lodge a month—Jackson lodged but a very few nights before she was my servant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jackson.</hi> There was a man lodging in the house? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had a fisher-man</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Quarterman.</hi> I was lodging in the house six weeks, and she kept two rooms for the reception of men and girls, and she received part of the money they paid. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; I did not; I only received 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night from you, for your own bed—I am not receiving money from a young man who lodged with you at my house—I do not know a person named Ray.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever received money from Ray? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; nor from a person named William.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, K</hi> 12). On Saturday, 19th Aug., I received information from Connell, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I went with him in search of the two prisoners—I found them coining up the street at Barking; Jackson had this dress in her arms, I took it from her and stopped her—I told her I must apprehend her for stealing that dress—she said Mrs. Hughes lent it her; I took both the prisoners to the station—I went afterwards to a house in Fisher-street, in consequence of being told that there was a piece of bed furniture there—I found a key on Jackson which fitted the house in Fisher-street—I found this piece of bed furniture lying on the bed for a quilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jackson.</hi> I told him I was going to take the dress back to Mrs. Hughes. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; she said Mrs. Hughes had lent it her—she was on the road back to Mrs. Hughes.</p>

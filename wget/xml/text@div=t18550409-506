                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Drummond, of the Jolly Gar<lb></lb>deners, at Lambeth Marsh. On 8th March, about half-past 7 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in and called for a pint of half-and-half—I drew it for him—two women came in shortly afterwards, the prisoner drank with them; they had half a quartern of gin—the prisoner then asked me to trust him till the evening for half a pint of beer and a pennyworth of gin—I said we did not do business in that way, we were not allowed to give any one credit—that is the practice of our house—the prisoner then used most disgusting language—he said, "I will break your b——y head, and I will knock your brains out; I will break your back"—I had not said or done anything to him previous to that—I have stated all I said—he then took up a pint pot and aimed at me three times; but I stepped back, and did not receive the blow—he was using similar language—he asked me again whether I would allow him credit—I said I would not—he then took up from the counter a large glass, what we term a pint glass, used for lemonade—it was a very thick glass, with a foot to it—he was going to throw it at me, but West, my fellow servant, caught hold of his arm, and took it from him—he was using similar language—he called me a b——y <hi rend="italic">snot</hi> and a vagabond—he then walked through into the wholesale depart<lb></lb>ment, and asked me again whether I intended him to have it or not—I said, "No, you shall not have it"—he said he would be d——d if he would not have it—he walked along the side of the counter through into the wholesale department; the long arm was standing there, by Mr. Drum<lb></lb>mond's writing desk—it is a tang pole, with a piece of iron at the end, used to shut the shutters with—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner caught hold of that, and struck me the blow that I have now on my temple—I do not know whether he had it in one hand or in both—I reeled, and should have fallen if I had not caught hold of the taps—blood flowed immediately from the wound, all about the floor—I bled more than an hour—I fainted after I left the bar to go into the kitchen, and was absent from the bar about an hour and a half—I heard the prisoner threaten to serve West, the same if he came to my assistance, and ten times worse—I was afterwards attended by Mr. Thompson, the surgeon.</p>

Q.</hi> When I came in about 6 o'clock in the morning, did not I come for a bundle which I had left there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you asked me for the bundle—you had some half and half, not gin and beer—I did not draw a man half a pint of ale, put a glass of gin in it, and give him a biscuit; nor did you say, "That is a cheap penny worth"—I did not say you were a d——d liar; nor did you reply, "I can believe my own eyes"—nothing of</p>

                  </hi>. I am fellow barman with Robinson.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 116, Vauxhall-walk. Robinson was brought to my surgery by Rogers, the con<lb></lb>stable, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon—he was in a very debili<lb></lb>tated state from loss of blood—he had a contused wound about an inch and a quarter, or an inch and a half, in length, on the upper part of the frontal bone—the scalp was completely divided as far as the membrane covering the bone—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by an instru<lb></lb>ment like this, either with the iron or the blunt part—it was an injury likely to be dangerous—I attended him for some time—no erysipelas followed.</p>

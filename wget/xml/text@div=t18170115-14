            . I live in Great Pulteney-street, Golden-square. On the 20th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street; I was accosted by the prisoner Myers, she took me to a house in <placeName id="t18170115-14-crimeloc70">Angel-alley</placeName>

I had my watch and seals about my person-it was a stop-watch. We were in the lower part of the house; the light was brought in about a minute; I then did not like the place I was in, and the prisoners were importunate for money; I gave them 1s. 6d. and left the house directly, my watch was then safe; the two prisoners came out with me, and had hold of my arms; as soon as I got into Bishopsgate-street, I felt a hand seize my watch, and the two prisoners left me immediately. I gave the alarm, went back to the house, and offered a reward for the apprehension of the prisoners. Myers was taken on the 8th of January, I knew her again; the other prisoner was taken on the 13th, and I knew her also. I am sure they are the two who took my watch.</p>

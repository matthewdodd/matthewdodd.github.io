I am a widow, and lived, when this happened, at No. 19, William-street, Regent's-park, and had a child one year and nine months old—the prisoner and I had lived together—he is not the father of the child. On the night of this transaction I left the child close to the wall in bed, asleep, in the kitchen—it was ten o'clock as near as I can say—the child had been healthy that day, and had not the least ap<lb></lb>pearance of disease—the prisoner wished me to go out to get him some beer and pickles—I said I had rather not go, and said "Don't hit the baby while I am gone "—I said so because he had ill-treated it before, during my absence—I at last went for the beer and pickles—I was gone about three minutes, and then returned to the room—my attention was attracted by the baby groaning dreadfully—I asked him, "What have you done to the poor baby?"—he said, "I have done nothing "—I ran to the bed, and took the child up—it appeared to be dying—I ran up to the lady, Mrs. Roe, in the parlour, and said, "Look at my poor baby "—I went to Mr. Barfoot, the surgeon, next door, and showed it to him—he gave me some medicine, telling me to to give it to the child every quarter of an hour—I saw the prisoner as I came out of the doctor's, and said, "Oh, you have murdered my poor baby "—I did not hear whether he said any thing, as I went quickly into my house, next door—the child lived till twenty minutes to three—it was taken to the hospital by the advice of Mr. Barfoot, and died rwo hours afterwards—I did not see the prisoner afterwards till he was in custody on the Sunday—I cannot say whether he remained at home that night, as I was at the hospital with the child—he was there the next morn<lb></lb>ing—when I saw him at the station, I caught hold of him and said, "Oh, you murderer"—he said nothing to that—they took me from him—he said nothing to me as to how it happened—I had no conversation with him.</p>

I have been with this woman for the last five months, and we have been living together as man and wife. We had the bans put up at Trinity-church, in May or June; and when the bans were up last, I wished her to go to church and have it settled, to be married. She said we had better wait two or three weeks longer. We went and took a front-kitchen in Little Brook-street, and were there two months. We went to another place, up higher in Little Brook-street, and there I left her. She</p>

I wished her to go with me, and we took this place in William-street, and were together ever since, except two or three days I was away, in consequence of having a few words. Last Friday and Saturday I had no work. On Saturday Mr. Linfield treated us to some gin and beer, and I took some wood home when I went to tea, and cleaned ray boots, and put on a clean shirt, and went out to Mr. Linfield's again, to get my money, and stopped late, and had some beer and gin. I took some supper home, and asked Mrs. Easted if she would go and get some beer; and while the beef was frying I went to the cupboard to get some onions, and fell on the child. I have no more to say at present."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 18, Wil-liam-street, Regent's Park. The child was brought to me on the night in question—I examined it—it had evidently received some external vio<lb></lb>lence, and had tumefaction on the right side of the bead, just above the right ear, going all along, and extending to the middle of the back part of the head—it was a welling—I could not find whether there was a frac<lb></lb>ture, as it felt completely pulpy—I could not then judge whether it was from one act of violence or not—I recommended its being taken to the hospital—at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, I found the skull was fractured, and it died of that fracture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it had been in bed, and a man fell down on it in the bed, could it produce that injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not, because there was more than one fracture, and I think they were produced by more than one blow, be<lb></lb>cause there was a large depression on one spot, and a smaller about three inches from the front, which was not so deep as the other—I would not say it was impossible to be done by one blow, but it is not probable—any blunt instrument might produce the injury, supposing it was not very broad—I do not think the instrument could have been very little more than an inch in breadth—(<hi rend="italic">Thomas Kendall here produced a hammer</hi>)—such an instrument as this might produce the wound I saw—the depression was not more than two inches at the broadest part, and formed more of a tri<lb></lb>angin—it is not necessary that the hammer should be triangular to make a triangular depression of the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it had been hit perfectly flat the probability is, it would make a circular mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—that is not at all necessary—it might be circular or triangular, as far as the instrument is concerned, only it could not be made by an instrument much larger than this—it was such a wound as would probably be inflicted by this instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any separation of the skin at all exter-nally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was a great swelling—if done with the hammer, the swelling would not be nearer the size of the hammer, as it would con<lb></lb>tinue to swell as long as there was blood under the skin—it depends on the size of the blood-vessels ruptured by the blow—it would swell as long as the blood poured out—the mother brought the child to me as soon as she found it out—I do not swear it is impossible a fall on the child would pro-duce these injuries, but it is improbable, and it would depend on the height. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the part that fell on the child's head was covered with clothes, would not that be more likely to produce the appearance you saw more than a hammer—if it was a hard substance covered with the man's</p>

               <p>clothes, for instance, a man's elbow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not be more likely—it would not account for the second depression—if the man fell from any considerable height it might cause one depression—it must be a consi<lb></lb>derable height to cause the fracture.</p>

I am a surgeon of University College Hospital—I re<lb></lb>member the child being brought there on Saturday night—I saw it as soon as I was called down—I found it insensible—I noticed a small mark on the right ear, and a small mark on the right side of the head—those marks alone were not sufficient to draw my particular attention—it expired in two hours—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, by order of the coroner, and found a large quantity of blood under the skin, nearly over the whole of the head, particularly on the right side, and a fracture—there were two fractures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment could those two fractures be caused by one blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend on the instrument employed—I conceive if it had been an instrument which bad two points of contact at the same time, it might—if it was an instrument striking two parts of the skull at one time, it might make two fractures, but an instrument with one face would make but one at a time—I think it probable such a fracture might be produced by a common hammer—they were such fractures as were likely to be pro<lb></lb>duced by this hammer—I cannot say they were so, but such a weapon was likely to produce them—the face of it, or it might have been the side—it was certainly not the claws—I have not the least doubt the wounds caused the child's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did the largest fracture commence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290060"></xptr>
               <p>At the forehead, and extended horizontally backwards to the back of the head, across the whole of the parietal bone to the middle of the occipital bone behind—there was another fracture from about the centre of this, upwards towards the top of the head—there was a very considerable de<lb></lb>pression of the bone there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the third line of the triangle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a mere ima<lb></lb>ginary line—the base of the triangle was in front—the fractures were not at right angles—it did not go in a direct line upward, but slanting—I merely express an opinion as to the probability of the particular instru<lb></lb>ment doing it—I will not say other things might not produce it as well as a hammer—the bones of children of that age are not more brittle than elder persons—they are softer, and yield easier to pressure—I think it would require greater force to cause a fracture with a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But not with a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not make much difference—the kind of fracture would differ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose force was applied to a part of the head, might it not produce a double fracture, one part going horizontally, and the other upwards, by the same blow, might not the fracture take two different ways? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but you do not understand what I mean by two fractures—there was another fracture, separate from this, and depressed—there were not three fractures—the other was behind—not a third fracture—by lines, we do not mean fractures—the two lines were one fracture—there was another behind, in the back portion of the same bone, the parietal bone, near the lower part of the head—I think it very improbable all this could be produced by one act of force applied to the head—I will not swear it could not be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CURWOOD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the child was in bed, and a man fell over it in getting into bed, was that likely to produce the injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it likely, nor probable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a drunken man went to bed in his clothes, and two buttons to be near one another, and the man fell on the child with that part, do you think these depressions would be accounted for by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not think the force could be sufficient to depress the bone to the extent it was—the force must be very great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might not a drunken man fall with great force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends entirely on what part of his body struck the child—I do not think it pos<lb></lb>sible that the force of a falling man would be sufficient to cause the injury, even if the buttons came against the child—here are two brad-awls found on the prisoner, produced by the policeman—I do not think these could have produced it, if in his pocket.</p>

When I left, I desired him not to ill-use the child, because he had ill-treated it before, when I have been out of the way, as there have been marks on it when I have come home, and I men<lb></lb>tioned it to him; and he said once he fell down in the street with it—he slapped it once in the face with his hand, when I had it in my arms—he never liked the child—he used to call it names—he said one night, "Take the little b—g—r out of bed"—that was not a great while before—I do not think it was after his last return.</p>

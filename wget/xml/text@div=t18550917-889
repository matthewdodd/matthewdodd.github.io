On 8th Aug., I was on duty at the Bank of England, and was called to the chief cashier's office, where I found a man named Bernstein—this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note produced, was shown to me; there is paper pasted all over the back of it—I asked Bernstein some ques<lb></lb>tions, and from his answers I went with him to No. 99, Shoreditch, to a public house, kept by Foley, who was not at home, but we waited about an hour, till he returned—on his return, I asked Bernstein, in Foley's presence, if that was the person of whom he had received the note, and he said that it was—Foley said that he had given him the note—I went inside the house, and asked him of whom he got it; he said he had not given anything for it, but he had gone out to get change for two men who came to the bar, and had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin—I asked him if he knew them—he said that he knew one of them, whose name was Webb, but he could not tell where he lived—I had previously told him that when I came I had seen two men who I knew to be thieves, and skittle sharpers at his bar—one of them was Woodhouse, but I only knew the other by sight—after some consultation with his wife, he said that they were the two men of whom he had the note—I told him I should hold him responsible, and took him into custody—after a short time he said, "Well, whatever happens to me, it serves me right; I have been repeatedly cautioned by the little butcher over the way, to have no dealings with these men; this is the first time I have had any"—he stated before that, that he had been waiting at the Auction Mart tavern for Bernstein, to bring him the change for the note.</p>

I said, "To Foley's public house and if you are not identified you shall not be detained"—he made no answer for some time, but then said, "You can only make a witness of me, I will be a witness if you like; we went last Wednesday week with <hi rend="italic">Tom what's his-name</hi>; I do not know his name, but <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Foley knows him for the last twenty years; we asked him whether he would buy a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; we told him it was queer; he said that he did not care a d—; we told him not to take it to the Bank or it would burn him; I do not think he took the note to the Bank himself, he sent somebody else; he said he would not be gone three quarters of an hour, and he was gone two hours and a half; the note was an old ripped up thing."</p>

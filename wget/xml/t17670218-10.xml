            . I live in Moor-lane, I am a bricklayer's labourer; last Friday the prisoner came into the building where I was at work; he said he had a good shovel to sell; we desired him to go and bring it: he said, the man that owned it was at the Three Pigeons; I told him to bring the he went for the man, and brought only the she, I seeing the mark upon it, stopped it; he above to cut the mark out; then I said, he should bring the man that owns it; he went away, and did not come again; this was last Friday; we took him about five at night in a public house in Duke's Place; we brought him before my Lord-Mayor: there he said a man offered him a pint of beer to sell the shovel for him, and he would not take less than half a crown for it; he said he did not know that man.</p>

            . I was working with Sculley when the prisoner came and offered this shovel to sell; he said he had it of a man to sell for him, and that man was at the Three Pigeons in Houndsditch; the mark of it was cut, and filled up with mud; we sent him for the man, but he came no more. We went afterwards, and found him in a public house in Duke's Place; he could give no account of the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I met a man in Houndsditch; he asked me to buy a shovel; I said I did not want one; then he asked me if I could sell it, and he would give me a pot of beer, or the money. I took it, and went to the people, and asked if they would buy a shovel; they sent me for the owner; when I came there he went away, and came no more; they after that came and took me; I went with them as quiet as a lamb</p>

            . I live at Low Layton, Essex. On the 14th of September, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Kingsland-road with my horse and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270052"></xptr>cart, coming towards town - I had to call at the Swan, in Kingsland-road at eight o'clock; I did not know the house, and turned my horse's head towards <placeName id="t18191027-75-crimeloc405">Edmonton</placeName>

I was not in there above half a minute, when I came out my horse and cart were gone - it was quite dark. The turnpike-man told me which way it was gone. I set off, and when I came to the Lamb, public-house, about a quarter of a mile off, there was a disturbance and a fight; I found my horse and cart in the crowd - my great-coat was gone out of the cart; I claimed the cart. I saw the prisoner seven days afterwards at Wansted. I have not found the coat. When I found the cart, a man said the person who drove it, had driven against a gentleman's horse, and killed it. The horse laid dead in the road.</p>

            . I am a salesman. On the 14th of September, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, I was on horseback in Kingsland-road, and saw the prisoner gallopping with the cart and gelding, about two hundred yards on this side the turnpike - I will not swear it was the prisoner. I called to the man to keep on the right side of the road. The cart ran against my horse, and ran the shafts into it. I laid hold of the horse, and wished to take the number of the cart, the man objected. I drew it to the light, the prisoner got out and said he would fetch the owner. Soon afterwards the prosecutor claimed it.</p>

             re-examined. I had left the prisoner in the cart while I went to make the inquiry. He has never returned me the coat. When I took him, I asked him why he ran away? he said he was afraid of being milled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking very hard - the prosecutor gave me a lift in his cart; he left me asleep in it. I awoke and found him gone, I turned round, drove to the Lamb, and met with this accident. I said I would fetch the master, but he was not in the public-house.</p>

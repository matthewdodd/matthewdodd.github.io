               <p>Was you walking? - Yes, with my nephew, a little boy, I was stopped by the prisoner, nobody else was with him, I was walking on towards the wall, and my nephew by the side of me, and I felt a small blow on the back part of my head, I turned short and thought it was Mr. Farmer that had run after me, to speak to me; I went to say my dear, and I saw the prisoner look me full in the face, I had a large riding cloak on, as I had just come out of the chaise, he pulled the cloak so tight that it stopped my speaking, my arms were through the holes, he then attempted to pull my bonnet, he gave me another blow, but whether I fell down with the fright as he was pulling my bonnet, or whether he knocked me down I cannot say, but he took off my bonnet, and a silver pin; he passed me and run down Mr. Haydon's yard.</p>
               <p>Did you cry out afterwards? - Not till I got up, I got as far as Mr. Lake's the tinman's, I then cried stop thief! Mr. Lake's man came out and asked me what was the matter, and I went into Mr. Lake's to compose myself a little, and as I was coming home Mr. Lake's clerk run after me, and said, Madam, we have got the man, I believe it might be about a quarter of an hour, I said to my nephew run home to your uncle, when I had got to the end of the street, the prisoner was behind me with Mr. Lake's clerk; and he said, here take your bonnet, why do not you let me alone as I go along the street; and I said, my friend, I never spoke to you, and I took the bonnet I believe from him; there was a tall man that had taken the prisoner, but whether it was him or the prisoner that I took the bonnet from I do not know, he was brought home to my house, and a constable sent for, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the time of the robbery? - I saw his face as plain as I see yours now.</p>
               <p>But if he had not afterwards come with the bonnet would you have known him? - Yes, he had a pair of trowsers, and a coat on; he was taken before Justice Staples that evening.</p>

               <p>How came you to speak to her? - I did not speak to her till I brought the prisoner back, I followed after her by the people at the tin shop telling me she was gone on; the prisoner told me it was a bonnet he had made his whore a present of, but had taken it away from her, I said, then return it to your whore again.</p>

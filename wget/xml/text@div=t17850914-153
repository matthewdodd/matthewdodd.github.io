               <p>Did you apprehend the prisoner at any time? - Yes, upon the night of the 14th, of May, between one and two in the morning of the 15th, coming along Great Queen-street, from the fields, I met the prisoner in company with three others, he was last and had an apron on, and this iron crow was tucked underneath the inside of his apron, I then told the rest of the men, to pursue the other two, and one of them was taken; then I took the prisoner by the arm, I searched him further, and I found this pistol loaded upon him: he was committed as a rogue and vagabond, we knew nothing, at least I did not, that this man had been committed before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What account did he give of having that pistol? - Would you wish me to tell you.</p>
               <p>I am instructed to ask it? - He told me that he and seven others of them, were going to break open a house in the fields.</p>

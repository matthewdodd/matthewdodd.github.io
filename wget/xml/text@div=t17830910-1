               <p>Court. Were the spurs taken from the place where they were? - Yes, they were taken from my servant's room, I went into my parlour, and there I found my beaureau open and three bank notes missing, two of twenty pounds and one of ten pounds, and there were three drawers laid on the floor, and all the papers about; I went down stairs and found the area door broke open, it had two bolts and a latch, they were forced, and then they came to the kitchen door, there was two bolts and a lock, with the key inside, and they also were forced with the iron crow, the screws were quite forced out from the wood, which crow I had the next day, and took it and fitted every particular place myself; the kitchen door was only slightly locked, which they could very easily open, then they went into my servant's room, and took three cases out of the room into the kitchen, the cases contained twenty-four table knives and forks, and twelve desert knives and twenty-four table spoons and twelve desert spoons, they also took out of the parlour, a silver caddy of tea, and a sugar bason that was plated; they locked the servant in the room.</p>
               <p>Court. It was light when you got up, I suppose? - Yes, as light as it is now, the prisoner Burton was brought back within ten minutes of the robbery.</p>

I then went down stairs, and in about ten minutes the black servant returned, he had lost sight of them, and I believe, in about ten minutes more, the tall prisoner was brought back by two men, surrounded by a number of other people.</p>
               <p>Court. What is his name? - I believe his name is Burton, there was a letter found upon him, directed to the name of Burton, which I believe the constable has, the other prisoner I did not see till the next day, I do not know how he was taken, nothing was found on the prisoner but this letter, the prisoner said, by God, if you feel further you will find a bank note, but however, he was searched and nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Out of what window did you look? - Out of the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Had they hats? - Yes.</p>

            , Esq; in Bedford-square, about the 26th of July last, my master had ordered me to get up very early to go out of town on Sunday morning; about half after four o'clock I got up to get ready, and I bethought myself I had no clean linen, so I went to my washerwoman's to get some, and by the time I came back it was half after five o'clock; as I was walking pretty fast thro' Charlotte-street, going home, I heard a noise of a door creeking, so I made a stop all of a sudden, and I still kept my eyes upon the door and I saw it wave, I knew the house and thought some of the servants were going out for a walk, and I stood and looked at the door, and presently I saw a man come and peep his head out, and seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100005"></xptr> me he drew back, with that I went about five steps on that they could not see me, presently, I saw the door open again, and a man just peep himself out, and when they did not see me he stood on the step, and then he saw me, as I was as near to him as I am to your Lordship; when they saw me, he held the door in his hand, and says he to the other that was in the house, come, come along, we can go there and be back time enough, I thought it was Mr. Symonds's servant by his saying so, so I did not take any notice, I had not the idea of any robbery; presently Mr. Utterton hallooed out of his bed-chamber Stop thief! directly the prisoner Duckston came out, and then I saw Duckston and Burton both run down Charlotte-street as hard as ever they could.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure they are the very two men? - Yes, I am sure they are, I pursued after them crying out, stop thief, while I was pursuing after them so close, Burton had the bundle under his arm, and he threw it over into one Dr. Lloyd's area, I still ran after him, I turned down Dyot-street, and they came into Bambridge-street, I pursued them into St. Giles's, and there was a great number of people standing at the top of St. Giles's, and I asked them if they saw two men running down, and they said they did, I said they were two house-breakers; as I was going down St. Giles's, running after them, I met with Mr. Utterton's labourer, and he went with me, he asked me if I should know them, I said I should, and we went down St. Giles's, we met a watchman, and he went with us, they took me to a publick-house in St. Giles's, there was a great many of them together there, I was rather dubious of going in for fear they should use me ill, I think it was the Green Man, I do not know the house, I never use any of the houses that way, I went in and made them all come out one by one, and neither of them were there, I suppose there were near forty of them there, then we had information that they went down New Compton-street, and I went with them part of the way along Compton-street in pursuit of them, and my time was almost out, so they told me they would go after them, and they went in pursuit of them by my description, and they caught Burton, and in about ten minutes Mr. Symonds sent for me to know whether I could swear to him, and when I came I could not help knowing that this was the man that I saw, I know him to be one of the men that was in Mr. Symonds's house, I am sure and positive that he is the man, I saw the prisoner the next day at the Rotation-office, Duckston is the very man that was with him, Duckston was not in the same cloaths when he was taken that I saw him in, but Burton was.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When did you get that plate again? - In about ten minutes after.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council to Byney. Did not you doubt as to Burton? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you believed, but you could not be sure? - No, I did not, I told the Justice I could swear to Burton and Duckston.</p>
               <p>You never saw them before? - No, I never saw them in my life before, I did not see Duckston afterwards till the next day.</p>
               <p>And are you sure that you did not say before the magistrate that you believed it was Burton? - I said Burton was the very man.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen: This is an indictment for a burglary; the evidence does not come near enough perhaps for that, for it was day light for a considerable time before, as much as an hour and an half, or near two hours; therefore it is possible that this fact might have been committed after day-light, if so, it is not a burglary, for in order to constitute a burglary, it must be done in the night time: but however the stealing in the dwelling house is likewise a capital crime to the amount of above forty shillings, so that in point of law it amounts to an offence of equal magnitude.</p>

               <p>Court to Doharty. Do you make it a general practice to give men a good character, that are accused of house breaking? - What did he take him out of my house for?</p>
               <p>Grubb. He had all implements of house breaking upon him; why do not you know me? - I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Doharty. Then he never was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100009"></xptr> taken out of your house? - I do not know my Lord, he might.</p>
               <p>Grubb and Macmanus. My Lord, this man come down to the office.</p>
               <p>Doharty. Was I there?</p>
               <p>Grubb and Macmanus. Yes.</p>
               <p>Doharty. What me?</p>
               <p>Court to Doharty. Was you at the office or not at that time? - No, to the best of my knowledge I was not.</p>
               <p>Was Burton taken up in your house? - I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>You never heard of it? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You must know? - If he was, I am sure I forgot.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear that he was taken up in your house, as a house breaker? - No.</p>
               <p>Grubb. My Lord, there were three men taken out of the one pair of stairs at Doharty's house, he knows me very well, and he came down to the office to speak for them.</p>
               <p>Court to Doharty. Did you go down to the office to speak for Burton on that occasion? - Really I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you or did you not? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did Burton ever lodge at your house? - He did.</p>
               <p>You never heard of his being taken up? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Take that fellow into custody for wilful and corrupt perjury.</p>
               <p>Doharty (kneeling.) My Lord, I humbly ask pardon for it.</p>

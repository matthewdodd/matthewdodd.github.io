I let him a house and bakehouse at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—there was no agreement in writing—the stand, the chimney-glass, and other things stated, were all in the house and the bakehouse—he was to use them, and if he left the house to leave them as he found them—I never sold him them, nor gave him permission to sell them—he paid me the rent up to 10th May—on 24th May I was awakened out of my bed—I went to the house and found the scale-stand, the chimney-glass, and other things gone—these are the things I missed—my initials are on some of them—this clock cost me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this stand, and scales and weights cost about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found them at Jacobs'—I paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get these back—the prisoner had left the premises entirely—he was not found for nearly a fortnight afterwards.</p>

These fowls were in a building adjoining my house - it is part of the house and enclosed by a wall outside. I went to bed at a quarter past twelve o'clock at night on the 1st of February; the house was all secure; I went into the yard, unlocked the door, and saw that the fowls were all safe at a quarter past twelve o'clock - I had locked the outer door myself - every thing was secure; I got up at six o'clock in the morning - it was just break of day - there was not light enough to distinguish a man's features - I found the door open - there is no wall round the yard - there is a communication round the house; I have a back door which opens into my house, and near that is a door leading to this building; I found the hasp of the staple of that door broken off, and two bags and a small iron bar left in the house; I missed three fowls out of twelve; I went to Newgate-market between nine and ten o'clock that morning, and there saw my fowls - one had been sold to a porter in the market, and the other two to a poulterer - they were all alive; I had reared and fed them every day, and knew their plumage - the cock had a hurt on one of his spurs - I cannot be mistaken in them; I have seen the prisoner about Turnmill-street before, and apprehended him at the Horse and Groom, public-house, there, concealed in the tap-room, with about twenty bad characters - I was afraid to go in; as soon as we went in they concealed him under their seats - sitting before him, with him under their legs; I sent for five or six people from my house to assist, and we secured him.</p>

            . I am a poulterer at Newgate-market. Mr. Bowley claimed two fowls which I had, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; I had bought them a little after eight; I saw them first about seven o'clock- the prisoner and another were in company - they had three fowls - they were shifted Irom the hands of one to another; the prisoner had the cock in his hand; I bought the two pullets of the man who was with him; the prisoner had the cock on the board at the same time; I gave 3s. 3d. for them - they were not fit to kill but to lay; I put them inot the coop. The money was paid to the other man - I knew the prisoner very well.</p>

            . I am a porter of Newgate-market. About half-past eight o'clock on this morning, I bought the cock of the prisoner for 1s. 2d.; I am certain of his person - I knew him well before, by seeing him with fowls and rabbits - I paid the other man for it; he was an old man - they both went away together; I bought it of the prisoner - they both agreed for me to have it, and said they should bring me some more to-morrow - both joined in the bargain, and wanted me to buy the three; the prisoner asked me 7s. for the three - both appeared to be owners.</p>

            . I am an officer of Clerkenwell. I apprehended the prisoner at the Horse and Groom, concealed under the seat - other persons were sitting over him, hiding him with their legs. It is a very bad house. I went to the prosecutor's premises - the door had been forced open - here is the iron bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going towards the City to mind horses and carts, to gain a livelihood; I met this old man, who asked me the way to Newgate-market - I directed him - he offered me 6d. to shew him the way - he then said if I would hold one of the fowls he would give me 6d. I held one till he sold the other - then gave it him, and he took the money. I have worked for Mr. Hagne, a tailor, in Hosier-lane.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BEDFORD re-examined. I saw the prisoner shew the fowls to two or three people in the market - they acted as joint proprietors in them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman K</hi> 271.) On Sunday night, the 11th of Oct., about a quarter to nine o'clock, I was in the Bethnal-green-road, and saw a female who said she was the prisoner's wife—I did not know her at the time—she was bleeding profusely from a wound in the head—she made a statement to me—I took her to a surgeon, got her wound dressed, and sent her to the London Hospital—I ascertained from her that the prisoner lived at No. 6, Albion-cottages, Holly-bush-gardens, Bethnal-green-road—I went there with some constables and saw the prisoner sitting at the window of the first-floor—the window-sash was out of the frame, and I believe he had it in hi! Hand—I heard him say he would throw it out on the first man who offered to come into the yard—I requested my brother constables to turn their lights on him, which they did, and 1 opened the door with a key which I had received from the woman who represented herself as his wife—I got into the house; the other constables followed me—when I got to the foot of the stairs I saw the prisoner standing on the landing above—he said he would shoot the first man who offered to come up—I did not at first see anything, but shortly after saw a poker in his hand—I went up the stairs: he attacked me with the poker and struck me several times on the back—I was then obliged to use my staff—I had not touched him before that—I had told him I came to take him into custody for assaulting his wife—I was forced down on my brother con<lb></lb>stable by the prisoner—the lights were extinguished by some means or other—the</p>

               <p>prisoner was still on the landing brandishing the poker about, and strik<lb></lb>ing me with it—I again advanced towards him, and he cut me over the head with it a violent blow, which knocked me backwards, and cut my head—while I was falling, I received a slight wound on the side of my head from the poker—I bled <hi rend="italic">furiously</hi>—the blood run into my eyes and prevented me seeing, and I retreated—I went to a surgeon, got my wound dressed, and afterwards found the prisoner in custody.</p>

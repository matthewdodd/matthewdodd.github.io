            , the deceased, and his Son, were going to fish, at a Place called the Moor, near Slaines ; they had a Casting-Net, and there was a String which belongs to the Net, and this String was about the deceased's right Arm: They were fishing in a Meadow belonging to one Sylvester ; and as they were fishing towards the North of the Enclosure, the Deceased seeing the Prisoners, stopped, and went back again, and as they were going back again, instantly came up the Prisoner,

There were three Persons, Fisher , Bettesworth, and Bowles, who could see what was done; they were on the other Side of the River, about an Hundred and Sixty Yards from the Place where the Accident happened; they heard a Gun fired, and the young Man cry out that his Father was kill'd; and when they came to the River Side, he had just dragg'd the Net out of the River; upon this they crossed over, and found the Man dead, or so bad that he could not live, and thereupon directed the Son to go and fetch Mr Cole, a Surgeon at Slaines ; he went accordingly to Mr Cole, and desired him to come along with him, for his Father was shot, and he believed he was dead. Why, says Mr Cole, if he is dead, it does not signify my coming, I can do him no good; so then the young Man went to Mr Russel, a Constable at Slaines : But I should tell you, Gentlemen, that as soon as the Prisoners saw these three Persons, Fisher, Bettesworth, and Bowles, coming towards the River, they ran away. Afterwards Russel, the Constable, and some other Persons coming up, they thought proper to pursue the Murderers: Accordingly they went to a Farm-House where Annesley and Redding used sometimes to lodge, and there they found Annesley, and apprehended him, and sent him to the Round-House at Slaines ; Redding could never be found, but he has surrendered himself since, in order to take his Trial. The Prisoner Annesley was carried before a Justice of the Peace, I think Sir

               <p>Q. Did you not send up Word to him you was sure he would be glad to see you?</p>
               <p>Egglestone. I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Reason, for which you thought Mr Annesley would be glad to see you?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give the same Account with Respect to the holding of the G as you do now, before the Coroner's Inquest , and before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Egglestone. Yes, I am sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give two Accounts before the Coroner's Inquest; part at one Time, and went out, and the Remainder when you came in again? Egglest. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say that the butt End of the Gun was up to his Shoulder, and the Muzzel pointed downward.</p>

               <p>Q. What Ground was it in.</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. They were in the Ground called Mr Sylvester's Rents.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Are there many Hedges on the Side of the River where the Deceased was?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. There were a pretty many Willows, but any Body might see through them.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. What did you see?</p>

               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. What Hedge?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. The Hedge that parted Mr Sylvester's Ground from Mr Redding's Ground, I do not know whether one of them did not come over the Stile, then they both run after Egglestone and his Son; young Redding came up first.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Did he lay hold of Egglestone?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Whether he laid his Hand upon his Collar, or what, I cannot tell; but the Boy run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it laid hold of the Shoulder or Collar of the Deceased?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Redding, I saw his Hand upon the Shoulder or Collar of the Deceased, but I cannot say positively whether he had him by the Shoulder or Collar.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. How long was it after that, that Annesley came up?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. The Boy was gone but a little way from his Father, and when Mr Annesley came up to his Father, he came back again.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. How near was he to his Father when this Accident happen'd?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. I cannot say how near he was to his Father, I believe two or three Yards off. - Annesley and Redding came up almost together, but Annesley came up after him, the Gun went off after he came up: I saw the Smoak and heard the Fire.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. As you were 169 Yards off how came you to come up?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. The Boy called to us and said his Father was killed.</p>

            , we came to the River just against the Place where Mr Egglestone lay, and we could not get over there without being up thus high; (putting his Hand to his Middle) but we went over in a shallower Place a little farther.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Were Annesley and Redding there when you came over?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. No, they run away before that.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Was Egglestone dead or alive when you came up?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. He was not dead, but he could not speak. I desired the Boy to go for a Surgeon, and he went away directly.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Who came first to the River?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Did you all three come away together?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Yes, I was coming rather before the Boy cried out, for I saw the Man drop, I could not see the Boy for a good while, for he was in the River, and he cut the Net from his Father's Arm, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150013"></xptr> he says, I did not see that; but I saw the Boy come cross the River, and when I came up I saw that the Net was brought cross the River.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Grapper. How did Egglestone lie?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth . He lay upon his Face; I lifted up his Head, he groan'd pretty much, but he could not speak: I sent the Boy for a Surgeon, but no Surgeon came.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Was you at the apprehending of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. What Place was it that the Prisoner was in when he was taken?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. It was a Sort of a Wash-house , a Back-house: He was in a Place where they throw up Hoops and Iron, and any Sort of old Lumber; I saw him lie upon his Face.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Who took him down?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. What did they do with him then?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. They carried him to the Round House at Staines .</p>
               <p>Court. When you came to the place where you say he had hid himself, did he come down of his own accord?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. When you heard the Gun go off whose Hand was it in?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Mr Annesley's.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. Do you know the Position of the Gun when it went off?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. Did you observe any Struggle between Annesley , Redding, and the Deceased?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. No other than their striving to take the Net away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any Thing that passed in the Round-House? - Did the Prisoner say any thing there?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Yes, the Prisoner said he desired to be kill'd out of the Way, for being accessary to such an innocent Man's Death.</p>
               <p>Brown. What did he tell you besides?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. He said he would have gone home for more Men, but

               <p>Bettesworth. I believe it was, that he said we can do it well enough.</p>

               <p>Bettesworth. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Mr Annesley making any Use of his Gun before he came up?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. I saw him offer to shoot at a Crow.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was that before this Accident happen'd?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. I believe about half an Hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Crow flying or sitting?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Flying.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he did shoot at the Crow?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. Not then, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you off then?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. About as far, I think, as when I saw the Man kill'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Position of the Gun when you saw him come up running.</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. It was on this Manner, [holds it as if the Gun was with the Muzzle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150014"></xptr> hanging a little Slanting towards the Ground.]</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. You say you saw Annesley and Redding in the other Ground, before they came into that Ground which belongs to Sylvester - what were they doing there, were they standing, sitting, or what?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. They were sitting or lying under the Hedge, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. For what Purpose do you imagine they were sitting or lying there?</p>
               <p>Bettesworth. I cannot say that, I may imagine they came to take the Net away, I cannot imagine any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Boy go into the River?</p>

               <p>Fisher. I see Mr Annesley, but I cannot say that he is the Man; I saw two Men lie under the Hedge a considerable Time, and saw a Piece in one of their Hands.</p>
               <p>Brown. In which Ground were they?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I believe in Mr Redding's Ground.</p>
               <p>Brown. In what Ground was Egglestone ?</p>
               <p>Fisher. He was in Sylvester's Ground. Bettesworth called to me, and said there is Redding running after Egglestone, and Redding laid hold of Egglestone , the Deceased, and then came up the other with a Piece: I cannot say whether he touched him or no.</p>
               <p>Court. In what Manner did Redding lay hold of him?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I cannot say, I was at such a Distance; but I thought he laid hold of his Shoulder.</p>
               <p>Brown. Did Egglestone make away from him?</p>
               <p>Fisher. Yes; for he knew he was out of the Bounds that he ought to have been fishing in; and there was a Sort of a Struggle to take away the Net; and I thought that Redding and the other Person did both, snatch at the Net, and then the Gun went off.</p>
               <p>Brown. In whose Hand was the Gun?</p>
               <p>Fisher. Not in Redding's Hand, but in the Hand of the other Person.</p>
               <p>Brown. Was not you attentive at that Time, to see in what Manner he carried the Gun?</p>
               <p>Fisher. It may be this way, or this way, I cannot say whether he had the Gun against his Shoulder or no.</p>
               <p>Brown. How near was he to the Deceas'd?</p>

               <p>Q. Who came there afterwards?</p>
               <p>Fisher. Mr Sylvester, he saw the Deceased lying upon the Ground, but he was not there when the Murder was committed?</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the House when he was taken? Fisher. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before the Justice of Peace?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I was examined, but I was not present when the other Witnesses were examined.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. What Distance was there between you and the Deceased, when the Gun went off?</p>

             , did not say to you he believed the Gun did go off by Accident?</p>
               <p>Fisher. He said he believed it was not done wilfully . I was called into a Room with Chester and Lane : He had Money offered him, in my hearing, by John Lane; he offered him 100 l. a Year. Mr Annesley said he could not give him 100 l. - but he would give him 50 l. for he had others to do for; then, said the Boy, I do not care to sell my Father's Blood; but I will do as my Friends direct me; I believe he was in Liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him.</p>
               <p>Fisher. I said your Father is dead; the Money will do you good; do not swear any thing against him, if you think it was done accidentally; he said the Money will do me good if I had it; and then said, I believe the Gentleman did not do it wilfully.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not some Conversation together, after his Examination before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I asked him, after he was examined, what he had done; and how he could swear against him, when he had said so and so to me; said he, I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Q That he did not know what he said, to who?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I asked him how he could swear against him when he knew what he said to me, said he, I do not know any Thing of the Matter; he did not remember what he had said to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you make a Declaration of this to him?</p>
               <p>Fisher. Yes ; and I told him what I now say, I mean what passed between us at the Time he went before the Justice: I said to Mr Williams, that Egglestone told me he really believed that the Gentleman did not do it wilfully .</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat all that you said to Mr Williams.</p>

               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Did you see the Deceas'd after he was dead?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. He lay dead on the Ground that I rent, near the River Side, I think about the Middle of the Ground.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Do you know how he came by his Death?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I was going up to look after my Ground, to see if there was any Cattle in it, or any thing amiss. - I call'd at the Cock, and drank two Pints of Beer, and when I came within two Hundred Yards or thereabouts, of my Ground, I met three Men, who told me old Egglestone was killed; I did not believe it, they then pointed to my Ground, and said, there he lies; I saw several People there, upon which I thought there was something more than common, and so I went up and saw Tom. Egglestone lie dead in my Ground.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Do you know where the Prisoner Annesley was taken?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. He was taken in a back Building belonging to Mr Redding's House; I was searching the Rooms myself, and heard the People say, here he is, and I saw Mr Annesley, who is the Gentleman there, come down out of the Place.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. What sort of a Place was it he was found in?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. It was a Place to put odd things in: It was not boarded up to the Top.</p>
               <p>Q Did he come down voluntarily, or was he pulled down?</p>
               <p>Sylvester . I don't know whether they pulled him down or helped him down.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. Did you hear him say any thing at that Time.</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I did not hear him say any Thing, I believe he was in a Fit, for he trembled and fell down behind the Door.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. Did you see him at the Round-House?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. No, I did not, for I was gone to search after the other Prisoner Redding.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Was you at Laleham before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Had not the Boy been drinking, and did he not sleep before he went in to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I believe he did, for about three Quarters of an Hour, I do believe he had been in Liquor, but he was refreshed afterwards.</p>
               <p>[Upon the cross Examination.]</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received Money to pay the Witnesses for attending here on this Cause the last Sessions, and from whom?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. Yes, I paid some of them, I think it was by Mr Giffard's direction who subpoena 'd me up; I asked him who was to pay me, he said I should be paid Half a Crown a Day for my Time, which was as much as he thought I could earn at my Business.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business is this Giffard of ?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. He is a Stranger to me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150017"></xptr>Q Do you know who he said he was employed by?</p>
               <p>Sylvester . He said he was concerned for the King.</p>
               <p>Q Did you send Notice of this Accident to any Body as soon as the Man was killed? Sylvester . No.</p>
               <p>Q Do you know Mr Williams ?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. Yes, I know him, but I never was in his Company upon this Occasion .</p>
               <p>Q What Business does young Egglestone follow?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I cannot say what Business he follows, I believe he draws Beer now.</p>
               <p>Q How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I have known him five or six Years.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business was he bred to?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. Sometimes he would be out at Service, and sometimes he would be with his Father in the Business of a Carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he draw Beer now?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I think it is at Mr Williams's, at the White-Horse in Pickadilly. But this is not the Williams I was speaking of before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been in Company with this Gentleman, and had some Conversation with him about this Affair?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I have been at the Gentleman's House in Pickadilly since this Business has been in Hand, but never before; and I have been in Company with the Gentleman there, but never had any talk with him about this Trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this Williams down before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him at Staines ?</p>
               <p>Sylvester. I saw him in the Town of Staines , I believe about a Week after the Accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the Boy, Egglestone , there since?</p>
               <p>Sylvester . I never saw him at Staines afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What he has lived with Williams ever since?</p>
               <p>Sylvester . I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you have not seen him at Williams's House every Time you have been there?</p>
               <p>Sylvester . Yes, I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper then said, they would rest it here; And having observed upon the Evidence, concluded with saying, he hoped it had fully made out the Charge against the Prisoners; that the Ground where the Man was killed being the Property of Sylvester, the Prisoners were Trespassers by coming into it, and therefore answerable for the Consequences. That as to Mr Annesley, there was not only implied, but express Malice proved upon him, for that after he had killed the Father , he was for beating out the Son's Brains, only because they would not let him and the other Prisoner run away with their Net.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr Annesley, you are indicted in a very unhappy Case, what have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Mr Annesley. My Lord, I am very unable to make a proper Defence, having by the Cruelty of those, whose Duty it was to protect me, been deprived of the Advantages of an Education I was entituled to by my Birth.</p>
               <p>All I know of the melancholy Accident in Question is, that on the unfortunate Day mention'd in the Indictment, I went out with my Gun, in company with my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150018"></xptr> innocent Fellow-Prisoner, to shoot Sparrows, as I usually did. As we were going along, Mr Redding, who is Game-Keeper to the Lord of the Manour, saw some People a poaching within the Royalty, upon which he proposed to go and seize their Nets, I followed him, the Deceas'd threw the Net into the River, and the Boy jump'd in to pull it across, to prevent which, I stoop'd to lay hold of one of the Ropes that trailed upon the Ground, and at the same Instant, the fatal Instrument I had in my other Hand, hanging by my Side, went off without my Knowledge, and to my great Grief as well as Surprize. My Behaviour, immediately after the Accident, was, I hope, inconsistent with a Temper that could murder a Man I had never seen before, without one Word of Provocation.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the Determination of your Lordship and the Jury, great as the Misfortunes of my Life have been, I shall always consider this unfortunate Accident as the greatest of them all.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr Redding, what have you to say for yourself?</p>

On the first of May last, in the Afternoon, Mr Annesly and I went out a walking; we saw a Crow, and Mr Annesley made an Offer to shoot at her, but I called to him not to fire, for that she was too far off: Soon after I saw Egglestone and his Son a fishing with a Casting-Net, upon which I said to Mr Annesley, I would go and endeavour to take their Net away, as it was my Duty to do; according I went up to the Deceas'd and demanded the Net, which he refused to deliver to me, and threw it into the River, one End of the String being about his Arm, I then laid hold of the String, and pulled, whilst the Boy endeavoured to draw it cross the River, and presently I heard the Gun go off (my Back being towards Mr Annesley ) and saw the Man fall down. - I said to Mr Annesley , I hoped he had not shot the Man, he said no, but turning up the Flap of his Coat, we saw he was shot; upon which Mr Annesley cried out, What shall I do! and expressed so much Concern, that I am sure it was quite an accidental Thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Give an Account of what you know.</p>
               <p>Redding. I was in the next Field called Chantry Mead. This where the Accident happened, is called the Hare Mead.</p>
               <p>Q. What Manour is it in?</p>
               <p>Redding. It is in Yeoveney Manour , which belongs to Sir

               <p>Q. Where were you when this happened?</p>
               <p>Redding. I was in Chantry Mead .</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you off then?</p>
               <p>Redding. As near as I can guess it is about forty Pole.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe there?</p>
               <p>Redding. I saw my Son and Mr Annesley coming up, - I did not know who they were till they came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them immediately after the Accident happened?</p>
               <p>Redding . Yes, presently.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they behave upon this Occasion ?</p>
               <p>Redding. They were so troubled they could hardly wag or speak; my Son said he was afraid the Man was killed; and he said to Mr Annesley , how did you do it? Mr Annesley said, I did not think of the Gun's going off.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw them coming up, did you observe them when the Accident happen'd?</p>
               <p>Redding. Yes, I look'd at them all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the Gun carried when it went off?</p>
               <p>Redding. Just as I may hold this Sword. (Holding it in his Right-Hand, hanging down near the Pocket a few Inches from his Body, almost upon a Level) He had it in one Hand, as I have the Sword now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express himself concerned?</p>

               <p>Redding. He was so concerned, that he did not run ten Pole, before he fell down and beat himself thus upon the Belly, and said, What have I done ?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any Quarrel between him and this Man?</p>
               <p>Redding. Never.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150021"></xptr>Serj. Gapper. (on the cross examination) Where did you stand when the Accident happened?</p>
               <p>Redding. In Chantry Mead.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a Hedge between Chentry Mead and Hare Mead?</p>
               <p>Redding. Yes, I believe there is.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see through the Hedge?</p>
               <p>Redding. It is a new Hedge not above a Yard high, and I could see any thing that was doing there, as clear as I can see you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Annesley with his Face or his Back towards you?</p>
               <p>Redding. He was Side-ways to me.</p>
               <p>Serj. Gapper. Why Chantry Mead is North of Hare Mead, then his Face could not be towards you?</p>
               <p>Redding. No, I say his Side was towards me.</p>
               <p>Serj. Gapper. You were speaking as to this being a Manour; how do you know it to be a Manour?</p>
               <p>Redding. Because there have been Courts kept there.</p>

               <p>Duffell. I have known him these eight Years, and he has been frequently at my House.</p>
               <p>Q. What Character has he?</p>
               <p>Duffell. I cannot say much in his Behalf; his Father could not manage him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business did he follow?</p>
               <p>Duffell. His Father was a Carpenter, and he worked with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave Staines ?</p>
               <p>Duffell. Soon after this Accident happened.</p>

               <p>Duffell. I have seen him at the White-Horse, in Pickadilly; and I heard at Staines , that he was sent for to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Man at the White-Horse come down for him to Staines ?</p>
               <p>Duffell. I did not see him there.</p>

On the Sunday, when the Prisoner at the Bar was carried to Laleham to be examined, I went there: The Company dined at the Grey-Hound at Laleham , I stay'd and drank half a Pint of Wine there, and immediately afterwards John Egglestone came to the Door, and called me out of the Room, and said he wanted to speak with me. When I came out, he said he wanted to ask my Advice concerning this Accident: I said, I wonder you should ask my Advice, when you have Relations to advise with; he said, I thought sit to ask you as you are my Master.

               <p>Dalton. No, I said, I thought by what he told me, that the Man was in no Danger of being hang'd, and therefore he had better take Money than endeavour to hang a Man, that he thought did not do it designedly .</p>

               <p>Q. Give us an Account of what you know of this Matter.</p>
               <p>Chester. I drove the Chaise, from my own House, to the Red-Lion at Brentford , and then to the Grey-Hound at Laleham ; I went up to young Egglestone, and ask'd him how this unfortunate Thing happen'd; whether it was done designedly, or happen'd by Accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Chester. This was at Laleham ; he said he believed it was accidental, for he did not believe any Gentleman in cool Blood would do any such thing wilfully.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing with respect to the Net?</p>
               <p>Chester. I think he said Mr Annesley was stooping to the Net, in order to take it, and the Gun went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any Thing how Mr Annesley held the Gun?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150024"></xptr>Chester. I had the Chaise-Whip in my Hand, and desired him to show me how Mr Annesley held the Gun; he took the Whip in his Hand and held it so, (which was much the same Position as Redding and Duffell said he held it in) I think it was rather nearer the Handle than the Middle of the Whip that he held it.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. Did you see the Wound; Where was the Wound?</p>
               <p>Chester. I understood it was somewhere about the Hip.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. I ask you whether you think he could have shot him in the Hip, if he had held the Gun that Way?</p>
               <p>Chester. I think he could not have shot him there, if he had held it any other Way.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. Pray do you know of any Money being offered by any Person in your Presence to young Egglestone?</p>
               <p>Chester. No.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. Nor any Reward of any Sort?</p>
               <p>Chester. No. - My Lord, I had forgot to mention one thing. After this, Egglestone spoke to Mr Annesley the Prisoner, and shook Hands with him; and Egglestone said he was very sorry for what had happened, but said he did not think he did it designedly, and then drank a Glass of Wine to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they shake Hands, or drink the Wine first?</p>
               <p>Chester. Both at the same Time as near as could be.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Did you see this?</p>
               <p>Chester. I did see it.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. I ask you whether the Prisoner at the Bar is not married to your Daughter-in-Law?</p>
               <p>Chester. My Lord, if your Lordship thinks I ought to answer this Question, I will.</p>
               <p>Court. The Relation is very small, but if they insist on their Question, you must answer it.</p>
               <p>Chester. The Prisoner is married to my Daughter-in-Law.</p>
               <p>Q. They ask this Question in Hopes of its being of Service to them in another Affair, for it cannot be of any in this; though I hope he has got a very good Wife.</p>

             gave me Leave to come in and hear the Depositions: I was afterwards sent for by Mr Perkins a Surgeon at Staines , to attend at the opening of the Body before the Coroner; there were several of the Coroner's Jury in the Room. I found the Wound on the left Side, about an Inch and an Half below the Ridge of the Hip-Bone; the Wound I apprehend to be about an Inch and an Half wide; I found it went into the Cavity of the Belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Wound go upwards or downwards into the Belly?</p>
               <p>Betbune. When I found it went into the Cavity of the Belly, I remember'd in what manner Egglestone held the Gun when he was before Sir

            , to show how Mr Annesley held it when he fir'd: I remember very well he held it to his Shoulder slanting downwards; I attempted to put my Probe into the Wound in the same direction as he described the Gun, but there was no Passage for it in that Position, it would not go in downwards; then I put it in in this Manner cross the Belly, and it went in without Obstruction, and then upwards and it went in with the same Ease, in this Manner. I observ'd several large Blisters, full of black Serum on the right Side, opposite to the Place where the Shot went in, the Blisters which were on the opposite Side, were three or four Inches higher than where the Wound was, - the Wound was on the left Side, and the Blisters on the right; when I found this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150027"></xptr> was so plain to me, I desired it might be as plain to the Jury and every one there, as it was to my self, because this was a Matter of Fact and not of Judgment, and I desired the Foreman to come and put the Probe in and try, he did so and found the Wound as I have described it: I was the more careful in this, because I had observed the Evidence that the Boy gave on the Sunday, and there was some Variation between that and the Nature of the Wound, therefore I desired them to take the more Notice of it, and said, Gentlemen, I shall have Occasion to speak to this by and by, and therefore I desire you would mind what I say to you.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you think those Blisters on the other Side were occasioned by.</p>
               <p>Mr Bethune . I apprehend they were occasioned by the Force of the Powder, and that if the Shot had gone through, it must have come out three or four Inches higher on the other Side than it went in.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. According to your Account, could he, holding the Muzzle of the Gun upwards, have made this Wound?</p>
               <p>Mr Bethune . It could not have made it with the Muzzle downward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how the Wound was upon the Bone, and whether there were any Shot remaining in the Wound?</p>
               <p>Mr Bethune . No Sir, But I found some Shot in the Cavity of the Belly.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. Now the Question is, Whether the Shot, coming upon this Bone, might not be thrown upwards?</p>

               <p>Mr Bethune . No, for the Shot went through the Bone, so that the Gun must have been held obliquely, pointing upwards; the Shot could not have gone through in that Direction if the Muzzle of the Gun had pointed downwards; this is not Matter of Judgement, but I have given you Demonstration of it.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. You say the Wound went from the left Side to the right, and that if the Muzzle of the Gun was downwards the Wound would be in the same Manner.</p>
               <p>Mr Bethune . Certainly Sir, if the Muzzle of the Gun is held downward, the Shot cannot go upward.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. He makes it appear that the Prisoner could not hold the Gun to his Shoulder, but that it was held horizontally, and that it was impossible for him to wound him in the Manner the Boy has described, if the Muzzle of the Gun had been pointed downward.</p>
               <p>Mr Bethune . I beg Leave to speak a few Words more to your Lordship. While I was giving in this Evidence before the Coroner and his Jury, if your Lordship remembers, I said I had showed them how the Wound was, therefore I desired them to consider how Consistent it was with the Evidence that Mr Egglestone had given: I believe I proved it to the Coroner's Jury and others that were there, that it was impossible it could be done in that Manner, if the Gun was held as he said, to his Shoulder, upon that he comes up again, and, says he, the Gentleman stooped when he did it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. This shews how he departed from what he had said, for he said first that Mr Annesley stood upright when he fired, and then that he stooped in order to make his Evidence correspond with the Wound.</p>

               <p>Keating . They stand there constantly .</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. What was that Note for?</p>
               <p>Keating . It is only a Copy of what I wrote for Egglestone, for as I told the Court before, I did not care that my Hand should be seen in any such Thing as Bribery and Corruption.</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. Where was this Note sign'd?</p>
               <p>Keating. I cannot say whether it was sign'd or not, he told me it was to be sign'd.</p>

               <p>Keating. Because he had no Money of his own .</p>
               <p>Mr Serj. Gapper. So you had a Crown to go to Woolwich and did not go?</p>
               <p>Keating. I did not go indeed.</p>
               <p>The Evidence for the Prisoners being gone through .</p>
               <p>Court. If the Jury should be of Opinion that the Gun went off by Accident, the Homicide must, in Point of Law, be either Manslaughter or Chance-Medley; I should be glad in that Case to make it Chance-Medley; but in order to that it must appear, that what Mr Annesley was doing, was perfectly lawful, otherwise he will be guilty of Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>The other Prisoner, Redding, had certainly, by Virtue of his Deputation, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150030"></xptr> by Force of the Acts of Parliament made for the Preservation of the Game, Authority to seize the Deceased, who was clearly acting in Violation of those Laws. But it is doubtful whether the Authority of a Game-Keeper being personal, the other Prisoner acted lawfully in assisting him.</p>
               <p>The Substance of the Arguments by the Council for the Prisoners, (viz. Mr Hume Campbel, Mr Serj. Hayward, Mr Clarke, Mr Wyrley, and Mr Smith) was as follows.</p>
               <p>My Lord, although a Game-Keeper's Authority be personal; we submit to your Lordship, that as the Deceased was confessedly doing an unlawful Act, Mr Annesley's catching at the String of the Net, which the Deceased had thrown away, and which might be only to prevent its falling into the Water, was not such a Trespass in him, as will alter the Nature of the Consequence, and make that Manslaughter, which appears to have been in Fact a most unfortunate Accident.</p>
               <p>We humbly apprehend, my Lord, that it is not necessary, that the Act Mr Annesley was about when the Accident happened, should be strictly legal; if it was an Act of an indifferent Nature, not an unlawful one, we hope it will be sufficient to excuse him from the Guilt of Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>If a Man throws a Stone into a Place of publick Resort, and kills another, that will be Manslaughter, because the Act itself was unlawful, supposing that dismal Consequence had not followed it.</p>
               <p>But if a Man is playing at Bowls, and undesignedly kills another, there as the first Act was of an indifferent Nature, the Law will not impute the Accident consequential to it as a Crime.</p>
               <p>As to Mr Annesley's entring the Close that belonged to Sylvester, whatever it might be with Regard to him, it was an Act of an indifferent Nature with Respect to the Deceased, who claimed no Property in the Ground, and consequently had no more Right to be there than Mr Annesley, unless you will suppose him to have had the Owner's Consent, which, as it was not proved, may and ought, with equal Justice, to be supposed in Favour of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>The young Man's Evidence being put out of the Case, (and considering the Manner in which he contradicted himself, and has been contradicted by others, what he says we apprehend ought to stand for nothing) Mr Annesley's Act appears to be no more than stooping to prevent the String of the Net from falling into the River; in doing of which, suppose a Pistol had gone off in his Pocket, would it not be the hardest Case in the World, to say that this Accident should make him guilty of Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>But allowing it necessary that the Act Mr Annesley was doing must be lawful, we hope to shew your Lordship that Mr Annesley's Interposition in this Case was so.</p>
               <p>There are two Acts of Parliament relating to the Game, applicable to this Case; the one made in the 22d and 23d Years of

            . Chap. 25. and the other in the 4th and 5th Years of William and Mary, Chap. 23.</p>
               <p>The first recites that divers disorderly Persons, laying aside their lawful Trades, betake themselves to the stealing of Conies, Hares, Pheasants, Partridges, and other Game , with Nets and other Engines .<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150031"></xptr> For Remedy whereof it enacts, That all Lords of Manours may, by writing under their Hands and Seals, authorize one or more Game-Keeper, or Game-Keepers, within their Manours; who being so authorized, may seize such Nets, or other Engines, as shall be used by any Person or Persons prohibited to keep or use the same.</p>
               <p>Then it recites, that divers idle, disorderly, and mean People, do betake themselves to the stealing of Fish out of Ponds, and other several Waters and Rivers, to the great Damage of the Owners thereof.</p>
               <p>Therefore it enacts, that if any Person or Persons shall use a Casting-Net in any River, &amp;c. without the Consent of the Lord or Owner of the said Water; and being thereof convicted before any Justice of the Peace, shall give the Owner such Satisfaction (not exceeding treble Damages) as the Justice shall appoint, or be committed to the House of Correction. And that it shall be lawful for the Justice to destroy all such Nets, or other Engines, wherewith such Offenders shall be taken or apprehended.</p>
               <p>The other Act of Parliament recites, that divers good and necessary Laws had been made for Preservation of the Game; notwithstanding which, or for want of the due Execution thereof, the Game had been very much destroyed by many idle Persons, who afterwards betake themselves to Robberies, Burglaries, or other like Offences, and neglect their lawful Employments.</p>
               <p>For Remedy whereof it enacts, That no Person, or Persons, shall have or keep any Net or Engine for taking of Fish, except the Owner or Occupier of a River or Fishery. And that it shall be lawful for such Owner or Occupier, and all and every other Person, or Persons, by him or them, for that Purpose appointed, to seize, detain, and keep, to his and their own Use and Uses, every Net or Engine which they shall find used, or in the Custody or Possession of any Person or Persons whatsoever, fishing in any River without the Consent of the Owner or Occupier.</p>
               <p>Now the Question which your Lordship puts upon us to argue, is, Whether a Person duly authorized under these Acts of Parliament, being resisted in the Execution of his Office, can legally call any other Person to his Assistance.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship will consider we are arguing in Favour of Life, and therefore will construe these Laws in the most beneficial Manner for the Prisoner, and the rather because such Construction will tend to put the Laws themselves in Force, which were intended for securing Men in their Property from the Violation of idle and disorderly Persons.</p>
               <p>These Acts suppose the Offenders to be desperate People, for it describes them to be such as afterwards betake themselves to Robberies and Burglaries, and likewise supposes (what is also true in Fact,) that they go in Numbers to destroy the Game.</p>
               <p>That Circumstance seems to imply that a Game-Keeper, or other Person duly appointed, may, in such Cases, call in other Persons to his Assistance.</p>
               <p>To construe the Law otherwise, would render it ineffectual , for it is absurd to suppose, that every Lord of a Manour, or Owner of a Fishery, should appoint as many Game-Keepers as there may be Persons inclined to invade his Property. This would entirely tend to defeat the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150032"></xptr> Security intended by the Law, and therefore can never be agreeable to the Meaning of the Legislators.</p>
               <p>As these are late Acts of Parliament, it cannot be expected, that we should produce Cases directly in Point, and Resolutions of the Judges, on the Construction of those Acts in this Question.</p>
               <p>But suppose upon some of the Acts of Parliament made against Smugglers, an Officer of the Revenue, or at the Common Law a Constable, being resisted in the Execution of his Office, calls in other Persons in the Neighbourhood to his Assistance, and Mischief or Death ensues; might not those Persons avail themselves of the Authority vested in the Officer or Constable, so as to be justified in what they do, for the manifest Support and Execution of the Law?</p>
               <p>A Man has undoubtedl y a Right to drive away Cattle, which he finds Damage faisant in his Ground. Suppose then he should desire a Stranger to assist him, could the Owner of the Cattle maintain an Action against the Stranger for the Trespass in driving his Cattle?</p>
               <p>Suppose, in the present Case, the Deceased had not unfortunately been killed, and had brought an Action against the Prisoners for an Assault, might not the Defendants (one of which was Game-Keeper) have pleaded specially, and justified under the Act of Parliament? And surely, whatever in pleading would have been a Justification in such a Case as this will be a sufficient Excuse.</p>
               <p>But we apprehend, that in all Cases where the Law makes Offences punishable by Justices of the Peace, whoever sees a Person committing such an Offence, has a Right, without any special Authority, to take him up, and carry him, together with the Instrument of his Offence, before a Justice, in order to his Conviction, and that whatever is necessary for this Purpose is lawful.</p>
               <p>If this was not Law, Offenders would in most Cases escape with Impunity; for observing themselves to be discovered, they would hardly stay till the Observer could resort to a proper Authority; and being mean and unknown Persons, might never afterwards be found.</p>
               <p>Even the young Man, who was so very forward in giving his Evidence, admits that his Father and he were actually fishing, that is, committing an Offence against these Acts of Parliament. That Redding, who had a legal Authority, came up first to the Deceased and demanded the Net, that the Deceased refused to deliver it; and that whilst they were struggling for the Net, Mr Annesley came up and snatched at it.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole, we hope Mr Annesley was well warranted to go to Redding's Assistance , and that the unhappy Accident that fell out at that Time, shall not be imputed to him as a Crime, but construed to be no more than Chance-Medley.</p>
               <p>The Substance of the Arguments by the Council for the Prosecutor, viz. Mr Serj. Gapper, Mr Serj. Wynne, Mr Brown, and Mr Johnson was as follows.</p>
               <p>My Lord, The Council for the Prisoners have undertaken to justify under two Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>As to the 22d and 23d of

            , we beg leave to observe, that the Clause empowering Lords of Manours to appoint Game-Keepers with Authority to seize Nets, does not extend to Fisheries. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150033"></xptr> Clause which relates to Fishing, only directs that the Offenders shall be punished upon Conviction before a Justice of Peace, but does not empower any one to seize either them or their Nets. The regular Way undoubtedly is to lay a Complaint before a Justice of the Peace, who is to grant his Warrant for apprehending the Offender, and then upon Conviction he may destroy the Net. Besides, it was sworn by old Redding, that this was his Fishery, if so, Sir

             had no Authority at all to appoint a Game-Keeper to take care of it, and consequently, even the Deputation itself is void.</p>
               <p>But if it was not void, yet still the Power is personal, and cannot be delegated to another, and therefore cannot serve to excuse Mr Annesley, who appears to have acted officiously, without being called upon by any Body.</p>
               <p>As to the other Act of Parliament, the 4th and 5th of William and Mary, that no Ways relates to Game-Keepers, but only empowers the Owners or Occupiers of Fisheries, or Persons by them for that Purpose appointed, to seize the Nets; so that this Power is confined to old Redding himself, and it does not appear he has appointed either of the Prisoners, and therefore, as they had no Authority at all, they were Trespassers, and must answer for the Consequences.</p>
               <p>As to the liberal Construction of the Acts of Parliament, which the Gentlemen contend for, we say that, at the Common Law, every Man had a Right to fish in Rivers; and consequently, those Statutes are an Abridgment of the Common Law, and therefore to be strictly construed. By the same Rule of Construction which they insist upon, any Man may claim a Right to come every Day and search another's House for Nets and Engines for destroying of Game. But what Murders, besides other Inconveniences, must be the Consequence of such an unlimitted Power, we leave all the World to judge.</p>

               <p>We admit that this is a new Case, and therefore the Cases put of a Constable, whose Office is as ancient as any in the Kingdom, are by no Means parallel. We insist therefore that the Prisoners, at least Mr. Annesley, having been wrong Doers, must answer for the Consequence, which being the Death of one of his Majesty's Subjects, make them guilty of Manslaughter, supposing the Gun went off by accident.</p>
               <p>Then Mr Hume Campbell said in Reply.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I beg leave to trouble you with a few Words, on Behalf of the unhappy Gentleman, who stands charged before you with a Crime which affects his Life.</p>
               <p>If that Consequence was the Motive for the Charge, he may rely upon the Justice of this Court as his Security; to your Justice he has surrender'd himself, and equally trusts in that and his Innocence.</p>
               <p>In arguing the Point now before the Court, I may take it for granted, that the Gun went off by accident, without Mr Annesley's knowing it; and only consider whether his interposing to assist Redding was or was not lawful.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I take it for a general Rule, that all Persons on request not only may, but are bound by their Duty and Allegiance, to assist legal Officers in the Executionof their Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150034"></xptr>I shall not repeat any of the Evidence; the Court will remember that a Request of the Game-Keeper's, or what amounts to such, has been proved.</p>
               <p>I mentioned the Case of a Constable, which the Gentlemen of the other Side, endeavour to distinguish from that of a Game-Keeper, by saying that his Power is great, and that his Office is very antient. I admit both these Positions, but insist that his Power does not arise from the Antiquity, but from the Legality of his Office.</p>
               <p>A Game-Keeper is a legal Officer, particularly appointed under the Acts of Parliament for the Preservation of the Game; he is for that Purpose fully empowered to put the Laws relating to the Game, in Execution: No-body can legally resist him, and consequently the Deceased and his Son were doubly criminal; first, in breaking the Law, and then in resisting the legal Officer, who came to put that Law in Force.</p>
               <p>What did Mr Annesley do in this Case? He stopped to take up the Net which the Deceased had unlawfully thrown into the Water, to prevent the Game Keeper from seizing it.</p>
               <p>Egglestone had abandoned it; and will any one maintain, that when a Trespasser throws away the Instrument of his Crime, it is unlawful in another Person to take it up? Nay the Assistant of him to whom the Statute gives it?</p>
               <p>They say a Man may as well go every Day into People's Houses, under Pretence of searching for Nets, &amp;c. No, they cannot do that by Law, every Man's House is his Castle; and the Law has provided that he shall not be molested there without a special Authority. Nor is there the same Reason for that, as there is for seizing Offenders in the actual Commission of the Offence. The very Case they put, implies the Offender may be found and come at by the ordinary Forms; but in the other, he may not be known, and will hardly stay till you apply for a Warrant to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>So that the Necessity of the Thing makes that reasonable and lawful in the one Case, which, for want of that Necessity, is not so in the other.</p>
               <p>That a special Authority, My Lord, is not necessary in all Cases, will hardly be disputed; a Constable, if the Law is broke in his Presence, may by Virtue of his general Power take cognizance of the Offence and arrest the Offender.</p>
               <p>In the present Case the Game-Keeper who is a legal Officer, and in nature of a Constable for this particular Purpose, saw the Deceased a Fishing, and consequently had a Right without any special Warrant to seize him, and when resisted, to call Mr Annesley to his Assistance.</p>
               <p>It is said, the Acts of Parliament are an Abridgement of the Common Law, and therefore should be construed strictly. My Lord, no Man, by the Common Law, had a Right to fish in another's Property. It was an Offence at the Common Law; It is Malum in se ; and the Statutes, that have been mentioned, only make that Offence Punishable by a Justice of Peace; as they tend therefore to secure the Property which a Man had at the Common Law, they are an Addition to the Common Law, fixing a Punishment for the breach of Law; and therefore to be so construed, as will best answer so salutary an End.</p>
               <p>If it is a new Case, as the Gentlemen seem to lay a stress upon it, let us consider what will be the Consequence of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207150035"></xptr> your Lordship's Determination if it should be against us.</p>
               <p>The Law, my Lord, I apprehend will become vain and idle; for if Offenders get together in any Number, it will be impossible for a Game-Keeper to restrain them.</p>
               <p>Nay, my Lord, the Law itself will become a Snare to all who have not the Act of Parliament in their Pocket, to tell them they must not interfere; for suppose a Person legally appointed under an Act of Parliament, going to do his Duty is resisted, can it be imagined that his Fellow-Servant, his Neighbour, or his Friend, would not think himself justified, nay bound to assist him, when he sees his Authority thus trampled upon.</p>
               <p>At most, my Lord, it could be only an imprudent Act in Mr Annesley to interpose , but we hope your Lordship will not construe it to be such an unlawful Act, as will make him a Trespasser, and so guilty of Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship will please to observe that it depends entirely on the Credit of Egglestone, whether this Gentleman did any Thing or not. Before your Lordship directs the Jury as to this, it is my Duty to acquaint your Lordship, that there is an Indictment on the Coroner's Inquest, and likewise an Indictment on the Black Act against the Prisoner Mr Annesley.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his general Character?</p>
               <p>Lawler. I do not know his general Character: But I know he has behaved very bad of late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never offer him any Money to keep out of the Way, and not appear at this Trial?</p>
               <p>Lawler. No, not I: But he said he would give them a Rowland for their Oliver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he meant by that?</p>
               <p>Lawler. No, only that he said if my Lord - did not give him Money he would turn Evidence on the other Side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think he meant, when he said, if my Lord - did not give him Money he would turn Evidence of the other Side? Why surely my Lord is not concerned in this Prosecution! But pray, Sir, you have given a bad Account of Mr Keating, how came you and he acquainted.</p>
               <p>Lawler. This Keating and I came over together from Ireland in the same Ship, he told me there were some Evidences on Board that were coming over to swear away my Lord - 's Estate; said he, there are three Women and two Men, and I have discovered the whole Thing; how they are bribed to come here, and if I come to London, said he, I will give my Lord - an Account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, Sir, tell us what became of Keating when he came to Town?</p>
               <p>Lawler. Soon after he arrived he found me out, and so I told Mr J'ans, I thought he might depend upon this Man, because I had seen him in Bristol; said I, I speak to you about this Man, out of Charity, for he is very poor; then says Mr J'ans, let him go to the White-Horse in Pickadilly; and then he wanted Cloaths and Money; and, says he, if they do not give me Cloaths and Money, I will swear that the Earl of - was to give a Note to young Egglestone to swear upon this Trial.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think he meant by his giving a Rowland for an Oliver? Whether it respected this Cause, or related to my Lord - 's Estate?</p>
               <p>Lawler. I cannot tell what he meant.</p>

             since the 18th of March; that because he could not be supplied with Cloaths, as he expected, he was to swear, that the Earl of - was to give a Note to young Egglestone.</p>
               <p>This is the State of the Evidence on both Sides.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, you are to consider, whether the Fact is Murder, Manslaughter, or Chance-Medley: Murder, Gentlemen, in Point of Law, is, when a Person kills another with express Malice and Design, or with implied Malice, as when it is without any offence or Provocation, but if there is a sudden Fray, and in that Fray and heat of Blood, a Person is killed, that is Manslaughter; now there are several Things in the Course of the Evidence proper to come under your Consideration; you will observe that Egglestone swears Mr Annesley said, Damn your Blood deliver your Net, or you are a dead Man, and that immediately the Gun went off, and the Man was shot; if he let the Gun off designedly, if this was the Case, though on a sudden, he can be guilty of no less than Manslaughter; but then you will consider what different Things the Boy has said; he has declared several Times, he did not believe he did it designedly, and according to what the Surgeons say, it is not probable to me, that this Would could be given in the Situation he says Mr Annesley was in; for the Wound goes upwards, and if he held his Gun as the Boy has said, the Wound could not have been as it is: Besides, that he is expressly contradicted in the Fact itself by old Redding, who swears he saw the Gun go off, and that it was hanging by Mr Annesley's Side. Gentlemen, as I said before, the Question you are to consider of, is, whether this is Manslaughter, or Chance-Medley in Mr Annesley; for as to Redding, he must certainly be acquitted; and as to Murder, I cannot think there is any Evidence to make Mr Annesley guilty of that; but as there was some hot Blood there may be Reason to consider, whether it is not Manslaughter; on the other Hand, if Mr Annesley was carrying his Gun by his Side, and it went off accidentally, then it will be Chance-Medley.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, 30th June, I was at Mr. Wilderapen's, Railway Inn, at Feltham—I went there about 11.30, and left about 12.30—I saw Merrick, and a man named Ham, drinking there—they asked me to drink, and I drank with them—I left about 12.15, with my wife, to go home—I stopped a minute or two outside—I heard a bother between the prisoner and a man named Bushnell—I turned round to go back—before I got to them he knocked Bushnell down—I said "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to knock an old man down like that, and old enough to be your father"—he said "You can take it up, if you like"—I said "I don't wish to"—he turned round, and knocked me down—I got up, and we had a bit of a <hi rend="italic">scrummage</hi>—we both fell—we got up, and he said "I will have no more of this," and he drew back 3 or 4 yards away from me—my wife halloaed out "He has got a knife"—he came towards me; I tried to get away, and Ham knocked me down on my right side—the prisoner ran in, and stabbed me on the left his directly I fell—I halloaed out "I am stabbed!"—I put my hand down to my thigh, and there was blood running down—Bushnell and my wife helped me up—she was close by, the whole time—the prisoner stood a little way off after he stabbed me—I am sure he is the man that struck me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been to the review at Bushey Park that day—I went after dinner-time, with another man—we got there about 3 o'clock—after we came away, I went home, and went out again—we called at one public-house, not more—I had had two or three pots of <hi rend="italic">half-and-half</hi> that</p>

I was called in at 12.30, on the morning of 1st July, to see the prosecutor—he was suffering from an incised wound on the upper part of the left hip—it was about half an inch deep, and not more than half an inch in length—a knife of this description would inflict such a wound—he lost a large quantity of blood—I attended him for ten or twelve days—he is quite well now.</p>

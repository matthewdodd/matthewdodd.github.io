                  </hi>. I am a confectioner of 37, St. Martin's Lane—the prisoner came to me about the end of September, or beginning of October, and said "Do you want your place insured?" I said "Yes;" he said "I am an agent to the Hand in Hand Insurance Company," and he showed me forms similar to these—he inspected the place, and said there would be rather a heavy charge for the insurance, because of the carriage builder's at the back, and that it was rather difficult to insure a place like mine, because, in case of fire in the carriage builder's, my place would be dangerous—he said "I will take it, and I shall charge you 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the first instalment, and then I shall make a report to the Hand in Hand, and get the surveyor of the company to come and survey the place, and if he does not like to insure it I shall return your money, and I will come to see you next week"—I then paid him 15a and he gave me a deposit receipt—I believed his statement—ho came the next week and said "Well, has the surveyor been to survey the place 1"—I said "No, I have seen no one"—he said "Well, it's all right, write to the surveyor, I'll make it right Now you will have to pay me the balance, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I paid him</p>

Do you know any friends who would wish to be insured?" I said "Yes, I have a friend in Euston Road, Mr. Alessandri," and gave him his address—I have not had my policy—I did not go to the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Hand in Hand office, New Bridge Street, Blackfriars—we have several agents—persons desiring to become agents have to fill up certain forms, giving references, &amp;c., which would be handed to the directors to consider—it is part of my duty to see that these forms go through the ordinary process, and if the directors approve they are sent back to me, and I, upon their direction, appoint' or decline to appoint the applicants as agents—I do not know Fox—he has never applied to become an agent, and I have never received directions to appoint him an agent or to refuse to appoint him—I know the names and addresses of our authorised agents now and in September and October last—he was not then an agent and has never been such since my acquaintance with the office—I have received no complaint about a proposed insurance of Mr. Brentini, and knew nothing of it until these proceedings—I have never received the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Brentini or the prisoner, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in respect of Alessandri's premises—I knew nothing of either of those transac<lb></lb>tions or of the prisoner until I received this letter from Alessandri on 7th September.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 27th December I was assisting at the North Pole public-house—the prisoner came in for half a gallon of ale, and put down a shilling—Miss Sheffield took it up, tried it with her teeth, and it bent—it was given back to the prisoner, who put down another—Miss Sheffield tried that with her teeth, and it was bad—the prisoner then put down another, and that was bad also—they were handed back to the prisoner, who some time afterwards came back with a good half-crown, and paid for the ale—we took five bad shillings the night before, and Mr. Sheffield gave me three of them to give to the constable—he could not find the other two—they bent easily, and I said to the prisoner, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself"—she said, "What has it to do with you?"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did she bite the shillings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because we had a suspicion of the woman—she was not sure, because they looked so good—five men and five women were with the prisoner on Boxing night, dancing in front of the bar—I only know John Ward by his coming to the police-court—I do not recollect the prisoner ordering a quart of fourpenny ale on boxing night, and paying with a florin; but I cannot swear she did not—I did not give her a bad shilling in change—I gave change to nobody—I was not selling beer, only fetching it for the boy—I only waited on three young chaps—I had nothing to do behind the bar.</p>

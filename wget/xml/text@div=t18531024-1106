                  </hi>. I am brother to Mr. Joseph William Schles<lb></lb>singer; he occupies a house, No. 30, Osborne-terrace, Clapham-road. On 19th and 20th Sept., my brother was absent from home—I was not left to take care of the house with the servant; 1 was residing in the house—the prisoner was the only servant—I think she had been in the service of my brother about four months—I am in the habit of leaving in the morning, coming to the City, and returning home at night—on Monday morning I left at past 9 o'clock; I returned near 7 o'clock—I did not find the servant at home—she came borne about half past 10 o'clock—she made an excuse that she was sorry she left the house before I came home, but her brother was taken ill, and she went to him in the house of a butcher; he had met with an accident—I do not recollect that she gave me the name of the butcher—on Tuesday night, when I got home, I heard a conversation in the hall, a male and a female voice—I did not then say anything to the prisoner on that account—after the robbery was committed, I spoke of Tuesday night; she</p>

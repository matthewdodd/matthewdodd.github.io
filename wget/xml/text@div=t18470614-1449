I am a labourer, and live in Orchard-street, Poplar—I went to Mr. Lake's wine-vaults, on the 1st of June—I changed a sovereign—I believe I got four half-crowns, a crown piece, and some small coin to the amount of the money—after I had received it from the landlord I was going to treat William Everett with whom I had been living—I put the change into my pocket, and soon as I had done that I felt a person come and put their</p>

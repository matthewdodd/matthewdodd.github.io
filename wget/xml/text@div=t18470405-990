                  </hi> I am master of the workhouse of the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. The prisoner was a pauper belonging to that parish—he had been about three years maintained in the parish workhouse—he had been during that time employed as a messenger, and for that he had extra ration allowed him—I had given him checks to take to the Bank, with written instructions how to bring the money, and he had done it repeatedly—On the 24th of February, about ten o'clock in the morning, I gave him a check for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—this it is (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—is is signed by three of the guardians of the poor of the parish—I gave him written instruction in what notes he was to obtain it, and I told him verbally—I said "You have your in<lb></lb>structions in the bag with the check, bring six 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi> notes, four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi> notes, and a penny, and don't be long"—he said, "I won't be long"—he left the house and did not return—inquiries were made about him, and I accompanied the officer in pursuit of him—I found him the next day in a public-house at Acton, seven or eight miles from town—I said, "John George, you are the man we were looking for"—he said, "Here I am"—I said, "What has become of the money?"—he said, "I have lost it"—I said, "It is very extraordinary you did not obtain the money as I instructed you; you obtained gold for it"—he said, "I have done it—I have done it"—there was a sovereign found on him, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 10½<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in silver and copper—he was brought to the police station and again searched, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 4½<hi rend="italic">d</hi> found on him—he was very abusive and very violent—I was obliged to assist the officer before he would allow himself to he searched.</p>

I am an old man; I shall not want it long; and those that have got it, it will do them good after I am gone."—I have found he changed a sovereign to buy this new hat which was on his head.</p>

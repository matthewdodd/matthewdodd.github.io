                  </hi>. I am an innkeeper and coach-proprietor, and live at Banbury, in Oxfordshire. I saw the prisoner at Banbury on Thursday evening the 10th of March—i had some slight knowledge of him before, but was not acquainted with him—I first saw him under the gateway of the old George public house, at Banbury, on Thursday evening—I was led to him by a young man whom I had employed to sell five horses in the market—he took me to the prisoner—he said he was about making a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> for our of my horses, for this one, if I was agreeable—I said I should like to see the <hi rend="italic">chop</hi>—I said to my young man, "Is this the gentleman you mean?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You are about to make a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> for four of my horses, I under<lb></lb>stand?"—he said, "Yes, if you are agreeable"—I then said I could not make out exactly which four he meant, and went into the stable to see the horses—the young man had got one which I had told him not to being—I said I should not part with that one, but if he thought well I would make the bargain with the other four—he said he would not have that taken away, for it was the best of the lot, and he could not think of parting with his horses without I gave more money—i said I understood the horse was a <hi rend="italic">roarer</hi>, and I had rather not <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> with him—he said mine was worn out, and his was very valuable—I said we might as well go into the house, which we did, and there we made a bargain for four of my horses and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this one of his—I gave him my four horses and a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the horse he had—I asked him who he got it from, and whose it was—he said it was a gentlemen's horse and the gentleman had used it in a four-wheeled carriage—he did not say the bought it of him—I asked it the horse had not been in coach-harness before—he said no, it was a gentlemen's horse, and had been in a four-wheeled carriage and the only reason he sold it was because he did not like to hear it make a noise up the hills—I said, "If your horse is all right, he is worth a good deal of money; but my young man says he is a roarer"—I told him twice I had rather not have any thing to do with it, but if it was all right, it was a valuable horse—he said the gentleman's sole reason for selling it was that it was a roarer, and he did not like to hear it make a noise up the hills—i gave him a check on purpose that I should get his name, and I wrote down the name he gave me at the time, and have it here—he said his name was, I believe, "John Brown, Byfield, Near Oakingham, Berks"—I am not quite certain of his Christian name—I said, "Oakingham is in Rutlandshire, is it not?"—he said, "No, in Berkshire"—I got the horse home—I suspected it was not a roarer, and thought he could not have got it honestly, said and I came up to London to Smith fields—I got there on the next Friday week, and saw the prisoner there—I told him the horse had proved a stolen one—he said, "the devil he had; then of course you must have your money again"—he wanted to know how it was found out—I said, "A gentleman's servant has been to my house, and owned it"—I do not know what an<lb></lb>swer he made—i said, "Of course you know who you had him of"—he said he bought him of a man as he was returning from Henley fair—I said, "You know the man, do you not?"—he said, "Not well enough I am afraid;" but he said, if I could go home with him, he could find the man he bought him of—the wished to call me aside afterwards—I said, "What have you done with my four horse?"—he said he sold them</p>

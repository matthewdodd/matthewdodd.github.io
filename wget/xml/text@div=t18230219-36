             very well. I saw him at the house, on Sunday, the 26th of January, at half past one o'clock in the day; he spoke disrespectful things of the prisoner there. I saw the prisoner a few minutes after Durham left the house, and I told him what Durham had said; he said he was a good for nothing man, and had he been there he would have given him a good hiding; but if he did, he would take the law of him, and therefore it was better to leave him alone. I saw him and Durham in the street, opposite the house that night, about a quarter past eleven o'clock. It was a very light night and frosty, and there were lumps of hard snow on the ground. I could hear distinctly what they said. The prisoner said, to the deceased,</p>
               <p>"What have you been saying disrespectful of me;" Deceased said,</p>
               <p>"What I like;" he repeated this several times. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I would give you a good hiding, but you would take the law of me." The deceased answered no, I would not, and immediately took off his hat, and laid it on a lump of snow, and put himself in a fighting attitude; they began to fight together. I think Durham hit the first blow in the prisoner's face; the prisoner then struck him - Durham fell on the stones on the opposite side, where the snow was swept; he got up, took his hat and hurried away towards his father's. He was not so stout as the prisoner, but about his height.</p>

               <p>"George what have you to say against me, that you go backbiting me behind my back, if you had any thing to say, why not say it to my face;" The deceased answered, he would say what he liked, and added</p>

               <p>"If I do you'll take the law of me;" he said, I'll take no law whatever, he took off his hat, and put himself in a fighting attitude. The prisoner buttoned his great coat, and they fell too fighting, they came to a close and Bingley threw Durham a cross-buttock, with his head on the pavement. The stones were all pebbles, and very sharp; he was thrown on the pavement with violence; he was quite thrown up, his feet were a yard and a quarter off the ground, when his head touched the pavement; he rose his head from the pavement, and I saw the blood trickle down from the wound; he got up and put himself again in a fighting attitude; they set too and he received a blow; he then took up his hat and walked off towards his father's, saying he would fight no more. Bingley went towards home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long after this did the man die - A. Several days. I often seen him about the streets afterwards, smoking his pipe and drinking.</p>

            . I am the father of the deceased - he came home on Sunday, between half past ten and eleven o'clock; his head was injured. I went with him to the hospital; he walked, and on Tuesday, I took him again in a coach; he returned and went again, on Thursday in a coach. He died in the hospital. He told me on the evening he received the blow, that Bingley had given him his death blow, and said there was no chance of his life; and that he had received his death blow. I considered him at that time in a dying state; there was not the least hopes of him from the first moment I saw him. He asked me to go with him to see if the man could be apprehended. He walked to the hospital two or three times.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London-hospital. I first saw Durham about one o'clock in the night the accident happened. I examined his head, and found a severe contusion, but it was not cut. I suppose it to be caused by a fall. I had no apprehension of immediate death, nor was he under apprehension of immediate death; he wished me to sign a certificate of his danger, in order to apprehend the man.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the hospital. On Thursday, the 30th of January, I saw the deceased and attended him till his death, which took place on Tuesday, the 4th of February. He came to the hospital to remain, on Sunday evening, the 2d of February. I examined his head after his death; there was a contused wound which might have been done by a blunt instrument, or by falling against some hard substance - there was apparently inflammation of the brain, which I suppose to have been caused by the wound, which produced his death.</p>

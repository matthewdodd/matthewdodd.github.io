                  </hi>. I am a foreman to the St. Katherine Dock Company. I was passing along the floor of the warehouse letter C on the 9th July, and saw the prisoner rise from a stooping position between two tea-chests—I passed along the floor, and saw a chest of tea disturbed, which had been previously opened, but took very little notice of that; however, I followed him—he ran to the staircase to get some hoops—he returned again, and then I saw the chest was disturbed—I reported it to Bull, the warehouse-keeper, who took him on one side—Bull said, "I suspect you have tea about you"—he said, "I have"—Taylor, the superintendent, came and searched him, and found a bag containing twelve ounces of tea concealed between his legs—I compared the tea with the chest near which I saw him stooping—it appeared to correspond in quality.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a superintendent of the police in the Dock. I requested the prisoner to deliver up the tea he had about him—he undid his small-clothes and drawers—I saw a string fastened to his waistband, and pulled out the bag containing the tea—I asked him how he could be guilty of such an act—he refused to answer me—I compared the tea with that in the chest—it was the same, in my judgment.</p>

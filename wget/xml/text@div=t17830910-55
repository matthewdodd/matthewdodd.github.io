               <p>Prisoner's Council. My Lord, as this is a capital offence, it should appear by the best evidence, and it states in the indictment that he was a seaman, on board the King's ship.</p>
               <p>Court. I look upon it, that if you have the Captain of the ship, who speaks of his own knowledge to the sailors on board, that certainly is good evidence; if it is not the best evidence if the Captain could not be here, then to be sure the ship's books should be produced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish you would ask Mr. Chorley, whether he did not forgive the man that took me there; I never received a copper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chorley. I paid the money into the prisoner's own hands, I told him, I suspected him, I had him take care what he was about, for it was death.</p>

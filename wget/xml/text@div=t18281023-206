            . On the 6th of October, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners running across the fields, from the prosecutor's, about thirty yards from his house: I thought something was not right, and stopped them - I found the sheets on Doughty; I asked them what they had got and Doughty said they had some table-cloths; I asked where they lived, and they both said at Hoxton - Cummings did not say anything about the sheets or tablecloths; Doughty then said his mother had borrowed the table-cloths when she had company - I asked where, and he said in Gray's Inn-lane; I went there, and they knew nothing about them; I took both the prisoners into custody - I do not recollect that Cummings said any thing about them: they both said they lived at Hoxton.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>CUMMINGS' Defence. I was coming across the fields, and met my fellow-prisoner - he said he was going with two table-cloths to Mount Pleasant, and asked me if I would take a walk - I said Yes.</p>
               <p>DOUGHTY'S Defence. I had been at Hoxton, looking for work; I met a man in the fields, who gave me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230085"></xptr>sheets, and asked me to take them to Mount Pleasant; I met this prisoner, and asked him to go with me - he laughed at me, and said I had been made a fool of; I said I did not care.</p>

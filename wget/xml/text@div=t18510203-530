                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Nicholls, a dock Iabourer, of Chapman-street, St. George's-in the-East—I am a tailoress, and work for Mr. Robinson, in the Commercial-road. On 12th Oct., about half-past ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, I sent my daughter with a bundle containing two coats, tied up in a yellow and blue handker<lb></lb>chief, to Mr. Robinson—I had been in the habit of sending her there for the last seven years—she came back with a policeman, about two o'clock—the coats were worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they belonged to Mr. Robinson—he gives me out the goods to make up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter of the last witness—she sent me with a parcel, containing two coats, to Mr. Robinson in Oct., tied in a blue and yellow handkerchief—I left my mother's about half-past ten o'clock; and as I was going along Lower Chapman-street the prisoner came to me and said, "Are you going to Robinson's?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "I am going to Robinson's almost directly, come along with me"—I went with her up Catharine-street, and round by the London Hospital—we then went up another street, where there was a lot of cows and cow-barns—she took me to the top of that street, and told me to go down another street, and at the bottom of it I should see a white milk-house, where I was to get five coats, and to bring them to her—she said she worked for Robinson's, and was going to take them there—I gave her my bundle, as she said my two coats and her five coats would be too heavy for me—she said she would wait for me—I went to look for the white milk-house; I could not find it, and returned to where I left the prisoner, and she was gone, and my bundle too—I cried—a policeman came up and took me to the station—I described the prisoner—I saw her again in the cell in Worship-street—there were about six persons besides her—she was not pointed out to me—I knew her directly.</p>

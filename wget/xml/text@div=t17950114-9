               <p>Q. How long had you left the shop before they were taken? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alarmed with any noise? - Very great noise; the windows were broke, I took the candle and went into the shop.</p>

That night I looked and I missed nothing but the guts of an old watch. As I was at work on Saturday I missed one of the watches; I happened to think of it, I recollected that I hung up such a watch in the window, on Thursday, and I never saw it when I took them down at night, and after that I missed another on Saturday, and the third I missed on Monday.</p>

               <p>I am a militia man; a private in the same company with the prisoner. The prisoner came to my house on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what Saturday night it was? - No, I cannot give an account of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how long ago? - I have been in prison three weeks. About a month ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you an accomplice? Did you go with him? - Yes. He came down to my house on Saturday night for his shirt; my wife used to wash for him, he came for his shirt to put on a Sunday, he had a watch in his pocket. I said to him, you have a watch in your pocket; he said he had, he could fell me one, with that I asked him to let me look at it; in consequence of which he brought down to me on the Sunday following a green shagreen case watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again if you was to see it? - I did not take any particular notice. (Shewn the shagreen case watch.) This is very much like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be like it? - Yes, I do. After he brought it down on Sunday. I did not like it, with that he made answer and said, I have got another, with that he fetched the other down, which I looked at; I made answer and said, sure enough, you have not stole them? you could not come by them honestly. Honestly, says he, what do you mean by that? I should not have thought of that; with that he left them at my house on Sunday for me to take my choice, if I was a mind to have them; they were there on Sunday, and on Monday night when I told him I would not have any thing to do with them, I was afraid he did not come honestly by them. On Tuesday I told him to come down and take them away, they should not be there; with that he came down and seemed very uneasy, with that he takes them and says, I will go and hide them; with that I walks along with him down to the barn, about a quarter of a mile from town, which he went in and asked me to lend him my bavonet, which he took from my scabbard, and scrapes a hole and buried them, and says, they would not be found there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the road to Cowley? was it in that part particular? - Yes, it was on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in West's barn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it by that name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from town? - About a quarter of a mile, it may be a little more, I cannot say for that. After he had buried them he begged I would not say any thing about them. He then told me he had stole them from a watch maker's in town; that he walked backwards and forwards twenty times before he could find an opportunity, and that when he found an opportunity he broke the glass with a stick, and took out the watches, and I told the serjeant of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the serjeant? - Because I thought it was more prudent to let the serjeant know of it, because I was afraid I should get into the wrong of it.</p>
               <p>Q.You told the serjeant of your own accord? - Yes.</p>

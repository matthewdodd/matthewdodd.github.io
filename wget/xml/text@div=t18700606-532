                  </hi>. On 14th May I went to Elham Street, Borough, about 6.30 a.m., with Inspector Fox, Pether, Marsh, and other officers—the street door was opened—Marsh opened it by a string, and Pether forced open the parlour door—we entered the room and found the prisoner in bed—she said "What is the matter, who is there?"—I said "My name is Branoan, I received instructions from the solicitors to the Mint to look after you as a dealer in counterfeit coin; we come here with a search warrant, signed by the Magistrate at Southwark Police Court"—she turned round partly on her face, and I saw Marsh struggle with her at the head of the bed—he afterwards picked up the pocket<lb></lb>book off the floor at the head of the bed and handed it to me—she said "I did not put that bad money there"—I said "Wait, we will see whether it is bad first"—I opened it, it contained eight florins and six shillings, all counterfeit, with paper between each—Pether and Marsh removed the bid, and Marsh gave me a second parcel,</p>

               <p>two half-crowns, four florins, and ten shillings—I said "These are bad, you will have to account for the possession of them"—she said "Somebody must have put them there"—no one else was in the room.</p>

I was with Brannan—when he spoke to the prisoner she turned round to take the pillow, and I seized her by both arms; at that time I saw a parcel drop from the pillow—I picked it up and handed it to Brannan—I saw Pether remove the bed and take some coins out of a dirty rag—she said that some one must have put it there.</p>

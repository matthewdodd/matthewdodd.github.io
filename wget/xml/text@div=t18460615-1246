                  </hi>. I am fourteen years of age—I assist the waiter at the North and South American Coffee-house, in the City—on the 28th of May I was sent for change for two sovereigns—my master's name is Edwin Smith—when I went out I saw the prisoner iu Thread needle-street—she came and said, "Did you drop a Ad. bit?"—I said, "No"—I had And. in copper in my pocket—she then said, "I thought you did"—she said, "What is your name?"—I said, "White"—she said, "I thought I knew you; how is your mother?"—I said, "Pretty well, thank you"—she said, '* Have yoo not a sister ill?"—I said, 'She has not been very well"—she said, "I have got some beads for her; how many pockets have you got?"—I said, "Six"—she said, "Just as many as there are beads"—she said, "Here is 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for your sister and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for you"—I was then opposite Mr. scman's, and I said I was going to get change for two sovereigns—she said, "Let me tie your</p>

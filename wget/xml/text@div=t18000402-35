             sworn. - I am a watchman at Mr. Coope's: On the 19th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I heard somebody coming out of the sugar house; then I saw the prisoner set down the bag of sugar against a lamp in the yard; then I saw him cover it over with dung; after that, he went to the kitchen, and stopped there a little while, I cannot say how long, I suppose four or five minutes; then somebody rung the bell, and he came out of the kitchen and opened the gate; I do not know who it was, but they talked together for some time, I did not hear what they said; after this, the prisoner laid hold of the bag, and took it up from the ground; I then laid hold of the prisoner, and sent for an officer; the last witness took the bag, and delivered it to me, I have had it ever since; it is the same bag.

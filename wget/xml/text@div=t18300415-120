             - in 1828 we lived in Whitecross-place, Finsbury; I know my husband was indebted to John Winterborn - I first saw the prisoner about June or July, 1828; he came to our house, and said he called for a debt due to Mr. Winterborn; he had a book once when he called - he came several times; in March 1829, in consequence of receiving a paper, I went before the Commissioners of the Court of Requests, in Osborne-street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner there - he demanded the utmost the Court had jurisdiction to order, which was 1l. 19s. 6d., for Winter-born; I told the Commissioners I wanted to know where Winterborn was, and that Mr. Sanders would not tell me - he did not tell me then; the Commissioners asked if I acknowledged the debt; I said I did - they said no one could take it out of Court but Winterborn, and directed me to pay it; I paid two half-crowns by instalments, and paid the rest to Wellan afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How came the Commissioners to say nobody could take it out of Court but Winterborn? A. Because I wished to see him - the prisoner had demanded it for eight or nine months before I was summoned; I attended the Court for my husband.</p>

            . I am a clerk of the Court of Requests, Osborne-street, for the Tower Hamlet. On the 2nd of January the prisoner applied at the office to take out some money; I asked for his ticket; he gave me a reference to a book in which the entry was made - he said the money had been paid in for

            ; I asked if the plaintiff was in the office - he said he was waiting; on referring to the book, according to his direction, I told him the whole debt and costs were paid, and amounted to 2l. 2s. 1d., together - I wrote a receipt, and told him it was ready; he called out, "John Winterborn, come forward and sign the receipt" - a man came forward from a number of people up to the counter; I said, in the prisoner's hearing, "Is your name John Winterborn?" - he said Yes; I handed him the receipt on a two-penny stamp, and said to him, "Is this your debt" - he said Yes, and signed the receipt, and then drew back among the crowd; I took up the receipt, and placed on the counter 2l. 1s. 7d., deducting 6d. the Court fee - the prisoner took up the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known the prisoner as being concerned in that Court before? A. He calls himself an agent or collector of debts - I cannot say whether it was, or was not, Winterborn who signed the receipt; I have known the prisoner in the habit of receiving debts for persons before - they are frequently received by collectors or agents.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Is it the custom of the Court to pay money to any body but the plaintiff? A. No; unless the plaintiff comes to sign the book it is not customary, except by order of the Commissioners, then it may be paid to any body.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it usual for collectors or agents that are known, to receive debts? A. Never, unless by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150065"></xptr>direction of the Court while they are sitting. The consent of the Court would appear on the books; my book is not here - when we take a stamp receipt, the book is not signed; I should pay on production of a power of attorney, but not without a legal instrument - we have no jurisdiction out of the Tower-hamlet.</p>
               <p>Q. The words "Tower-hamlet" are scratched out of this receipt - who was that done by? A. I do not know - I believe they were not struck out when it was signed; I wrote it - it is customary sometimes to write it on receipts; it denotes the jurisdiction of the Court - those words were not on the receipt at the time it was signed; it was an cmission - it is not always written; it must have been put in, I think, after the receipt was signed, because it was supposed not to be so correct - I think I put the words in after it was signed; I know I did on re-consideration - I do not know exactly when I put it in; I first observed it struck out two or three days ago - it has been in the custody of Mr. Laing, the attorney; I do not know when it was delivered to him - before he had it, it was in a drawer in the office, which the clerks had access to in office hours; I keep the key - I wrote in the words "Tower-hamlet" since the prisoner has been in custody, as I conceived it was an omission on my part before; I did not do it to injure the prisoner - sometimes it is omitted and sometimes put in; I do not know who struck it out.</p>

Three or four months since I saw Blyth in Cornhill, about seven o'clock in the morning, coming from the top of Cornhill with a barrel—I said, "God bless me, where are you going so early in the morning?"—he said he was carrying this barrel to the New England, and if I chose to take it he would give it me to carry—I consented to carry it, and he brought me down to Finch<lb></lb>lane, not far from the Baltic coffee-house—he left me. under a gateway, and bid me wait there till he came back with the direction—I did so—he returned, and desired me to go to Mr. Howard's, in Tabernacle-square—he gave me a paper—I went to Mr. Howard, who keeps a beer shop, and delivered the paper and barrel—I came back, and Blyth gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me what he said—I said the gentleman behind the counter said it was all right—while I was under the gateway I looked at the barrel, and saw some bottles in it—I cannot tell whether they were empty or full, but it was very weighty.</p>

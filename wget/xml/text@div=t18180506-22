Next day, I collected the monies stated in the indictment, in her presence, at tea-time, and put them into a drawer in a chest, which I did not lock-this was on Saturday. She said she wanted to remain there till Monday. On Monday, when I came home, I found she was gone out. I heard her say she should return between six and seven o'clock-she never returned. I went to the drawer that evening, and missed the 38l. and my pocket-book; she left some clothes behind her.</p>

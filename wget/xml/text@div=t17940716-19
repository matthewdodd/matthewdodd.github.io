               <p>Prisoner. I happened Saturday morning to be walking to Whitechapel, and I stopped at this house, where I never was before, and I asked this young woman which was the nearest-way to the necessary; and she conveyed me backwards; coming out I saw the apron laying and took it up, not knowing who it belonged to; this gentlewoman's aunt was in the parlour or kitchen; I turned round and says, I have got an apron, if it is your's, take it. Says she, you must stop, I must send for a constable; says she, I command these two men to stop that man. Says I, I will stop, and I will thank you for a pint of porter: Says she, I will draw none. I stopped till the constable came, and he asked me what I meant to do about this affair? I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160032"></xptr>I did not know; Says he, will you go for a soldier? I said, I had no objection to serve his majesty; and he takes me before a justice, and I was committed.</p>

               <p>Court to Bowyer. Did he hold this apron openly and publickly so that any body might see it, or was it concealed? - It was concealed in the back part of his breeches; his breeches were not buttoned when I saw him, he could not button them with the apron; he said the apron stuck to him.</p>

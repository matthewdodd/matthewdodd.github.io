            . On the 18th of January I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of my room. At about half after eight in the evening, I went down stairs on an errand; I returned in about three minutes; as I came up stairs I heard my room door pulled to; I looked up and saw the prisoner coming out of the room.</p>
               <p>Did you know him? - No; he was quite a stranger to me. He went up the second pair of stairs. My room is on the one-pair. I saw a bundle under the flap of his coat. I went into my room, and missed the sheet; I had left three hanging on the line; one was gone. I ran down to the landlord of the house, and said there had been thieves in my room. He came out and stopped the prisoner as he came down.</p>
               <p>Had he the bundle then? - No; it was left upon the two-pair-of-stairs. He said he wanted a washerwoman. He was carried to the watch-house, and the landlord went up and fetched the bundle down.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was examined? - No.</p>

               <p>I keep the house where the prisoner lodges. On the 18th of January, Mrs. Ray came down to me and said there were thieves in the house. I went to her assistance. I saw the prisoner coming down stairs. I stopped him and took him into the parlour. The lodgers up two pair of stairs cried out; I thought there was another thief; I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say what he came into the house for? - He said he wanted one Mrs. Smith, a washerwoman. There is no such person lodges in the house. I went up stairs and found a sheet, a cloak, and a pincloth loose on the landing-place of the two-pair-of stairs. When I brought them down the prisoner said he was innocent.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had gone with you there - A. My brother and my father. There were several boys playing with me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father leave you there - A. Yes. While I was at play, a man told me to spin my top.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that man if you were to see him. Look round about, and see if you see him - Yes, I do. It is the prisoner at the bar; he had on the same dress as now, only a little apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you to spin your top what did you do - A. I could not do it myself; I gave it to another boy to spin it. He then came to me, and said, if you will come along with me I will give you a goldfinches nest and a mouth organ. He took me to Tothill-fields; my brother went with me, and another little boy. He asked my brother to go along with him; he told him if he would go along with him he would give him a bird's nest and a cage and a mouth organ. When I got into Tothill-fields, he told me to pull off my boots, to run round the cricket ground, and my brother and the other little boy. I said I would not pull my boots off; he said I should. Then he put his hand to my collar, and laid me down on my face. He laid his elbow the pole of my neck; he turned up my feet, and cut off my half boots with a clasp knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the boots fastened before he cut them - A. They were laced up and tied, and when he got up he said he would be d - d if I should not have the boots again, and if I was to meet any man I was to say he was my father; he then said I was to run round the cricket ground, and I was to have my boots again after I had ran round the cricket ground. I run, and the other boys run with me.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were running what became of the prisoner - A. The prisoner told me if I met any gentleman I was to tell them that the prisoner was my father, and he would be d - d if I should not have my boots again, and while I was running he went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go off - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what he did with the half boots after he took them off - A. He put them in his apron, and then he kept on trying to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say anything to him about his wishing to get away - A. No.</p>

            , SEN. I am the father of the two little boys that have been examined. I took my children to the park on the 27th; I took them to the Birdcage walk, opposite Queen-square gate. I staid with them there scarce five minutes, and I left them there. While I was staying there I heard the prisoner come up and ask one of the children to spin his top. I heard him; I did not see him at the first. On hearing him speak to the children it induced me to look round. When I looked round I observed the prisoner speaking to the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that induce you to take particular notice of his person - A. It did. I had no suspicion of the man. I went off with a child in my arms not a twelvemonth old. I noticed the dress of the prisoner: it was identically the same as to the jacket, but he had a short apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you hear what had happened - A. I went round with the child, and walked. I returned to my own house in about an hour and a half, No. 9, Upper Crown-street, about half past eleven o'clock. When I came to the door I knocked; my wife opened the door; she appeared in agitation, and said, your child has been robbed. I asked, which of them; she said, William. I called the child forward. The child was there. I received information of him. I went to Queen-square office, which was then in the same street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270036"></xptr>Q. What parish are you in - A. In St. Margaret's, Westminster. They directed me to go with the children to the same spot where they had been robbed. I went with the children, and they directed me to the field where they had been robbed, to Tothill-fields; when I came there, I found the deputy ranger had seen something of the transaction. I could find no trace of the prisoner then. I gave my children direction if they saw him again, one was to watch him, and the other to come and give me information. That was to my own two children.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this - A. Monday, the 27th. On Tuesday, the 28th, I desired my children to go into Great Russell-street. Covent Garden; as they were going down Suffolk-steps, into St. James's-park, the eldest ran against the prisoner. I received the information from the eldest child. I pursued after the prisoner into King-street, and in Frederick-street I saw the prisoner standing at the bottom of Frederick-street; I made towards him; the instant the prisoner saw me making toward him, he walked off; he was going a quick pace; he looked over his left shoulder, saw me coming after him, he then ran off; as soon as he run I cried stop thief; the prisoner cried stop thief. I then ran after him; seeing the prisoner getting a head of me, I desired the sentry at the gateway, to drop his musquet across the gateway, so as to prevent his running through, which the soldier did, but the prisoner got through, and got into the park, and ran towards the corner of the Treasury-gardens, the wall where another sentry stands; I still crying stop thief; the prisoner continuing the same. He then made towards the Horse Guards; when I cried out stop thief, stop that man, that is the thief; I then saw a soldier move, and seized him; the soldier was going on sentry. As soon as I saw the prisoner was seized I desisted from running, being out of breath, until I came up to him. When I came up I desired they would let the children come up to see if it was the same man when the eldest came up, I asked him if this was the man that took his half boots, in the hearing of the prisoner; the soldier had him fast. When I mentioned the word to him, as soon as the child came up, he said, papa, that is the man that had my half boots. I desired the soldier to take him to Queen-square office with me; the soldier refused. I took him by the collar, and led him as far as Suffolk-steps, there I gave him up into the hands of an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were shewn the place in Tothill-fields - A. Yes, I was shewn the place where it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the high road - A. No, it was in a grass field, by the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it to the road - A. I cannot exactly say how near it was to the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that you are speaking of - A. Yes; I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw in Bird-cage-walk, and the man that you afterwards seized in the manner you have described - A. Yes; I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the boots since - A. No part of them; they were new boots. I had them of the maker on Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your father ask you if that was the man that had taken the boots - A. Yes; I knew him again. I am sure it is the same man.</p>

I was upon the look out from nine o'clock until near eleven; I had heard of the man while I was at breakfast at nine o'clock. About a quarter before eleven, I was looking over the garden rails; I observed a man laying down by our play ground, and three children round him; there appeared to me to be one girl, that had a white pinafore on. After they had played some time until some person was going across on the foot pavement, when the man had got a considerable distance, the child with a white pinafore got up first, then I discovered it was a boy; shortly after, the two boys got up, and the man with them; he went behind them, and placed them all of a row; I discovered two of the children had no shoes on, which struck me all was not right; I waited until the children came up; I called to them for some time; they refused to come; after a short time, the biggest of the three came up, that was Mr. Westcote's boy; I asked what that man had been doing, or saying to him; he said, nothing. I said, do not tell me a story; where is your boots; he said his father had got them. I said, are you sure it is your father; he said, yes, sir, it is; with that I walked away to my own door; after that, when I came to my own door, I saw the prisoner; he went round by the Ducking-pond, and returned towards the Horse-ferry-road; I pursued him, but did not overtake him; I said to my friend, it is a trick; he pursued, and did not over take him. Afterwards I gave Mr. Wescote the particulars of every thing that I knew.</p>

            . I keep a slopseller's shop in Rosemary-lane - one shop is for women's apparel. On the 19th of July, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was present when the prisoner John Wallace came to my wife, in the women's shop, with eight pairs of stays, which he asked 26s. for; she offered 24s., which he agreed to take - I asked who was the maker; he said his mother, that his sister stitched them, and they gave them to him to hawk about the shops - I asked if he would go to his mother with me; he said Yes - we went; when he got up one pair of stairs he called Mother! the female prisoner came down, and walked thirty or forty yards with me; I asked if she was the maker of the stays - she said, "Yes, I make them, my daughter stitches them, and I give them to my son to hawk" - I then took him home to my shop; my wife gave him 24s., and he gave a receipt, in the name of Wallace - two or three days after I found his name was Murphy - on the 29th of July, about nine o'clock in the morning, he brought eight pairs of stays in a basket; I took him into the parlour, and said, "You have deceived me; your name is not Wallace, but Murphy" - he said, "No, it is Wallace;" I said, "Well, I am a headborough, and insist on knowing how you came by them;" he said, "For God's sake don't hurt me; a young man gave them to me to sell, and they came from a warehouse" - I asked where the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060175"></xptr>young man was to be found, and where the warehouse was- he gave me no answer; I gave him in charge - I had five pairs of the eight he sold me left - the daughter was tried last Tuesday.</p>

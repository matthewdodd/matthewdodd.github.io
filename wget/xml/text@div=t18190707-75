I know the prisoner, Noble, he was employed by my master to make up garments - I have known him about eleven months. On Christmas day I asked him to lend me 18 d. He said he wondered that I was without money, for it was hard to work in the vineyard without tasting the grapes. I asked him what he meant by that? he said there was plenty of things in our warehouse that I could make money of, and he would come next morning if I would give him something. He came next morning, and I gave him about six yards of velveteen - he brought me 3 s. or 4 s. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he often come to the house before your master was up - A. Yes; early in the morning. I informed him that a young woman had told me to be aware, for that she did not like a man that was loitering about our window before the shop was open; he said then he would bring

               <p>Q. Where was Noble at that time - A. He came to the door and shoved it, which was a signal that he was there; a very few minutes afterwards Brown came in with a green bag under her arm, which I had seen several times before - it belonged to Noble. I gave her the piece of mixed cloth and the kersey; she put it into the green bag, and took it out of the warehouse; I saw Noble with it in the same green bag on Fish Street-hill, about ten minutes after; I do not know what he did with it. He gave me 1 l. on account the same day; he was to give me 3 l. for the cloth and kersey. The cloth measured about forty yards, besides the kersey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or he afterwards become alarmed - A. I told him several times that I was afraid of being found out. He told me to stand my ground, for it would be better than to run away; for if I was taken up I might say I knew nothing about it. About a week after this I ran away, and went directly to Noble, in Redgate-alley, Minories; he told me to get a coach, and he would take me to Spitalfields. About a week after this, I met Brown in Whitechapel, and she went to Gravesend with me, and passed as my mother, as she said it would lull suspicion. I was to get a ship at Gravesend, and leave the country. Noble also said I had better get away, for there was a sharp look out after me. I staid there one night, then went to Chatham on Thursday, and on Friday I returned to my mother in town. I went to my master, and told his brother the whole truth - before I was taken up I confessed the whole.</p>

The cloth was worth 4 s. 6 d. a yard. I squandered the money away. I saw Noble come and push the door - I used to leave it ajar for him.</p>
               <p>Q. You moved the cloth from the shelf before he came for it - A. No.</p>

I have frequently looked at Noble, and noticed him, particularly one morning with a green bag under his arm, which created great suspicion in my mind that he was after no good.

             came to my room, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and told me he was employed by Mr. Steel the day before, that he gave him no money for his time, and he was to attend him again at half-past nine o'clock that morning; and if Mr. Steel did not give him some money to support his wife and family, he did not mind what part he was on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything else - A: He said he was after leaving a piece of cloth, two or three yards long, in possession of the prisoner's, Noble, brother; that he laid down the piece and went out for half an hour, to give him an opportunity to take it away, and when he came back he was a d - d fool, for he was not off with it, for he would not have it then to be sworn to.</p>

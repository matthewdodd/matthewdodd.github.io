                  </hi>. I am Secretary of the Statistical Department, East India Office, and live at East Sheen—on the 15th April I was dining out—a message was brought to me and I went home at 10 o'clock and found the police in possession of my house—I missed from the dining<lb></lb>room a marble clock and a musical box, and from my bedroom a port<lb></lb>manteau with clothes and other things in it which I had left open in the morning—this is a list of them—I also missed a dark grey overcoat which I think was in the bedroom—I value the whole at about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a very old rough tweed coat was, about a week afterwards, brought to me by the police—on the 7th May I went to Worship Street police-court and saw Darcy there wearing the very coat which had been hanging in my dressing-room—I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not the slightest doubt it was mine—this other coat was brought to me by the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have not been in Portsmouth for many years—I do not go to marine stores there and did not meet Withers there—the policeman brought the coat to my house—I am quite certain about it—I have no other coat like it—it was made for me by a tailor named Wyatt—I had not worn it for about a year before the robbery—before the Magistrate I said that I was not quite sure about the wrist buttons, but when I got home I asked my wife how the sleeves were made—when I was examined on the 10th May I said "The coat produced I believe is mine"—that was the tweed coat, and on the 15th I was quite certain.</p>

            . The prosecutrix came to the office, said, she had been robbed; she described his person. I went and apprehended the prisoner. I searched him; I found nothing on him, neither bank note or pocket-book. I told the prosecutrix there was another person of the same description, a person that we suspected, he had only one eye, like the prisoner; I thought she was mistaken.</p>

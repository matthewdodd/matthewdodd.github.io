               <p>of April, and there were thirty-four ewes—they were in the two-acre field—I counted them again on Wednesday morning, and one ewe was gone, marked with "N"—I found the skin at the top of another field, in the tide of the hedge, the entrails laid by it, and were warm—I have seen two legs, two shoulders, and some more mutton since, and have matched them with the skin—the knuckles came in at the right place—I bare no doubt it belonged to the skin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for on this occasion—I went into the field and saw footsteps of two persons, which lead to the end of Sweetbriar-walk, about three quarters of a mile from the field—I obtained a search-warrant, and went to Julph's house—he lives with his mother, and Price lodges there occasionally—I found the two prisoners in bed together, at least Julph was in bed, and Price at the foot of the bed, partly dressed—I searched the premises, and found in a box which was locked, two shoulders, two legs, and part of a loin of mutton—I have compared that with the skin, and am certain it belonged to it—I compared the prisoners' shoes with the footmarks in the field, and they quite matched—they are both very peculiar shoes—there was blood on the pair belong<lb></lb>ing to Price—when I took them, Price attempted to get out of window, but a man I had placed outside prevented him.</p>

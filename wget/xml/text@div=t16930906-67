The Woman of the House advised them to go out at a back-door, but they thought it not convenient, so continued in the House: At last the two Prisoners came into the House, and told the People that there was a Prize worth 500 l. in the House, for there was the greatest Rogue in England in the House, and they would endeavour to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16930906005"></xptr>do what they could to execute their Design (or words to that effect,) at last Captain Webb and Mr. Chalinor sent for a Constable, and went into the Street and took the Prisoners, but the other went off.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 376). On Monday morning, 27th March, I was employed by Messrs. Cleaver, with another policeman, to watch their premises in Earl-street, Blackfriars—they consist of a wharf, shut in with a gate, at night—they are in the iron trade—I was there at 6 o'clock in the morning, or a little before—I saw the witness Bell's pony cart there shortly after 6 o'clock, standing close to the wall—it then crossed over to the Bricklayer's Arms, on the opposite side—Bell was with it—I did not notice anybody else—while standing there a little before 7 o'clock, Thomas came off Cleaver's wharf, St. Ann's wharf, and went to the Bricklayer's Arms; in about a minute after, Palmer and Bell came out of the public house, and went down the wharf with the pony and cart—Thomas followed in about two minutes; he stationed himself at the gateway at the top of the wharf, looking up the street, apparently watching—I kept away—presently the cart came up with Palmer and Bell; I followed it to Hercules-terrrace, Westminster-road—there a labourer assisted Bell in unloading the sash weights—they put them into an empty house—Palmer began placing them in the room on the front floor—after they had unloaded, Palmer and Bell went to a public house—I then went and communicated to Mr. Cleaver what I had seen—we continued to watch the premises—I took Palmer into custody on the Friday morning—I told him I wished to speak to him respecting those sash weights he had put into an unfinished house Mr. Sutton was building—he replied, "Yes"—I said I wished to know where he got them, as I was a police officer—he said he did not know the man's name, nor yet where he lived, but it was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Blackfriars-road—I asked him what he gave for them; he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he was not a judge of those things—I asked him how long he had them; he said, "Some time"—I conveyed him to the station—I found 304 sash weights; above a ton</p>

               <p>I would have something else—I went across to the public house—I was five minutes in the Bricklayer's Arms—Thomas came over, and had some rum with us—I did not see where he came from—I took the pony and cart, and went down into the wharf to load the sash weights—Thomas came out to the gate, and there I saw him when I came out again—Sweeting helped to load, and Palmer, and some other man—as he was behind the stack he handed them to Palmer—I came over Blackfriars-bridge, and took them to some new buildings in Westminster-road, Hercules-buildings, and there we unloaded them into an empty room—Palmer was in the room, stacking them—he paid me as we went along—I had nothing to drink after we came over the bridge—I am sure Sweeting helped to load, because I took the weights out of his hand—I saw Palmer pull out a purse, and give a man something; who stood behind the stack—he turned his back at that time—my charge was half a crown; it was two hours and a half—when Palmer paid me he said, "I shall make about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the job; I shall lose my other time to-day, I shan't make above 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by this job"—when we had completed loading the iron it was about a quarter past 7 o'clock—I could not swear what time exactly it was; we could not be much more than ten minutes on the wharf.</p>

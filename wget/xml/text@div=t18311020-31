When I saw him I asked what he thought of himself; he said he was very sorry - that he had got a little drink, and went to Brighton, Worthing, and Maidstone, spent all the money, and came home quite destitute; I had a very good character with him, and believe it is his first offence, and that he is not a very strong mind - he gave himself up to the officer.</p>

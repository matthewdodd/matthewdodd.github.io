                  </hi>. I live at 57, Cleveland Street, Fitzroy Square—I am at present out of business—on the night of 15th October, at a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> after 6 o'clock, I was standing under the Waterloo Bridge, in the Waterloo Road, for shelter—an old gentleman came up to me—the pri<lb></lb>soner was standing behind with another man—they were strangers—we got into conversation, and I went into a public house with the old gentle<lb></lb>man—the prisoner and the other man followed—the prisoner produced a roll of what appeared to be bank notes, and some coins in a purse, and said he had come in for a lot of money, and had drawn 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day—he said he was a stranger in London, and had come from Yorkshire, that he had had three solicitors, and after the case was over, they had won the day for him, they asked him what he was going-to give them for their trouble be<lb></lb>sides the expense, what he was going to make them a present of—one soli<lb></lb>citor showed 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he doubled it—he gave one a guinea hat and the other a ring—the old gentleman then asked me what money I had on me—I told him I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then asked me to treat them to something—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230105"></xptr>
               <p>I did so—I pulled out my money, which was loose in my pocket, and he<lb></lb>said "Don't show your money to everybody, you don't know who is about"—the prisoner was willing to stand a bottle of port, but the old gentleman declined and said we had had quite sufficient—we then got into a lengthy conversation, and the prisoner wanted me to show so much money, and he would double it—he asked me how much I could get—he said he was going home by the 11 o'clock train to Yorkshire the following morning, and his luggage was up at the station on the platform—the old man took out some notes and coin in a purse, and the prisoner said he would double what I could show—I said "I won't show it to-night, bat I will try and get some more money by to-morrow morning"—I told him I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and by going home I could get another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the old man said "What is your watch and chain worth?" and I said I had not brought it with me—he wished me to hand him the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said "This gentleman will double it"—that was the prisoner—I said "We had far better wait till the next day, I should be able to get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. perhaps"—the old man said "Now is your time to make some money if you choose, I will be a friend to you, that man has a lot of money, and we might just as well have it as any one else"—I told him my father was a clergyman at Sunbury, and I could get some more money by the morning—I said I would write to my. father—the old man said "Don't write to him, keep it secret"—afterwards he said "All right, don't part with your money to night, don't show it, but come on the following morning to Great Portland Street, we will meet there at 9.30"—they did not say they were strangers to one another, but they appeared to be—the prisoner could hear all that was said and so could the third man—the old man said it would be a good thing for me if I could get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the next morning, so as to get it doubled, and he would lend me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note or so, in order to make more of it—I said I would be at the appointed place by the following morning at 9.30—we had something more to drink, and left the public house, and they took oaths that they would be at Great Port<lb></lb>land Street at 9.30; they crossed hands and said "So help me God I will be there"—they asked me to take the oath, but I said I would be there, and I did not take it—the prisoner then bade the old gentleman and myself good night, and he and the other man walked towards the station—the other man did not take any part in the con<lb></lb>versation, but he overheard everything that was said—I left the old gentleman by the York Road—I bade him "Good night," and watched him go down to the station and join the other two—they were in conversation and put up their hands and I thought they were showing how they took the oath together—they were under the arch—I went and spoke to a con<lb></lb>stable—he went up to them and the prisoner and the other man ran down Church Street and the old man passed me, crossed the road, and went down the other street—the constable ran down Church Street and brought back. the prisoner—I recognised him and charged him—he said he did not know me—I should say I was with them from first to last about three quarters of an hour or an hour—I am positive the prisoner was one of the men—I charged him with trying to obtain money from me.</p>

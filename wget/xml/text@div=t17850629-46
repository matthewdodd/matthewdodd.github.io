            , between five and six in the afternoon, I called for six pennyworth of rum and water in this house, and I took out my purse to pay for it; I gave him a shilling, he returned me the change, immediately a girl who sat at my left hand took the purse out of my hand, and conveyed it entirely away, I could not come at it, she passed it away in a moment by slight of hand, I never got it again; nobody was in company with me but the prisoner, she followed me without asking my consent.</p>
               <p>Did you consent, had you any conversation with her, did you give her a little rum and water? - Yes, I did, nobody was nigh her, a constable came and searched her, and it was not found, all she said to me was she swallowed it.</p>
               <p>Was not you boasting of your riches? - No, I am not a rich man, it was all I had but a few halfpence; I am a King's pilot, I came up from the ship that day, that was the money I took, and she got it all.</p>

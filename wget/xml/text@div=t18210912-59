            . I know the pocket-book which the duplicates were found in to be the prisoner's. About three months before that I slept with her, and as she was putting her pockets on it fell out - I picked it up, and opened it, there was 1 s. 1 1/2 d. in it - she took it out of my hand, and said it was like my impertinence to open her pocket-book. It was made of satin or silk, and in one side of the cover was a place for money - I saw no other pocket in it. I am certain this is it (looks at it.)</p>

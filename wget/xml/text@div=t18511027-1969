                  </hi>. I live at 3, Abbey-place, Smith-street, Hercules-buildings; my husband is a slater. I know the prisoner—he, and his father and mother, occupy an apartment in my house—I remember the policeman coming to our house to search, on the Thursday evening on which the pri<lb></lb>soner was taken—I sleep in the lower part of the house, on the ground-floor—it is but a two roomed house—I recollect perfectly well the Saturday night before that Thursday—when the prisoner came home that night we were having our supper—my husband called him, and gave him a glass of porter—it did not exceed 20 minutes after 12 o'clock when he came in—I let him in, and fastened the door afterwards—I crossed from the public-house with a pot of beer when the clock struck twelve, and it was about twenty minutes after<lb></lb>wards when he came in—I saw him go up-stairs—I handed him the candle, and fastened the door after him—the door fastens with a bolt at top and bottom—I bolted them both, and there is a spring-lock—the lock could not be opened outside without a key, but a person outside could not get in with a key, because the door was bolted—the prisoner did not come down again, because he could not get out—I saw him again on Sunday morning—he came down between 9 and 10, in his stocking-feet and his shirt-sleeves—he brought a piece of bacon on a gridiron, and asked me to cook it for him, and I did—he could not get out of the house without my hearing him—I do not sleep</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270170"></xptr>
               <p>very soundly, because I do not enjoy the best of health—a person could not come down and undo the bolts of the door without my hearing them; and if he got out, he could not get in again, because I have no street-door key—I am able to tell that the prisoner was in the house from 20 minutes past 12 till I saw him in the morning—the door was fastened in the morning as I had left it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CAARTEEN</hi>. Q. Who lives in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No one but his father and mother, and brother, and a young woman, named Flaharty, who is now in her confinement, who attends his mother, who is afflicted—the mother and the young woman sleep on the floor—the father and the two brothers sleep in the room—I am no relation to any of them—my husband is a labouring man—he works for Mr. North—he was at home that night—he saw the prisoner, and gave him a glass of porter—he saw him go out of the room—I got up from the table and gave him the candlestick—my husband was sitting at the table—when the prisoner received the candlestick he wished us good night, and went up stairs—I got up and shut the door when he went out—I did not go in their room, but J am well aware that his father and mother, Flaharty and himself, and his brother were there—Flaharty is married—her husband is a seafaring man—half-past 12 o'clock is not a late hour for me to be up on Saturday night—I have many little odds and ends to do—on Saturday night I am very often up till 1—on Monday morning my husband goes to work at 6—we sometimes go to bed at 10, and some<lb></lb>times at 11—we never go to bed leaving the street-door open—we shut it—if I do not bolt it, it has a spring-lock—I remember the night the policeman came to our house—he knocked at the door, and then <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the door, and I got up—the policeman did not enter the house without my knowledge he knocked and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the door—the door did open when he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> against it, and I momentarily got up—he had knocked at my bed-room door before I got up—he was inside the street-door before I opened my bed-room door—to the best of my knowledge that was between 10 and 11—the prisoner has been in my place going on for three months—my husband is not here, he could not leave his situation to be here—the prisoner's father and his younger brother are here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know that this was on 28th Sept.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not exactly know the day of the month—I heard the policeman say it was 28th Sept.—it was the Saturday before they came to search my house—the prisoner was mostly in the habit of coming into my room—he used to come down for a light or a pipe of tobacco.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARNOCH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your husband is at work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as a slater, for Mr. North, in the Palace, New-road—it was on a Thursday night the police<lb></lb>man came to my house—he knocked at my door, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the door against my parlour-door—he must have <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> with great force to get it open—I did not prevent his searching my place, but he did not offer to search my apart<lb></lb>ment—Ellen Flaherty is in her confinement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the night the policeman came to search your house, was your husband at home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and my two children—my outer door was not bolted then—it is not when I am not up late, because sometimes they are working later than we are—on that occasion, I went to bed and left my door unbolted, because I have no street-door-key to accommodate them with—on that Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner between 9 and 10 o'clock, in his stockings—I was up that morning about 7—my husband is at his work to-day—he has worked for Mr. North regularly for eighteen or nineteen years—he knows that I am come here for this purpose—the prisoner bad</p>

               <p>been lodging regularly at my house ever since they have been in my place, which is close upon three months—my house is a good step from Great Charlotte-street, Black friars—South-street, Hercules-buildings, is in Lam<lb></lb>beth—I suppose it would take a quarter of an hour to walk from my place to Great Charlotte-street—the prisoner is what they call a hammer-man—since he has been with me, he has been working for some master in Webber-street, but I do not know his name.</p>

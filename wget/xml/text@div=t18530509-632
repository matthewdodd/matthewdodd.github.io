                  </hi>. I am a porter to the Great Western Railway Company, at Bull's Bridge. On 4th Feb. I saw the prisoner working at the wharf—he left off work at 6 o'clock, and I about half-past 7 o'clock—there was a truck with a tarpaulin down over the hoops, on the south side of the line, across it—it was to go with the train which was to come down that night—I saw the prisoner after 6 o'clock on the side of the truck—he had a large package in his right hand, and was getting down with it—it was like this package produced—when he saw me, he dropped it by the side of the truck and ran away—I followed him across a field, and when he got some way across, and had gained ground on me, I said, "You may run, old fellow, for I know who you are"—I did not mention his name—when he got to the back of the field, I saw another man, Thomas Etherington, speak to him, but I did not hear what was said—Etherington was nearly a quarter of a mile from where the track was—he spoke to me after the prisoner had gone—I then went back to where the truck was, picked up the package, put it against the office door, and communicated with the foreman—I then took the package into the office, and we both went in and told Mr. Webber—the prisoner had no business there at all after he had left work—I saw this knife lying on the edge of the truck, and found the ropes of the tarpaulin cut—I had known the prisoner about six weeks before that, and have been accustomed to work in the same place with him—I was from five to seven yards from him when he was getting down from the trucks, and am sure it was him.</p>

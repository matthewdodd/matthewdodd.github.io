               <p>Q. What reason did he give you for selling out. - A. This is the particular reason; he said, Mr. Bartlett there is a conspiracy against you to rob you of your liberty, and they will also rob you of every shilling that you have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who had formed that conspiracy. - A. He said Mr. Bill, my own attorney, and Mr. Davis, his attorney, had agreed together to bring me in a lunatic, because they saw I was very uneasy in my mind; and at the time he told me this he made me promise not to tell; I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether any other person was in it. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. To prevent that he advised you to sell out the stock. - A. Yes; he said they were going to apply to the lord-chancellor, and they had got two men to swear at a guinea a-piece that they saw me run up and down the street naked; I said you know better than that. He says, that is no matter, I know the men that will swear it; and if they swear it, you will be kept out of the money all your life. He offered to take his oath of it that this conspiracy was formed against me.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that you sold out your stock. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you employ as your broker. - A. Mr. Richardson. I received 619 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you receive of your broker. - A. A check. Upon that I went to Mr. Boldero and Lushington, and received two three hundred pound bank notes, one of the three hundred was No. 738; I do not know the date of the other I changed; that I kept and carried to Ramsgate with me.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went to Ramsgate did you in point of fact see your wife. - A. I did no, he would not let me; he said let me have the management of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he did or not see her himself. - A. He told me that he went to the house and that he could not see her, he had seen a female servant whom he was very well acquainted with, her name was

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner advise you to then. - A. He said, now I have thought of another plan; let us go back to London again; I hear you have a son at squire Newbolt's at Fulham, and the mother loves that boy uncommonly I am told; now let us go back there, and we'll go and take him, you have a right to take him, and try and see whether he cannot prevail upon her; if not, and the mother will not be reconciled, we will tell the mother that we will carry him to America, or take and put him on board of a man of war; we shall surely make her come to then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he then come from Ramsgate, and go to Fulham. - A. Yes, we took post chaise and went to Fulham.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid all the expences. - A. I paid all the expences, he had no money.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you get to Fulham. - A. It was somewhere about the 10th of July, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon; we went first of all to the Eight Bells, then Smith said let me go in, do not you go in to the boy upon no account in the world, and if I see him I will take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave you at the Eight Bells and go. - A. Yes, I waited; when he came back he said he was gone with his master to Oxford, and that he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that go to Mr. Newbolt's yourself. - A. Yes, I was informed the boy was there, I run over several rooms in Mr. Newbolt's house, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come back to the Eight Bells to the prisoner. - A. Yes, and I attempted to run away from him, finding that he had told lies. I had not found him out before I got into a boat and made my escape from the prisoner; I was got about half way over the river, when he and a person named Gayton hailed the boat, and the boatman came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gayton was a friend of yours. - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. When the waterman came back did you join in conversation with Smith and Gayton. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Gayton stay with you. - A. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find the money in your pocket. - A. I had all the money in my pocket then.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when you came from Fulham you had all your money in your pocket. - A. I had; I took it out of my pocket and I found that they were all right in my pocket book; which I have in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was that. - A. About an hour before the prisoner and I came to London together; I was alone by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before you went to Mr. Newbolts. - A. No, it was after, I was alone then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you then see that you had the three hundred pound bank note. - A. That I did not particularly look to; I looked to see that they were all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket did you put them into. - A. The right hand outside coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. A great coat. - A. No, my close coat, I had no great coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How did the prisoner and you come from the Eight Bells, did you walk or ride. - A. We came in a hackney coach.</p>

               <p>Q. You had drank too much had not you. - A. I had not drank so much but what I could remember the greatest part of what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come to in the coach. - A.

He was going up to that part of the town, to see whether he could see my son coming from Oxford; he could not. When the prisoner was in the

               <p>Q. I believe you never see him again till he was taken in custody. - A Not till he was taken in Mr. Henson's house. The prisoner has acknowledged to me at Newgate, that he had got two hundred and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140017"></xptr> eighty pound, that he robbed me on.</p>

               <p>Q. What answer did he give. - A. Two hundred and eighty pounds, he said that is all I have got of your money left; if you will not appear against me, I will give you that.</p>

I asked him if he knew what that balance was, he said no; I told him that I had mislaid the letter, and I did not know the exact account of the balance, that I had put it down in my lower office, I would go and look for it; this was up stairs. I went down stairs and sent my clerk for a constable, I went up again to the prisoner, and told the prisoner that I could not lay my hand upon the letter, but my clerk was looking for it, I begged him to sit down, and I dare say I should find it; he said he could not stay, he had a lady ill, in a coach, and desired me to pay the balance to a Mr. Wren.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know such a person as Mr. Wren. - Yes, a publican in Cow Cross; I told him I must have his authority, and begged him to write it; he began to write the authority, he did not finish it, but begged that I would write it, and put that which he was writing in his pocket. I accordingly writ an authority, and desired him to sign it, which he did, which I have now in my hand; he then was going away. I told him he could not go for that the bill of three hundred pounds that he had paid into the hands of Messrs. Haywood and Co. at Manchester had been stolen from a client of mine, and that I suspected him to be the man; first he said he would go, I was on the stairs to stop him, he pushed by me to the door, but my clerk taking the precaution of locking it, he could not get out; he afterwards was very quiet and sat down when he saw I was resolute, and he said his name was not St. John.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the first instance I wish your lordship to understand that the prosecutor has perjured himself in his evidence twenty times; Mr. Henson's amounts to the same thing. So far when he asked my name prior, I told him 
               <persName id="t18070114-6-person181">

            , that I acted as agent to St. John; he charged me with respect to the acquaintance I had with that man (I am speaking of Mr. Henson), I said that I come from him, I would show him the man, and take him myself; that was refused. The last time that I was brought here I had respectable people from the country; at the present instance I have none; many of them live in Hampshire. The prosecutor has brought these people from Manchester, whom I know not though I do not deny that I negotiated the note. The man was with me and put his dot on the note.</p>

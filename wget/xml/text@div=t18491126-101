                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Wells, of High-street, Kensington. On 3d Nov. the prisoner came to the shop, to purchase a wedding-ring—I showed her some, but she did not buy any—when she was gone I missed two gold pencil-cases—I went, and found the prisoner in a public-house—I took bold of her, and charged her with stealing the pencil' cases—she came back to the shop, and rolled on the floor, and made a great noise, and while doing so I imagine she took the pencil-cases out of her boot, as she had not them in her hand at first, but she had afterwards, and I took them out—these are them; they are Mr. John Wells's.</p>

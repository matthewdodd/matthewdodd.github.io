                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 557). On 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> February, I was on duty, in plain clothes, in Leadenhall-street—about half-past 7 o'clock, I saw two ladies standing with their backs towards a shop, looking for an omnibus—the prisoner went to one lady, and as she moved away, he moved after her—one of the ladies attempted to get into an omnibus, and the prisoner got in front of her and obstructed her—I stepped across the road, took him in custody, and told the conductor to stop the omnibus—he stopped it until the lady got out—I then asked her to feel if she bad lost her purse; she felt in her pocket, and said that it was gone—the prisoner struggled with me for about five minutes; his cape tore, and I have no doubt he dropped the purse at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am staying at present in Jubilee-street, Mile end—on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> February, I was in Leadenhall-street soon after 7, waiting, for an omnibus—the prisoner kept at my side, close to me, and my daughter was on the other side—as I went across, he went before me and took hold of the omnibus—he kept staring in my face, and I said, "Are you going to get into the omnibus? because, if not, allow me to pass"—he <hi rend="italic">caught round me</hi> in a strange way, and, of course, was at my pocket, but I did not think of that—he had hold of my clothes by my pocket, by my side—my purse was safe in my pocket when I was waiting for the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> on the pavement—I should say I waited ten minutes before the omnibus came up—when I searched my pocket my purse was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where had you been before you got into the omnibus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Into the Borough, to my grand-daughter's, and I called on a friend as I came home—I did not go into any shop—I do not keep my purse and handkerchief in the same pocket—my purse was in my petticoat-pocket, and my handkerchief in my dress-pocket—I have to put my hand right in front of my dress to get to my petticoat-pocket—that is the only access I have to it—I walked to my grand-daughter's—I left home about two o'clock, and got there about 3—I put my purse into my pocket when I left home, but had not had occasion to use it at all—I could not be deceived about it being in my pocket, because it had silver in it, which made it heavy, and I could not walk without feeling it—I am sure it was there when I stood on the pavement—I have earned it for years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you would have missed it if it had been away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I did not miss it, because there was a bustle in getting into the omnibus—I frequently felt to see if my purse was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEMP</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you walk do you feel your purse, when there is anything in it, against your person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I am sure I had it in my pocket when I was in Leadenhall-street.</p>

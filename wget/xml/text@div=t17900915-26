Last Monday, the 13th of September, I went out to take a walk into the country with two or three of my comrades; coming home we went to one of the men's houses in Old-street: it was very late: he asked me to stay all night: I set out to go home; and I missed my way, and went into the lower part of Holborn; this was two or three in the morning; the prisoner was walking there, and asked me if I was going her way? I said, I wanted to go to the Adelphi, and if she would take me there I would give her sixpence; she said, she would: it was very dark: she took me into <placeName id="t17900915-26-crimeloc129">Parker's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Did you miss any thing before you went to sleep? - No, every thing was safe then; when I awoke she was in the room; immediately she upbraided me with being in her apartment; I said, you vile woman, you brought me here instead of taking me home; I missed my things immediately, and called the watch: I never found any of my property; I charged her with it; she said, what business have you in my premises? she declared she never saw any thing of the things.</p>
               <p>Had you given her any money? - Not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you only sat on a chair? - I sat in the chair, and leaned on my elbow: I called the watchman, and he took charge of her, and took her to the watch-house: the constable is not here.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a porter to the East India Company? - Two years.</p>

               <p>My lord, on Monday week, the 13th, I was at an acquaintance's, till between four and five in the morning, day light; I came home and found a woman at my door; and I asked what she did there? she said, she had lost her cap, hat, and bonnet: I opened my door: there is no lock: and there I saw this man lying asleep on the bed; I waked him, and asked what brought him there; he said eh! eh! who brought me here! a woman in the dark; and he asked me if it was me? I said, I had not been home since ten at night; he said, he should see into it; I went and called the watchman and constable, and told them the story: there are several girls in the house; any of them could get into my apartment: the constable came, and he gave charge on suspicion; he said, he could not positively swear to me.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Did the girl that let you in unlock the door or not? - I do not know; I know her person; and in particular she had two pair of fine black eyes at the time, she had dark hair.</p>
               <p>Was there any other door open? - Not that I saw; it was up one pair of stairs.</p>

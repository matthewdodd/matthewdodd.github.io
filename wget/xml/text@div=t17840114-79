               <p>I am a blacksmith; I know Mr. Wright's house; on the 26th of November, I was coming down Fleet Market, on the side leading to his house; I saw a man half way in the window, by the help of a sledge that lays under the window, he stood upon that and he was about half way in the window under the sash, I saw him draw himself out as I was coming down, I thought he was conversing with somebody, and he and another ran by me as hard as ever he could; I had no suspicion of any robbery; I think the man had a cast in his eye, I cannot say, as they went by me they had like to have thrown one another down.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you know him again? - I think I should, but I am not sure; he had then dark, or rather black clothes on.</p>
               <p>Court. Look around the Court and see if you see any body like him. - No, really to be upon my oath, another man may be of the same size.</p>
               <p>Court. The next witness is an accomplice, but here is no ground to identify this.</p>

             got up before me. She called and said, my house was broke open; this was about four o'clock. I got up and found a window-shutter taken down, also a casement, where the thief got in, and the door was opened to go out again. I lost these things mentioned in the indictment. They were all in the house at night going to bed. I saying I had been robbed, a man came to me the next day and said, he saw the Prisoner at the bar with some sauce-pans in her apron. I inquired amongst the watermen, and found she was gone to London. About three days after, my man took her and brought her to Fulham; I went to her at the Constable's house, she had denied it for some time, but confest it to the Constable before I came, and after that to me; she said she had a fellow with her who got in at the window, and took the things and gave them to her, and that she had carried them to London, and sold them to a person who is now here to give evidence against her; and that if I would forgive her, she would pay me for them, or get them for me again.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in St. Martin's in the Fields; the Prisoner at the bar sold me four copper sauce-pans, and a brass kettle at a market price; she told me they were her mother's and hers, and that they were going to remove farther off, so they would not pay carriage thither. I gave 10 d. a pound for the copper, and 6 d. for the brass ; I put them out at my door to sell, and the prosecutor came and owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you buy them?</p>
               <p>Baniman. She brought them about a month ago, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

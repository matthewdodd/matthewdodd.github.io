                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, at 67, Berwick Street—on the 17th of May, about 8.30 in the morning, I heard somebody on the landing outside the bedroom door—I called out, but got no answer—I got out of bed and went to the door, and I heard the stairs creak all the way down to the parlour—I called the young man who slept in the house up-stairs—I heard the parlour shutters on the ground floor opened and the window thrown up, and then I. ran to the bedroom window and saw the man had missed his footing and had fallen into the area—I went to the street door to prevent him getting up—I waited in the street till one of the young men went for the police, they came, and took him out of the area—we went over the premises and found the kitchen window open and the shutters forced—I had seen them fastened about 11 o'clock the previous night when I went to bed—when I looked out of my bedroom window and saw the prisoner looking up from the area, he had his boots off, and I saw his white</p>

               <p>socks—when the police came he had his boots on—a person could <hi rend="italic">get</hi> to the kitchen window by climbing over the area railings—the area is covered with wire to prevent the cats getting in, but getting out he fell, and took the wire work with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard the footsteps distinctly as far as the parlour—the prisoner's foot was sprained—he did not appear as if he had been drinking at all—I heard him give the constable an address, and state who he was—he could not walk up from the area, and they took him to the station, I believe, and to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant C</hi> 2). I was called to the house of the last witness about 3.30, and saw the prisoner in the area—he had his boots on at the time—the parlour window was open, and also the window in the area—the prisoner said he had fallen into the area in running away from a police constable—I took him into the kitchen, and asked him what he had got about him, at first he said nothing—he subsequently said that he had a knife—he seemed to be in pain about his foot, and I took him to the hospital before going to the station—I searched him subsequently again, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) open—he said it was his—the kitchen window had been opened by a knife being passed in and the catch thrown back, and the shutter bar had been lifted in the same way—that could be done by such a knife as that—the area railings are about 5 feet high, and the area is 10 feet below the level of the footway.</p>

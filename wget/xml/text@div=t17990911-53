               <p>Q. Did you know Agar before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light night? - A. Yes; they hustled me, and Staunton put his hand in my pocket, and upon that Agar knocked off my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the face of the man you call Agar, so plain, at eleven o'clock at night, as to be able to swear to his person? - A. Yes, it was very light, and he was close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lamps there? - A. I cannot say; then one of the party picked up my hat, and I called out watch; upon that one of the party came up to me, and said, d-n you, if you call out watch again, I will cut your throat from ear to ear; upon the watchman coming up, I put my hand in my waistcoat pocket, and missed the half guinea directly; I am sure I had it within five minutes before I was attacked; the watchman came up, and I pointed out Agar, and told him that was the man that knocked off my hat; I did not see any of the rest then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your half guinea again? - No, as soon as the watchman came they all ran away; there were two of them taken that night, Lewis and Agar; I had seen Staunton the Saturday night before, at the corner of Fleet-market, as I was standing there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been out of place? - A. From the 21st of June; I left Mr. Parish, of Ludgate-street, mercer, and I had put into two offices, and attended every day; I lived with Mr. Parish three months; I had not been in any place before that; I had been to the East Indies in the William Pitt, as the surgeon's servant; and, after I came home, I lived with my father at Ramsgate.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to lodge at Mr. Cadwell's? - A. I had lodged there before I went to my place; I had seen Staunton the Saturday night before, at about half past nine, as I was standing talking with a woman that I knew; he came up to me, and said, b-st your eyes, you b-r, what business have you with that woman? it was a person that my father knew when he lived in the Minories; her name is Peggy Mills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to meet her there? - A. No, I asked her how she did; I met her accidentally; I had not seen her before since I left the Minories, which is about twelve months ago, very nigh, I cannot be quite sure; she was standing at the corner, and another woman at a little distance from her that I did not know; when I asked her how she did, Staunton came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know you again, when you asked her how she did? - A. Yes, she said she was very well; I have seen her since that, about five weeks ago in the Strand; I do not know where she lives, I met her accidentally at that time, and have not seen her since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then ask her where she lived? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after you were robbed, and yet you did not ask her where she lived? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her you had been robbed? - A. No; she spoke to me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you did not ask where you could find her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Staunton besides the night you were robbed, and that Saturday night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When Staunton said, b-st your eyes, you b-r, what have you to do with this woman, what did you say? - A.Nothing, but he struck me a violent blow upon the breast; and, when I came to myself, he repeated the blow again.</p>

             see both these blows? - A. Yes, then I got away; when I met her afterwards in the Strand, she said, she hoped I would not hurt Staunton, that was about five weeks after I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Staunton had been in custody then about five weeks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you did not ask her where she lived? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Agar or Lewis before that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. - Q. You are a servant out of place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you footman at Mr. Parish's? - A. In the morning, I used to open the shop, and clean it out; I did up the breakfast things, attended dinner, and shut up shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give your master warning, or he you? - A. I did not like my mistress, Miss Parish, and I gave them warning myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you were so good a servant, that there were no complaints of you? - A. They asked me, whether I liked to stay or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps there was a complaint, when you took an hour to go to Fleet-market? - A.There were no complaints of any thing else that I know of; my master used to mention that to me.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you went to Mr. Parish's, how long was it that you had been returned from India? - A. A twelvemonth last February; my father then kept the Fountain in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is your father in now? - A. I cannot say; my mother keeps a boarding-school; my father has left the Fountain nearly a twelvemonth, as nearly as I can guess; I then went on board the Taunton Castle, and was discharged in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110090"></xptr>the Hope, because I was too slight; I was going before the mast; I was on board her seven or eight days; I then went to my father's, in Queen's-head-lane, Islington, till I went on board the Manship East Indiaman, from December to February; I went in her as far as the Nore, and was discharged because I was too slight; my father was then gone to Ramsgate, and I went to lodge at Mr. Cadwell's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were on board the William Pitt? - A.Three years come April.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - A.Twenty-three next May.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lodged at Mr. Cadwell's from that time to this? - A. No, I am now very badly situated, I am in the workhouse in Gray's-inn-lane, and have been ever since I came out of the hospital, about a fortnight ago; I lodged at Mr. Caldwell's about three weeks after I was robbed, and then I went to lodge at the house of a young fellow that I had known on board the Pitt; from thence I went to the workhouse, from the workhouse to the hospital, and then back to the workhouse again; I went there because I was in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Being in distress, you know there are different ways of relieving one's self; you have perhaps heard of a 40l. reward. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, of course, you have learned arithmetic enough to know, that three forties make 120l.? - A. I don't do it for that-God forbid.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by this half guinea? - A. I had fifteen shillings, a half guinea was lent me by the maid-servant that lives at Mr. Parish's; her name is

               <p>Q. Then you got in for nothing? - A. No, I paid for going in at half price, and I came back with my aunt and my cousin, and one of the performers; I parted with my aunt and my cousin, at their house in Oakley-street, Blackfriars-road, and the other performer left me in Fleet-street, to go to Charing-cross.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you had those clothes? - A. I pawned my coat to get some tea and sugar, when I was in the Hospital; this is a coat I had from the workhouse, the waistcoat was given me by my young master, and the breeches I bought with my own money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You came away from the Circus with your aunt, your cousin, and one of the performers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell them of the robbery? - A. I believe my brother has; I have not seen them since.</p>

On the 1st of July, I heard watch cried; the prosecutor was at the corner of Field-lane, and Chick-lane; I came to his assistance, and he told me, he was robbed of his hat, and half-a-guinea; he pointed out that middle-man (Agar) as the man that took his hat; and he said, he felt one of their hands in his pocket, and he missed half a guinea; then my partner came up, and we both attacked them; there were five or six, if not seven in the gang; Lewis was at a distance, I did not suspect him to be one of the party; they all ran away, I ran after them, but lost sight of them; two of them were stopped and taken to St. Sepulchre's watch house, and from there we took them to Hatton-garden watch-house; when they ran away, they went off in a cluster, with a great laugh.</p>

             sworn. - After calling the hour of eleven at night, on the 1st of July, I saw Gray at the bottom of Chick-lane; he said, he had been robbed of half-a-guinea; there were a number of them standing there, and then they all took to their heels and ran away; two of them, Agar and Lewis, were stopped and taken to St. Sepulchre's watch-house; I went there, and we hand-cuffed them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110091"></xptr>and brought them to our own watch-house; I did not see either the hat or half-guinea, and I really believe, in my heart, that Lewis is as innocent of the affair as the child that is unborn in the womb; I took Staunton the next day at the Castle, facing of Chick-lane.</p>

             Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live with Mr. Parish; I hired Gray for Mr. Parish; he lived with us about three months; I believe he was perfectly honest, but if we sent him out of an errand, it was a matter of great uncertainty when he would come back; he would be half an hour frequently going to Fleet-market, and for that reason he left our house; once he staid out all night without leave; he said he was intoxicated and would not come home, and Mr. Parish forgave him.</p>

             Sworn - I was constable of the night. Agar and Lewis were brought to our watch-house; Gray charged them with robbing him; I told him to be very particular in what he said; he looked at them a second time and said, he could not swear to them; I did not know that they were to come before this Court till within these few minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Lewis called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Agar also called two, and Staunton four witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and lodge at the Queen's Head beershop, Hillingdon. On 11th June, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in the taproom, and laid a half crown on the table—the prisoner was there, and no one else—he asked me to draw him some beer, and I left the room for it, leaving the half crown on the table—I was not gone five minutes, I brought the beer back, found the prisoner there, and the half crown was gone—I told him some one must have taken it—the landlady, Mrs. Tuckwell, came in, and the prisoner said he had not a farthing of money—he went away in five minutes—I knew him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an inn, at Hillingdon. I know the prisoner very well—on 11th June, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, he came to my place and had a pint of beer; be gave me a half crown in payment, and I gave him the change—I have known him nearly thirty years; he has been cowman to a lady in the neighbourhood, and saved a little money, which he</p>

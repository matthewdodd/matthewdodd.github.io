Claridge was in my employ upwards of five years—the meat was shown me by the policeman—two of the pieces I could swear to as mine—the others I believe to be mine—I had not given Claridge any right to sell meat, or give it away—my slaughter-house ought not be open so soon, except for getting the horse and cart out—all my other men were in bed.</p>

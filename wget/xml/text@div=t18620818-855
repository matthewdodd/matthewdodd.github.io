                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Henry Hill and others, tailors, of 3, Old Bond-street—the prisoner was in our service for about eight years, up to June 23d—it was part of his duty to receive money on account of the firm, and enter it in our books—he reoeived cheques, and entered them in the same way—it was his duty to pay in the cheques he received to the Union Bank, Regent-street, when the amount had accumulated to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had no authority to sign the name of our firm—I am acquainted with his writing—the whole of this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his writing—he would have access to letters addressed to the firm by coming early enough—when money is paid into the banker's a credit slip is given—this credit slip (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is dated 26, 3, '61—the first item is a cheque from William Tucker for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is in the prisoner's writing—I was not aware of any credit of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being sent up to us, till after the prisoner left our service—I had not the slightest idea of his being about to leave.</p>

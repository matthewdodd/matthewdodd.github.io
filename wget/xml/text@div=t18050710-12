             sworn. - I am a butcher; I live with Mr. Davis, in Newgate-market, he is a salesman: On Tuesday evening, the 25th of June, about seven o'clock, I was going from Newgate-market to Clare-market, and there, outside of the watch-house door, I saw a large body of people; I supposed there was somebody in the stocks opposite the watch-house door; the prisoner at the bar was leaning over the rails, she was three parts intoxicated in liquor; when I went up, the other witness that has just gone down told me that the prisoner had got a mug hanging between her legs; I put my hand down, but could not feel it; I lifted her petticoats half way up, and this mug was hanging between her legs.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood him that it was hanging about her leg? - A. I cannot be positive; it was hanging before her tied with a blue ribbon; I laid hold of it, and cut it off with a pair of scissars, and put her into the watch-house; I fetched a constable, and gave charge of her to him; he came in, and searched her afterwards, and found a pair of sugar tongs upon her, and two duplicates - one for two spoons, and the other for one, and some silver and halfpence she had in her bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing? - A. She was very much in liquor; it was a very hard matter to get any thing from her; I produce the milk-pot.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you know any thing of this woman? - A. I never saw her before she was brought to Bow-street; on the 30th, I think, I went to Bow-street; on the 25th day of June, very near five in the afternoon, I was coming up stairs to my chambers in the <placeName id="t18050710-12-crimeloc78">Temple</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was that? - A. I think it must be taken near half past four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at it - Do you know it to be your's? - A. I have not the least doubt of all the articles; my name is on the tea-tongs, the spoon, and the cream-pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going through Covent-garden market, I met with a young man; he asked me to have something to drink; I told him, I did not care; I walked on a little, while he felt in his pocket, and said, he had no money; he pulled out a spoon, and I went and pledged it; he said, it was the third spoon he had pledged that day; we walked on a great way, and he took this milk-pot out from under his jacket, and the sugar-tongs, he asked me to take them home, as he had got to go to Blackwall that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to conceal it between your legs? - A. The constable knew I had got no pockets, and I carried it in my hands a great way, and then I tied it to my garter.</p>

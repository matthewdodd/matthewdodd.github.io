                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 29). On 12th March, about four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Bunhill-row. The two prisoners were knocking at the door of the Blue Anchor, loud enough to disturb the inmates—the house was shut, and there was no appearance of any light—they con<lb></lb>tinued knocking some time—I went and asked them to go away quietly—they told me to go to b—y—they continued making a noise, and singing as loud as they could—I asked them to be quiet, and they told me again to go to b—y—they continued a noise sufficient to alarm the neighbourhood, and they went <hi rend="italic">on at me</hi> down Chequer-alley, and there they both fell down through liquor—I assisted to pick up Thomas, and while doing so, William said, "Keep your bands off, you b——, or else I will give you something"—they then placed themselves against the wall, and commenced singing as loud as they could, and said, "There, you b——, we put you at defiance to touch us"—I then took Thomas into custody—William then ran at me, and kicked me in the groin, saying. "Thomas, I will stick to you as long as I have a drop of blood in me"—they both then seized me by the collar—I got away and sprang my rattle—William said, "You may call, you b—"—I went down the alley, drew my staff, and be ran at me, and as he ran I hit him on the arm—he then got both arms around my waist, and said, "Stick to him, <hi rend="italic">Tom,"</hi> and Thomas caught me round the neck by the collar, and we all fell together—while we were down, Thomas beat me with his fists, took my rattle away, and threw it up the alley—I cannot say how long it was they kept assaulting me—assistance came at last, and they were taken into custody—I have been attended by Mr. Mather for this injury, and am under him now—I was in bed a fortnight, and have not been able to do duty since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called up to attend to Ross on the morning of the 12th, at half-past four o'clock—he was very severely injured; he could not stand, and appeared to be suffering very great agony—the principal injury was in the groin—I had him conveyed home, and then examined him—he was a good deal injured about the back and neck, and the injury in the groin was very serious, as if from a kick—it was</p>

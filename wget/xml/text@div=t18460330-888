I am servant to Mrs. Lemon, of No. 5, Hoxton-square—on the morning of the 7th of March she went out, leaving me and Harris in the house—about eleven o'clock there came a single knock at the door, which I opened, and saw Melany—I asked what he wanted—he said he came from Mr. Walker's, in Hackney-road, for some jobs—I told him I was sure he was not right—he said, yes, he was quite right, he had been told to come to Mrs. Lemon's, No. 5, Hoxton-square—I asked what for—he said, "Boots and shoes"—I said I was sure he was not right, for we had not any—I called my fellow-servant down—Melany was asked to go into the parlour—I and Harris went up stairs, to finish the job we were about—in about ten minutes I came down, and saw the street door open, and Melany was gone—I did not miss anything at that moment—I went into the kitchen, to see what time it was, and I missed the watch which had been suspended over the dresser—my mistress afterwards missed two silver spoons and a tea-spoon.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable</hi>, No. 274.) About a quarter past one o'clock on the 7th of March, I was about Field-lane, and saw both the prisoners—I saw Jones, as he went down the lane, beckon to a man named Simmonds, who keeps a handkerchief shop there, and was standing at his shop door—he followed the prisoners, and they all went into a public-house on Saffron-hill—about two minutes after they went in, Melany came to the door, and looked up Saffron-hill and down again—he repeated this twice—I and Hewett, an officer who was with me, went into the public-house—I heard a jingling sound of silver, and saw Jones standing by a beer-barrel which was turned end upwards, and on the barrel this handkerchief was spread, and he had his hands upon it—I pushed him on one side, and under the handkerchief I found these spoons and this watch—I said to Jones, "What is the meaning of this? do you know anything of these?"—he said, "No"—asked Melany if he knew anything about them—he said, "No"—I took them into custody.</p>

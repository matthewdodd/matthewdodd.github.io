                  </hi>. I am the son of Robert Wagstaff, a farmer at West Ham. Chilvers was my father's carter—I thought it necessary to watch him, and went to the premises of Mr. Young, in Mile-end-road, on the 28th of September, and about four o'clock that afternoon I saw Chilvers drive my father's team into the yard—he got on the wagon, and took off two bags, one containing about two bushels of chaff, the other about half a bushel of corn—he was to leave my father's house about one o'clock in the night, on the 27th, for London, and did so—he should have fed the horses in the market in London—he had about six bushels of mixed corn allowed him to feed them—he should have given them the chaff and corn mixed in London—we always give them a bushel of clear corn and six bushels of chaff—they mix it themselves—they generally get home about five o'clock in the afternoon—I saw him do this, and I saw the ostler, Davison, take it off the wagon from him, and deposit it in to stable close by—he emptied the bags, and returned again, locked the door, and put the key into his pocket—the prisoner Chilvers then turned round and drove home, without eating or drinking in me premises—the horses had nothing to eat but a mouthful of hay which he picked up—they ought not to have eaten there—I then went and gave the ostler into custody—he denied all knowledge of it—the policeman demanded the key—he refused it, but after all he took it out of hw I pocket and unlocked the stable—we there found the corn and chaff—I have compared the corn with my own, and believe it to be the same, and the chaff also.</p>

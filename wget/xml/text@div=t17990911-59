             sworn. - I live No. 29, Crown street, Soho: On the 19th of August I lost a bonnet off my head in <placeName id="t17990911-59-crimeloc309">St. John's-street, Clerkenwell</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was the name of your friend? - A. One Reeves; I left her about ten minutes before eleven, I believe; I was stooping down to tie my patten tight, it had been a wet night, when somebody came up to me, and gave me a push, and said, what are you doing here; I made no answer, and my bonnet was gone in an instant, I could see no more of her; I could see that she had on a black gown.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that that woman was the woman at the bar? - A.She lisped, and I saw her afterwards with the bonnet on her head; the watchman advised me to go to the watch house, which I did; and in less than ten minutes afterward, the prisoner was brought in with my bonnet on her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the woman that took your bonnet any thing on her head at the time? - A. I cannot say whether she had or not; I know the bonnet by my own work in it, I altered it from what it was when I first bought it; the constable took it into his charge, and has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your bonnet pinned on? - A. No, it was quite loose upon my head, it was gone in a minute; when she came into the watch-house, I said, young woman, that is my bonnet; then she made use of a bad expression, and said d-n your eyes, how came you to say it is your bonnet; I bought it half an hour ago, and gave a shilling for it. I never saw her before; I told her I did not want her locked up, nor to do any thing to her but to have my bonnet; and she said, if she could get me out of the watch-house, she would not leave me while there was a rag to my back.</p>

             sworn. - I was the officer of the night: About half past eleven o'clock the last witness came into the watch-house, and said she had been robbed her bonnet; she told me the woman that robbed her had a black gown on; she said she should know her again if she was to see her; she sat down, and in a few minutes the prisoner came and made a noise at the watch-house door, damning and swearing, and breeding a riot; I desired the patrol to open the door and let her in; I asked her if that was the person that had robbed her, and if that was the bonnet upon her head; she said it was; I asked her if she had known her before; she said she had not; the prisoner said, she had given a woman a shilling for it; I asked her where the woman was, and she did not know any thing about her; in consequence of that, I thought it necessary to take charge of her; I kept her in the watch-house, took her before the Magistrate, and she was committed.

               <p>I met Jenks in Goswell-street about eight o'clock at night; he asked me to go to Islington to bathe; coming down after nine at night we met Hunter, Hill, and Baldwin, and two girls with them, by Old-street turnpike; Jenks told Hill that Hunter had five guineas in his pocket; they found I heard and then told me of it; we came down to a house facing Aylsbury-street, and Jenks and I and Baldwin agreed to take him up into the fields, and take the money from him; Jenks, Baldwin, and Hill lay on one side, and I on the other for about the space of twenty minutes, as soon as we laid down I laid my hand across his back.</p>
               <p>Why did you lay your hand on him? - Because I knew this money was to be taken; Jenks and Baldwin took the money from him.</p>
               <p>Why did you lay your hand over him? - I am used to lay my hand over any body when a-bed; Hill picked one pocket, and Jenks the other; Jenks took a guinea and eight shillings, and Hill a shilling; then they all got up and ran away, and left Hunter and me; Hunter snored, I take it he was between sleep and awake; when they ran away he started up; I believe they ran round the haystack and lost him.</p>
               <p>On his Cross Examination he said, it might be later than half after nine, but he was sure it was not twelve when they met the prosecutor; that one of them reached over the prosecutor to pick his pocket on the side he lay on; that he was perfectly sober, but the others were not; that the reason of their going into the fields at that time of night was, that they said they knew where a great many girls inhabited, and Hunter agreed to go; that they rambled about from ten till between one and two, when this was done.</p>

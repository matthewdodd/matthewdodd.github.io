Jumping out I fell down on my hands and knees, and they were then going off, and Mr. Henley, who was with me in the chaise, called to me, and said, I had better<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110107"></xptr>come into the chaise, I got into the chaise we drove on, in about two minutes, from between two to three minutes they brought the prisoner at the bar up to the Castle, the men who took him brought him; I said to him when he came up, where is that gentleman's watch, and my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice enough of the prisoner at the time of the robbery to recollect him again when he was brought to you? - I cannot say that I did; I can-swear to his person positively. He said the man that took the watch had thrown it into the road, but if it was lost his mother would make it good. I cannot say that this was the man that took my money; he said if we would take a lanthorn and candle, and go back we should find it; and we immediately searched his pockets and found a pistol loaded, which answers to the same pistol that was held to my head; I took particular notice of it, it was cocked; the moment that he put it to my head I looked at it, it was an iron pistol or a steel one. We brought him to Hounslow.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Hunt, I am looking at your silks, but your young man and I cannot agree about the price; they are for a good man, and if you can do them well, it may be a good account;" he said he had a commission to purchase them. I asked if he wished them to be entered to himself, he said no. to a much better man than him.

             of Duffield; in consequence of this representation I let him have three lengths of lutestring, and two pieces of Persian. I asked how he wished them to be packed, he said he could not inform me then, but he was going to Hull next day, and should probably take them with him; but having a good many parcels to take, he had not made up his mind whether he would take them or have them sent. I asked for a reference; he referred me to Messrs. Fry's, bankers, and Mr. Nalder's, Cheapside. I enquired, and next morning he called and got the goods. I told him they were entered to Robinson, he said he had several parcels to collect, and would call in a coach, in about twenty minutes, as the Hull coach passed his door; he did so, and took them.</p>

            . I live at Duffield, and deal in silks; there is no other person there of my name. I never desired the prisoner to order these articles; I had given him some commissions some time ago; he was recommended to me as a clever man, likely to select goods for me; all my orders to him were in writing; I did not know that there was such a person as Mr. Hunt - I have not employed him for two or three months; the last order I gave him was in November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He was recommended to you as an agent - A. As a man likely to buy for me, as he bought goods on his own account, and therefore I could buy of him; when I have sent him an order he has enclosed other things on approbation, which I had not ordered in one or two instances, and I have kept some of them; he had no orders at this time; I always bought for cash - I did not direct him where to apply for goods - he has had orders to buy in his own name for me, he once had orders to buy in my name; Messrs. Fry and Co. are persons to whom I should have referred; he has bought in my name since I ordered him not.</p>

            . I belong to the firm of Holroyd and Co., Bread-street. On the 19th of February the prisoner called at our house; I knew him before - he said he had some goods to sell for a manufacturer - a job for cash - I gave him 29 l. odd for the goods in question, which are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many years have you known him - A. Ten years; he was much respected, I understand.</p>

               <p>MR. HUNT. This is the property he obtained from me, I sold it for 40 l.</p>

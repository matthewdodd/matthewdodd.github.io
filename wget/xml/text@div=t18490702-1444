                  </hi>. My name is Robert Myers Gibb; but I have never gone by it. On 4th March I was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Triumvirate</hi>, which was lying in the mole of Naples—about ten o'clock that day I set the prisoner a job; it was not finished after dinner, and I sent him about that and another—he gave me abusive language—I ordered him down till the captain came—I was com<lb></lb>manding officer, in his absence—the prisoner came down with a marline spike,</p>

               <p>collared me, and tore my shirt—I gave him a push, but did not strike him—a scuffle ensued, and we both fell—as I fell I saw him cut my hand with knife—the spike was taken from him, and I found I was stabbed on each breast—the surgeon of the <hi rend="italic">Bull-dog</hi> came and dressed my wounds—I was thirty-four days ill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am second mate of the <hi rend="italic">Triumvirate</hi>—I saw the prisoner coming out of the rigging—the mate told him to go on the main-stay and put the mat on—he said be could do it as well as ever he could, for all that he had had a glass of grog—he was not the worse for it—I saw him go up the rigging, <hi rend="italic">giving language</hi> all the way he went up—he came down with a spike, saying he would take some of that b----y <hi rend="italic">cheek</hi> out of him—Gibb called Dalton to take the spike out of his hand—I did not see them I down, but I saw them standing, and the prisoner putting his knife into tin I sheath in a belt round his waist—Gibbs' hand was cut—I ran, and said to the prisoner, "Here is a pretty thing you have done, you have cut the mate's hand open;" he said, "Yes; and I would do it to any one who would knock me down, and kick me after I was down"—I took him to the forecastle, and then found Gibb covered with blood on his breast—he was taken to the hospital at Naples that night.</p>

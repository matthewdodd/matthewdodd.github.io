               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How did you see them? A. Through a hole in the next floor, about as large as a pane of glass - the bin was on the side of the floor - we were in the floor over it - we kneeled down - we knew they were stealing it - the bin holds about four loads - my master does not sell wheat - the mill feeds from that bin - I was not there in the old foreman's time - Mr. Clarke is foreman now - I do not know of any dislike between Mr. Clarke and the prisoners - we could not see the bin, and the proceedings at the cart at the same time - I ran to another hole - I was on the second floor from the ground - Hinchley was holding a sack, Smith was holding a bag, and Hibbert wheeled it to the cart - Lutman was against the door - there were three holes; through one hole I could see the wheat running: through another hole I could see the cart - I went to one hole, and then to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, you say you went to a hole in the loft, and saw from that into the yard, and saw Lutman and his cart, how did you do that? A. I ran to another hole, and then saw them putting it into the cart - we looked through a board - Mr. Clarke has not been tutoring me what to say - he spoke to me about this on the Monday morning, before I had been to the Justice, and the day before yesterday he did not tell me what I was to say - he asked me whether it was the truth, that I did see them, and I said yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you say correctly at first, that after you looked through the first floor, you descended a ladder, and looked through another hole? A. Yes; the bin is very large, the hopper is in the middle - the bag is at one corner - the wheat was not running from the middle where the hopper is, but from the corner where the bag is.</p>

            , he is foreman of the prosecutor's mill. I was in the mill on the 5th of April, with Charles Burr, between twelve and one o'clock - we were at the top of the mill - there is a hole there - I looked through, and saw some wheat running out from the bin, from one corner where there was a bag - we then went down to the next floor, and looked through a hole, and saw the wheat run down into a sack; and the three prisoners who are employed in the mill, were there - we saw three sacks, which were put into Lutman's cart - we could see the door from the hole we looked through the second time - Hibbert wheeled the sack to Lutman's cart, and put them in - I told my father when he came home at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did not you tell your father when he came home to dinner? A. I do not know - I have not talked with my father above once or twice about them - he and the prisoners have had some quarrels - I told my father as I went home at night, and again the next day - when we first saw the prisoners, we were at the top of the mill - the hole was about as large as a square of glass - we looked through to the floor under us, and saw wheat running - the top of the bin is not inclosed by a sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hole in the under floor immediately under the hole in the top floor? A. Yes; there was nothing to prevent our seeing through the two floors at once - I saw through the first hole the hopper, and then I came down to see through the other hole - the hole in the room where the bin was, is about five yards from the bin - I know the difference between a foot and a yard - it was about five yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been talking about five somethings, and forgotten whether it was five feet or five yards? A. No; it was five yards - there was no other cart in the road at that time - I know Beech - he came with his cart at the time Lutman went away - my father talked with Charles Burr about this business the next day before we went before the magistrate - my father talked to me once after this about it, but not in Burr's presence - he told me he had talked with Burr - I am sure of that - I do not know what quarrel my father has had with these prisoners - they have been disputing - my father has rather less wages than some of them - he is not jealous of them - they said something to offend him about three weeks before this, and they had quarrelled about a month before - my father is rather angry with them - I was at Clerkenwell with my father before the Grand Jury - we talked on the road from Uxbridge - he has not talked over and over again with me about it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you quarrelled with the prisoners? A. No; the bran is not kept in the place where the wheat is.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARKE. I am foreman to Mr. Burr. On the 5th April I was at the Fox public-house - I saw Lutman there with his cart - I do not know what was in it - my son gave me some information when I went home at night - I examined the corn bin - two or three sacks of corn were gone - I know the hole the boy showed me in the floor - I could see what they described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there a hole in the top floor? A. No; not in the boards - down the ladder you can see into the second floor - there is no hole<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100103"></xptr>in the boards in the floor at the top, that you can see into the second floor - there is no floor above where the bin is - it would be impossible for any one to look through a floor above where the bin is, and see it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many floors are there? A. Four - the bin is on the fourth floor - it would be necessary for a person in the third floor, to look through a hole to see the wheat flow into the bin - there is no hole in a floor exactly under another hole: but within sight of it, three or four yards from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been speaking to any of the witnesses in this case? A. No; not on any particular point - I did not speak to any one about what he was to say - I only told my son to tell the truth - I never knew him to tell a story - I spoke to my son to-day about it - I told him to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the Grand Jury with him? A. No; I did not - I came from Uxbridge with him - I do not know whether I talked with him there - I have been foreman at the mill two years - I found two of these prisoners there when I went there - I have 100l. a-year - Hinchly has 27s. a-week - Hibbert 20s., and Smith 23s. - I have had no quarrel with these men in particular, only in the course of work - I have ordered them what to do - they have insulted me many times, but I never resented it nor cared for it - I never told my boy of it - he might have heard my wife speak of it - I have never spoken to Charles Burr, or my son about this, but only to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURR. I am the proprietor of the mill. I know the situation - if these boys were in the upper part of the mill, they could see the bin, and by coming down they could see the wheat running into the sacks, and by removing a little on one side they could see the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you often been in the mill? A. Yes; but I never knew of these holes till this transaction - I cannot tell whether they were made for this purpose - I should think none were so large as a foot - there are holes in many large buildings - three of these men have been many years in my employ, long before Clarke came.</p>

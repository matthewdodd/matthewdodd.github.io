               <p>On the 21st of October, about half after eleven o'clock, as I was coming along the Old Bailey, at the top of Fleet-lane, Stevens and Davis spoke to me, I cannot tell what they said, I shoved them from me: I went down the lane to the Elephant and Castle to speak to a young man; Stevens and Davis came into the house; I called for a glass of gin: Stevens and Davis immediately said that they wanted a glass of gin, and Stevens blasted my eyes if she would not have a glass at my expence; I called for a glass; I condescended to pay for the three glasses; they went out before me: I came down the street slowly, and Stevens put her hand upon my collar and pulled me upon a door cell; the door was shut and a candle immediately produced at the stairs, and I was told that was the way: I condescended to go up stairs; I then said I would have nothing to do with them, and desired them to let me go; Stevens said she would be d - d if I should go out of the room without I gave her a shilling; I condescended to give her a shilling; some shrub was produced, and they wanted me to drink, I would not; they then said I should have connexion with them if I would not drink; I said I was a man that had a family, and desired to go about my business; Stevens said I should not go without I would give her another shilling; I went to the door, and Stevens put her hand immediately to my throat, and said,</p>
               <p>"blast your bloody eyes, if</p>
               <p>"you make a noise or stir, I will cut your</p>
               <p>"bloody soul out;" Davis then took me by the head and held it back, and said to Stevens,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, go it then:" I saw Stevens pull my purse out of my pocket with the money in it; I laid hold of her wrist, and said</p>
               <p>"you have got my purse;" she blasted my bloody eyes, and said, "what purse?" I said, my purse, and I should be ruined; one of them called Jem! Jem! and the prisoner, Ingleston, came up, and the candle was put out; I saw the purse in Stevens' hand; I insisted upon having my purse again, and she pretended to faint upon the bed, and called for some water; I said that would not do for me, I had lost my property, and should be ruined: I got to the stairs, and then the candle was blown out again, and I received a blow upon my head, I thought with more than a fist; I got to the door and called the watch, and gave charge of the prisoners: I never found any of my money again.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor asked us if we would drink any thing; we went and called for a quartern of gin; he changed half a crown and paid for it; we wished him a good night, and went away; he came after us and came up stairs, and asked what we would drink; I said I did not want any thing, and then he sent me for a quartern of shrub; then he wanted to be free with Stevens; she resisted him, and went in sits on the bed; and when he found he could not get his ends of her, he said we had taken his money.</p>

               <p>I happened to be in the house at the same time; I went to see one Mr. Hill, who was bad in the house: I heard a noise in the house; he desired me to go and see what was the matter; I came to the door and saw them coming out of the room, and lighted them down stairs, and the wind blew the candle out.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Prosecutor. Was you in a coach with two women before? - It is false, I never was.</p>

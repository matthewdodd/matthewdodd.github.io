               <p>be gone above an hour and a half, and I did not see her again for three days—I then found, that while I was out she had been and taken some of the things away, and got herself a room—she came back on the Monday follow<lb></lb>ing, and wanted to return home, but I said I would not receive her any more—she has been living separate from me ever since Easter—on the evening of 15th June, when I came home, I found my room door locked—I broke it open, and found her inside, sitting on the floor—I said, "What are you doing here?" she said, "I am your wife, and where you are, I will be"—I told her she should not, and if she would not go out, I would carry her out—I took hold of her by the shoulders and under her legs, and carried her down as far as the first landing—I then dropped her legs, because she was punching me in the face, and pulling my hair—I then took hold of her by the two shoulders, and held her before me down the stairs, holding her, not letting her go—I made her go down before me—when I got within four steps of the bottom, I found that she was falling forward, and, to prevent her from hurting herself, I tried to recover her, and overbalanced myself, and went over into the pas<lb></lb>sage, and she on the top of me—I found that I had broken my arm—I can recollect her being on the top of me, punching away at me with something, but I was nearly stunned, and do not recollect much else, only calling out "Murder!"—I was partly insensible—when I came to my senses, I was lying in the passage where I fell—I put my hand to the back of my head, and found it covered with blood—I was taken to the German Hospital, Dalston, and have been there up to last Tuesday.</p>

I am employed where he is, and came home with him on the evening of 15th June—my wife told him that his wife was up stairs—he went up, and I and my wife followed him—the door was locked—he broke it open, and the prisoner was sitting on the floor—he asked what she did there—she said, where her husband was there she had a right to be—he said, "If you don't go quietly, I shall carry you down"—he took her up in his arms, and carried her down one flight; he then let go of her legs, and they got within three or four stairs of the bottom, when he fell over her—he said, "Oh, my God! Howe, I have broken my arm; I am done"—the next moment my wife said, "She has got a knife," and she took hold of her left hand, and the back of her hair, and I took the knife from her right hand—she said, if it was twenty years hence she would do for him; she did not care if she went to the gallows for him.</p>

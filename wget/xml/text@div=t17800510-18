The prisoners came into my shop and asked to look at some coloured silk stockings; whilst I was shewing her them a lady came for some cotton stockings; I left the prisoner and went to attend the lady. While I was serving the lady, I perceived the prisoner's hand in a position that led me to suspect she had concealed some stockings. As soon as the lady was gone out, I went to the prisoner; she fixed on a pair, and asked me the price of them; I put them in a piece of paper for her. I asked her how she could come to the shop under a pretence of only buying a pair; she told me not to suspect her. I took her cloak aside, and there was these stockings (producing them) under her arm.</p>
               <p>What was the value of these five stockings? - Twenty-five shillings I value them at.</p>
               <p>Did you find the fellow to that odd stocking left behind? - I did.</p>

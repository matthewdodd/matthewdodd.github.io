Mr. Farrell, Mr. Elbey, Mr. Cole, and myself went together to the house; the front windows towards the street were shut up; there is a back room on the same floor; there are lodgers up stairs; there is an entry to the house; the back door of the house was open, we got in at that into the entry; there was a large hole in the door of the back room, which comes into the entry, the door was locked. It was about one o'clock when we went. Through that hole I saw Small and Lovell up towards the windows, their backs were towards me; I could observe they were very busy doing something, but I could not tell what; in less than half a minute Sheen came from the fore room into the back room (the two rooms opened into one another) as soon as I saw Sheen come out of the fore room into the back room, he came to the door, and said, who is there?</p>
               <p>He did not see you, did he? - No, but I suppose he heard the noise of our feet in the passage; knowing his voice, we directly broke open the door, and secured him, for fear he should have any fire-arms; we were not a minute securing him; the door and the bed join together in the back room; we broke the door open; Sheen directly threw himself upon the bed, and there we tied him.

             afterwards found 20 or 30 counterfeit shillings upon the bed; I left him safe; then Lovell threw this glove down, and ran into the fore room; the fore room stunk of aqua fortis enough to knock one down, there was half a butter firkin full of it; I heard some metal chink; I went into the fore room, and brought Lovell out into the back room. When I was in the back room I said to Mr. Farrell,</p>
               <p>"There is a great quantity of bad money in the fore room." He said,</p>
               <p>"Do not touch it till I come." I left it for him to take up. I found in the glove four sixpences and two bad shillings; at the same place where the woman was, I found this phial of aqua fortis; in the back room I found another phial of aqua fortis, this scouring-paper, and some metal; under the window there was a sort of dresser, where the women were, which I imagine they had been at work upon. Here is some metal, some pummice-stone, and something they run ingots into. I picked these two shillings and a six-pence from the floor where the women were; I heard them drop, but cannot tell who threw them down. Here is some metal which has been used.</p>

While we were busy with Sheen, Lovell made her escape out of the room where we were; Cole and I pursued her, and took her in the necessary; Mr. Cole caught hold of Small's hands, and brought her to us; her hands were as green as grass, and black, as if she had been at work at the money; I examined Lovell, her hands were nothing like that.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, Joseph Myatt, and my brother; we carry on business as market gardeners, at Manor-farm, Deptford. On Monday evening, 27th Sept., we had occasion to send some goods to market in a wagon—the prisoner, Smith, had charge of it; he was our carman at that time—I saw the wagon after it was loaded; it was then in the yard; it was loaded with baskets to go to market—those were the proper things to go—I had some suspicions, and had some policemen secreted on the farm—the time for the wagon to start was about 12 o'clock at night—I was in my bedroom at that time—I looked out of my window and saw the horses brought out from towards the stable—I could not see the stable from where I was—two men brought them out, who I believe to have been the two prisoners—it was Smith's duty to bring the horses out—I saw a sack on the back of one of the horses; it was a full sack—when the shaft horse was put into the wagon the sack was taken off the horse's back, and put on the shafts of the wagon—the two men then drove it away—I then made a communication to the policemen that were on the premises—the constables afterwards came to me in the course of the same morning, and between 2 and 3 o'clock on the Tuesday afternoon I went to the Green Man toll house in the Kent-road, and there saw a sack; it was full; it contained four bushels of oats—I took a sample from home of my own oats, and looked at those in the sack, and they corresponded exactly—I believe they were some of our oats—there was no mark on the sack; we have scores like it—I had not given any authority to the prisoners to take any sack of oats from our premises—they usually take a bit of corn mixed with chaff for the horses; this was clear corn—there was a sack put on the shaft containing mixed corn for the horses—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Francis-street, Deptford. I was in the prose<lb></lb>cutor's employment on Monday, 27th Sept.—I know Boston—he came to me on that day, and was helping me load my wagon—I was not very well, and I asked him if he would go and fetch the horses back from market, and let me stop at home, as we had to go to plough next day—he said he would—I left him, and went home about 7 o'clock—if I had been well it would hare been my duty to have gone with Smith—Boston went in my stead.</p>

On Monday night, 27th Sept, I was at Mr. Myatt's farm with Turner, another constable—I was concealed among some frames watching some onions—I remember the wagon going away from the yard that night; I think it was as near 12 o'clock as possible when it started; I saw it going—I was not near enough to see who the parties were that went with it—I followed it, and saw two persons with it; Smith was one, and I believe Boston to be the other—I had some communication with Mr. Myatt after the wagon had left the yard, in consequence of which I and my brother constable followed the wagon—I saw it in the Kent-road, stopping at the Crown and Anchor—I observed a sack on the shafts—I passed it, and touched it—it was full—the wagon afterwards went on—I fol<lb></lb>lowed it, and saw the sack several times between the Crown and Anchor and the Green Man toll gate—when I got just by the toll gate a policeman hallooed out that there was a full sack of corn on the ground—I immediately ran to the wagon and saw that the sack which I had seen there about two minutes before, was gone—the policeman that hallooed out was not Turner, but a policeman on duty on that beat—Turner and I were in plain clothes—there was another sack on the shafts about half fall, but the full one was gone—that was standing upright, this one was lying along the shafts—I had not seen the other sack there before; it was not there before, not on the shafts—the policeman on duty went up to Smith and asked him if he had lost a sack of corn—he said no, he had not; he had none—I then went back to Turner, and took the sack into the toll gate—the policeman on the beat had picked it up—I then followed the wagon on to town—I looked into the full sack, and found it contained oats—it was not mixed com, but all oats.</p>

I was on duty in the Old Kent-road, about 1 o'clock on the morning of 28th Sept.—I saw a van horse, about 100 yards on the Kent side of the Green Man toll gate, shy at something lying by the side of the road—I went up to see what it was, and found it was a sack full of something; it was lying at the near side of the road as you go towards the Green Man—it was in the gutter I should call it, but there is no kerb there—it was in such a position as it might be if it had fallen off a cart or wagon; for just about there the middle of the road was being mended with stones, and the carts drew off to the side of the road to avoid them—I saw a market cart and a market wagon in advance—the wagon went on through the toll gate—I saw that the wagon had drawn to the near side of the road to avoid the stones—I went after the wagon and saw Smith—I asked him whether he had dropped a sack of corn—he said no—to the best of my belief Boston was with him—the constables in plain clothes said something to me, and the sack was taken into the toll house—the cart was behind the wagon when I overtook it—the man who was with Smith was with him at the time I asked the question, he must have heard what I said—he was on the hind part of the wagon, and I was at the near side—he was sitting on a projection behind the wagon—he was not more than six yards from me, and I spoke load enough to be heard thirty yards off—he did not speak—I saw his features, and to the best of my belief it was Boston—he was npt asleep—he looked at me, and I looked at him—it was not very light.</p>

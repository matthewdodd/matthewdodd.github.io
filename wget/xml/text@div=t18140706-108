               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you saw him take the money, or did he fail to account for it - A. No, I did not see him take the money; he accounted for it in an artful way. He did not take the money from the till; he contrived to withhold the money. I found two tickets of a watch in the name of Joseph Clark. The hand-writing of the tickets and the book is his hand-writing. On Tuesday the 17th of May, it was entered,

            , silver watch, lodger, a guinea and a half. I referred to the file which I have in my hand; I found these two tickets to be in the handwriting of the prisoner; I asked the prisoner how there could be two tickets in his hand-writing. I counted the tickets over, and I looked in the balance book, in which we set down the abstract of the business; then I looked in this book; I found on the 17th of May I delivered one hundred and one pledges; the money received for these pledges was twenty pounds eight shillings and three farthings. When I counted the file, I counted one hundred and two tickets; as no one is infallible, I reckoned the tickets over again; I found there was one hundred and two tickets on the file, and the amount came to twenty-two pounds four shillings and nine pence three farthings. The way that this robbery has been committed, on the 17th of May he took one pound eleven shillings and sixpence, and the watch was booked a guinea and and a half to make up this deficiency, whereas, the watch was never pledged at all. That entry was made in the book to cover that guinea and a half. As he confessed to me without any promise or threat, I turned the prisoner away. The next morning, on looking over some other things, I procured a search warrant; he came to my house on the Wednesday, and sat down in the parlour. I wished to have a witness with respect to what was going on; I sent for Mr. Perryman. When Mr. Perryman came I said, this affair of the watch; I was by no means satisfied. At last, my saying it was his hand-writing, that all the business was done by himself, he then said, sir, I will own it, there was never such a watch pledged. He said he took the money out of the till, and if I would fetch him the day book he would shew me. He did shew me the date and the place.</p>

I did; he pointed out that he actually took one pound eleven shillings and sixpence from the till; he was asked several times if there was any more; he said he took one pound eleven shillings and sixpence, and no more.</p>

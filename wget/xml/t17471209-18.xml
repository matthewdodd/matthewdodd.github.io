               <p>Pell. Yes, my Lord, I am a relation of Mr. Rrew's, and he has made great complaints of late of his running back; by that means we thought of marking the money, and I markt them.</p>
               <p>Abihal Horn. Early in the morning I saw Mr. Dean, and he told me this story, and as he had no stranger in his house, I sent one of my sawyers and he brought the liquor immediately; the shillings that are now in Court I can swear to, I took particular notice of them; I and Mr. Dean went to Mr. Rew and took the Prisoner into his master's compting house, and told him we had a suspicion he had robb'd his master. I told him I had just sent five shillings he received, and that he had not put it into his master's till.</p>
               <p>Though the Prisoner's crime appeared to be great, yet they could not prove it a felony, but a breach of trust.</p>

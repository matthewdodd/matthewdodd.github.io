               wilful murder of her infant child
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Adolphus.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE - . Q. Are you in the service of Mrs. Plasco - A. Yes. Mr. Plasco is an oil-man, and wine-merchant, in Pall-Mall. I went there three weeks before the prisoner. She came on the 3rd of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she your bed-fellow - A. Yes. When she came first, her size was large. I accused her of being with child, but she denied it. On Saturday she was very ill. I do not think she knew what a situation she was in. On Sunday morning I went to Mr. Green's, at the next door, an apothecary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that it was in March or May - A. I cannot say the month. It is five or six weeks ago. I asked his advice. He gave her some hartshorn. I returned to her. She was then in the privy. I gave to her and told her what Mr. Green's man said to rub her back with it. I then went to do my work, leaving her in the privy. I returned in about a quarter of a hour. This was about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. What situation are you in - A. Housemaid. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18120701-17-deflabel108" type="occupation">cook</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18120701-17-defend246 t18120701-17-deflabel108"></join>. Two of the Miss Plascos came into the kitchen, and asked me for some bread and butter. Susan was then in the privy, about half a dozen steps from the kitchen. After the young ladies were gone (before that I went into the area to get the butter) I saw the situation of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. And you saw the floor discoloured - A. I told her to come in, for fear she should get cold. I then went, and gave the two Miss Plascos some bread and butter. She remained in the privy. I then got my master and mistress's breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that take you - A. About twenty minutes. I then went up into my room to fetch some things for Susan, that I thought necessary: some linen. I returned, and she was still in the privy. I told her to come in, and led her into the kitchen. I then went to clean the privy up, and I heard the baby cry. I screamed out, and said, oh, my God, Susan come here; here is something. She came to me, and bid me not to frighten myself; there was nothing there. I went and lit a candle. She took it out of my hand. I took it from her again, and looked down the privy, and saw the child. I ran up stairs to the young man, the porter, whom I have since married; I told him that she had miscarried. I went down stairs again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the child out of the privy - A. She must have done it. I went down stairs again. She was then taking the baby from the dust-hole, which is close to the privy. The child then appeared to me almost covered with dust from the dust-hole. She had got hold of the middle of the body of the child. The legs were hanging downwards. I then went to the top of the kitchen stairs, in my fright, and came down again, and I missed her. I said, Susan, where are you. She said, I am here. I went to the coal-cellar, and she had got the baby in her hands, holding like a ball. The child was stark naked. I then went up to my mistress, and told her. My mistress told me to run down, and tell her to save the baby, and she would forgive her. I ran down and met her on the first landing. I told her to come up stairs to my mistress. I led her up stairs to my mistress's room.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not deliver to her any message - A. I did not. As I met her on the stairs I told her to come up. My mistress threw a flannel petticoat down the bannisters, to put the baby in: and when she got into my mistress's room my mistress talked to her of her cruelty. Mistress asked her if she would not like to go to bed. She said, she would, if she would let the baby go with her. My mistress said, no, she would not suffer the baby to go out of her sight. The baby then was delivered into my care. In the mean time my master went for Dr. Barry; and Mrs. Hockley, a female assistant, came. She came and looked at the baby, and then went up stairs to Susan. She came down again, and took the baby from me; she washed it and dressed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the child live - A. Until one o'clock. Mr. Sandell, the apothecary, came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the state of the child while it was naked - A. No, not in my fright.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after this, make any search in the prisoner's closet - A. Yes. I looked to see whether there were any baby things there. There were none. She sent me to her box. I did not see any baby things. On the same day, (Sunday) between twelve and one o'clock, I asked Susan, why she did such a rash act. She said, she did not intend to do it until that morning, and then she had made up her mind.</p>
               <p>COURT. The child was alive then - A. The child died at one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When did the prisoner first come to the service - A. On the 3d of February.</p>
               <p>Q. You accused her of being with child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor girl did not increse in size as woman generally do - A. No; she being so far gone.</p>
               <p>Q. On this day you first discovered her in the privy - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She made no concealment of the pains that she was in and you were so kind as to get her something to assist her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the child directly after it was taken out of the privy - A. I did not. When I heard it in the privy I ran away. I was very much frightened indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. When the girl was talking to you on the subject, did not she attribute the pain to another cause - A. No, she did not. I can recollect every thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010033"></xptr> that passed, though I was very much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bid you examine whether there were any child-bed linen in the box - A. Nobody desired me. She sent me to the box.</p>
               <p>Q. As your recollection serves you, you can tell us whether she had not a fall down the kitchen stairs from the top to the bottom - A. She did fall from the top to the bottom: she hurted her elbow, and no where else.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, the privy, like all other privies, had a good deal of soil - A. No. It is a pan there. It runs off like a water-closet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Therefore it could not be got rid of that way - A. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>MRS. HOCKLEY. Q. You are studying midwifery under Dr. Barry - A. Yes. I live in the family, and assist in that department; and I have practice of my own. I was sent by Dr. Barry to this young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Mrs. Plasco's, did you see this child - A. I went up stairs, and went into Mrs. Plasco's room, and it was in the servant's lap, in a flannel dress, as she described. The child was then crying.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by your observations a full-grown child, or not - A. A full-grown child. I went up to the mother, to see if she was safe. I found her quite safe. I left her, and went down to the infant. I washed it. It was voiding blood from its mouth. It was a god deal bruised. There were several bruises: one on the temple, and another on the back: and there were small coals on it, particularly on its head, eyes, nose, and mouth. I washed it all over. I could not get the coals out of its eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did it live after you came - A. I came a little after nine; it died a little after one.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, from your judgment, ascribe now the cause of the death of that child - A. Doubtless, one or other of these bruises on the temple. There were two or three bruises on the temple; and one of them was the cause of that bleeding. The child seemed to die quietly and slowly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you saw the child, was it a premature birth - A. It might be two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a premature birth be occasioned by a fall - A. It might have that effect. There was a bruise on the child's forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the child's head happened to beat against the pan, might not that occasion a contusion - A. It might have that effect.</p>

            , who had been recently delivered. On my entering the drawing-room I found the child in the possession of Mrs. Hockley. Having understood the nature of the birth of the child, I looked at the child, and found it bleeding copiously at both nostrils. I requested Mrs. Hockley to undress the child, that I might examine the child. Having so done, Mrs. Hockley attempted to give the child some warm milk: it could not swallow it. I examined the child very minutely. I saw no particular marks of violence upon the child that should occasion its speedy death. Having understood the nature of its birth, I was then led to an opinion how the child might find its death. The child, upon coming into the world, received a little pressure, a blow upon the head, from which I was led to believe one of the minute small vessels of the brain had given way, from that pressure, which was the cause of that effusion of blood from each nostril, and from that circumstance convulsive motions were produced, that lastly ended in the death of the infant. That is all the circumstances that I know of the death of the child. To the best of my belief, the effusion of blood from the brain occasioned the blood both coming out of the nostrils and out of the mouth, which blood naturally congealed in the throat. I laid hold of the baby, and put it in one position, and then in another, and then it did not bleed. I think the child was a full nine months child. I am of opinion that the bruises were occasioned by the fall of the child, which might arise by the act of accident, and not by design. I believe so: and I think it was the first child.</p>

I was in the tap-room of the Vine public-house, near the bar—I saw the prisoner standing with her back to me near the bar, with something wrapped up in a rag in her hand—I was opening the door, and she turned round and said, "What did you pull my gown for?"—I turned round, and as soon as she could speak, she struck me with a knife, with both her hands—she had the knife in the rag—she gave me a wound on my wrist and on my elbow—that on my elbow bled—I was obliged to go to a surgeon—I had not spoken to her, or done anything to her—she was intoxicated a little.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Loveland, who is Clerk to the Board of Guardians of St. Luke, Chelsea. It was the prisoner's duty to pay 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week up to the 10th Nov. to Miss Ashe—I have got his account, where he has put down the payment of these sums—if he received from her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the amount of the sum that had been paid out, it was his duty to pay that to the treasurer forthwith—I have his pass book here—he has never 'accounted to me for that sum—on 22nd Nov. he was before the Board, and was suspended for a week, in order to get his books ready, and before the next meeting he was away—these entries are to Emma Ashe.</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you present at any time when the prisoner was before the Board, when an application from Miss Ashe was before them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he did not make application for his salary—I have no recollection of an application for his salary being made in my presence—an application may have been made during that period—his salary was paid quarterly, at the usual quarter days.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ascertained that from the prisoner himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from his own books—he has never made them up finally; he was sus<lb></lb>pended for a week to make up his accounts, but he has not done that—there was a book in which he should enter sums that he received—they would be entered on one side as received, and on the other as paid to the treasurer—I have seen him make entries in that book, but I was not in the habit of seeing it—that book is not here.</p>

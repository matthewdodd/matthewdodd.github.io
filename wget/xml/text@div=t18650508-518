                  </hi>. I am verger of the church of St. Thomas, Upper Clapton—on 5th April I left the church at twelve o'clock, after morning service—I was by the church after that, but not to notice anything wrong—I left it at twelve quite secure in every way—I passed it in the evening, but could not see the windows—next morning I was called into the church about twenty minutes before eight—I found everything in confusion, books strewed about the floor, and all the gentlemen's robes gone out of the vestry, surplices, gowns and hoods and table linen and other articles—I had left them secure in a cupboard locked, anyone could get access to the church by climbing the wall and getting in at the window, that was the way it was done—three of the alms boxes were broken open and the contents taken out, I do not know what was in them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, living at Spring-hill, Upper Clapton—on 6th April I was going to my work at five minutes to six in the morning—I had to pass by St. Thomas' Church and I saw three men come out at Mr. Kingsford's side door, he is the incumbent, his house is next to the church—the two prisoners are two of the men—I recognised Burnett as the first man who came out—I recognised him at Clerkenwell on the 10th, he was with about fourteen others and I picked him out, the other prisoner was also there—I picked him out, I knew him in a moment by the mole on the side of his face—he was standing alone, and I was told to go and look at him to see whether he was the person—they had no bundles with them, but they were bulky round the waist.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burnett's Defence.</hi> The witness must be mistaken, there are hundreds of people about early in the morning; if he had seen us leaving the church he would have followed us and given us in charge. The reason I am unable to call a witness is, that my sister was nurse to an invalid lady, and the very morning this happened she was sent away into the country with this lady, and I don't know where she has gone to. I don't know why he should not be able to swear to the other one if ha saw us all leave the place together.</p>

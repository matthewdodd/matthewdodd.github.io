                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger at 34, New North-street, Finsbury. On the night of 3d November last, about twenty minutes past 12, I was coming down Long-lane in the direction of Barbican—I saw the prisoner Burridge there—we walked together some short distance, about fifty or sixty yards by ourselves—when we had got that distance Daley joined us—we went some short distance up a court—Burridge wanted me to go home with her, which I refused—they continued to talk to me to some extent and while so doing they robbed me of my watch—I felt my watch safe while I was in the court, in my waistcoat pocket—I found it was gone the moment they ran away—I called for the assistance of the police—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch—it was fastened by a chain—it is <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> the ring now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 160). On the morning of 4th November last, about 1 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Police," and went towards Barbican—I saw the two prisoners running in the direction of Aldersgate-street, and the prosecutor running along the road in a staggering manner—I ran in the same direction, and he pointed out the two females on ahead as having robbed him of his watch—I followed them; and overtook them as they turned into Aldersgate-street—they were running—Daley was a few yards in advance of the other—I followed Burridge; as she turned round Aldersgate-street, she threw her shawl from her shoulders and held it in her left hand, which formed a festoon behind her, and I, treading on it, nearly tripped me up—I eventually took her into custody—I took them both at one time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you do that, if one was five or six yards ahead of the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In being tripped up I ran against Burridge and so ran her against the other prisoner—I do not think she held her shawl as she did, purposely to trip me up, but it had that effect upon me—when I saw these two women they were running—the prosecutor was in such a state that I do not think he was capable of telling what they were doing—I first saw them about twenty or thirty yards from the court—I did not say to the prosecutor, "There are the two women that robbed you of your watch"—he pointed them out—I did not find any watch—I found nothing on Burridge that belonged to the prosecutor.</p>

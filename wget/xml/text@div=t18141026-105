               <p>JOSEPH PELLIS. I am an officer, On the night of the 10th of October, a quarter before nine o'clock. I stopped the prisoner in Broad-street, St. George's parish. He was carrying across his shoulder a bag and basket. I asked him what he had got there; he told me oil, he said he come from Mr. Hubbuck, and he was going to carry it to Mr. Hubbuck's customers in Whitechapel. I had a suspicion all was not right; I took him into a public house and asked him for a bill of parcels; he said he had none. I asked him where he was going to carry it to? he said to a private house, but he did not know the name. I asked him if Mr. Hubbuck knew of it? He said he did not. On examining the can, I found two gallons of sperm oil, and a gallon of turpentine in the can in the bag. I took him to the office; I then went and searched his house, and in the cupboard in the first lower room, I found a tin can, containing two gallons of lamp oil, and a bladder containing a pint and a half of turpentine, and ten pound weight of red paint, and two pounds of stone blue, the whole of which I took to the office. I asked the prisoner about them; he said he brought them from Mr. Hubbuck's a little at a time, his wife had been very ill, and he was in great distress. This is the property</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the whole of the tin cans; I know the blue, and the tin can containing the red paint. I dealt in all the the articles.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner behaved much to my satisfaction for many years</p>

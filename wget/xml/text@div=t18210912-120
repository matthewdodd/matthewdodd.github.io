            . I belong to the Thames police. I was in Cockspur-street, and saw the prisoner at the print-shop, in company with another boy, and two others stood on one side; I saw him lift the prosecutor's coat pocket up three times, and the fourth time he got the handkerchief out. I immediately collared him and took it from his bosom, where I had seen him put it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Why did you not tell the prosecutor - A. Because two boys were in company - I took the other boy too.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

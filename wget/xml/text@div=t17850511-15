               <p>Prisoner. If you was to inspect into that woman's character you would not believe what she says; ask her if she knows Mr. Williams? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he attend at the time we were committed, and tell her she deserved more to be taken up than us; and did not he say, you know very well I could take you up directly? - You hold your tongue a minute, you see I took a ready furnished room, and while I was sitting with my fruit a woman stole the sheets and a silk handkerchief.</p>

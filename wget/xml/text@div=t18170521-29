On Tuesday, the 29th of April, I tied my mares up in the stable, but did not lock it - I lost them. I found them on the 1st of May, at the Cherry Tree public-house, in Kingsland-road, tied up in a stable-Kingsland-road is sixty-four miles from my residence-the prisoner was there also. The best of them was worth 15l., and the other not more than 2l.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live in Church-lane, Mile-end, New-town. I was at the White Hart at four o'clock in the afternoon; the landlord introduced me to the prisoner - the prisoner shewed me two colts - He asked me 9l. for the best - I did not think it worth that money; I bought the other of him for 3l. 2s. 6d. He said they belonged to his brother, who was in distress for rent. I asked him where they came from - He said he brought them from Cambridge, and if he could not sell them, they must go to Smithfield market. I asked him several questions - He did not seem to know any person at Cambridge. I told him to meet me at the Cherry Tree, and I would have an officer there, and if he did not come by them honestly, he had better not meet me. He came - I had an officer there, and he secured him. Yarrow came in about an hour after and claimed them. He still said they were his brother's. When he was being locked up, he said he lived at Aldgate - I found he did not live there. Before that he said he lived at Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. After he was taken, he said he was employed by a man to sell them, and if he could not, he was to meet him at Shoreditch about nine o'clock - I did not take him there. He said, a strange man overtook him, and asked him to sell them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody. The mares were delivered to me. He said they were given to him to take on the road by a man, and that he was to go on till the man overtook him. He said nothing about selling them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man met me, and asked me to take them on till he overtook me, and he would give me 3s. I never saw him afterwards.</p>

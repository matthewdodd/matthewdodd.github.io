                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday morning, the 9th of February, I was going up York-street, Bedford-square, Commercial-road; the clock struck seven as I turned out of the square into York-street, it was just day-light—I saw Germaine and Bruce—Germaine had a bundle on his right arm, in a blue handkerchief—they were close together, side by side—I was running up the street—just as they got to the top of the street I laid hold of Germaine—Bruce turned his eye over his left shoulder, and seeing me, ran away—Germaine said, "You have got me at last, you have long wished it; I cannot halloo, I have been very lucky"—I took the bun<lb></lb>dle, and took him to the station; searched him, and found a skeleton key in his pocket—I charged him with having these things in his possession and not giving a satisfactory account—the bundle contained a counterpane and two sheets—I do not recollect his making any reply—after he was charged I went to search for Bruce—I went to a lodging-house, No. 15, rose-lane, Wentworth-street, Spitalfields—I went up into the top room, occu<lb></lb>pied by Bruce and Proby, and found him there, with Proby's sister—Bruce took his coat off, hung it across a line, and threw himself on the bed with the remainder of his clothes on, smoking a short pipe—I said "Get up, Bruce, I want you"—I knew him before—he said, "What for?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280171"></xptr>
               <p>—I said, "For being concerned in the robbery with Germaine, that you got away from me this morning"—Proby said, "Oh, George, I would see the b—d—before I would go with him"—he told her not to halloo—I then pot the handcuffs upon him, locked the door, and put the key into my pocket—I then commenced searching the room, and found three files in a cupboard—on searching further I found some duplicates, and asked proby what they were—she said they were all hers—one of them referred to a table-cloth pledged for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at Mr. Soame's, in Brick-lane—I searched another room, but found nothing—I took Bruce and proby to the station, and charged them with being concerned with Germaine—I could not find any owner of the property that day—the skeleton key that I found on germaine opened the door of Mr. Hunt, no. 6, Alfred-place, Alfred-street, Stepney, who had been robbed of a tablecloth on the 9th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hunt, of No. 6, Alfred-place, in the parish of Stepney. On Wednesday morning, the 9th of February, I got up about six o'clock, or a little after—I perceived a light on the stair-case before I got up—I had just awoke, and my bed room door was open—I hallooed out, "Hunt, is that you?" thinking at first it was my hus<lb></lb>band up, but he said, "No, I am here"—I said, "there is a light on the stairs"—we got up, my husband went down first, and I directly after—I found the street-door wide open, which I had locked the night before when I went to bed—i and my husband had gone to bed together about eleven—I missed a table-cloth from a chair in the par lour, which I had folded up and placed there between ten and eleven the night before, after supper—it was there when I went to bed—there was 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the kitchen mantel-piece which was not taken, and a bundle on the stairs—I suppose my hallooing out "Who's that?" directly I saw the light, disturbed them—the street-door could not be opened from the outside without a key—This table-cloth now produced is ours—I know it by the way in which I folded it up and by a pickle stain on it—it is the one I have lost.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM PARDOE BIDDLE. I am in the employ of Mr. Soames a pawnbroker, in Brick-lane, Spitalfields—I took this table-cloth in pledge from Proby on the 9th of February, in the name of Ann Carthy—I had seen her before, but not very often—I can swear to her—I took in two pledge at the same time of her—the duplicate I gave her has been produced by the officer.</p>

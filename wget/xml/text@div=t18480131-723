                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On 21st Dec. I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Con<lb></lb>stance</hi> at the East Country Dock, Rotherhithe, unloading deals by shoving them through the <hi rend="italic">mid-ship</hi> port-hole—there were four or five others ar work at that hole—I did not see the prisoner outside the port—he was mate—I had seen him on board shortly before—as we pushed the deals through, we knocked off a piece of wood, which was nailed on again by some one outside—it was knocked off again, and was nailed on each time—I felt a blow of a hammer in my eye—it was thrown from the outside of the ship, through the port-hole—I did not bear anything said when it was thrown—it knocked me immediately, and I was taken to the <hi rend="italic">Dreadnought</hi> hospital ship.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

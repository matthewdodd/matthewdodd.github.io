                  </hi>. I live in Duke-street, Southwark. On Saturday afternoon, the 29th of May, I was coming into the City—on London-bridge, near the steps leading down to the water on the London side, I felt something trip against my heel—I turned round and saw the prisoner close behind me—I thought he looked rather suspicious, and put my hand to my pocket and found my handkerchief was gone—I followed him to the top of the steps leading to Thames-street, where there was a police-man, but before I could speak to him the prisoner ran down the steps—the policeman and I followed him, but lost sight of him—we went under the arch and up the steps on the other side, and walked half-way across the bridge, but could not see him, but on our way back I saw him—I saw the policeman take him, and find my handkerchief on him—I am quite sure of his person.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Half-way public house, in Webber-street, Blackfriar's-road. On 27th Jan. I was called by my wife to give change—I came into the bar, and I saw Richardson and Spring there, with another, whom I cannot recognise positively—I saw a half sovereign lying on the counter, close by the side of the prisoners—my wife said, "Change this half sovereign"—I took it and tried it, and it was a good one—I put it down, and Richardson said, "Here, governor, put that back, I will pay you for that, "and he put his hand in his pocket—hearing that I did not change the half sovereign, I left it for a moment on the counter, and a gentleman on the other side said, "Draw me a glass of ale"—I served that customer, and then my attention was called back to the half sovereign; I said, "Who is going to pay me?" and Spring said, "Here governor, take it out of this," and he pushed the half sovereign towards the edge of the counter, where I stood—I took it up and placed it in my purse, where I had no other gold; I gave the change to Spring, and they went away immediately—'they had drank some of the ale which they had ordered, but left the greater part, and my suspicion was excited—I took the half sovereign out of my purse and tried it in the detector, and bent it in half (I had tried the first half sovereign in the detector and it was good)—I bent it back again, and put it in my purse, and the next morning I took it out of the purse and put it in my desk—I kept it by itself, under a glass first; I afterwards took it up stairs, and put it in my desk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Bell public house, in Friar-street Blackfriars-road. On 5th Feb., between 4 and 5 o'clock, the three prisoners came in together—Richardson asked for half a quartern of gin and cold water—he threw down half a crown to pay for it—I took it up, and saw it was good by looking at it—I did not put it in the detector—I can tell by looking whether it is good or bad—I am in the habit of taking a good deal of money—when I had taken the half crown, Spring said, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> I will pay for that gin," and he tendered me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was going to take up the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Richardson said, "What are you going to do?" I said, "To take the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said "You shan't do that," and he tendered me a bad half crown in place of the good one which he had taken up—I could see the difference between the two half crowns, because we have had that done so frequently before—I told him of it at the time, and gave the bad half crown back to Richardson—Richardson said to Spring, "What did she say?" or words to that effect—I am not very quick of hearing, I only hear on one side—Richardson took up the half crown, Spring paid me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the gin, and they all went away together.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a cigar shop, in Kingsland-road. The prisoner came there about 10 o'clock on 19th March—he asked for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cigars—I asked which he would like—he looked towards the Pickwicks—I picked out seven, and wrapped them in paper, and he gave me half a crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he went away—I put the half crown in the till—I had no other half crown there—when I closed the shop I took it out and put it in a small box, and took it to my bed room—the next morning I sent it by my servant to the butcher's—she brought it me back—I asked two persons in the shop if it was good—one said he wished he had a pocket full—the other said it was bad—I afterwards took it to the butter shop and they broke it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the last witness. I remember on the Tuesday being sent to the butcher's, opposite where we live, with a half crown—they told me it was bad, and I brought it back—I am sure I brought the same back, and gave it to my mistress—there were two gentle<lb></lb>men in the shop, and they looked at it—I afterwards took the same half crown to the butter shop, and they broke it in pieces—I brought back one of the pieces to my mistress—I was in the shop on the Monday night; I noticed the prisoner, but not to swear to him.</p>

On 19th March the prisoner came to my house, at a little after 11 o'clock, for a quartern of gin; he put a bottle on the counter—I served him, and he put down a bad half crown; I weighed it, and found it was bad—I told him I thought it was bad, and I was justified in detaining him and the half crown—I gave him into custody, and gave the half crown to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not tell you he did not know it was bad? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said he got it from his employer on Saturday night, and that he lived in Fitzroy-square—I told him I thought it was a late hour to come so far for a quartern of gin—he said that he had been out on the drink with a party he knew, he might say a fellow workman—there were a great many other persons round, but not my family—I knew most of them; they were neighbours—I have not any of them here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Bridge-street, Homerton, and am a shoe-maker—on the night of 9th May, between 9 and 10, I was at home, with my sister, mother, brother, the prisoner, and two more, next-door neighbours—the prisoner was causing a disturbance, I asked him to go to bed, and he would not—he was a lodger in our house—he swore at me, and said he would murder me; and he said, "I won't go to bed; I will stab you"—he then took this hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his pocket—I ran round the table, and he reached over the table with it, and stuck it in the palm of my left hand—I caught hold of the hook with my right hand, and got it out of my hand—he then said, "I will stick it in you"—I said, "You have done it"—I asked my sister to catch hold of the hook; I let go of it, and fell to the ground—I was faint with pain and loss of blood—my hand was bleeding very much—I have had pain from it since—when I got to Worship-street, the doctor attended me—it was ten days before I could go to work.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 125). I took the prisoner into custody, and took this book from his right-hand pocket—he said the wound in the hand had been done in a struggle between himself and the last witness and another brother—he was in a very nervous state, and appeared to me as if he had been drinking very much; he was trembling very much—the prosecutor was quite sober—his hand was bound up—there was a quantity of blood about the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I and my wife had been having some words about her being out so late. She had given me some cause for jealousy. The prosecutor and his brother were sent for to the public-house, and I had a struggle with them when they came back, and they gave me a wound on the face. It was in the course of the struggle that his hand was torn.</p>

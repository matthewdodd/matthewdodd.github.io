                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 55.) I live in St. Marylebone. On Thursday morning, the 21st of Nov., at one o'clock, I saw the prisoner on my beat, leaning on a post, in Lisson-grove, at the corner of Devonshire-street—he was alone, and had not any parcel with him then—I saw him again about ten minutes to two, in company with a young man whom I have known five years—he is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-driver, and goes by the name of Cackham—the prisoner had this bundle of leather under his coat—I said, "What have you got there? "—he said, "I don't know"—I felt the top of it, and said, "It is top-boots, is it not? "—he said, "I don't know; it is leather"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "Bought it "—I said, "What are you going to do with it?"—he said, "My brother<lb></lb>in-law will have it as soon as I get home"—I asked where he bought it—he said, "That is my business"—I said, "My business is to take you to the station-house"—he said, Oh, he would go to the station-house; and when we got there he said his fellow-servant gave it to him to mind till the morning, that his fellow-servant had got a long way to go, and he was to meet him in the morning in Norfolk-street—he was taken before a Magistrate, and remanded for a week, and three or four days after I found the owner.</p>

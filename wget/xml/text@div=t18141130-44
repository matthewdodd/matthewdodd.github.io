               <p>Q. On Monday evening, the 14th of November, how late were you in your shop - A. About seven o'clock the candles were lighted: I have a room behind the shop; I had occasion to go from the shop to that room; I returned to the shop; I thought I heard a noise in the parlour; I looked into the shop. I saw all was safe; then I went into the parlour again; I heard a pull at the flannel. I went in, and the flannel was gone; when I heard this pull at the flannel, I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your window shutters up - No; a door opens from the shop into the street; that door was shut with a catch and a handle; the window does not open; I missed the flannel.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 14th of November I and Wilson were on duty; we were going out; we saw the prisoner and another man coming down Tottenham-court-road by Pierey-street; he that is not in custody came and nudged the prisoner on the shoulder; he dropped the flannel; it was covered over with a great coat; I fitted the great coat on; it fitted the prisoner; I ran after this man; and apprehended him at the bottom of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that flannel, is that flannel yours - A. Yes; I now hold a part of it in my hand; there is the remains of the mark which I am in the habit of making on the flannel. This is the flannel that I lost, I am sure.</p>

               <p>EDMUND WILSON. I picked up the flannel; it is the same flannel that the prisoner had; it was covered over with a great coat and an apron.</p>

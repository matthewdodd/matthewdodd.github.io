                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to my brother, Charles Davey, of 4, Castle-court, Lawrence-lane, licensed victuallet—the female prisoner was in our employ on 22d April, as housemaid—on that day, about 2 o'clock, I saw her drawing gin from the bar into a soda water-bottle—she had no right to do, that, or to be there—I went and asked her what she had—she secreted it under her dress, and at first said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have some<lb></lb>thing," and she said that it was only a little gin—she was soon afterwards given into custody—her boxes were searched in my presence, and a quantity of articles were found there belonging to my brother, tea, sugar, table-cloths, and other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the officer took a key from her at the station, and returned to our house with one, and in my presence he unlocked a box, in which some more keys were found, one of which fitted my brother's drawer where plated spoons and forks were kept—these things were kept in my brother's bed-room—the prisoner as housemaid had entrance there.</p>

I am a detective officer in the City-police—from in<lb></lb>structions I received, I went with Mr. Charles Davey to Great Westmore-land-street, Pimlico—Clark's wife answered the door—I asked if Mr. Clark was at home—she said, "He is not, but I expect him home in a few minutes"—I west in and waited—the prisoner Clark came, and I asked him if he knew a person named Caroline Hodson—Clark and his wife both answered, yes, they did very well—I said, "She is in custody, on a charge of felony,</p>

               <p>and in her possesssion is found a letter purporting to be written by you, Clark, in which you acknowledge the receipt of a certain panel and some smokes, and other articles; and asking for a bottle of gin"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter—I then showed it to him, and asked bin if it was his writing, and he said it was—it is dated 3rd February, 1861—it Last no reference to this matter, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> it led to my calling on Clark—I then informed him that I was an officer, and wished to search his house—he said, "You are welcome to do so"—I searched, and in a box I found a towel marked "Davey," and, in, a work-box, eleven spoons, German silver, I think; also six forks, one marked "Citizen"—in a bed-room I found two sheets, one marked "Davey," and the other not marked—in consequence of further information we searched on the following day, the 29th, and found in a bed-room two blankets, and in a bed-room occupied by the prisoner Clark's brother, I found a fast containing three duplicates of articles pledged in the name of Mary Ann Clark—they related to a cruet-stand and glasses, a coat, and a toilet-cover marked Davey, which was given up by the pawnbroker, and identified by the prosecutor.</p>

I am a licensed victualler; and keep the Fountain and Star, in Castle-court, Lawrence-lane, in the City—Hodson was my housemaid—while she was with me I very frequently saw the other prisoner come to my house with his wife, Mrs. dark; perhaps about once a mouth—this property found in her beat is mine—the towels found at Clark's house are all mine—there is a toilet-cover, some towels, sheets, and blankets—the toilet-covers were kept in drawers in my sister's room—a key was found which fitted all the drawers in my room—these plaited goods are my property; "Citizen" is on one; my house is the "Citizen luncheon-house"—I identify all these.</p>

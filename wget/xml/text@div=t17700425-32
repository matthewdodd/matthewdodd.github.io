It is about six weeks ago, he came and knocked at my door; I let him in; this was between twelve and one in the night. I went to bed again. I then heard a rumbling in the kitchen. I made my girl get up and see what was the matter. She went, and said, there was a great kettle in the kitchen. Then both the prisoners were in bed together. I made them both get up and carry it away, or, I told them, I would send for an officer, and take them to gaol. They got up, and got a porter, and took it away.

            . I do business for the ship Henrietta; she lay at Deptford at that time. There was a copper lost out of her; it was missed the 19th of March. The ship carried forty-five hands; the copper would dress for so many. It weighed betwixt seventy and eighty pounds weight. The ship is gone to Greenland.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harvey. How much did the copper you carried, weigh?</p>
               <p>Harvey. It weighed about sixty pounds, as near as I can guess.</p>

               <p>There was a mate of a ship came on shore, and asked us to go and do a jobb; his hands were gone on shore. He gave us two shillings each to unmoor the ship; she lay off Prince's stairs. When we had done, Lawson asked me to go and lie with him. There were some men coming up the stairs, called Cole-stairs. As we were near them they dropped something, we picked it up; it was a little kettle. Then the watch was going past eleven. We carried it to Doyle's house, and laid it backwards; the next morning we carried it to Whitechapel, and left it there.</p>

               <p>Simms fell right over the kettle; then we took and carried it to Doyle's; he knew of our coming with it, as well as we. It was a bit of old copper that had not been used for years and years. Harvey was paid for carrying it to Whitechapel. It did not weigh above seventeen pounds, and we had but five pence a pound for it.</p>

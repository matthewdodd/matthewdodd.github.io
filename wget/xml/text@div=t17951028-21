               <p>Q. Did you see or feel it go? - Yes; I did not see the watch in her hand, I felt it go; she calls out, open the door! open the door! and there was another by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they open the door? - Yes, and I got up and forced the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when she went out was the door shut on you? - Yes, and another by the door when I opened the door outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other? - I cannot tell, it was a very dark place, and I laid hold of her, and I said, where is my watch? and she said, what ails the man? come down stairs; and then I went down stairs, and I walked from that door to another, and I stopped by this door, and by and by I see four women coming arm and arm, and the prisoner Roberts was one of the four, and I laid hold of her, and put her in the watch-house. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with this girl you say; was there any other girl with her? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the other girl? - Sunday night there came two girls to our house, the 18th, and told me that this Cole took my watch and planted it in East Smithfield; as soon as they told that to me, the beadle went and took her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again? - Yes; Coombes has it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it in his hands? - The 19th, the Monday as they were tried.</p>

               <p>Q. Cole was not one of the girls that you see in the house? - No, but she was one of the four that was with the other girl when I took her.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in liquor. Had you ever seen Roberts before? - I have seen her many times; I never spoke to her before; but I go a jobbing in that street very often, for my master, and I live close by. I am certain she took the watch from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your's a silver watch? - Yes. My name is inside of it, S. T. smith, 1793.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the public office, Whitechapel. On Monday the 19th, about one or two o'clock, I came to the office, and they told me that these two girls were brought up, and were charged with stealing this man's watch, and I went and found the watch in Amy Cole's bed, inside, sewed up between the slock and the feathers. She gave me the key of the room; there was only one bed in the room.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. I was in this man's company on Saturday night, and he gave me a shilling, and I went down to get something to drink, and I left the candle burning the mean while, and when I came back, the candle was out and he was gone out of the room, and I never see him afterwards, till he came to take me prisoner; he had no watch as ever I see. The house is full of girls, and they have got a great antipathy against me, and I don't know what for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cole. I never see the young man till he came up on Sunday morning, and said, that was the room where he was robbed; and when he came in he said, that was not the room; and he went into the back room, and found nothing, and he said, that he was very confident that this was the girl that took the watch.</p>

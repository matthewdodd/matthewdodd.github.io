               <p>that in consequence of the accounts of the barmaid not being correct, I should have the till made to lock up, and that all the money he received was to be placed in the till, with the exception of what he took for wine and cigars, those being small items, he was to put that by separately, and he would have a sovereign in change, and to purchase any little things that might be re<lb></lb>quisite for the purposes of the business, and such disbursements he was to enter in a book, and produce vouchers for the same, and the money would be made up to him on the following morning from the money in the till, so that he might always have a sovereign intact each day—he said he could not obtain vouchers for everything, but he did for a great many—he was not to pay for anything, according to instructions, without a receipt—I used to open the till and take the money for the first month—I used to go every morning to the bar, open the till, and take an account of the money, and enter the receipts in the prisoner's book, and deduct from those receipts any expenditure he may have made, and then from the till money make good the amount he had spent, and replace the sovereign—when I discontinued doing this I put a clerk of mine named Howse in my place—on Saturday, the 31st October, I communicated with a detective named Lythel—I did not see him markthe money—on the Tuesday, 3rd November, Lythel called at my office—I went to Bow Lane Police-station to see Lythel—I did not go down to the house with him—the prisoner was usually paid his wages on a Monday morning—during the month I had charge of the bar, I allowed him to pay himself on Sunday out of the sovereign, thinking he might want the money, and made it good on the Monday morning—I gave instructions to Howse.</p>

                  </hi>. I was examined at the Police Court when the prisoner was com<lb></lb>mitted for trial, on his behalf—I am in the habit of going round with pork pies for Messrs. Watling—ou Tuesday, 3rd November, I went in due course to the Shakespeare tavern—the prisoner said he wanted two pork pies—I gave them to him and he gave a half-crown and I went on to the Woodin</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLET</hi>. I called with the pies three times a week—there was a man in the cart with me, but I generally got down to serve—if I was on a different round the young man would either send a young boy down or go in himself—the young man went in once or twice when I was with him, but not often—I have served the pies for two years—I cannot say how long, I have served at the Shakespeare—the pies the prisoner had were always one price—I may have served him forty or fifty times, or more or less—I did not see where the money came from with which he paid me—I laid the change down on the counter and did not see where he put it—the vouchers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are from Watling. and Son—such vouchers are given now at the Shakespeare—these goods (<hi rend="italic">referring to vouchers</hi>) were not delivered at the Shakespeare, but at the confectioner's, I expect—"William Morgan "is the signature to the receipt—we had a man in our employ of that name—he has told me he has been driving the cart on that round for the last ten years—I have seen him write receipts, but not those—I never gave a receipt to the prisoner—I said at the Police Court that those vouchers came from the ice shop—I believe I said that I understood receipts were given when the money was paid out of the prisoner's own pocket—I do not exactly remember—the prisoner has asked me for receipts and I told him we did not give bills for rather small amounts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Baxter at the premises in Wheat Sheaf Alley—part of the premises consist of a beer shop and part an ice shop—I have had to apply to the prisoner for change and he has not been able to give it me from the money behind the bar, and on a Sunday he has given it me out of his own pocket when I have been outside with a stall for ginger beer.</p>

The coins I asked change for that I remember were a half-sovereign and a half-crown—I do not recollect any other coin—it was not always on a Sunday—I did not say the half-sovereign was on a Sunday—my applications for change were generally made on a Sunday when I was outside with the ginger beer stall—I cannot tell you of any more than those two instances—I cannot tell how long I have been there—it was last summer I believe, when I went into the employment—that is the nearest date I can give—I cannot tell the date that I took the half-sovereign in to be changed there are other shops round there—lam not known by all the people in the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper's assistant, and live with my father at Islington—I went into the Shakespeare refreshment shop on the 3rd November—the prisoner was serving—some one came in and tendered a coin and I lent the prisoner <hi rend="italic">id.</hi> as he had not enough change—he repaid it to me in coppers—I cannot say whether any other customer came in then—about the same time some one else tendered a half-sovereign and the prisoner applied to me for change but I had not it, so he took all the money from the shelf and the rest from his own pocket—he had to send out to change the half-sovereign immediately afterwards and he put back what he had taken from behind.</p>

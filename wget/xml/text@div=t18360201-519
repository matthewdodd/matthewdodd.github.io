This blanket belongs to me and my sister—she is a partner with me—we live in our nephew's house, the furniture is ours—we lost this on the 17th of January, off the bed where the prisoner slept—he came there on the 11th to lodge, and told us he had got into work at Mr. Frostick's the tailor, on the Saturday night, he went away, and took the half of the blanket—he tore in two—it was found on him.</p>

My aunt lost a blanket—I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him three hundred yards off—I brought him back—we told him he had taken part of the blanket—he said he had not—we asked him if he had any objection to shew us—he said, "No"—he went up stairs, and I went after him—he had it about him, made into drawers, and part under his waistcoat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Cook, and live in Devonshire-place, Paddington, with my brother, Henry Edmonds. The prisoner was his servant for three months—on Thursday, the 25th of September, I missed some shifts—the washerwoman said she thought we should find them in the prisoner's box—I proposed to search her box—she said the washerwoman should not do it—Mrs. Edmonds asked if she would allow her to do it—she said, "Yes"—she took the key from her bosom, unlocked it, and put some of her clothes over a small shawl of Mrs. Edmonds's—we found in the box a shawl, a pair of gloves, an apron, a handkerchief, and a piece of muslin, of Mrs. Edmonds's—the prisoner then said we must have placed them there—my stocking were found in her box—she had worn them, and locked them up In her box—she said she thought one of the children had placed the apron there—she said the shawl her own but I knew it was not—it belongs to Mrs. Edmonds—the child had stained it with currants when she wore in—the stockings and beads belong to me—they correspond exactly with what I have at home—she said she knew nothing about the gloves at all.</p>

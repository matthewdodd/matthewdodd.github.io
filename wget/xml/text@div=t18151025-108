The house where I sleep is divided into three dwellings, the one over the other. On the 25th of this month, at a few minutes before three in the morning, the two prisoners, Smedley and Bevers, came into the room where I sleep, and asked me for my money? I told them I had none. They asked me for some gold? I told them, what there was was about the shop, and then they went and looked for it. They then came and asked me for my burnishing stones. I did not know them before. Then they asked me where my box was. They got five burnishing stones. I told them my box was at the farther end of the shop. They went and broke open a little tea caddy that I had in the shop, which I used to keep my money in; there was no money in it then. I was then dressing myself, when they came to me, and called me a bl - dy b - r, and said, if I did not lie still, they would murder me. I laid still, until they had got out of the shop, and then I followed them down stairs; I put on my trowsers, my waistcoat, and my shoes; I followed them; when I got on the last landing, Bevers came up to me, and told me to go back; I told him, I would not. He told me a second time to go back? I told him I would not. He said, I'd be d - d if I would go back. Then he shoved me against the ladder, which stood on the landing, and then ran down stairs, and he got out, and left Smedley behind him; Smedley was inside the street door; I caught hold of him, and then somebody was pushing the outside of the door, to try to get Smedley out. Smedley then ran up stairs from the first landing on the outside of the house. I then ran out of the yard, and ran after him, and cried murder, and stopped him; he ran up Hemming's row then. When I was fighting with them at the top of the stairs, I got two of their hats; I do not positively know whose hats they were; there were W. B. in one, and a shirt and two muslin handkerchiefs. When I was scuffling with them, one of them caught me by the throat, and tried to gag me; that was Smedley; he got his hand in my mouth, and I bit his fingers. That same day I went out, I saw Smedley and Connor; Connor was an errand boy to my master. I followed them, until I met a man, and told him to mind where they went to, until I fetched Mr. Fitzgerald, who is a saddler, and has the manufactory below ours, in the same house. We pursued them, and took them just by Whitehall, in Parliament-street. I had not seen Connor at all that morning, until I saw him when we pursued and took him. I am an apprentice to Mr. Ingleton. They broke in, by breaking away some wooden bars over the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Beaver and Smedley - A. By the light of the moon, as I lay in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see their faces - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure you saw both of them - A. Yes; they came close to my bed side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bevers. Q. What do you swear to me by - A. By your features.</p>
               <p>- FITZGERALD. All I know is, that when I arrived at about eight o'clock on the morning of the robbery, I found my premises broken open also; I am a saddler; my manufactory is on the same premises; it is a large factory and there are three floors; one door leads to the whole, but each has a separate door, my premises are under Mr. Ingleton's, where Butler sleeps. When I came there in the morning, at about eight o'clock, I perceived the door broken open, the second door of the entrance; there are two doors in the entrance; there is an outer door; then at the end of the passage there is another door, leading to the factories. It was the second door which was broken; and as I went up to the counting house, I perceived the window was open, and the different drawers all knocked about the floor; I had been robbed too. I found a hat which is here.</p>

            . I was sent for at about four o'clock on the afternoon after the robbery was committed. When I came into the workshop, there was Connor and Smedley, whom they gave into my charge. I then took them to St. Martin's watchhouse; and got information where the third man was to be found, at No. 30, Orchard street, Westminster. I took another with me, and went and found out the room in which he lived, and found him at home; he was at tea. I asked him if he knew any one of the name of Smedley or Connor? he hesitated, and then said he knew them a little. Then I told him what I came upon, and that he was suspected to be one of the party. With that I took him into custody, together with the hat, and brought him to St. Martin's. I found out on Thursday, that five burnishing stones were pledged in Smith street, Westminster. The pawnbroker is here.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Fitzgerald came in the morning to Bow street and stated the particulars of the robbery, and I went with him. On examining the premises, I found that a sort of railing, which runs over the outer door, and along the lower part of the premises was broken; and when two or three bars of this were removed, there would be room for a man to get in without disturbing the fastening of the outer door. Then you turn to the left, and there is a staircase, at the bottom of which, there is a strong door before you come to Mr. Fitzgerald's door. A considerable part of the wood of this door was cut away, to get at a strong lock, so as to shove it open. Then the stair case is open to the top of the house. On coming to Mr Fitzgerald's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250039"></xptr>factory door, there is a place large enough to admit a hand to the inside, where I am given to understand the persons in his employment hang the key, for each others convenience. This door had not been broken, but had been opened with the key; then they can go from there up another flight of stairs to Mr. Ingleton's; Mrs. Ingleton's warehouse is made secure by a flap door, so that that was forced, and by that means, the bolt pushed up. When Butler goes up of a night, he bolts this after him, and then nobody can get in there without bursting this flap door up. These things were given to me. (Witness here produced two neckerchiefs, one shirt, and a hat, marked on the inside W. B. another old hat, a tinder box, and a dark lanthorn.) I went in search of the prisoners, and whilst I was gone, they were taken.</p>

            . I made this trap door fast, and put the keys on the inside, and went to bed at half after nine. When I examined it the next morning, I found that the staple was forced, and laying some distance from the trap door, and the keys which I always leave in the lock, to prevent any one putting false keys in, were taken out. The shirt and two handkerchiefs belong to Mr. Fitzgerald. I found one of these hats inside the door, and the other directly I got out, it was upon the premises; I do not know whose hats they are.</p>
               <p>- Fitzgerald. I found one hat in my counting house. The key of my factory was generally hung up on the inside, in a place where the workmen could get it, to let themselves in of a morning. I know the shirt and the handkerchiefs to be my property. I had left them in a trunk on my premises. The new hat which was found at Bevers's, is mine.</p>

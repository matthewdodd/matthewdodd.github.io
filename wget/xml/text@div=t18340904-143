            . I am a coppersmith. I was in the White Raven on Saturday, the 5th of July - the deceased, I believe, did something which vexed Davidson, and in the course of the evening they got angry together - I do not remember their going out of the room - I went into the back yard, and left them - Clubb came into the yard afterwards, and called me - he unbuttoned his trowsers, and showed me some blood on the lower part of his shirt - I believe he did not know at that time that he had been stabbed - there was a great deal of blood on that part of his shirt which a wound in the stomach would make - I saw the policeman come into the yard - the prisoner jumped out of the window - the policeman followed and seized him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. I believe Clubb was a much stronger man than the prisoner? A. He was rather stronger.</p>

            . On the evening of the 5th of July, I was at the White Raven. I am servant there - I found Clubb and the prisoner quarrelling - I was in the skittle-ground - I saw Clubb come out of the room first, and in a few minutes the prisoner followed him, and stood in the passage - the prisoner was not trying to push out - he was prevented by one of his fellow-workmen - he got out in five minutes, or better, and when he got out, I saw a few blows exchanged - I did not see who struck first - I saw both the prisoner and the deceased strike - I saw the prisoner on the ground three times - I saw Clubb struck once on the stomach, and once on the head - as the prisoner was going to strike him on the stomach, I saw him deliberately put his hand into his pocket, draw it out again, and then strike him in the stomach - they were both in a very great passion - the prisoner had been down twice before this took place - he was not exactly knocked down - he laid down more out of cowardice than any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he was in the passage, was not Clubb calling on him to come out to fight, and taunting and challenging him? A. Yes, he was - Clubb took him by the collar, and pulled him out to fight - Clubb was the best fighter, and the strongest man - the prisoner would have had no chance with him - when he fell, it was because he found he was opposed to a stronger man - the last time he was on the ground, Clubb tried to strike him while he was down, and was prevented - the prisoner had laid down- the blow was struck on the stomach before the prisoner laid down - the deceased did not seem as if any thing ailed him after he received the blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner would not get up, what did Clubb do? A. He stood swearing, and taking very great oaths what he would do if he got up - the prisoner did not wish to get up - he was afraid of him - I think he had had enough of it.</p>

I was in the public-house, at the bar, taking a glass of something - I saw Clubb come out of the parlour - he rushed past me into the street, as if he was in a great passion - soon after I saw the prisoner come out of the room - he passed me quickly as I stood at the bar - as he passed me, there appeared to me in his right hand something like the end of a handle - I could not see of what - his hand was closed, as if he had something in it, but I cannot describe it - he appeared very angry also - I saw a scuffle between them opposite the door, but I never went out - the prisoner was down twice in my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him before the confusion began in the room? A. No; I saw nothing in the parlour.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. William Clubb was brought there on the 5th of July, with a wound on the lower part of the chest, rather inclining to the right side, just about the right groin - I should imagine it was inflicted by some sharp instrument - a penknife, I should think, would do it - he lived from the Saturday night till the Thursday following - I am of opinion, his death was caused by inflammation produced by the wound - I examined the body after death - the wound had penetrated into the cavity of the chest, which would be about an inch - he was a very muscular strong man - I have not a doubt that the wound produced the inflammation,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040072"></xptr>which caused his death - it was bleeding at the time he was brought in - it was a sort of wound a person might receive without being conscious of it - it would not produce a prostration of strength for some minutes - that would arise from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How deep was the wound? A. About an inch - it was a traverse wound - not circular - the wound was not necessarily mortal, if inflammation had not intervened - the aperture was not at all convex that I observed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could such a wound as that be inflicted by a steel pen? A. I think not; I have not a very clear opinion of that, but I do not think it would produce such a wound.</p>

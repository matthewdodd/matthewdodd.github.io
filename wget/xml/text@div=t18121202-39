               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you know her - A. I have seen her a great many times. She came to my shop on the 22d of November last. At the time that she came into my shop, I was in the accompting house, which is attached to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in your shop - A. No. A clerk of Mr. Baker was in the accompting house with me. As soon as I saw the prisoner in the shop, I left him, and went up directly to the prisoner. She had a very large band box with her, which laid on the ground, which created some suspicion. I walked to her in the front of the counter, and asked her what she wanted; she answered, a quarter of a pound of butter, at sixteen pence a pound. She had a large cloak on her, and appeared agitated. I suspected her, from her appearance; and I asked her if she had done any thing wrong, and why she was agitated. She said, she had not. I then moved her left arm; and when I lifted up her left arm, the ham fell from under her arm. This is the ham; it is mine. It has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it is your ham - A. I have many hams laying in the front of my counter. I am positive it is my ham. I challenged her, how the ham should fall from under her arm; she said, it fell from off a pile of hams.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a pile of hams near where she stood - A. No; a few feet off, not directly near. The ham did not fall until I lifted up her arm. It is a Westmoreland ham. It is peculiar in my trade. It is different from a Yorkshire ham; and every factor cuts them in a different way. I think, positively, that this ham stood upon that pile of hams in the morning. I did not miss the ham until it fell from under her cloak. I shewed her the place where she took it from. I said, this ham you took off this pile. She said, she never saw the ham until I touched it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was carrying a band box. I was moving my things. I went into this gentleman's shop. I saw he had a suspicion of me. I opened the band box. He lifted up the side of my cloak. I stood up to let the gentleman see I had nothing. The hams were all laying close; he took up a loose ham, and said, d - n your eyes, you have got a long cloak on. He kicked me, and made great riot. He sent for a constable. The constable came and took me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not kick her. She made a great riot. I only pushed her, when I saw the ham fall from her.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Hodgson in the accompting house. I saw the ham drop from under the prisoner's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Hodgson go up to her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike her - A. No; he pushed her two or three times after the ham fell. I saw the ham fall from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of this ham - A. It cost me twelve shillings.</p>

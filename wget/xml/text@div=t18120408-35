            . Q. You are a marshalman of the City - A. I am. On the 8th of March last I went to Mr. Pierson's house; I searched the prisoner's box in her presence.</p>
               <p>Q. On your searching the box did you observe her do any thing - A. Before I searched the box she put her hand into the box and catched out a brown paper parcel before I began to search; she endeavoured to secrete it under her clothes; I caught it from her. Upon opening the paper parcel they appeared to be two bank dollars; upon further examination one turned out to be a bad one; there was a three shilling token, an eighteen penny token, and ten shillings; I then proceeded to search her box, and after I took all the clothes out of the box I saw a quantity of silver laying at the bottom of the box, it contained just the quantity that Mr. Pierson said he had lost. It was loose at the bottom of the box; two three shilling tokens, three eighteen penny tokens, five shillings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080031"></xptr> and two sixpences; I then asked the prisoner how she came by it; she said that she had not taken it all from Mr. Pierson but some of it was what she had from her friends upon her giving that answer; Mr. Pierson, who was close behind, said, if it is the money that Mr. Pierson has lost, it is all marked. We looked it over minutely, and we found every piece marked as Mrs. Pierson had described. I had six penny-pieces produced to me; I cannot say where they were found they were brought to me at the table by one of the maid servants.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner, I believe, had been apprenticed to you from the Asylum - A. She had so, she had been with me near two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lately missed your money - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And in consequence of that you had marked your money - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the officer searched the prisoners box - A. I was not present; I saw the money produced.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brand. Shew first the three shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pierson. This was marked with a cross under the word token.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the eighteen-penny pieces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pierson. The marks were not put by me, but this is that I had in my purse marked, they were marked by a young gentleman in my house, under my inspection.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. In consequence of suspicion that you entertained to discover who the thief was when did you begin to mark any of the money - A. On Saturday the 7th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark any before Saturday - A. No, I did not. The eighteen-penny pieces were marked on Saturday night, they were put into a yellow bag or purse, and put into my breeches pocket; my breeches were up in my chamber on a chair back near my bedside.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of coming into your chamber in the morning before you were up for the purpose of lighting your fire - A. She was. It was in the same purse in my pocket that I had before missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning of the 8th did the prisoner come into your chamber - A. She did, as usual to light the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that while she was in the room she was near where your breeches were - A. She was, it was near the fire place, she could not help being near the fire place, after she left the room; I suspected that something had been done, and the officer came within ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to examine the bag in your breeches what did you find was missing - A. Sixteen and sixpence in all; consisting of five one-shilling pieces, two sixpenny pieces, two three-shilling pieces, and three eighteen-penny tokens, and they were all marked, and they were all found by Brand in her box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How old is this poor girl - A. She is sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. You took her from the Asylum - A. I did, in the year 1810; she has been with me two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the females in the house always upon good terms with her with respect to jealousy - A. I do not know with respect to jealousy.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you in the house - A. Two servant maids, who live in the same room with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. To your knowledge had any other servant been in your chamber that morning - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel; called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

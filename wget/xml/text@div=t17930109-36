I had not missed such property, it appears to be watch keys, but about four months since, I found I had lost some gold watch keys, and a part of a gold seal, three links of a chain I had in the shop was gone, the whole weight of the chain was originally ten penny weights, and it was reduced to nearly eight penny weights and there is about three links among these pieces of gold, I can swear it to be the same, from the corresponding pattern, I missed four or five watch keys, and they were of that sort.</p>

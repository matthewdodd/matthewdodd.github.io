               <p>How old are you? - Fifteen, in October; I called at Fisher and Wells, and took pieces, and gave a receipt for them on a bill of parcels; when I was coming by St. Paul's, the prisoner tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me, if I did not live at Mr. Jones's the dressers, and I told him, no, and I went on; he did not speak to me till we got into Bishopsgate-street, then he asked me if I did not know one Mr. Rogers, a dresser of silks; I saw him sometimes before me, and sometimes behind me; he kept near me; there were two of the men that met us, and he asked if I did not know them, I said, yes, very well; when we came to the Swan Inn, in Bishopsgate-street, he asked me to drink a pint of beer with him, I told him no, I must make haste home; then we crossed the way, and as we were coming by <placeName id="t17860830-58-crimeloc307">Rose-alley</placeName>

               <p>(The witness Barnes was ordered to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>How came you to let him? - I could not hinder him, he threw down the box and took it from under my arm directly.</p>
               <p>Why did not you hold it fast? - I could not because he pulled it so hard.</p>
               <p>Did you try to hold it? - I do not know, I was very much frightened; I cannot tell in what manner he took it; I did not see which way he ran; it was between one and two.</p>

               <p>Have you never told a different story from this? - No.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. Barnes the baker? - Yes.</p>

               <p>To day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And yesterday? - No; we have been talking of it all day to day.</p>
               <p>Did not your father threaten you, if you did not find out the man? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Had you any money, when you went out in the morning? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, had you any when you come home? - No, I swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see the prisoner? - At Mr. Saunders's, the paper warehouse, where he was brought by the two officers by my description; I knew him as soon as I saw him; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>I am a baker's apprentice; I saw the prosecutor's son, and the prisoner walking along together down Bishopsgate-street, about half after one, arm in arm.</p>
               <p>Were they arm in arm together? - No, no, they were not walking arm in arm together.</p>
               <p>Then how came that expression into your head? - It was a mistake; I watched them down Bishopsgate-street, as far as I could see them; I went to tell his father, but he was not at home; I thought he was in company with a bad man; I told his mother, he had a trunk under his arm; he took out a knife and opened it; and there was an old mop, an old shoe, and some bits of mortar.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know what the reward is in this case? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never know it was forty pounds? - No; I have not been talking about it to day to the lad.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the boy Patrier? - Four or five years.</p>
               <p>What sort of a boy is he? - A pretty good boy.</p>
               <p>Do you think he is to be believed upon his oath? - Yes, Sir, I do.</p>
               <p>Then he has sworn that you have been talking with him about it to day, and since four o'clock this afternoon? - I have not, we have not been together five minutes the whole day.</p>

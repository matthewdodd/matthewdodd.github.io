               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110060"></xptr>Q. What was the name of the watchman? - A.Stephens, and there were two other patroles; upon that several took an active part, I saw Williams strike at somebody; the pots were thrown at the patroles, and they were followed down stairs into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Soon after ten; I then crossed the way to go to my own home; I then observed Williams standing in the road way, with a drab coloured coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they come out; peaceably or otherwise? - A. They came out in a hurry; then they returned towards the Sun public house several of them, and knocked at the door, but I cannot name any one that knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been out of the house before they returned to the Sun public house door? - A. More than a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see of Williams at that time? - A. I did not observe him at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they get into the public house at all? - A. They shoved up the window and got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them make use of any expressions at that time? - A. They called out for one Bill, a person, I suppose, they missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Lancaster? - A. Yes; his name was William.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lancaster in the house that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue in the public house? - A. I suppose half a minute; it was a very short space of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come out the second time? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of them were together? - A. About 12 or 14; they then went towards the Compasses a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of them? - A. No; I did not; they then returned from the Compasses and went towards the watch house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is the Compasses a public house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the watch-house from the Sun? - A. About ten doors distance; when they returned from the Compasses, I observed Arnold, Dunn, and Williams; Dunn went first with Williams, on one hand, and Arnold on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any more than those three persons? - A. I dare say twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of those who followed? - A. Yes; I knew Parsons and Russel; I stood at the end of Red-lion-alley, about 40 yards from the watch house, on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing what passed at the watch-house door? - A. Yes; I saw a mob at the door, and I saw one man seemingly striking with a stick; I thought it was at somebody that was within; I did not go any nearer; I then lost fight of them by some night carts, and I did not take particular notice where they went to after that, till I saw them return back.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any of those you saw return back? - A. I observed Arnold and Dunn, but did not see the prisoner; they went then towards Peter-street, and there I lost sight of them; I saw a watchman standing at the end of Peter-street, of the name of Larcher; about ten minutes afterwards I went down Peter-street, and found Larcher all over blood; he appeared to me to have had a blow on the head with a stick; I saw, as if the skull was driven in, nearly as deep as the bowl of a table spoon.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What business are you? - A. A case-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a decent tradesman, and were at this Sun public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a club, perhaps, at which many decent people resorted? - A. If I had not gone with a tradesman I should not have gone myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe every thing passed very peaceably till somebody tore Toombs's coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you said upon the former trial, that you thought it was a frolic, and that Toombs was a very ill-natured fellow, to call the watchman and make that disturbance? - A. I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, Dunn, Arnold and Williams, and a considerable number of persons passed towards the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have said it was impossible for you to say who were the persons that stopped at the watch-house and took an active part? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you saw a number of persons returning you did not see Williams? - A. No; I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a patten-maker; I was a the club when the riot took place; the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what passed about Toombs? - A. Yes; Toombs went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember trying to prevent Toombs going away? - A. Not that I remember; the watchman came into the room and went to the left side of the room where Dunn stood; when they had got there, one of the watchmen said, which is the man that insulted you, Toombs; and he pointed to Dunn; he immediately went to collar Dunn, and Dunn put himself in a posture to strike him, and he did strike him, he knocked him down; then the watchman got hold of his collar and a scuffle ensued, and they were all up in arms directly, the people in the room with sticks and quart pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams one of those that were up in arms? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they know he was the watchman? - A. Yes; he had his watch coat on; then there was a fight between Ryan and Dunn, and Williams got between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110061"></xptr>Q. Was this before or after the watchman had been knocked down? - A.Before the watchman came in; I then came down stairs and saw the watchman that had been knocked down upon the stairs; I got out of the house as soon as I could, and went opposite the watch house; I was so slurtied I cannot tell who came down before me or after me; I then saw Ryan and Dunn very plainly go into the watch-house; I then saw ten people or more in the road way; then I saw Williams near the door of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so situated that you could see what passed in the watch-house? - A. Yes; from the light of the lamps, and the door being open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Brewer, the beadle, that was killed? - A. No; there are folding doors; that door was not open where I suppose he stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body so near the door as Williams? - A. Only Orrell; I saw a knife in Dunn's hand, it was a clasped knife open; I saw Ryan and Dunn go into the watch-house, and I saw them come out again; they pulled off their hats and holloaed huzza; at the time that Ryan and Dunn went in, Arnold stood on the same side of the way that I did, before me; the mob went down towards Peter-street; I saw the prisoner and Orrel, and Dunn and Ryan, and a good many more, I followed them to the corner of Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is the Compasses? - A. About the middle of Cow-cross; I saw the watchman that stood with one hand across the other, and I believe a lanthorn, and Dunn with the knife he had in his hand, cut him under the chin; his name is Charles Englefield; he then presented a knife to his body; upon that I holloaed out why do not you take the knife out of that man's hand, he has cut that man; upon which Dunn made use of the expression, you b-r, I will cut you, and put the knife at me; after that, finding he was cut, they went away down Peter-street, to Bull-head-court, about half way down the street; there, either the watchman, or the superintendant of the watch, sprung a rattle, and passed me again; when they came up, Williams, Orrell, Ryan and Dunn, and others sell a beating the watchman, a man of the name of Larcher, he is dead since; there was a boy under the shelter of a window said, for God's sake don't kill the man; after that, they turned down Peter-street again, and left a man there, and turning down Peter-street again, they turned up Saffron-hill, where there is a turnstile, and there was a gentleman in black coming along.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams one of the party? - A. Yes; Williams, Ryan, Dunn, Orrell, and a vast many more; Dunn presented his knife at the gentleman's body, but I do not know that he received any hurt; I said, Williams, why do not you take the knife out of that man's hand; upon which, Williams said, who is that calls my name; I again repeated, why do not you take the knife out of the man's hand, where is the use of cutting people that do not meddle with you; he turned round to me as if he was going to strike me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you then? - A. No; then they went through Turnstile, Saffron hill; I observed Williams put his arm round Dunn, and whether he shut the knife, or whether Dunn shut it, I cannot tell, but it was shut, and no more mischief was done; they proceeded along Hatton-garden, and when they got to Holborn, they parted in threes and fours; Berry, Ostand, and Dunn, and a great many more, went down the hill, and others went up the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation before they parted? - A. Yes; they said that was the roller stick.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that? - A. The patrol's stick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were a witness at the time Arnold, Ryan, and Dunn were tried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, to-day, sworn that Ryan, who was then indicted, went into the watch-house-Did you not also swear, upon the last trial, that he went into the watch-house? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Ryan was acquitted, was not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been accused yourself of going into the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not taken up as one of the three men that went into the watch-house? - A. No; I was taken up to support the evidence of

I was not taken up, I surrendered myself in every respect; I went to the Magistrates in Hatton garden, and was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me, at first, that you were taken up, and that the impression upon your mind was, that you were to be a witness; upon your oath, did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110062"></xptr>you not believe, at that very time, that you were taken up for the purpose of being prosecuted? - A. I never was taken up, I went voluntarily to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the office the next day after the affair, I suppose? - A. No; I was in my business, and when I found that I was inquired after, I was told some people had been there, and I went to the office, where Mr. Blamire was sitting, and that was in the evening, at Hatton-garden; I went by myself, and there was another that was at the club as well, one Howell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the transaction did you go to the Magistrate's? - A. Three days.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go then the next day and give information of what you had seen? - A. No; I was about my business, in the bone business, such as they collect at butcher's, and cook's shops, for the grease.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you now? - A. A patten-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the bone business? - A. I was indicted for a nuisance; but I served my time as a patten-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in any other business? - A. In the coal trade.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you never a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in prison, perhaps, upon this occasion? - A. Yes, before the trial, without seeing any Magistrate at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how many times have you been in prison? - A. I cannot recollect; I never had a charge of felony against me of any kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You know what the meaning of felony is? - A. I should suppose it is for a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. For stealing any thing - now, you understand it, upon your oath, were you never apprehended upon a charge of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you cannot tell whether you were ever apprehended upon a charge of stealing any thing; have you never been in the custoday of one Joslin, a City constable? - A. Not upon a just thing, that was upon suspicion of stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dare you swear you had never been in custody but upon this charge? - A. Never to have a proof of any felony against me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a reward advertised of two hundred pounds for apprehending one of those persons? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a very large reward offered? - A. Yes, there was a reward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You have seen advertisements struck up about the town, for a year and a half together, for the apprehension of this man a well as of others? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked about some charge of felony; what was it, and what became of it? - A.Nothing came of it; I was discharged before the Alderman, at Guildhall, I was never committed upon it; I have been tried before Lord Kenyon, for taking a man's head-stall off, many times, when I was collecting the tolls, for things that I distrained, but I never was tried for any thing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you or did you not, for the purpose of being accurate as far as you could in giving your evidence, buy the printed account of the trial a few days ago; have you not been reading it over and over again? - A. I bought it for Mr. Jeffs, of Turnmill-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Jeffs gave you the money then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not said, that you pawned your own handkerchief for the purpose of buying it? - A. Yes; I did pawn my own handkerchief, and I bought those papers for myself, as well as for Mr. Jeffs.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you do with them? - A. I delivered them to Mr. Jeffs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read them first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason? - A. I have been threatened to be shut, people have been nights and nights after me; people have met me in the streets, and swore they would set me aside if this man was convicted; I said, it is not my evidence that will do it, to satisfy you, says I, here is the paper to look at; the two numbers came to one shilling, and Mr. Jeffs paid me a shilling again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you surrendered yourself? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a dustman: I was at the club at the Sun public-house; the prisoner was there, and Dunn, Ryan, and a great many more, to the number of thirty or forty, the greatest part of them I knew; there was a man there appeared to me to be a stranger, he wanted to sing a song, and his singing of it did not please the company, upon which, Ryan and Dunn shoved him about, till they note the skirts of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams there? - A. Yes, sitting still at that time; after Toombs's coat was tore, he was going away, and Williams said, d-n your eyes, stop, you shall not go out, and cried out, where is the poker; Toombs then got out, and fetched a watchman; two watchmen came up, either watchmen or patrols, and upon their coming up, there was a general scuffle among the society belonging to the club, beating the watchmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110063"></xptr>Q. Was Williams concerned in that fighting? - A. I cannot tell; I was shoved from the top of the stairs to pretty near the bottom; before I could get to the door, I heard either a pot or a poker rattling down stairs, and a great number of them coming down stairs; I went and stood in the middle of the road, in the centre of the door; I saw some patrols come running down; they proceeded towards the watch-house; I saw a great number of the society, that was at the club, come out afterwards; I saw Ryan, Williams, and Dunn, particularly, come out; they came out all of a shutter and confusion, they got into the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Williams dressed? - A. He had a light coloured jacket on; then they missed one of the society, whose name was Goldsmith; the landlord had shut the door, and there was an outcry among the mob, where is Goldsmith; somebody cried out, they had fastened him in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that said so from the mob? - A. No; then I saw Ryan, Williams, and Dunn, go and lift the window up next the door; I saw them get in at the window, and come out again at the door; one of them said, he was not in the house, but I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else go into the house besides these three? - A. No; then one of the mob said, that Goldsmith was taken to the watch-house; then I saw Ryan, Williams, and Dunn, crying out, d-n their eyes, we will have him out again, if he is at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Who was it that made use of that expression? - A. I cannot tell; but it was one of the society belonging to the club; I then left the middle of the road and went on to the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them then? - A. They went towards the watch-house, Williams was one of them; I went to the watch-house, and stood opposite the watch-house door, as near the pavement as; could get; I did not see any body go into the watch house, but I saw three men come our of the watch-house, Williams, Ryan, and Dunn; Dunn had a knife in his hand, he appeared to be wiping blood off it, as it seemed to me; Williams was quite close along-side of him, and Ryan too; when they first came out of the watch-house, they pursued a man up White-horse-court, but whether they caught him or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.Before they pursued the man up Whitehorse-court, did Dunn make use of any expression? - A. Yes; he said, d-n my eyes, I have done it, I have done it, and whiped the knife on his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular noise at this time? - A. After they came out of White-horse-court, they gave three huzzas, and the greatest part of the society joined them in hazzas, three times, as they went down Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see Williams there? - A. Yes, but with no weapon that I saw, Dunn had a knife in his hand; then they went as far as the corner of Peter-street, where there was a watchman ringing his rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams with them at that time? - A. He was; then Ryan and Dunn knocked down the watchman, and Ryan took his stick from him, beat him with his own weapon, and then took it away; Williams was there at that time; they then went down Peter-street, and up Turnstile, and there Samuel Russel called out Thomas Williams by name; then Williams called out, d-n your eyes, what do you mention names for; then Russel said, I will not call you by your name any more; then they went up to Hatton-garden, and down Hatton garden, till they got into Holborn, and then they turned different ways, and I went up Hatton-garden home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were a witness upon the trials of Dunn, Arnold, and Ryan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the same evidence against Ryan then that you have done now? - A. Yes, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. And, notwithstanding that, Ryan was acquitted, was he not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn before Mr. Floud? - A. Yes, and I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was that? - A.Between twelve and one in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from Williams when you were examined by Mr. Floud? - A.Nearer to him then I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Floud reading over to you the printed trial? - A.Without a doubt it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it was? - A. I cannot say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not read it to you as your evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In which you had sworn positively you had seen Williams? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon the solemn oath you have taken, did you not positively swear that you did not know Williams? - A. No, I did not; if I did, I was in liquor; I said it might be the man, but I could not call him to my recollection, being in liquor; but I had since perfectly recollected that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you did not tell the Justice you could not recollect, because you were in liquor? - A. I told him I did not know whether it was the man or not, till I recollected myself, and got sober; I was quite in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you were so much in liquor that you did not know what was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110064"></xptr>on? - A. I did not know what was going on; I have recollected myself since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember swearing that you did not know that he was the man? - A. I swore he might be the man, but I could not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him since? - A. No, only riding in the coach with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have been in prison then? - A. Yes, nineteen weeks in all, before and now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the trial read to you since you have been in jail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Rittson the constable? - A. No.(Rittson called into Court.)</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No, that is not the man that read the trial to me; he asked me if he should read it over to me again, and I said, no, I don't want to hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Williams was in a jacket, you are sure? - A. Yes, to the best of my rememberance.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in a rough drab great coat? - A. No, it was a jacket, not so long as my coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.From the time of this affair, till he was taken up, had you ever seen Williams? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - A. Yes, perfectly well before that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any other person of the name of Thomas Williams belonging to the club? - A. Not that I ever heard of; I had often seen him at the Compasses where I resorted; when I was apprehended, I gave a description of him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you sober the whole of that evening at the Sun? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you, when you were examined upon the trial of Dunn and others, name a Thomas Williams as being present? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other person upon earth of that name? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given his description before you were taken to Mr. Floud's? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from the Sun public-house in Cow-cross? - A. About forty yards; about eight or nine, on the 10th of November, 1796, the first that I saw of it, was loomb's coming up Whitehorse Alley; he said he had been robbed at the Sun public-house; I went in again; I had not been in two minutes before I heard the cry of the murder; I went our again, and went to go down he alley, and the mob pushed me before them right into the watch-house; inside the door of the watch-house, there were six or seven in the watch-house, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; I have some knowledge of his face, being in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe in the watch-house? - A.

               <p>Q. What do you mean by taking the skin of your ancle? - A. He crossed his legs to throw me down; somebody called out in the street, mind the woman; he said he did not want the woman, he wanted the man; when, I went home, I met the watchman, Joseph Hobart, I asked him to turn back, and he would not; he had not gone many yards before he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe who it was that knocked Hobart down. - A. I think it was Ryan; I lodged at Mr. Daniel's; I went to Mrs. Lewis's and found Mr. Brewer all in blood there; I said, Mr. Brewer, I am afraid you are killed; he said, I am afraid I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing farther? - A. No. farther than the mob giving three cheers in the street when they had done it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What line of life might you have been in at that time? - A. A widow woman; I went out washing for my living at gentlemen's houses.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem pretty well acquainted with the names of these men? - A. Only from the names they gave themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you had no other knowledge of their names than while you were in the watch-house? - A. No; I never saw them till I saw them in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. It was a dark night, was it not? - A. No; it was a moonlight night, and plenty of light.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you into the watch-house, curiosity, I suppose? - A. No; curiosity brought me out, but I was forced by the mob into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, for granted, you went next day and told the magistrate their names? - A. No; not for a week after, and then I was fetched, and obliged to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Your own regard for public justice did not lead you to do it? - A. There was too bad an ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110065"></xptr>cident in the house for me to go out and leave the house; my master got cut the same night, by my going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you gave evidence upon the former trial say, you knew Williams? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know what the oath was, that you took, to tell the whole truth? - A. Yes; and I have told the truth; I was not asked any thing about Williams.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach. Q. You were asked only about those at the bar? - A. No, I was not asked any questions about Williams, nor Ryan, only about Deputy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say you are quite sure that he is the person that was in the watch-house, or only believe it? - A. I believe he is the person, I am most sure of it, I am sure of his face, his face is not altered the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to repeat that to me, that you are quite sure of it? - A. Yes; I can say that I am quite sure of it, with a safe conscience.</p>
               <p>Q. After being cautioned? - A. Yes, I was very cautious before I came here.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Have you ever seen him before? - A. No, never.</p>

            , sworn. - I lived at No. 15, Cow-cross, in Nov. 1796, next door but one to the watch-house. On the 10th of Nov. I was in my own house, shut up, I heard a great noise, and I went out into the middle of the road and saw a man at the tap of the Sun public house; I went to the watch-house door; Mr. Brewer was leaning over the half-hatch, and I told him of it; I then saw three men come up to the door, I thought it had been two patroles coming to bring a charge, but when they came nigher, I saw one of them had a knife in his hand; upon that they all three rushed into the watch-house; I heard a noise, but saw nothing, one of my friends then took me away home; I afterwards went out again, in about a minute, and said I must go and see what they have done; when I came to the watch-house door, I saw Mr. Brewer, standing by the watch-house door, covered with blood running down him, but before I had time to speak to him, twenty or more came up; I heard one of them say d-n my eyes, we will have him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the three joined them at that time, or were they separate? - A. I cannot say upon that, they all rushed into the watch-house; then I went into my own home and saw nothing more.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you attend him? - A. We had a consultation on the case on the Saturday, and I think he died in the course of that night or Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. The riot commenced by your endeavouring to take Dunn into custody? - A. Toombs came down first, and said, he had been ill used; I said to Dunn, have you done any thing with the man's property; and I had not said half a word, before Dunn knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no warrant? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am entirely innocent of the charge. Sharp swore before the Magistrate, that he could not swear to me; such people will swear any thing for the sake of the reward; I have been told there was a great reward for apprehending the people that committed this depredation.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchmaker, joining the Curtain-road: I was before the Justice when Sharp was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you, from his manner of speaking, and from his conduct, to be a man in his sober senses, and who knew what he was about? - A. I am firmly convinced, from the manner of his giving his deposition, he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. Eight or nine years; he is a good-natured, friendly man, and I have seen instances of his forbearance; I never had any reason to suppose him a man of a blood-thirsty or revengeful disposition.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine other witnesses, who gave, him the character of a humane, peaceable man, and several of whom deposed that he had worked on his mother's premises from the time of the accident till he was apprehended.</p>

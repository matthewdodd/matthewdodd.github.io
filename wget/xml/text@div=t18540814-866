                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Ickenham. On 20th June the prisoner was in my service, as a weekly servant, and I sent him with a load of hay to sell, about 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning; he returned the same evening about a quarter past 6 o'clock—I asked him where he had taken the hay—he said he had taken half a load to my brother, a quarter of a load to a coachman at the Royal Oak, and a quarter to Mr. Malyon, a customer of mine, at Stockwell—I asked him what he charged the coach-man for his hay—he said it was to be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the coachman was going to pay my brother; he also said that Mr. Malyon would pay next day, and next day the prisoner brought the money to me—the coachman's name is William Smith—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that the prisoner had that day is accounted for—he quitted my service on the Monday week afterwards, without notice—he never said anything more about Smith's money.</p>

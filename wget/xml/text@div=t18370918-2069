                  </hi>. I reside at No. 79, St. Martin's-lane, and am an artist's colourman. The prisoner was in my employ. On the 13th of August, as he was coming out of my shop, I charged him with having some of my property—I had missed some—when I stopped him, he pulled out these brushes from his trowsers, and begged me not to send for a policeman—he said it was the first he had ever taken, and these were all—he was searched in my presence, and some more small brushes were found on him—these are all mine—he was not authorised to take them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. These small ones are not his—the large ones are his, but I took them to show to a gentleman—his wife has repeatedly allowed me to take out goods to show. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He never was authorised to take any out—these small ones are mine, as well as the others—I have no doubt of it at all—I have agreat many more of the same description exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. You may find them at every shop in London—I got them from the maker myself, William Neville—I never defrauded my master of a sixpence.</p>

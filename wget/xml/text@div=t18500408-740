                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 393). I went with Oliver and these shoes to the ground connected with Mr. Adams' building—about ten yards up the fence on the inside, the part nearest Broad-street, there were two in<lb></lb>dentations of feet within about three quarters of a yard of the paling—they were two deep marks, about a foot apart—I placed the boots in those marks—those marks did not bear the appearance of nails—I placed the shoes beside, and the impression that was made bore an exact resemblance to the first im<lb></lb>pression—that was the same with both the feet—I afterwards put the boots into the marks, and found them to fit exactly—from those two deep indentations I traced the marks to within fifteen yards of where the fire was—I examined the footmarks all along—there did not appear to be the footmarks of any other person—I traced the same marks back again, the impression of the right boot more particularly—the ground being harder there, and the boot pressing hard on the earth, the nails brightened the earth, and I could distinguish the absence of one nail in the waist of the boot, and five other nails(<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>), these marks were clearly shown—I counted the impressions of these five nails distinctly—I only did that with one impression—I noticed a piece of tar, or some substance on the waist of the left boot—I observed marks of that on the first footmarks; the indentations—I also compared the size of the boots and the shape generally—I placed them in, and I found the heels to correspond exactly with the heels of the marks—I did not trace any nails connected with the left boot; I did not look so particularly at that as I did at the right—the other constable kept the boots—we examined them together.</p>

Q.</hi> Were there not other footmarks on that vacant ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there were other footmarks—we went through Mr. Adams's premises, on to the waste ground, and the first thing we saw was the returning footsteps, we then went to search for the coming footsteps—we began at the Horseferry-branch-road part—we found a deeper impression there than at any other part—I saw footmarks about fifteen yards from the building.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and live at Weedon, in the county of Bucks. On Sunday evening, 29th April, I was at Hillingdon—I had a cart, and a hamper in it, containing ten dead ducks—about half past 10 o'clock the cart was standing in front of the Standard public house—I went to it, saw some straw littered about, and missed nine ducks out of the hamper—I had left the hamper secure, tied with a string—I found the string broken or cut—I gave information to the police—I was shown the ducks next day by the policeman—they were the same that had been safe in my cart the night before—they are not here.</p>

On the afternoon of 30th April I was at Hillingdon, and saw the prisoners in a field, about 300 yards from the back of the Standard—they had a basket in their possession—I watched them, and saw them go to a stack of straw, take something from it, and put it into the hamper—I went round, and met them coming along by the railroad—I asked what they had got—they said, "Ducks"—I said, "Stop; I shall arrest you"—they dropped the basket, and went away—I was in plain clothes—I examined the basket, and found it contained nine dead ducks—I followed the prisoners, and took them into custody—I showed the ducks to the prosecutor next day, and he identified them—he explained to</p>

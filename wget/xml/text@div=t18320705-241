            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Green. I saw the turpentine put into the cans; the prisoner drove the cart, pointed out the shop, and told us to wait opposite - he came out once or twice, and said Powell was busy, and kept us waiting half an hour; he then brought out the cans full of pearl-ash and water, which is called oil of tartar - I thought there was something wrong, and opened them immediately; I pursued, but could not find him.</p>

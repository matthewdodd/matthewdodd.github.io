            .(The case was opened by Mr. Knapp.)</p>
               <p>HENRY SIMMONDS sworn. - I live in Paternoster row: On the 9th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was on the top of the houses looking into St. Paul's Church-yard when the procession went by, and I found between the ridges of the houses, in a gutter, a small mahogany box; it was between the house of Mrs. Nicholls and my uncle's; the backs of the houses adjoin; the box was not near any window; there are two ridges that go with a descent, and between them I found the box in a gutter; from the top of Mrs. Nicholls's house there is a descent, which goes upon the leads, and on the leads there is a parapet wall and a ladder; when I was up there, I saw the gentleman at the bar and two or three others there; the box contained a paper, which was folded up; I opened it, and in it was about a dozen duplicates, which I took to my uncle; the box, when I took it up, fell to pieces in my hand, but I took the pieces and the duplicates to Mr. Gaimes the next morning, in the state I found them, as near as I could, and I left them with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You went up there to see Lord-Mayor's Shew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner, and two or three more, on the top of Mrs. Nicholls's house? -</p>
               <p>Q. That is some distance from the place where you found the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many houses are there from which persons might arrive at that gutter? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might they from half-a-dozen? - A. Yes, one way.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GAIMES sworn. - I am the proprietor of three shops, in St. Paul's Church-yard; I carry on the jewellery business at No. 54, the cabinet business at No. 53, and at No. 51 principally cutlery; at No. 51 I occupy the ground-floor only; the house is Mrs. Nicholls's, and I rent the lower part; at present a brother-in-law of mine manages the business in it; and when the box was found, Benjamin Collins managed it; Peregrine Parry always sleeps there; I know the prisoner, he lived with his mother, at No. 51; the front windows are secured by shutters, which are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020035"></xptr>fastened on the inside, but cannot be opened on the outside; on the 10th of November Simmonds came to me, and brought me a number of duplicates, some of which had my name on them; I went to the pawnbroker's with those which had my name, and after I had made enquiries, I gave them all to Kimber, the constable; in consequence of his going to Fleming's, the pawnbroker, Fleming's man produced twelve knives, thirteen forks, and the pouch; before the Lord-Mayor I swore to the knives and forks, by their having a mark and my name on them, and to the pouch, by my private shop-mark: upon resorting to my shop, at No. 51, I discovered they were missing; I have some of the same sort left that I had at the same time from Salt and Co. of Sheffreld; I had either two or three dozen of deserts, and the same of table; those produced were never accounted for to me, nor had I ever sold them to Mrs. Nicholls or the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have three shops, Nos. 54, 53, and 51, in St. Paul's Church yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the whole houses, Nos. 54 and 53? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-43-person409">Q. </persName>
            Which house has your personal attendance? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-43-person410">A. </persName>
            Nos. 54 and 53.</p>

                  <persName id="t18011202-43-person411">Q. </persName>
            Then as to the sale or disposal of the effects in No. 51, you leave to some other person? - A. I am often there myself, perhaps a dozen times a day; I attend very little behind the counter in either of the shops, but I think less at No. 51 than either; I did the careful part of it:</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you there in February? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-43-person412">A. George Young</persName>
            , who is here.</p>
               <p>Q. You have another shop in Cornhill, have not you? - A. Yes, and another at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Campbell, who is now dead, had a share in your business, I believe? - A. He never had; I am the sole proprietor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago did it happen that Mrs. Nicholls had occasion to distrain for rent? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-43-person413">A. </persName>
            Last quarter but one; Mr. Campbell hired the shop, and I paid him again; I did not know it had happened till he told me; they were not there ten minutes, for I gave a check on my banker the moment I heard of it; it was thirty-seven pounds ten shillings, for a quarter, at one hundred and fifty pounds a year.</p>

               <p>Q. Nos. 53 and 54 have access to the tops of the houses, have they not? - A. Yes, at 53, but there are no leads at 54.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being called upon to make good damage done by your servants for getting over the tops of the houses? - A. I never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-43-person414">Q. </persName>
            Is the sale of your curlery confined to No. 51? - A. No, there is as much sold at the other shops; though I say the shops are divided, there may be as many desks sold at 51 as 53 or 54, and so with cutlery at the others.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the knives had your name on - is not the name of Gaimes generally put? - A. No. only on the very best.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, upon your oath, will you swear that those knives or forks were not sold at 53 or 54? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that you could not tell that they had not been sold? - A. Yes, but I have never been accounted to for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. 
               <persName id="t18011202-43-person415">Q. </persName>
            Explain that? - A. When before Mr. Alderman Combe, I was asked to swear positively whether those were the articles I had been robbed of; I said, I could not; but, since then, I have examined my books, and from my own servants I am enabled to say they are; for table-knives and forks we have no room in either of the shops, than in No. 51, they never were placed in any other.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KIMBER sworn. - I am a constable, and produce some duplicates which I received of Mr. Gaimes; I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of November, about half past eleven at night, at No. 51, St. Paul's Church-yard; he did not say any thing; I searched for a person of the name of Hunt, in White Rose-court, Basinghall-street, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were sent by Mr. Gaimes in the evening to apprehend this young man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A good humane thing to apprehend a boy at midnight? - A. He desired me to take him up when I saw him.</p>

             sworn. - I was employed by Mr. Fleming, in February last, as his shopman, in Newgate-street. (The duplicates shown the witness.) This is my hand-writing, dated the 12th of February; I know the prisoner, and I received the pledge of him; I have no doubt of his person, as I have seen him more than once as pledging and redeeming things at our house. (The articles produced.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This transaction was as far back as February? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a growing young man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you now come from Mr. Fleming's? - A. No; I have left him six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Fleming's shop has a deal of business, and is darkened by clothes, is it not? - A. Yes, round the door, but it is not a dark shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak from recollection of a person ten months back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a young lad, growing, and features of lads of that age alter considerably within six or seven months? - A. Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a possibility of a person being deceived as to a growing lad? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-43-person417">A. </persName>
            It is possible, but I have no doubt in my own mind. (The property was identified by Mr. Gaimes.)</p>

               <p>Q. Not only every servant you may have, but have had, and every visitor, must pass through your shop at No. 51? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE YOUNG sworn. - I was servant to Mr. Gaimes, at No. 51, in February last; I know these knives and forks, having cleaned them, but I never sold a table-knife or fork, or desert knife or fork, all the time I was in the shop, or ever missed any.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave them? - A. In September; I did not look to see whether they were there or not; I was there in January, and saw them afterwards; I cleaned them all as soon as I got to the shop, but cannot say the last time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What time was it in January you went to Gaimes's? - A. The 20th of December I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was it customary to clean them? - A. When we saw them dirty; sometimes in the course of a month or two.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-43-person418">Q. </persName>
            Suppose you had heard nothing about the 12th of February, and I had said, when did you clean them, what whoul you have said? - A. I do not remeber cleaning them but two or three times at first; I am sure I had not cleaned them for more than the last two or three months; Mr. Wenman used to serve as well as me about a month or two before I left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Campbell sell any thing there? - A. He has once or twice in the present year; but he never sold any knives or forks as I know of.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have twice found things hid in our cellar; a thread-case, a pair of razors, and a desk, which I informed that young man of, as I thought it was proper Mr. Gaimes should know it.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>AUGUSTINE RAYMER sworn. - I live at No. 2, Prospect-place, Newington Butts, and knew the prisoner about eight years ago; I had not seen him for several years, and he is so much altered, I should hardly have known him had I not seen him at his mother's; Mr. Gaimes succeeded me in that shop.</p>

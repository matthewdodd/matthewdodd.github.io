            , who depos'd that on the 12th of March last, she went to the Deceas'd's Lodgings, and finding him upon the Bed, she asked him how he did? The Deceas'd answer'd that he was the worse for the Company, (pointing to the Prisoner) who had been teazing him to Death. That then she advis'd the Deceas'd not to admit the Prisoner into his Company, upon that the Prisoner came up to her, and held her by the Throat with his Hand till she was almost Strangled; then drew his Sword and Stab'd her in the Arm and Head. The Deceas'd coming to her Assistance, the Prisoner gave him a Stab in the Back, and another in the Belly, of which he died in 2 Days after. Another Person depos'd, that hearing a Noise she run up, and saw the last Stab given. The Surgeon depos'd that he was sent for to the Deceas'd, and found him sitting upon the Stairs, with a large Wound in his Belly, and his Intestines hanging out; that he found another Stab in his Back, and it was his Opinion that he died of 'em, they being both mortal Wounds. The Evidence further depos'd that the Deceas'd had no Weapon, when the Prisoner fell upon him, nor did he give any Provocation to the Prisoner, to induce him to commit so horrid a Murder. The Prisoner in his defence deny'd the Fact, and endeavour'd to turn it upon Mrs. Anderson, but there being other positive Evidence, which agreed with that given by her, the Jury found him <rs id="t17080414-18-verdict84" type="verdictDescription">

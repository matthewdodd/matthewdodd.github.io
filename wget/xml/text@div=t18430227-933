                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Turkey-street, Enfield. On the 4th of Feb. I was removing goods from one house to the Dairy Arms, in Turkey-street—I employed the prisoner to assist me—I stood a pot or two of porter, as he did not charge me any money—Taylor and Ellis were there—I was busy getting my things away, because I was stinted to time—the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife had some beer—I had received from Joseph Jessop, of Waltham Abbey, a cheque for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had five sovereigns and a half—I took the box out of my pocket, and put it into my apron when I got to my new house, but I found I had a sixpence, and did not open the box—the prisoner took it out of my lap to look at—I said, "Take care of that box, it is a favourite box of mine"—I never saw it again—Mrs. Taylor was gone for a pot of porter—the box was worth about half-a-crown.</p>

On the 4th of Feb., I drew a cheque on Prescott and Co., for 256<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and gave it to the prosecutrix that afternoon—I was to give her this money on condition of her giving up to me the house she was living in—I saw the prisoner and another man helping her to move—I waited till the prisoner went up stairs, and then handed her the cheque—she did not put it away while I remained—in consequence of what I heard I wrote to the bankers to stop the payment, and went to the bankers myself.</p>

I am the wife of John Taylor, and live in Turkey-street, Enfield—I went with Mrs. Ellis to the prosecutrix's on the 4th of Feb., about a quarter past six o'clock—Mrs. Roberts, the prisoner, John Taylor, and Ellis, were there—Mrs. Roberts was a little the worse for liquor, and Taylor also—the prisoner's wife came in—Mrs. Roberts said, "Now, won't you stand a pot? I don't wish you to be all; I will be a pot as well as you"—Ellis said she had no money—then Roberts took a small box out of her pocket—she shook it—there was something in it, she said, "I must take care of this box"—the prisoner took it out of her hand—John Taylor said, "Saunders, give me the box, let me take care of it"—the prisoner answered, "No, I can take care of the box"—he had got it when I left the house—I staid five or ten minutes, and left Saunders, John Taylor, and Roberts there—Mrs. Ellis went out with me—I went with Ellis again to Roberts the same evening—Roberts said, "Let us have another half-pint of beer"—I said, "I don't want any more, we will have half a pint, and give it up"—Roberts</p>

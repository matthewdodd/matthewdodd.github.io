            . I am superintendant of the works of the London Gas Light and Coke Company, who were doing very extensive repairs in Smithfield. Some hundreds of pipe were there. Mayne was employed to put down the pipes; he was taken into custody, and in consequence of what he said we went to Field-lane, to the prisoner's house; he keeps an old iron shop. He came in soon after we got there; Mayne was with us, and said the prisoner was the man he sold the pipe to, and that he gave him sixpence halfpenny. The prisoner did not deny it - it cost the company 5 s. We found it in the shop - it was broken three pieces, and the long piece was in the back shop - it formerly formed one whole pipe.</p>

            . I went with last witness to the prisoner's house. He came in, in about twenty minutes; I told him I came about some pipe. I found two pieces in the front shop, and one, four feet long, in the back shop the length of the whole was six feet. The prisoner said he had bought it that morning, and turning round, he said he believed he bought it of that man, (meaning Mayne.) Mayne said what he sold it for, and I asked the prisoner what he gave for it, and he said sixpence or sixpence halfpenny. I then took him.</p>

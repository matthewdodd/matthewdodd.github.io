               <p>I live at Ratcliffe cross: on the 6th of June, Mr. Sherberd brought me a pair of nankeen breeches to alter them, to take them in; he took them away from me altered; then the other man prisoner came in, and told me he had a job to do; he took a handkerchief and untied it, and produced this coat which is here; he said a woman had it to alter before; and I altered it, and on the 8th of June he fetched it away from me; I never saw the nankeen breeches before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kidd. Here is the half handkerchief which was taken off Mrs. Ransom's neck; I know this by the border.</p>
               <p>Do you know it only by the border? - No, but it is cut in half, and it was put round her neck, and never hemmed; as soon as I said this is my handkerchief, she gave it to me, and gave me a shove, and said take it, I had it with the rest of the things; then I looked at her, and she had one of my shifts on, and a pair of cotton stockings on; I said I ought to have them, and Mr. Fletcher made answer, would you strip her here; I knew the shift, it had a very little bosom, and when I lay in, I had it cut bigger, and afterwards I sewed it with coarse groat thread; I have the fellow to the stockings on at that time.</p>

               <p>They say they were a large bunch of keys? - No, they were not.</p>

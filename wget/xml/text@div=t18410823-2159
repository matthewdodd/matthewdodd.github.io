                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, Charles Good all, as card-makers, in Great College-street, Camden-town. The prisoner was in our service about three weeks—I missed eight or nine dozen pencil-cases, on Friday night, the 26th of July, from under the counter in the counting-house, which was not the place his employ took him to—on Saturday morning, the 7th of August, I saw him, and told him I had got a pencil from a person named Roach—he said he knew nothing about it—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an errand-boy, and live in York-place, Camden-town. I saw the prisoner in High-street, Camden-town, a few weeks ago, just by the oil-shop, near the Mother Red Cap public-house—he said, "Have you got that knife now?"—I said, "No"—he took three pencil-cases out of his pocket—I asked where he got them—he said a boy in Oxford-street, that worked on them, made him a present of them—he offered to sell me one—I said they were of no use to me—he offered it to me for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would give 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he said, "No," and I went away—I had got to the corner of a street, when he came and said, "I will take 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and you must buy some apples"—I said I had no more money—I bought one for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sold it to Mr. Liney's son—I believe this now produced to be it.</p>

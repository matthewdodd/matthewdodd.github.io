On the 10th of June, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner coming down stairs with a bundle in his hand; I met him at the foot of the stairs, and asked what he had got in his bundle, I saw him open a door which is at the foot of the stairs; he said it was a parcel, which he had brought from a young woman in Portland-street - I asked what business he had on that side of the house; he said he wanted a pint of porter; this was the private part of the house - I took the bundle from him. I found a white dress and a petticoat in it; they had been taken off a spare bed, up two pair of stairs. I saw a silver spoon in the kitchen at five o'clock, and it was found on him when he was searched.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner. In his hat I found a cap, a table spoon, a case with two razors, and a pair of gloves - in his waistcoat pocket I found a neck-chain, and in his breeches pocket another razor and some halfpence. I told him next morning that there was still something missing; he immediately took from his person some caps and lace, and gave them to me,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness, and lived at my father's house in Nov., 1854, and still do so. I have seen Hague there; the first time was on 5th Nov., Sunday, when he went out with my sister Emma, at half past 10 o'clock—they were away a good while—I saw him again on the Tuesday following—there were fireworks on the Monday, and he came on the Tuesday, and went out with my sister about half past 7 o'clock—I saw him in the house before they went away—my sister was away about half an hour—they went into the plantation—besides the 5th and 7th Nov., I have often seen him at my father's house talking with my sister, and walking with her outside frequently—Mrs. Davis used sometimes to come to the house.</p>

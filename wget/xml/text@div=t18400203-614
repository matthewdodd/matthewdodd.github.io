                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was on duty on Saturday night, the 28th of December, about half-past eight o'clock, in Belton-street, Long Acre, which is about half a mile from Regent-street—I saw Linan come out of No. 12, in company with the two prisoners in the last case, Golden and Baker—I did not see them go in—they had nothing when they came out that I could see, and I let them pass—on the Tuesday following, the 31st of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw Myers come out of the same house, with a bag on his back—I stopped him, and asked him what he had in his bag—he said, "A few packs of cards"—I took him to the station-house, and found in his bag these two pieces of silk, six packs of cards, a pair of old trowsers, and some handkerchiefs—when I pulled it out, he said, "That is my property; I purchased it in the regular way of business, in Cutler-street"—I had heard of this robbery about five minutes before Linan and the other two came out of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Cutler-street, Houndsditch.

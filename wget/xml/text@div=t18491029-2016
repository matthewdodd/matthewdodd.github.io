In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I went to the house of Moses Johnson, at Stratford, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, on the 12th Oct.—he produced this lead, and from what he said, I went to "The Pigeons," and saw the prisoner—I asked him if he knew anything of any lead—he said, "No"—I repeated the question, and he said, "What lead do you mean, the lead in the stable?"—I said, "Have you sold any lead?"—he said, "No "two or three times—I took him to How station, and he looked down at this lead in the charge-room, and said, "It is no use saying I did not take the lead, I did; I took it off the roof of the stable at the back of Mrs. Laythorpe's"—I compared this lead with some in the stable, and it corresponded exactly with the lead of the scullery, and with the lead of the gutter called "the drip."</p>

I am a zinc-worker, and reside at Stratford—I accom<lb></lb>panied the officer to "The Pigeons," and compared this lead produced with other lead in the stable and scullery—they corresponded—I found marks in the lead corresponding with the drip on the roof—this piece came off the gutter—here are marks where it had been dressed over the drip.</p>

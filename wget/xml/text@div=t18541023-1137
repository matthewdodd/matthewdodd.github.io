                  </hi>. I am porter of Bishopsgate workhouse. The guardians of the East London Union had their usual meetings on Wednesday, 4th Oct., in the board house in Devonshire-street; at these meetings paupers apply for relief—I attend there to keep order—on 4th Oct. the prisoner made an application to the guardians for relief—he asked for a sovereign—the guardians offered him an order to come in the workhouse, which he refused—he became very insolent and told the guardians they were no gentlemen, and wanted to starve the people; that he had been in the work-house before, and had had enough of it—after talking to him some time the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230080"></xptr>
               <p>guardians ordered me to remove him, and he refused to go unless a police constable was brought—I then put my hand on his back very gently, and said, "This won't do, you must go away"—he turned round, and began to strike and kick at me; I closed with him and laid hold of him and he fell on his back, and in that position I got him out of the room—I then let him go; he got on his feet, took a knife from his pocket, and made a plunge at me—it was a small clasp knife, with a black handle, and a sharp point, and it cut through my coat—this is the coat I had on (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I saw him open the knife, and I got back on purpose to avoid it—the knife has gone through the lining, and cut through my trowsers, through both sides of the pocket—it must have been very near to the skin indeed—a man named Mackoy stopped him—other people interfered; I could not see who they were; and assistance also came from the board room—he was removed by a policeman, named Carr.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, residing in Sweet-apple-court, Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street. I was attending the board of guardians on the afternoon of 4th Oct.—I saw Hall dragging Bethel out of the room—Hall pushed him away, and after pushing him down he probed his knife at Hall—before he did so he was quite free from Hall, and could have gone away—I saw the knife open in his hand—he poked his knife at Mr. Hall—I saw the blow he made at him—I could only see part of the knife; it was a dark handle, and I saw about two inches of the blade—I assisted; I caught hold of his arm, and said, "Go away quietly"—I believe Carr afterwards came in, and turned him out.</p>

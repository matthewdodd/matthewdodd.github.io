                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRIERLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A shoe-binder—I went up at half-past twelve, or one o'clock, for a light, and asked Nash to give me a light, which he did—I was going down stairs, and they called me back, and asked me to have some gin and spruce—Nash said, "No, put it away till morning"—the prisoner said, "No; if you can't drink it, let those have it that can;" and he snatched the bottle out of her hand, and hit her in the face, and gave her a black eye—he was tipsy—he and Harman fought for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and he took the tub and hit the prisoner on the top of the head with it—she got the tub out of his hand, and threw it out of the window—it was I that was refused to have the gin and beer—she was going to pour it out for me, when he took the bottle from her hand—I do not know what condition Nash was in after the fight—I was calling, "Murder!" for the policeman to assist us—I thought the prisoner would be murdered—I called out soon after the fight began—he was striking her, and also Mrs. Nash, after the fight, both at once—I did not help—I saw blood flow both from the prisoner and Nash, but none from Harman—Nash did not fall on the tab—it was thrown out of the window—the saucepan was there, but I did not see it in the room till after the policeman took the prisoner—it was found under the bed, bent, as it is now—it was not used at all in the room—I will swear that—I stopped till the policeman came—Nash was then on the floor, with his head on the bed, in a fit—I am quite sure he was not sitting up—he is subject to fits—I do not know whether he is subject to bleeding in the head—he had had several cuts before, and when he gets in liquor is not in his right mind—I did not see any violence given at all, only in the fight—I do not think he said his head was cut—I do not think he spoke—he was too tipsy—I did not see the saucepan strike him—there was no saucepan used while I was there—I know nothing of How Nash came to be struck be<lb></lb>hind—he might have fallen on the saucepan or on the fender—he never was touched by a saucepan—I will swear he fell on the saucepan in my pre<lb></lb>sence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said before the saucepan was not used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he fell under the table several times—the saucepan was kept under the table.</p>

                  </hi>. I live right opposite the prosecutor's—I can see the passage window adjoining the room that Nash and Carter live in, from my door—I saw Nash strike the prisoner on the bead several times with a washing-tub—she wrested it out of his hand, and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it out of the staircase window—I did not hear Nash say anything in the course of the conflict—Nash was very tipsy that evening—I did not observe a lump on the prisoner's head—the policeman came and took them away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The fighting was before you got there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Nash was not bleeding at the head when I got there—the tub was half a butter firkin—he took it up, and hit her over the head several times within—I could see a Plainly—the policeman came up directly—I did not see a drop of blood flowing from Nash's head—I saw the prisoner taken away, and told the po<lb></lb>liceman it was a shame to take them away, as they did not begin it—the policeman came up directly, while I ran in<lb></lb>doors to put a covering on—he came</p>

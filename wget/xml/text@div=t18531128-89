                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 60, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. On 9th June I left my house about 11 o'clock in the morning, to go to Ascot races—I left my servant, Martha Farmer, in the house—my niece was at home, she is a little girl—she was gone to school—I left my pocket book in my drawer in my bedroom—I believe the drawer was locked—there was in my pocket book two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—there was in the same drawer seventy-five or seventy six sovereigns, a watch and chain, four bracelets, one of which was a diamond one, and two sets of earrings and brooches—I left some plate, but not in that drawer—it consisted of forks, and spoons, and knife rests—I returned about 11 o'clock at night, or a very little after—I left Windsor by the half past 9 o'clock train, and came away immediately—I do not think it was later than 11 o'clock—when I got home, I went in my bedroom—there was no appearance of a robbery, the drawers and everything were shut—the room was in better order that night than I have ever seen it—I went in the kitchen to have my dress unfastened by my servant, and she asked me if I</p>

               <p>On the 24th of April I heard a man had been inquiring for me, and asked for a job; he came to my house once or twice; he had been assisting my people to get in a heavy piece of timber, and asked for some small beer: I was drinking tea in my back kitchen: I heard the door open, and somebody go up stairs; there is a large room up one pair of stairs which I use as a workshop, and for the men to keep their tools; I stopped to see who went out, and a lady who was drinking tea with me said, that was the man who had been asking for a job; I ran after him, and seeing something stick out behind, I stopped him; I asked him what he had got? he said he had got nothing; I looked under his coat, and there was a saw; I laid hold of his collar and told him I would keep him till I knew which of the men the saw belonged to; I sent for the men; and

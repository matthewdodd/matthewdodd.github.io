                  </hi> My husband keeps a grocer's shop in Horseferry-road. On Thursday, 17th Feb., the prisoner came and asked for half a quartern of sugar—it came to three farthings—he gave me sixpence—I examined it, bent it, and told him it was bad—he said he could not take the sugar, and I said he should not take the sixpence either—he said a gentleman gave it him for holding his horse—I kept it, and said if he did not go away I would send for a policeman—he went away, and I placed the sixpence on the parlour mantel-piece—I afterwards gave it to Cousins, the officer—I am sure it was the same I had from the prisoner.</p>

About eight o'clock at night, on 17th Feb., the prisoner came to the shop for a halfpenny candle—he put down a shilling—I examined it, bit it, and called my master—he asked the prisoner where he got it—he said from a gentleman for holding a horse for about three hours—the shilling was bad—my master kept it and let the prisoner go—I followed him—I saw a policeman and told him—the prisoner ran up Snow's-rents—I ran after him and caught him.</p>

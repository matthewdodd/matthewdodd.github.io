            . I am headborough; on the 24th of January, about seven in the evening, the Custom-house officer had detected this evidence and the prisoner, and stopped the three sacks of oats, they were clean oats; he ordered me to carry them to the City of Bristol alehouse; I challenged the prisoner with taking them out of some lighter; then he told me he had, and that there were two men concerned with him; one he said was the cook, the other he called John; I took him to the watch-house; then I went to Capt. Ayre, and asked for the cook and John; they came on shore, I took them to the watch-house to the prisoner; they both of them owned they were parties concerned; then I took them all before the bench of Justices, they were committed, two to Bridewell, and the other to New Prison; after that the other two were acquitted.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was before the Justices, and heard the prisoner own he was concerned in stealing the oats: he is a Portuguese, but he served his time at Yarmouth; the others are gone to the East-Indies.</p>

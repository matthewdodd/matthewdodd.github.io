            . On the 20th of June I was in Mr. Bellamy's kitchen, between one and two o'clock, and heard a noise in the dining-room, I ran up stairs, the prisoner Fuell, ran out of the dining-room door, and then out of the street door; I pursued, and called Mercer, who stopped him. I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I am servant to Mr. Bellamy. Butler called me, I ran out and saw the prisoners running together about sixty yards from the house. We called "Stop thief!" Welch stopped Fuell. Wynn was taken in the timber-yard.</p>

            . I am toll-man at Battersea-bridge. I heard the cry, and saw Fuell running very fast; Wynn was behind him. I made a catch at Fuell but missed him. I took Wynn; by the motion of his hands I thought he threw something over the hedge. I charged him with throwing something over, he denied it.</p>

            . I am a foreman to a ship-breaker at Battersea. I saw Fuell run into the yard. I saw him throw something white down; he stooped as if to conceal himself behind the timber; the mob were pursuing him. I collared him, and asked him what he threw away; he made no answer. I found there was a strainer, a salt-cellar, and dish, behind the timber; I also found the salt-spoon where I saw him throw something down. Mercer came up and claimed them.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was working opposite the prosecutor's; I saw Fuell open his door and go into the house. Wynn was about fifty yards off, but was within sight. Fuell came out, joined Wynn, and gave him something. I heard the cry, and they both immediately ran off together. Fuell appeared to me to open the door with a key. He could not open it without a drop latch-key. I saw one found in the boat by the river-side, where he was stopped, and suspected to have thrown something over. I tried it to the door, it opened it. I saw them both together before Fuell went in.</p>

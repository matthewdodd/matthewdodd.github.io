                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Lainson, of Clifton-street. On the 10th of December, I saw the prisoner in the street, and told him to come and sweep my kitchen chimney—I got my kitchen ready about eleven o'clock—he came and swept the chimney—I had a half-sovereign, and a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I put under a yellow basin on the dresser—my little girl saw me put them there—no one else was in the kitchen—the prisoner came down the chimney—I took the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from under the basin, and sent for change—I then put the basin over the half-sovereign again—the prisoner could see it—I then went into the back kitchen, leaving him and the half-sovereign in the kitchen—I came back, paid him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he went away—I then called my little girl, and told her to bring her bonnet to go out, and I missed the half-sovereign—there had been no one in the room, nor in the house, but my little girl who is two years old—no one could have taken it but the prisoner—I went to the prisoner—when he saw me he ran up stairs and said, "This is the lady where I swept the chimney"—I then asked him whether he took the half-sovereign—he said he had not—I went and found a policeman of the H division, No. 35 or 33—he said it would cost me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I proceeded with it—I am sure he said that—he was a thin man, rather tall—I told a friend, and we got another policeman, who took the prisoner to the station-house—the prisoner said, the first time I saw him, that rather then lose his character, he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for every chimney he swept.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at home—I went once into the kitchen when my mother got the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from under the basin—I then went up stairs, and did not go down again till the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that on hearing he was suspected, he went to the prosecutor's house, and was charged by her daughter with stealing a brass cock—that he left his address and went home;</p>

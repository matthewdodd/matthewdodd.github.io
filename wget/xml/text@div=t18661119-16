                  </hi>. I am a fish salesman of 28, Underwood Street, City Road—on Saturday night, 3rd November, I went to bed about half-past eleven—I examined the doors and windows, and they were all perfectly secure—I was awoke a little before five in the morning by a noise like the forcing of the passage door leading from the washhouse—shortly after<lb></lb>wards I heard a crash of glass—I then went downstairs—I found the back parlour window up, and the washhouse window was broken away just by the catch—a person could then undo it and open the window—I then went and called a policeman—there was nothing taken that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 38). On the morning of 4th November the prosecutor made a complaint to me; I went and examined the house—access had been gained by passing over two walls from seven to eight feet high—the washhouse window and the back parlour window was broken—I examined the back yard—I saw no one there, but in the adjoining yard I saw the prisoner making his escape over the wall—I made a rush at him and caught him by his left arm—he struggled very hard, and the sleeve of his coat came off—I called for assistance and got him into the street—he asked who charged him—I told him I did—with great diffi<lb></lb>culty we conveyed him to the station—a low wall, about four feet high, separated the yard where I found him from the prosecutor's—by en<lb></lb>tering the washhouse window he would get to the passage door—that was bolted, and he could not get further, and he then went back and got in the other way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 9, Beak Street, Regent Street—Mr. Kittier is my nephew—about December, 1877, he was desirous, in conjunc tion with the prisoner, of taking over the business of Tatham and Co.—they bad been fellow-clerks in the firm; Kittier was traveller—to assist him I advanced him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to form the capital of the business, and the prisoner was to find a like sum—about 4th or 5th March last the prisoner called on me and said that they were very much, pressed for money, would I discount the Kills that he had with him to the amount of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did so—amongst them were these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 27th January, 1879, at four months, drawn by A.

Tatham and Co., and the other for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 17th January, 1879, at three months, on Joshua Atkins, accepted by him—I passed those through my bankers, and they were returned to me unpaid, one marked "Refer to acceptor," and the other, "Not provided for"—upon that I saw the prisoner and said, "This bill has been returned"—he said he would see me righted in all money matters concerning it, and he sent me this cheque of his own for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed "R J. Kenworthy and Co."—I suppose that was for the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill that was dishonoured—I paid in that cheque, and that was returned marked, "Refer to drawer"—after this he brought me other bills; some of them were dis<lb></lb>honoured, and afterwards, from information I gathered, I thought it my duty to institute these proceedings—I am a loser by the bills alone about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

               <p>—I knew nothing of the internal arrangements of the firm—I knew no one except the prisoner and my nephew—I did not know a clerk named Arthur at that time; I knew him afterwnrds—these two bills of Robinson's and Atkins's were in the bundle handed to me, and on those bills I advanced about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more discount—most of those bills were dishonoured—after that the firm still obtained further advances from me—they traded under the name of Tatham and Co. for about a year and eight or nine months—the prisoner changed the name of the firm some few months ago, for what reason I don't know—I did not see my nephew respecting it till afterwards—he was a partner at that time, no doubt—the partnership is now dissolved; I think it was before the date of this cheque (2nd August) that the firm became Kenworthy and Co., but I am not positive; it is signed "R.J. Ken worthy and Co."—perhaps that was the name they were trading under at that time, but I really cannot tell you—at that time they owed me a considerable sum—no doubt this cheque was given me by the firm to pay off part of that sum—I knew they wanted money because they came to me for the discount, as they could not get them done at the bank—my nephew brought me this cheque; I had some correspondence with the firm befoie it was paid—I wrote for money several times—I cannot tell, the exact date when I knew that this bill of Kobinson's was forged; I think it was about 7th or 8th September—that was the first time I knew anything about it, and I immediately took proceedings—I heard lately that the firm was in Chancery, that there was a dissolution of partnership—I believe my nephew applied for it; I don't know when it commenced—I was quite ignorant of what was taking place at the time—I have offered a composition to the creditors of the estate; I said I would give 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for it; I agreod to take over the business on that—I have not heard anything of it since.</p>

In January last I was clerk to the firm of Tatham and Co.—on 17th January I recollect this piece of paper being placed before me by the prisoner, my employer—he said "Write the words accepted payable at the London and County Bank, Slough, and sign it Joseph Atkins"—I did so, and handed it to him, and he called me a b—fool for doing so, for writing Atkins's name, and said "It is useless to me"—he attempted to throw it in the lire, and I knew no more of it till about three weeks ago—the name Joseph Atkins is in my undisguised handwriting—he looked at it and said it was useless to him because I had written it in my own hand<lb></lb>writing, undisguised; he said so—I thought he threw it in the fire—I recollect this piece of paper, dated 27th Febuary, being place I before me by the prisoner—he said "Can you imitate James Robinson's signature?"—I said I would rather be excused, or made some demur about it, and he snatched it away from me and said, "Perhaps I had better do it myself"—he then dipped his pen in the ink and went on the other side of the desk and wrote something across the front of it, in my presence—his younger brother, Henry Lawrence Kenworthy, was also present—I had seen the prisoner draw out the body of the bill, and he asked his younger brother to write the words "accepted, payable" across it, and he did it; that was before I was asked to write the name—I was in the office on or about 30th June—in the morning, when Mr. Kittier came into the office, the prisoner said "Mr. Kittier, have you got any money," or something to that effect—Mr. Kittier said "No; for why?"—the prisoner said "There is a bill of Mr. Robinson's falling due as to-morrow which will have to be taken up by us"—Mr. Kittier pressed very much to know why, and the prisoner replied "Simply because I have signed the man's name"—that was all I heard.</p>

I was a clerk in this firm with my brother—I remember the 27th February; I don't think Robinson's bill was signed on that day, it was a day or two afterwards; I was in the office when it was drawn out, I can't say when it was, it was about the 27th; the,. drawer of it, the prisoner, and George Arthur were there—a number of other bills were drawn out at the same time—when Robinson's bill was draws it was given to Arthur to take to Robinson's, at Wimbledon, to get it accepted; that was the day it was drawn—he left the office with it to go, but he did not take it that day—he did not come back to the office that day—I saw him next morning; he had the bill with him then, it was not accepted—I was in the office by myself when he came in—I asked him for the bill—he hesitated a few minutes, and then he told me that he had hoi</p>

               <p>got it accepted, but he would go again with it—t told him he had better wait till my brother came in—my brother came in, it might be an hour afterwards—he asked for the bill—Arthur did not make any answer, he kept quiet, he never said anything—the prisoner said "If you have not got it accepted you had better give it to my brother and let him go and get it at once"—Arthur said he would go down to Robinson at Wimbledon that afternoon or evening—the bill was given to me across the desk by my brother Charley and I Wrote across it "Accepted payable at the London and South Western Bank, Wimbledon," and then handed it to Arthur—at that time the name of Robinson was not on the bill; that I am certain of—Arthur said he would go round that evening with it—my brother Charles left the office with him—next morning Arthur brought the bill into the office, he offered me the bill—I said I did not want it then as I was going out—he said "I have got the bill accepted and you had better take it"—I looked at it, and it was signed "J. Robinson"—he kept it and gave it over to my brother with a few other bills—I saw the bill again that day; I put it and other bills out on my brother's desk for him to endorse; he came in about 5.30 I think and he endorsed the bills, a lot of them put together, and Arthur went with them to Mr. Landers—when Arthur returned the first morning with the bill he seemed as if he had been drinking—I have been in the office two years; I have seen him in that state many a time—my brother told him on this occasion that he would have to leave if he did not behave himself and alter from the way he was going on; and he said he would be better in future, and would not drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We keep a bill book in the office, I cannot tell where it is, I last saw it when I left it in the desk, I can't say for certain when that was—I left the employment about two months or six weeks ago—I can't say for certain, I don't know that I have left yet, until the break up—I am not at work there under the receiver, Arthur is—I left the bill book in the desk—I believe this bill was entered in the bill book, I can't say for certain, because I did not enter the bill book up myself, the prisoner did—I have seen the bill book—I don't know that this bill was never in it, I expect it was put in with the others, they were all entered together—I believe Atkins's bill was in, I believe they were all put in together—I did not look in the bill book myself; there was something like 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of bills sent away together; they were all entered up at the same time—I expect that Atkins's bill would be entered with the others; I will swear it was—I have a brother named Claude Ernest, it was Charles Joseph who was at the Middlesex Sessions a day or two ago—he was charged with obtaining money under false pretences, on a false charge, as Mr. Cox said—it was in reference to a bill—I do not know Mr. John Ray, a solicitor—I never heard of him—I know Mr. Hartwell—my brother and Mr. Kittier have had transactions with him; I have only done so through the firm, being a clerk there; he has bought goods of the firm—a bill for 199<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was brought to my brother to get discounted by Mr. Hartwell—he did not discount it, he did not turn it into coin; Mr. Stewart's brother has it, at least Kearsey, Son, and Hawes—Stewart's are slate merchants and creditors of my brother to the amount of between 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my brother left the bill for 199<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with them to discount and hand him the proceeds, but when the noise occurred Mr. Stewart said he would not give the bill up until he gave it up to the right man; that is Mr. Hartwell.</p>

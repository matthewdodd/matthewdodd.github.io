            , the man at the bar, he says you have robbed this coach or this gentleman I will not be positive which, were the words; he called for assistance, and I caught him by the leg; I heard some thing drop to the ground, we secured him, and got his hand fast; I called for a light, and picked up a pistol loaded and cocked. I live about a quarter of a mile from the back of Chelsea College; the prisoner said it was distress that drove him to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Maslin. How came you not to tell me this part of the story? - I was coming down King's Road, and I jumped off my box, I was setting down one passenger there, the person that robbed the coach went forward, and I got up to him, and I got off my box and I seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the person you seized? - I have a little doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to jump off your coach? - I had a strong suspicion; if you put me to my oath, I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Court. How dare you to want to suppress this case in this manner; have you been with him in gaol? - No, I have never seen him till this present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the pistol was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think it is a great piece of prevarication, as to the first instance of my being taken. I was taken at a distance off almost a quarter of a mile; no property found, the prosecutor said it was so dark he could not rightly tell a man from a woman; in my commitment it is eight shillings that he lost, now he swears to an half crown piece; and now the coachman first swears to one evidence and afterwards to another; I was taken to the watch-house, and then this man comes up and says that is the man, before that one of the evidence that is come against me says, that he was asked to stop by another; the man then looks at me a second time, why was not that other man as likely to drop the pistol as me.</p>
               <p>Court to Pilkington. Was there any body else apprehended on this charge? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Jones. I was partly examined; I can tell more, it is as much for the prisoner, as it is against him, alluding to what he has said, there was a person of the name of Hoggs who said the prisoner attempted to rob him on the side of Battle-bridge, so as the prisoner at the bar came by, he said that is the man; and I said let me have your horse and I will follow him, let him go where he will; Mr. Pilkington was present when he was searched.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

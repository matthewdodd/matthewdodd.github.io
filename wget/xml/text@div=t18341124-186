                  </hi>. I live on my property, in the Vauxhall-road, Pimlico. On the night of the 22nd of August, I was returning from Blackheath to my residence—I got to New-cross about a quarter or ten minutes to ten o'clock—I had drank more than I should have done—when I got near New-cross, I found myself Very ill in the stomach, and sat down on the bank by the side of the road—I found my watch was gone, and my chain, and six gold seals—afterwards I got up from there, and walked on; and met a policeman, named Redwood, whose father I had known very well—I told him of it—I had discovered I had lost my watch, before I met him—I discovered that before ten o'clock—I felt it safe about the turnpike gate, on this side of Deptford—I do not think the bank it above one hundred yards from the turnpike-gate—I felt in my pocket, and found the guard-chain, which was round my neck under my waistcoat, was broken, and the watch gone—I had not felt any body tugging at my watch—I was either knocked down, or pushed down fin the road, I think—I did not feel any body near me—I felt a knock or push when I got up from the bank—it was after that that I found my chain broken—a man pushed me down—that is the person standing there, (the prisoner)—I gave a description of him—it was after that man knocked or pushed me down, that I missed my watch—after that I met the policeman, and told him some<lb></lb>thing—to the best of my recollection, it was the prisoner—I did not know whether I was pushed or knocked down, but the more I have looked at the prisoner these three or four days, I am the more convinced—I got into a hackney coach, and went home without speaking that night—when the witness looked for me that night, I was gone off in the coach—I did not see the prisoner before that night—I have no recollection of drinking with him—he was shown to me the morning after the robbery, and I swore he was the man who was ill using me that night; and I asked him what he had done with my watch and seals—he said he had never seen them—I do not recollect feeling any thing done to my watch or watch chain, at the time I was pushed or knocked down—my watch was in my fob, and the guard was round my neck—that was broken, and I look upon it it was broken with a pair of pinchers—it was a very strong one—I put it under my waistcoat—it was made of strong steel—I do not know what parish the place is in where I received the push—I believe they call it St. Paul's, Deptford—it is in Surrey—I had six gold seals to my watch, and a steel chain—the watch was a silver hunter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's servant. On the 22nd of August I was in the service of Mr. Halden, at New Cross, near the turnpike—on that night I was coming out of my master's gate, about ten minutes before ten o'clock—I saw two men up against a high wall on the opposite side of the road—I think the road is about twenty yards wide—they were both close together, and did not move on—they were standing up—during the time they were standing against the wall a cart or waggon went by—I did not take particular notice which—after that went by, the young man's hat fell off—one was an old man, and the other a young man—the young man had his back towards me, and he had the old gentleman against the wall for about two minutes—they were standing still, only the young man had his arms round him somewhere about his middle, as I thought—after they had been there about two minutes, or two minutes and a half, the young man's hat went off, and he left go of the old gentleman, and walked away—the footpath is <hi rend="italic">feather-edged</hi> off, and the old gentleman walked away about fifteen yards into the road—the young man then felt on the footpath, as if he was feeling for something—he also grappled in the grass on each side the footpath, both by the wall and the other side—he then picked up his hat, and ran after the old gentleman, who had got about fifteen yards down in the middle of the road—he laid hold of him, and flung him down on his back—he had him there about a minute and a half in the middle of the high road—the old gentleman's hat fell off about five yards from him—I was standing at the end of the lane—I had not gone on—I stood my ground—I did not stir a foot—it was fifteen yards from where I stood to where the young man threw the old man down—the young man left the old man down in the road—the old man had gone rather farther down the road—I do not think I was more than fifteen yards off when I saw him thrown down in the road—it was the width of the road—the young man left him, and ran towards me—I was standing at the end of the lane—I could not see his face, but I took the <hi rend="italic">dimensions</hi> of his height and his dress while he ran up towards me—I saw he had on a dark coat, a dark waistcoat, and dark trowsers, and he had on a very narrow-brimmed hat—he passed by me—he was running, but not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240199"></xptr>
               <p>very quick—a slow run—he went by me down Newcross-lane, the lane leading to Mr. Hardcastle's—it leads down—it is a kind of back carriage way down to Mr. Hardcastle's house, and it leads down to a pathway—it is a narrow cut for foot-passengers—it leads also to a footway either going to the Five Bells, or you can turn to the right—I lost sight of him for about two minutes—I ran to the old gentleman, and asked him what the man had done <hi rend="italic">at</hi> him—the gentleman said something, and I immediately ran after the man down the lane—I could see nobody going down the lane—I ran half way down, and thought he had jumped over some palings into a field—I ran back again to the old gentleman, and said, "Has he robbed you of any thing else?"—he said, "I don't know at present;" and while I was speaking to him, I saw a man come from over the field, which was twenty or twenty-five yards off, up the road, over a kind of bank, not a hedge—the man who ran down the lane could very well have returned and come over that bank—I did not see him come over the top of the bank, but I saw him run from the bank into the middle of the high road, across the footpath—I did not see him come over the bank—he came from the bank—he came into the road with his hands under his coat flap, and walked coolly down to the old gentleman and me—I was not making any words, or talking—he said, "What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was the young man with his hands under his coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The pri<lb></lb>soner—I said, "This gentleman has just been robbed of his watch"—he said, "Oh, that be d—d, nothing of the kind"—I then said, "He has, for I saw it all"—I said "I will have nothing to do with it," and I bade them good night—I ran up towards Croydon canal bridge to see for a policeman—I did not see any, and I returned back again—I did not see either the pri<lb></lb>soner or the prosecutor—they were gone—I saw the prisoner again about a quarter of an hour after, below the Newcross turnpike-gate, opposite Mr. Hardcastle's gate nearly—it leads up to what I call the front coach-road, further down from London—he was by himself walking along the road—I did not give him in charge—I told the policeman, when I saw him coming down Mr. Hardcastle's coach-road, what had happened—I gave a descrip<lb></lb>tion of it to the policeman, Ledger, of the R division, and he took him in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You observed the height, figure, and dress of the man; what is your belief as to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is the same man by dress that passed me at the end of the lane from the old man, and came up again—he has the same dress, and is the same height, as near as I can guess, but I did not see the young man's face—it might be another man in the same dress—I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now you were in the service of a respectable gentleman, named Halden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was at that time—I have left about a month, or rather better—I left him on account of the garden—I believe he discharged me—I am quite sure he did—the place did not exactly suit me—there was another reason—I had been to the George, and had a pint of beer along with a friend, and coming home, master thought I was rather tipsy—I was not discharged for beastly drunkenness, but because I smiled in my master's face—I had had two pints of beer—it was about five o'clock in the evening, half an hour before they dined—I took in the tray, to lay the cloth—master told me to go out of the house be<lb></lb>cause I smiled in his face, and he was angry—he said he thought I was a little in liquor—he said, "Go out of my house"—I said, "Sir, allow me to put on my hat and jacket, and I will go"—my master pushed me about—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240200"></xptr>
               <p>I had the front door in my hand, and he came and gave me a push out; not because I was drunk, but because I smiled in his face—I was examined before the magistrate—the young man appeared to be feeling for something, and was grappling the grass at the side—I stated that before the magistrate, and about his picking up his hat—I am certain I said the old man was fif<lb></lb>teen yards down in the middle of the road when the young man overtook him, and that he laid hold of him, and flung him down on his back—the young man had the old man against the wall for about two minutes and a half—I said so before the magistrate, and that he took hold of him round the waist—that the old gentleman's hat flew off five yards from him—that I took the dimensions of his height—that he went away past me at a slow run—that when he asked what was the matter, I said the old gentleman had been robbed; and he replied, "That be d—d," &amp;c.—that he came up, with his hands behind him, as if nothing was the matter: and that I said I would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand from your evidence when you had this conversation with the young man, after coming up to the assistance of the old one, that you believed him to be the person who robbed the old man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believed him to be the person who passed by me down the lane, and that was the person, by his dress, whom I saw with the old gentleman, and who robbed him, if he was robbed there—after I had the conversation with the person, I went away, and left them together—they were together alone, walking away—my suspicions were not at all excited from what I saw at my mas<lb></lb>ter's gate—I did not know what they were about, until I saw the old man down in the high road—the man ran towards me after flinging him down in the road—I was determined to be sure whether he had robbed him, before I took him, and I went and asked him—I would not take hold of him till I knew from the old gentleman what was the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think it proper to stop him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have been proper, but I thought I would go and see if he had robbed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

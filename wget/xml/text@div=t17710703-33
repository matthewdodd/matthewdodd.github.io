            . The father and mother of the child are acquaintances of mine; they live about two streets of from me. I went to Mr. Sharpe's to get a pot of beer; he keeps a public house. Mr. Sharpe has three children; I saw the two youngest at play. I asked where Betty was; Mrs. Sharpe said she was not well. I went up, and asked her how she did; she said, very bad. I said, is it a fever or a cold; she said she had got an odd running upon her. I asked her what; she said her mammy could tell me; she said she was sore where she made water. I look'd at her; she look'd very much swelled and inflamed; her shift was discoloured. I said, I am afraid some little boy has been playing tricks with you, or some man; and if you don't confess the truth, your mammy won't get you cured, and you will die. Then she colour'd, and burst out a crying, and said I will tell you who it was if you won't tell my dada; I said I would not, but would tell her mama. She said it was Mr. Craige. I asked her who he was; she said, the man that work'd for her father. I asked her how he met with her; she said she was playing with some peas, tossing them up upon the bed, as she sat in the room playing with her doll. As she went to get some of the peas, he throw'd her upon the bed, and did something that hurt her, and pressed her so hard upon her belly that she could eat no victuals all next day. I asked why she did not tell her mother; she said she was afraid: for he had told her, that if she told it, her father and mother would beat her. I asked how long she had had this running; she said, on Tuesday, the day before. I asked her if he had had any thing to do with her; she said, yes, some days before, I can't remember what day; and in the whole, three times, on different days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you when the first time was?</p>
               <p>Burt. Yes, upon Good Friday: the last time was the Monday, I think, before it was found out. I went down stairs, and told Mrs. Sharpe of it, and call'd in Mr. Sharpe, and told him. He went to the justice, and had the prisoner taken up; I had seen the man before, but did not know his name.</p>

            . When I had taken the prisoner up, as I was going to the justice he turned his head about and look'd at me. I said, How can you look me in the face after you have used me so ill, though I have been a father to you; he said his heart was ready to break.</p>
               <p>Q. He denied the charge I suppose?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Not to me; he did before the justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any surgeon that examined the child?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. The surgeon deposed that the child's body was not entered, but injured; he is not here.</p>

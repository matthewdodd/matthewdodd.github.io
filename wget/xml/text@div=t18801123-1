I live at 41, Edward Square, Islington, and am a wood turner—the prisoner is the husband of my late wife's eldest sister—his home was at Footscray, in Australia—he arrived in this country on 16th March—he stayed at my house from 18th March to the 16th August, five months all but three days—on 16th August the prisoner, my wife, and her brother left my house, not together, but within a quarter of an hour of one another; my wife had not my permission to go—I saw her again on 8th October—I did not know where she was living between 16th August and 8th October—on 8th October she came to the place where I worked, 69, Southampton Street, Pentonville—on the 11th I saw the prisoner; he came to my work in the morning; I told him if he waited till dinner-time I would fetch his letters, and give them to him—I did so, and he gave me an acknowledgment—I asked him if he had seen my wife; he said he could take his Bible oath that he had seen nothing of her since 16th August, when they left my place—since that time I have had no conversation with him—on 21st October my wife returned to my home; she only slept there on that night—on Friday morning, the 22nd, I went to my work—I returned home at dinner-time; my wife was not there then—she did not sleep at home on the night of the 22nd—on the 23rd I went to the Great Northern Hospital, between 10 and 11 in the morning; I there saw the dead body of my wife, Jane Messenger—her brothers name is Samuel Bernard Anstace.</p>

               <p>had married my wife's elder sister, and that he had a grown-up family out in Australia, sons and daughters; he told me so, I did not know it otherwise; I did not know it from my wife, not before he came—he said that he used to do slipper-making in Australia, and his wife kept a dairy, and that he came home, leaving her there—I do not know how he had got the money to come home; I do not know at all what his means were, whether he was in a state of poverty there, or that he had a difficulty in getting the money to come home—my wife's brother was not stopping at my house when the prisoner came home; he did not come there till 2nd August; he arrived on Bank Holiday from Canada; he came to stop in the house, and stayed there till the 16th—we used all to be together; we had our meals together—the prisoner came to England to try to get an estate for the brother, Samuel Anstace, and for his wife, for the family; he thought the wife's brother <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> was dead when he came over, and he came to lay claim to the estate for his wife—I don't know exactly the date when he first knew that the brother was not dead; it was not soon after he came back, it was some time after—he was under the impression that the estate he had come home to claim was of enormous value—as far as I know, he believed that his wife's family were entitled to it; it was the constant subject of conversation on his part; it is an estate called the Stock well Park Estate; he used to say the value of it was close on 175,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a veer—he was a great deal with the brother; they were always together, talking on this subject—he was not in a feeble state of health when he came home; once or twice he said he had got a bad cold; he was not attended by a doctor indoors, he went to a doctor—he was not very unwell for weeks, that I am aware of; I know he went once or twice to the doctor, he might have gone when I did not know—I only noticed his trembling once, that was when he had the first letter from his wife—I did not take much notice of him myself, I was not much in<lb></lb>doors with him—I did not know of the state of his health being con<lb></lb>sidered dangerous, or of his having been advised to leave where he was—he never said to me that the scenes he had witnessed were too much for him—I heard my wife say once that she could not stand my treat<lb></lb>ment—I think that was about a week before she left home—I think it was said to an old lady who used to live with us—her brother has not spoken to me about my treatment of her—I am not aware that she was attended by Dr. Chalmers for injuries that she had received—she was attended by Dr. Chalmers, he was our family doctor; I don't know what for, only when she was confined; not for injuries that she had received that I am aware of—I heard after she went away that she had sought the protection of a Magistrate, but she told me when she came back that it was nothing of the kind—I do not know that it was her own brother who took her away; he and her went away together while I was at my work—I don't know that she left by the persuasion of the neighbours—I sought to find her—she came to see me on 8th October—I did not try to find out where he was that same night; I asked her, but she would not tell me where she was living, she would not even tell me the station she had to get out at—I did not prevent her going back again, because I wanted her to bring the child back with her—she had taken the child with her, and when she came back to me she brought the child—I did not like to prevent her going away then, because I wanted the things she had taken away with her, as well as wanting the child—I had no idea</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow and live at 45, Stonefish Street, Not<lb></lb>ting Hill—on 8th August a friend of mine brought the prisoner and Mrs. Messenger, and her brother to my house; they wanted two rooms—I had but one to let—they came again on 16th August, together, about 3 o'clock in the day, and they continued to live at my house for seven or eight weeks—they had one common room, and Mrs. Messenger slept in my par<lb></lb>lour—she had a child with her, and the child slept with her—they took their meals together in the common room—there was a bed in that room—the prisoner and the brother <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> slept in that bed—in the day time they were all together upstairs—<hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> went out sometimes—the prisoner and the deceased were sometimes left alone in the upstairs room—I can't say exactly how long <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> stayed there; it might have been four or five weeks, be then left—after he left the prisoner and the deceased continued to occupy the upstairs room during the day time, she continuing to sleep downstairs with the child as before;—the child was between three and four years of age—I used my parlour in the day time, and I used to sleep there as well as the deceased and her child—the other rooms were occu<lb></lb>pied—in the morning the deceased used to go upstairs to the room where the prisoner was, when she had dressed herself—the prisoner left my house a week before Mrs. Messenger; he left on the Saturday morning as she left on the Thursday evening following, 21st October—between the Saturday and the Thursday the prisoner used to come to see her every day—she told me where she had taken a room for him—I never saw her again alive after she left on the Thursday evening—when I last saw them together they appeared to be on good terms, I never saw them any other way but on good terms.</p>

               <p>nothing to do—I did not notice the state of health he was in—he did not seem to be in a desponding state; I did not see much of him; I only thought he was strange, that was all; he would creep about the house so, come downstairs without his shoes, and I thought it was funny for a man to do that, I thought it might be because he should not make a noise—there was nothing else that I noticed strange about him—Mrs. Messenger told me one day that she had found a bottle of laudanum in his pocket, and she told me she threw it under the grate—no scene took place about it—she said when she told the prisoner of it that he said "Eh, what?"—she told me that she accused him of intending to poison her—they had been there some weeks when she told me this—I may have used the expression "he was in a terrible way," because she told me that he spoke in that style "Eh, what?"—I don't know whether that bottle of laudanam was destroyed, I did not see it—I only heard of its being destroyed; there was another one found a day or two before the deceased left—it was not shown to me—Mrs. Messenger told me she had found another bottle—she did not give it me, she told me where it was, and left it there, and I got it—she asked me whether she should throw it away or whether I would accept it—during the time they were there I never heard the slightest sign of quarrelling—when they first came the one thing that seemed to occupy the prisoner's mind was the claim to the property, but not so much at the latter part, after the brother left—I understood that when he left he went to one of his sisters, I am speaking of <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>—when the prisoner left he went to live at a milk shop dose handy, I can't think of the name of the street—I knew the deceased was going to leave, I think the next day after she had seen her husband, I knew it then for the first time.</p>

I live at 25, Chatterton Street, Finsbury Park—I am agent to a railway company—on Friday, 22nd October, about 12.30 in the day, I was entering Finsbury Park from the Blackstock Road—I saw the prisoner there with a lady; they were entering by the same gate walking side by side—they took the path to the north of the inner circle of the park—I lost sight of them for a short time—I saw them again in from 10 to 15 minutes—they were then sitting on one of the seats oppo<lb></lb>site the lake—they were in conversation—I then made my way out to the park, it commenced raining—as I was going along I heard a report of a pistol—that was about four or five minutes after I had seen the prisoner and the lady sitting on the seat—I at once turned round and saw the lady running away from the prisoner towards me; he was running after her trying to catch hold of her—I ran towards them, and saw the prisoner fire at her breast—I saw the revolver; he had hold of the woman's shawl with his left hand and fired with his right—she fell on her knees, held her hands up, and appeared to implore the prisoner to spare her, and looked at him in the face—he fired at her again, he aimed at her breast; he was not more than three feet from her when he fired that shot—I was about 20 yards off—she then fell forward on her face—the prisoner then</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went into the park to walk about, I was not well at the time—from the time I saw them first till I heard the first shot was from 15 to 20 minutes—I did not hear what they said, but I could have done if I had paid attention; there was nothing to prevent my hearing if I had wished—there were very few people about—when he fired the third shot he was within 3 feet of her, and I was about 20 yards off, not more—he moved his coat aside and fired at his heart with very great coolness and deliberation; after he had shot himself the revolver dropped from his hand, he made an attempt to get it—it was not a struggle, he made a rush—the woman never spoke in my hearing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Bland and Sons, gun<lb></lb>makers, 106, Strand—I remember on Monday, 25th October, Inspector Macfadden making some inquiries at our shop—a few days before that, I can't swear to the date, the prisoner came to the shop rather early in the morning; he said he wanted a revolver; he asked the price; I said we had none of our own make under two guineas; he said "That is much too dear for me, I want a much cheaper one;" he said that he was going to Australia, going into the bush., that he had been there before, that he did not want one for use, only as a matter of show, that he never had any occasion to use one, he wanted it to lay in his portmanteau in case of necessity, he might want to use it, he hoped he never should—I showed him a very common one, of a foreign make, and told him the price was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he said that would suit him—I sold him the revolver and a box of cartridges—I cannot identify this revolver; it was very much like this, and these cartridges would be the size for this revolver—they are similar to what I sold him—he paid for them, and took them away with him.</p>

I did not ascertain that the prisoner had been suffering from illness recently, I never heard it alleged until to-day—I did not make inquiries of Dr. Chalmers as to whether he had been attending him—I have said that from inquiries I had made. I believed that the address in the pocket-book was written some six weeks before, when he stated that he was a little ill; that was what the persons referred to said—I have said that I heard to-day for the first time of his suffering from illness; I meant illness to the extent of being attended by a medical man.</p>

I am house surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital—on 22nd October, at 1.30 in the day, I saw the deceased woman, Jane Messenger, at the hospital; she was dressed—I examined her; on the right side of the body, in front of the chest, she was burnt; the dress was also burnt, the body and part of the stays; I think my hand would cover the space that was burnt; there was a corresponding indentation on the steel of the stays, and a bruise on the chest corresponding to that indentation; on the left side of the body I found holes in the dress and bodice, and a circular wound between the third and fourth ribs, about an inch inside the nipple—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found that a bullet had passed through the chest, injuring the left auricle of the heart and the right part of the left lung, and become buried in the sixth rib. two inches from the spine; death was caused by the bullet injuring the heart and lung—I handed the bullet to the Coroner, and the Coroner handed it to Inspector Macfadden—the deceased appeared to be about 35 years of age, as far as I could judge.</p>

I reside at 16, Connaught Square, and am senior surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital—on 22nd October, about 2 in the day, I examined the prisoner at the hospital—he was gasping for breath—I found a small triangular penetrating wound, two inches in a vertical line below the left nipple; blood was still trickling from it; there was a corresponding aperture in his jersey—the ball had traversed the chest, and has lodged there very deep—there was no second aperture; the ball was never extracted; it is lodged in his chest now—he remained under my care until he was removed, about three weeks after his admis<lb></lb>sion—I believe he was removed on the morning of the day that he went to the police-court.</p>

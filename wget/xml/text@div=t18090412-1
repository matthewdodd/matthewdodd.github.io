               <p>ROBEAT COOMME. Q. You are a soldier in the seventh veteran battalion - A. Yes. On the 28th of February I was a centinel at the magazine at the end of the white tower; I was stationed at the Tower; the prisoner was a labourer belonging to the Tower, he was employed by the board of ordnance. On this day, about twenty minutes before six in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner go behind some old ropes, I saw him take some paint up in a bladder and put it in his pocket; I took it out, I told him he should not have it; I kept the paint till the corporal came to relieve me; I let the prisoner go; I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I was corporal of the guard. I received the paint of the last witness; I delivered it to the officer of the guard; he delivered it to Gotty the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the Thames police. The paint I got from the clerk of the storehouse; I have had it ever since. I apprehended the prisoner in Brush alley, East Smithfield, on the 3d of March; I told him I must take him in custody for stealing the paint, and a pistol that he had taken from the Tower; he said he knew nothing about the pistol, he had not got it.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER. I am clerk in the storekeeper's office in the Tower; the prisoner was employed as an extra man in the different store offices.</p>

On this evening I went down to get a bit of wood to light a fire; this paper I saw there; I took it up, the centinel ordered me to put it down again; I put it down again, and then he said nothing to me, he was not thirty yards from me at the time.</p>

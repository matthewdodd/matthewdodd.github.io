                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Affirmed</hi>). I am agent to Messrs. Chance Brothers, Finsbury Circus—on Friday afternoon, 21st June, about 4 o'clock, I was in Princes Street, near the Bank, intending to go into an urinal, but I changed my mind, and came out on the northern side, in Lothbury—the prisoner and another man came up to me; I thought I had seen the prisoner before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187207080052"></xptr>
               <p>—I examined his face carefully, and watched him—when he got up to me I was pinioned up against the wall of the urinal, and immediately found a hand going to my watch; it was removed, and I saw it go in the direction of the other man, but could not see what was in it—they both pressed against me, and the prisoner removed my watch from my chain—I dashed into the street, holding up my umbrella and shouting, "Stop thief!"—I am a little lame—I do not think I lost sight of the prisoner—I am certain he is the man I saw running, and I think I saw him all the way, but I can only judge by his back—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the man who took my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am short-sighted—I cannot say whether I mentioned before the Magistrate about my watching the prisoner before he came up to me—I was very much agitated from illness—when I called "Stop thief!" I was about twenty or twenty-five yards from the men—mine is rather a confused sight, but I can see objects at a considerable distance—I did not ask to have another look at the prisoner at the station because I was not sure of him, but as I did not know how long it might be before I had to appear against him I wished to examine his face clearly and fully, that his features might not go out of my mind—he was brought in, and I had a good long look at him for about three minutes, that I might keep him in my mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the man; if I had I should not be here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inquiry agent, of 15, Basinghall Street—on the 21st June I was in Lothbury, about 4.30 p.m., and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running, and stopped him—another man came up and said "It is all a mistake, you are not the man"—the prisoner put his hands together and touched him about the breast, and he made off for Bell Alley—the prisoner then said "What do you want? what is the matter? I am not the man"—I said "Well, we will wait and hear what the people have to say"—the prosecutor came up, saying "I have lost my watch; that is the man—I said "Your watch has gone round the corner with the prisoner's friend"—I should know the other man again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw nothing pass, but I saw his hand touch the other man's—he did not offer to strike me, but he struggled—he was not in my custody alone, there were several.</p>

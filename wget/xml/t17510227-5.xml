            . When the prisoner and the other man went away, there came a link by the door; I going the same way, took the benefit of it. I came up with them in about three quarters of a mile walking: when I was about 20 yards behind them, I saw the china mug in the prisoner's hand; the prosecutor had told me of it before, and I had been privately looking about the house with him for it, and he told me he suspected the prisoner had it. So I went up to him, and took him by the collar, and said, Jack, that is Mr. Nash's mug, give it me; he put it into his bosom, then he took me fast by the collar. I cry'd out I had stop'd a thief; the person along with him stood close by us, but neither assisted me or him. I said again, he had robb'd Mr. Nash of a china mug. Then he threw it over a wall belonging to the Widow Withers. I went and knock'd at the door, and got a candle and lanthorn, and went into the yard behind the wall, and pick'd up the mug<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270004"></xptr> broke in pieces. The pieces were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor, and one of the same pattern compared with it, which he brought.</p>

               <p>I was at Mr. Nash's house this night, and drank four or five pots of slip. After the reckoning was paid, Mr. Ambler and I went away together; I fell down three or four times, and I pick'd up this mug near a pair of gates where lay some dung; I did not know whether it was a common white mug or a china mug; and in walking about a quarter of a mile, this Mr. Scot came after me, and said I stole it. So I shov'd him up against the wall, and threw it over the wall.</p>

On the 21st of April, he came to me, he brought several articles, which I cannot charge my memory; and among the rest he brought some parasols and an umbrella; he sold them to me; I suspected him, and sent my lad after him. The lad lost him in Exeter-change; he came back and told me had lost the prisoner. I then found out his master, and sent to a relation of Mr. Fossick. In consequence of that Mr. Fossick waited upon me, he saw the parasols, and the umbrella; which he claimed. These are them. I am quite sure they were brought to me by the prisoner. I gave the prisoner eleven shillings a piece, for the parasols and for the umbrella 15 s. 6 s. The prisoner had been at my shop selling umbrellas. When he came with the three parasoand the umbrella I bought them, as Mr. Fossick wished to detect him.</p>

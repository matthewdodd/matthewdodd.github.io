               <p>Q. What time of the day was it - A. I cannot say; I was asleep when it was taken out of my pocket. I went to sleep about half past one in the day; I awoke between three and four in the afternoon; the prisoner was in my company then; he said I had another hour to sleep. I was going away by the afternoon coach, and I awoke by the noise in the house. That was about half past four. I went to the door, looked in my pocket-book, and missed my notes. A post chaise man stood against the public-house door, I asked him what notes were left in my pocket-book. I cannot read; I do not know one note from another. He said there was a one pound note and a five-pound in the pocket-book. There ought to have been a ten pound note and another one pound in the pocketbook. I told the landlord I had been robbed; he told me to go for an officer. I went to Hatton Garden office, and got an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who took it, do you - A. No. The prisoner went out of the house when the office came.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor told me he had lost a ten pound note. He did not say at that time that he had lost any more. I learned who was in company with him. I searched the other man that was in company him. The prisoner was gone then. They told me the prisoner also<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060056"></xptr>was in company with him. The prisoner, I learned, was a ostler to Mr. Fagg, a stage master. I sent for the prisoner; he came. I accused him of the robbery; she denied knowing any thing about it. I took him to his master's stables, and told him I was sure he was the person that had got the note, and I would not leave you stable until I found it. I proceeded in searching and when I came to a little cupboard, he then said if I would turn my back to the door he would take out the note and give it me. I turned my back to the door; he put his hand into the cupboard, then put his hand to mine; he put this ten pound note into my hand. I took the prisoner to the office. One of Mr. Fagg's men came to the office, and said they had found a one pound note in the stable. I went down to Mr. Fagg; he delivered me the one pound note. It was in an old shoe. The prisoner owned to taking the ten pound note. He said if they hang me for it, I will tell you where it is.</p>

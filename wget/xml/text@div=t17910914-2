               <p>I saw the prisoner come out of this house with a trunk in his hand; I am very sure it was him; he came out of the back room, one pair of stairs; he had the trunk in his hand, and was putting it on his shoulder; he walked across the road with it; I let him go on till I went up stairs to see if any body was at home; I found nobody in that room; I ran down stairs, and ran across the road to Mr. Bearden, who kept a publick-house, and he assisted me to take the man; he had the trunk on his shoulder; this is the same trunk.</p>

               <p>(The trunk and articles in it deposed to by Railton, who said he left it in the room, and saw it the next day at the justice's; the value of them is 2 l. 7 s. 9 d. he shut to the door of the room when he went out, but so as the servant could get in to make the bed.)</p>

               <p>I was a publican at the time of this robbery; I saw him with this trunk on his shoulder, the 5th of July, in Princes-street; I took him, and Franklin took the trunk.</p>

               <p>Bearden. There is no truth in that; I said I was bound to prosecute him in the penalty of 40 l.</p>

On Tuesday afternoon, 27th March, between two and three o'clock, Burland came to the gate with a truck, containing four empty casks—he presented this pass to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—no person with empty casks is allowed to pass without one—I gave the pass to Mr. Clements in Sayre's presence, and gave Burland into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Docks. Between three and four o'clock on this afternoon I went with Burland to the barque <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>; she was then hauling out of the dock, about to start on a voyage—I asked the mate, Parker, in the prisoner's presence, if the pass was his writing—he said no, his name was not Smith, but Parker—I asked if he had delivered any casks to the prisoner in the course of the day—he said, "No"—I asked if he knew Burland—he said, "No"—I asked him if there was any one on board named Smith—he said, "No"—on the next Saturday I accompanied Egerton to a house in Grove's-alley, Wellclose-square—I saw Woolford in Egerton's custody—I asked him his name, told him what I was, and asked him if he was in the London Dock on Monday—(that was with reference to another matter)—he said, "No"—I said, "Were you there on Tuesday?""—he said, "No"—I said, "Were you not on the jetty?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you not load some casks?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I take you in custody on the charge of stealing four casks"—he had been interdicted for some time from coming into the Docks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 193). On Tuesday afternoon, 27th March, I was in the London Docks, and a little before three o'clock saw both the prisoners together at the bottom of the jetty, looking amongst some empty casks—I saw them again a little while after against the new ware-houses in the roadway leading to the jetty, with a truck with two casks in it—Burland had hold of the truck—Woolford then put two more casks on the truck, Burland drew it along, and Woolford pushed behind—as they went along one cask fell off, Woolford picked it up and put it on again—they went in the direction of the principal entrance, where Cross was—I saw the same casks next morning in Sayre's charge—I do not know where the <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi> was lying—the <hi rend="italic">William Wilson</hi> was lying alongside the jetty, where I first saw the prisoners—on the following Saturday I went with Sayre to Grove's-alley, Wellclose-square, and inquired for the prisoner Woolford—I was told he was at home—I said I wanted to engage him for a job, they then came down and told me he was not at home—we went away from the door, went back again, and I said, "Woolford is at home"—a female said, "He is not, he has been out a</p>

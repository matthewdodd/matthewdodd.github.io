I went out on the 5th of December about three in the afternoon, and left 22 new gold rings in one bunch, and five old ones in another, hanging in the window. In about a quarter of an hour I had a messenger came and told me what had happened. The other witnesses can give a farther account.</p>
               <p>Elenor Henderson. I am daughter to the prosecutor. After my mother had been gone out about five minutes, the two prisoners came in for a cap, which Flidger had pawned. We have a partition that parts the shop. I went to that part where the things in pledge are for it; I heard a foot come round the counter, and the prisoners whisper. Our maid had just washed by the counter, and, it being wet, I observed the print of a muddy foot as I was going round the counter. They were both together where I left them then. I said somebody had been round. Solowin said, who should be behind your counter? I said, very likely you have. She said, she had not. Then Flidger said, who is to behind your counter? I went behind the counter to see what was lost, and a young person called to me at the window, and told me a woman had been round the counter, and had taken something out. I said they should be searched; Flidger said, for what? They dared me to search them. Then I called a gentleman in; he said, no body should go out of the room till they were searched. Then Flidger said, come into the kitchen. I and the maid went there with her, and she delivered the 22 new gold rings to me, and Solowin had given them to her, and desired I would let them go.</p>

            . I was going by Mr. Henderson's shop at this time; and, stopping to speak to a young woman in the street just by the window, I was looking in, and saw Solowin go behind the counter, and take down the rings from the window. I saw the upper part of her body at the time, and am certain it was she. She took also a little parcel; but she let them fall. I called and told young Mrs. Henderson; then I went into the shop, and am sure to the person, though I never saw her before to my knowlege.</p>

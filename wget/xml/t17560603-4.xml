            . The prisoner confessed in my hearing before justice Manley she stole the piece of money. So the thirty-six shilling piece, was lodg'd in my hands, and I have had it ever since, (producing it. )</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at my liberty about a fortnight and after that they took me up again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Atkerson. When was it that you heard this confession ?</p>
               <p>Atkerson. It was on the 27th of April. Justice Manley did not care to meddle with it, and advised me to take her before Mr. Fielding, but when I came out at the door she was gone. I took her up again on the 3d of May, and let her go home that night to her mother, and she came to me the next morning according to her word. I took her before justice Fielding, and she was committed. She was examin'd again on the 7th before her master.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How long after the 18th of May was it that you took the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was about nine days after.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not secure her at the time ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I came down stairs she was gone out of the house, and I never saw her till the day I took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she first own to you she took that piece of money?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She own'd she took it that very day. I heard the next Sunday that she was at Chelsea, so I got her secured.</p>
               <p>Atkerson. The prosecutor's wife told me, she would not have been taken up at all, had not she said some disrespectful words of her master and mistress at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>My master told me if I would confess he would let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you make her such a promise ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

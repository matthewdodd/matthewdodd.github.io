               <p>ANGELIOUS BETRAUN. I am an officer. On the 4th of June I was in Oxford-street, near Poland-street; I saw the two prisoners together - Warner had a bundle under his arm: when they saw me they separated, and turned down Poland-street, on different sides of the way - I followed behind some persons, and saw them join and go down Brewer-street, into a coffee-shop - I went in, and said to Warner, who still had the bundle, "I want you?" he was going to give the bundle to Lawrence, but I said, "Bring that with you - what have you here?" he said, "Boots which I brought from Ipswich, where I exchanged some pens and quills for them," and that be lived in Whitechapel; I said he must have given a good many for them - I then asked Lawrence what he knew of them; he said Nothing: I asked which way they had come from Ipswich - they said through Romford and Whitechapel; I asked why they did not leave them in Whitechapel - they said they had been up there to sell some pens and quills.</p>

I was proceeding down Oxford-street on the 4th of June; Warner asked if I knew where there was a coffee-shop - I said Yes, and we walked on to one; the officer came and asked what he had in the bundle - he said shoes, but he would not satisfy him where he got them; he took us: I did not know what was in the bundle.</p>

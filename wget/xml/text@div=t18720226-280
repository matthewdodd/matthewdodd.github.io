                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Edwards, of Clerkenwell—on the evening of 7th February, he sent me for a necklet—I got it, and was bringing it home in my bag—I had the bag by the neck, and put it under my jacket—when I got to the corner of Ashley Street, three men came up and put their hands over my mouth and eyes, and took the bag and necklet—the prisoner was one of them—I had seen them before—they followed me to the jeweller's shop—two of them came first, and one of them had a new pair of trowsers, and he said he was not coming in the mud—they kept beckoning for him to come—I went on the other side of Ashley Street, and the two were beckoning the other one to come up—the prisoner was one of them—after they had taken the bag and necklet, they ran down the street, and I ran too, calling "Stop thief!"—they did not hurt me—two ran down John Street Road, and one went down Corporation Lane—there was a crowd in John Street Road by the beer-shop, and the prisoner came back into the crowd, and a policeman took him.</p>

The prisoner was drinking in the house between nine and ten at night: there was no company, only Mr. Irvin in the kitchen.

               <p>On the 17th of March, at night, the prisoner came into Mr. Hughes's house; Mrs. Hughes had been ironing; the different articles she ironed, she laid in a chair in the kitchen; the prisoner sat herself in another chair, near the chair the different articles lay in; I saw her put her right-hand under a cardinal she had on, and her left-hand she out in the chair, and with that she conveyed the things mentioned in the indictment out of the chair; I told Mrs. Hughes of it; the prisoner, hearing me tell her, got up, and went out immediately; the prisoner came the next morning; we sent for a constable, and detained her; she was searched, but there was nothing found upon her; Mr. Hughes was not in the room; she said, she never saw any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>How came you to let her go away the night before? - I did not know that I had a right to stop her without an officer; I told Mrs. Hughes of it.</p>
               <p>To Hughes. You was not in the kitchen the night before, when the prisoner went away? - No; I never found my things. My wife is not here; she has been bad five weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman. On Saturday morning, 14th Oct., I was in Rood-lane; I noticed a man and his wife walking along, who after<lb></lb>wards turned out to be Mr. and Mrs. Winter—I saw these boys (<hi rend="italic">the pri<lb></lb>soners</hi>) in Rood-lane, about 10 o'clock in the morning; Mr. and Mrs. Winter were walking in the direction of Fenchurch-street—the three lads were together in company; from the manner in which they were following the parties I suspected that they were up to something no good, and was induced to follow them—Mr. and Mrs. Winter walked up Rood-lane from Eastcheap, across Fenchurch-street, going into Lime-street—the lads fol<lb></lb>lowed up close behind—when Mr. and Mrs. Winter got into lime-street, they made a stop to converse, or something of that kind—they were not stopped by a crowd or carriages—when they stopped, I noticed Regan draw his hand from Mrs. Winter's pocket—the other two boys were close behind, quite in reach of each other—their attention was drawn towards the parties that were before them—when Regan took his hand from Mrs. Winter's pocket, the lads immediately turned, and all three went towards Fenchurch-street—that was going back in the same way they came—I cannot exactly say how far I was off, when I saw the lad take his hand out of the pocket—I do not think above fifteen yards, on the opposite side—I went up to Mrs. Winter, and asked if she had lost anything; she missed her purse—she could not go as fast as me, but I followed them into Fenchurch-street, along Gracechurch-street, towards London-bridge—on my way I passed a police<lb></lb>man named Moseley; the three lads had just come by Eastcheap, and were turning down Fish-street-hill—directly after I told the policeman, we fol<lb></lb>lowed them—I took one on London-bridge—I cannot exactly say which, I think Mollony—I did not see the constable take the other; they were taken to the station house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Winter; he is a labouring man, usually residing at Leatherhead, in Surrey—I was in London early on 14th Oct.; I was walking early towards Leadenhall-market with my hus<lb></lb>band—I remember being in Lime-street; we stopped there for a short time, and the last witness came up and asked me if I had lost anything—I imme<lb></lb>diately put my hand into my pocket, and told him I had lost my purse—I had had it; it might have been a quarter of an hour or twenty minute before that—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, when I last saw it—a new sovereign, two half crowns, a two shilling piece, and the rest in shillings—I never saw it again—on Mr. Wellans speaking to me, I followed the lads—I recollect seeing them a short time, before they came up to me—I took notice of them, so as to know them again—these are the three lads—it was in the next street before I came to Lime-street; I do not know the name, I am not acquainted with London—I am confident I saw these three lads.</p>

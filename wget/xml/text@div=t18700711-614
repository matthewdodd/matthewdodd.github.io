                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, in partnership with Dr. Hassal, at Richmond—the prisoner was my assistant—I engaged him about the middle of April—he told me he was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh—I have since had reason to believe he was not—his duty was to make up medicines, to receive all the bills and fees that came in during our absence, and to account for them once a week—he was provided with a cash-book for that purpose—very Boon after his</p>

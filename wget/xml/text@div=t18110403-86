            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Bruton Crescent, near the New-road, Somers Town. On the 20th of February, about seven in the evening, I stopped the prisoner, he had four pieces of pipe on his shoulder, I found afterwards it was twenty-one feet. I asked him where he was going; he said he was a master-man, he was going home with it to No. 7, Norton-street, Fitzroy-square. I said, you must go with me to the watchhouse; he said, suppose I take you to where I am doing the job. I said, that would be as well. He took me to the Norfolk Arms in Leigh-street with this property; he went into the bar, he said, let me leave this here, the watchman has detained me; I suspected he was employed by that publican, Mr. Hill to do the job; I let him go, and as we were coming out I had suspicion that it was stolen. I went to Mr. Stiles, one of the commissioners, he took me to Mr. Clarke's, and after that I went with Mr. Clark to the prisoner's lodgings in Cleveland-street.</p>

            . I am a labourer to Mr. Clark; the prisoner and I were employed at Mr. Paine's houses; I left work at six o'clock, the prisoner told me to go home, as he had a friend to meet at Mr. Hill's public-house. I left some leaden pipe in the back parlour, the prisoner had the key of the room to lock the lead up. On the next morning I heard that he was taken up, I went to the house and missed the lead; I was afterwards shewn the lead that was taken from the prisoner, it was the same lead to all appearance that was left in the back parlour, about twenty-one feet.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of this lead - A. I pay seventeen shillings for it. That is the kind of lead I employed the prisoner to fit up this house with.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

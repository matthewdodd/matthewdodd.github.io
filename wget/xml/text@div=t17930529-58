            , No. 69, Cable-street. I took in a cotton apron for sixpence the 1st of May, and a shift for sixpence the 2d of May, and a blanket for fourpence the 3d of May; I am sure it was the prisoner; I had seen her before. (The things deposed to by Mrs. Garland.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lodged with this good woman a matter of two years, and I always used to go out a charing, and get money, and I used to give her the money; she used to have the money and support herself with it; she used to want me to turn out and look for men; and when I would not she used to lick me and abuse me, and when I came to prison I had a black eye, and I have been in the sick ward almost ever since; she desired me to pawn the things.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Garland. I never desired her to pawn any of the things; she pawned them for liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She is just moved to that house where she is; and pays twenty-pence a week for it, she knocked me down, she wanted me to go with men, both with blacks and whites, and I am not guilty of the crime; I have no witness nor a friend in the World; I was born in a place called Southampton, I have friends there, but none in London.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Had you any knowledge of her pawning of these things? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now that she pawned them to get drunk? - I am certain she did, because she came in drunk and went out sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever suffer her to pawn any thing at all? - Yes, she did, my own things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Bourne and live at Start ford, in Essex—I was present in September, 1852, at the Parish Church at Plumstead when the prisoner was married to my sister, Lucy Filer—I was one of the witnesses—they resided at Plumstead afterwards—she is in Court now.</p>

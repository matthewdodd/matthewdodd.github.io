This paper was brought to me by the prisoner, signed Mary Ann Pearce—having read this letter I believed it came from Mr. Pearce, a widow, in Leather-lane—I received from my husband two sovereigns—I enclosed them in an envelope, and gave them to the prisoner for Mr. Pearce—the prisoner wrote on the letter" Received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

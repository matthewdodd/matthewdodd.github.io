                  </hi>. I am registrar of births, deaths, and marriages for the district of St. Luke—I live in the City-road—I have my register here—on the 12th of May last I saw the prisoner'—he said he came to register the birth of a child—I asked him to take a seat, and went to my desk and took out the book—I had not heard of the birth before he came—it is part of my duty to make inquiries and exert myself to get all the information I can—there appeared something strange in the prisoner's manner which made me suspect all was not correct, and I asked if he was the father of the child—he said he was—there was on the mantel-shelf a caution-paper, and also one lying on the table—on my asking if he was the father of the child, he said he wondered why I asked him that question, or why did I doubt him—I said, "I don't doubt for a minute, but as registrar I am bound to ask you the question I have done, "at the same time handing him a caution-paper—I had not pointed hit attention to the paper—it was before him on the table—I said, "Perhaps you will just have the kindness to read this, to show that I have no desire to ask unnecessary questions"—this is a copy of what it required by the act—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I called his particular attention to the part at the top of the paper, which he read hastily and threw it down—it is to this effect, that no putative father is to be allowed to sign as father, and nothing is to be inserted as to '-. legitimacy or illegitimacy—I have not got a copy of the Act of Parliament—these papers are supplied from the registrar-general's office—they are directions to me—this is the entry, No. 33—the prisoner used the words, you need not doubt my veracity, for my wife is the daughter of Mr. Wallen, the respectable architect of Finsbury-circus"—it might be, "late of Finsbury-circus"—I replied, "I simply asked you whether you were the father"—knowing that sometimes an uncle will come, conceiving that he has power to register the birth—I then made the entry in the register as it runs here—I asked him, "When born?"—he replied, "5th May, 1846, at 15, King-street"—I said, "The sex?"—he said, "A boy"—I said, "The name of the child?"—he gave the name, "James"—I said, "The name and surname of father?</p>

               <p>"—he said, "James Augustus Seymour"—I asked, "The name and maiden name of mother?"—he said, "Amy Seymour, formerly Wallen"—I then asked his occupation or calling—he said, "Town traveller"—I then read over the entry to him as it runs here,(<hi rend="italic">reading the entry over</hi>,) and asked him to sign the book, and he signed "James Augustus Seymour"—this is his signature—I then completed the entry by adding the words, "Father, 15 King-street"—I had already got that address from him in the previous conversation, thinking I was entitled to put that, supposing him to be the legitimate father—I added in the next column, "12th May, 1846,"and signed it myself, "Henry Hamlin, registrar"—the prisoner is the man.</p>

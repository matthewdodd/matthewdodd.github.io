                  </hi>. I am foreman at Messrs. Stevens and Jackson's coal-yard—on Friday morning, 23d of May, I assisted in finishing to load a van; twenty-two sacks had been loaded overnight, and we completed it from half-past 7 to twenty minutes to 8 in the morning—they were for Mrs. Fleet<lb></lb>wood, of Montague House, within a quarter of a mile of Uxbridge—thirty sacks were weighed out, each containing 224 lbs.—they were put into one of my master's vans, and given into Fountain's charge as carman—Collier went to assist him—they left before 8 in the morning—a delivery-ticket, containing the quantity, was given to Fountain with the coals by the boy in the office; I saw that—on the same day, before dinner, I went to Mrs. Fleetwood's and weighed the coals—there were twenty-four sacks, and some litter about would make twenty-five—there are two hundred-weight in a sack.</p>

Stevens's coal-yard and made a communication, in consequence of which some men were sent to weigh the coals—Mr. Jackson sent for Collier, and asked him if he had delivered coals anywhere else besides Mrs. Fleetwood's—he said that he had not, and that he delivered three tons there—Fountain was not there—I saw the coals weighed; none had been consumed, and if there had been any there before they would have increased the bulk—twenty-five sacks were all that could be found.</p>

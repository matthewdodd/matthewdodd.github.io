The watchman called me up at one o'clock in the morning; I missed all the turkeys and some more poultry. I rode towards Southgate, and traced a cart to Shoreditch by information, but could trace it no further. I could trace the poultry by footmarks and feathers within three hundred yards of the prisoner's house, at the Four Old-way, Enfield. I got a constable, and on returning met the prisoner; he had corded breeches on, and the knees were dirty with clay - the soil near the house is clay. The constable took him; he said he knew nothing about it. I found in the brook near our premises, the marks of corded breeches on the clay soil, about ten o'clock in the morning. The turkeys were all found dead.</p>

            . On the morning of the 23d of November, I searched the prisoner's house, but found nothing. When the prisoner was taken, he was dressed in corded breeches. I saw the marks of a person's knee on the clay soil of the bank - they exactly corresponded with the prisoner's breeches - there were footmarks - one person had been there with his shoes off, for there were toe-marks - turkey feathers were strewed about all the way, from the brook to the hen-house. I searched the prisoner, and found a snare in his pockets. I went to Mr. Raikes' park in the evening, and found a quantity of turkeys, two ducks, and two snares, exactly like that found on the prisoner.</p>

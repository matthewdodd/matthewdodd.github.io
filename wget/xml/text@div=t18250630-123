On the 21st of May, at ten o'clock in the morning, I washed the plate, and set it in the window of a small front room to dry; soon afterwards Miss Whitaker spoke to me - I saw the door open, and that the plate was gone; twenty-four spoons, twelve forks, three ladles, two skewers, two pair of sugar tongs, a cheese knife, and a child's boat, were gone, with the tray in which I had put them. I ran out to the gate as fast as I could, and saw two men driving away in a one-horse cart, very fast; it was about twenty rods from the gate; I ran to Mr. Phips, a farmer, close by, and borrowed a horse, pursued the cart, but did not see it again till I got on the Edgware road, a mile and a half off; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300041"></xptr>traced it by the marks of the wheels, and as soon as I got into the Edgware road I saw it, and am sure it was the same cart; I hallooed Stop thief! there were a great many people about - they went a good deal faster when I called out, and turned into a lane, which goes up to Oxden farm; both the men then jumped out of the cart and creeped through the hedge: I took the horse and cart, with the horse I was on, to Mr. Lardner's (I was within ten rods of the men); Lardner came out with his servant Jones; Jones and I ran down the lane, and were directed after them; Jones pursued; I found sixteen pieces of the plate in the cart, and the rest scattered about the gate, and some a little way from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did the plate lay? A. By the window, which was a little way open. I am sure it was the same cart - it was a dirty blue colour; I rode a mile and a half before I saw them again; they went on a quarter of a mile and turned up the lane, and jumped out; I might have been ten minutes gone to Mr. Lardner's.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lardner, who lives in Wilsden parish. In consequence of what Layt said to me, I went in pursuit down the lane; he shewed me which way they had gone through the hedge, about one hundred yards from the Edgware road; people who stood in the road, directed me across the fields; I saw one man returning across the other side of the fields as fast as he could; I followed, and kept him in sight about a mile, and then lost sight of him for about two minutes, and caught sight of him again; he was the same person, and dressed the same; I am quite certain it was the same; he got into another field: I followed him nearly a mile further, and got nearly close to him; he was then stopping on a hedge, and appeared to be pulling off his shoes and stockings; he looked round, and saw me coming, and started off with his stocking half-way down and one shoe off; I ran about ten rods, and secured him; he was very hot, and just as I got to him, he tumbled down on the hedge, and was very much out of breath; I told him he was charged with stealing plate, and must go with me; he said he was innocent; I asked what made him run away; he made no answer: I asked if he had pulled off his stockings to disguise himself; he said nothing to that, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When Layt came to you did he leave the cart at your master's house? A. Yes; the lane is about two hundred yards from our house; we both ran down the lane, leaving the cart there; the two fields together are nearly half a mile large: I dare say they are fourteen acres each; he ran nearly half a mile.</p>

            . I was in the Edgware road on the 21st of May, and saw two men in a cart, in Oxgate-lane, and am positive the prisoner is one of them. Layt came up riding as hard as he could, and hallooing Stop thief! the men went as hard as they could dride, and jumped out of the cart when they got down the lane; the prisoner went over the meadow; I followed him a little way, and saw Jones in pursuit: I saw the prisoner in custody, and am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Edgware road is a great thorough-fare? A. Yes; this was a sort of green cart; it passed very near me; I noticed it because it went so hard: the men's faces were towards me when I turned round and looked at them; I am certain of him; he had a short black velveteen jacket on - it was an open cart.</p>

            . I am constable of Kilburn. I received the prisoner in charge; I was getting into the cart and asked him if the horse would kick, he said he did not know, he had never seen it: I drove him to town in it, and between Paddington and Kilburn the horse was going at a very rapid rate - I could not pull him in; he said</p>
               <p>"If you give the reins a chuck he will stop immediately;" which it did. I found sixteen pieces of plate at Mr. Lardner's, and a sack.</p>

               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

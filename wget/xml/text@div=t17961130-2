               <p>Q. Was it light then? - A. Yes, It was a little light; I found a great hole in the window-shutter, in the front of the shop window, and a great quantity of plated spurs, and a dog-whip gone, they were hanging up in the window; the hole was right opposite to where they hung; the piece taken out was large enough for any man to put his hand in; on Monday the 24th of October, as I was coming down Newington-causeway, I saw some spurs on the outside of a shop-window, exposed to sale, at one Mr. Kingsford's, there were three pair, and three odd ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity you missed? - A. I cannot tell, I suppose about four or five and twenty pair; they were iron spurs, plated with silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the last person up the night before your house was broke open? - A. My wife, she is not here; I saw the shutters up at ten o'clock the night before, it was all safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. From the situation of the house, have you reason to believe, they did any more than take the spurs out of that hole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they hang close to the window? - A. Quite close to the glass; the thickness of the window and shutter was about four inches; the constable has got the three pair of spurs, and the three odd ones; Mr. Kingsford led me to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You found these at Mr. Kingsford's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps that sort of reputable place, called an old iron shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him if he had any more, and he denied having any more, and you afterwards found more? - A. I asked him the price of the pair, he asked me 3s. 6d.; I saw another pair, and asked him the price of them; I asked if he had any more, he said, no, only some odd ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any more? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see Smith the prosecutor? - A. Not before he came to me; I cannot recollect the day he came; as near as I can recollect, it was an hour after dinner; he came to the door, and saw some spurs I had had near a fortnight; he took down a pair of spurs, and asked me what the price of them were, I told him the price of them; he asked me if I had any more; there were two pair more hanging at the door; he took them in his hand, and asked me if I had any more, I said, only for a odd ones; he took them in his hand, and said they were his property, he could shew me the fellows of the odd ones; he said they were taken from his shop, and asked me if I knew who I had them of; I said, I did, and he desired me to keep them till the morrow, and he would bring the odd ones; on the morrow, about dinner time, he brought the odd ones, and asked me to go with him, and show him the person I had them of; I went with him to Duckham's, he was not at home, we waited till he came home; I asked him how he did, he said, I don't know, somebody here has got me in custody; I desired him to come down to my house, he did, with the officer; I pulled the spurs out of my pocket, and said, these spurs you left with me a fortnight ago, I can get nobody to buy them, they are spoiling with me, I will give them back to you, he took them up; his wife came and said, my dear, you know nothing about these spurs; he put them down again, and said, no, I know nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. These are the spurs you received from him? - A. Yes; the same as the constable had, I had of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner on any other occasion, but this? - A. Not on any occasion like this; he worked for me some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for them? - A. I did not purchase them at all; I took them to sell for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I know perfectly well you know this man, he is a brass and iron sender-maker, is not he? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. If I was to ask for an old iron-shop, they would direct me to you, I suppose? - A. No, they would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it does not go by the name of an old iron-shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it is called an old iron shop, have not you heard it so called-are you dumb all at once? - A. I do not deal in old iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that it is? - A. I tell you it is not called an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that is called an old iron-shop? - A. It may be called an old iron-shop, but not in the common way.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that it is called an old iron-shop, in your own neighbourhood? - A. I cannot say that it is called an old iron-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that it is called an old iron-shop; there is some good reason, I suppose, for holding back an answer, don't you know old iron-shops get a bad character for receiving goods? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present when you had these spurs from Duckham? - A. Yes, my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any servant that assists you in the shop? - A. None; I had them from Duckham's house; he said, as they are knocking about in the drawer, they are no use to me, I wish you would sell them for me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mrs. Kingsford been ill, and kept her bed? - A. She is not ill, she is at home to mind the business.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the only person we are to believe in this business? - A. Yes; I don't know any other person.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to tell Mr. Duckham these things were challenged? - A. No; I went with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see his wife the very first day the person that lost the goods came to you? - A. No; I did not see her that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you kept this iron-shop where you are now? - A. Four years come next February or March.</p>

               <p>Workhouse—I had known her three or four years before this, and her father also—as we are going to the workhouse, she asked me what we had done with her father—I told her he was locked up at our station-house—she said, "What for?"—I said, "For secreting the birth of a male child that was found in the water-closet at the back of your house"—she said, "That is false, for my father knows nothing about it; he was out at the time the child was born, and he was out also when I put it down the water-closet"—I said, "Do you say that you did it?" and she said, "Yes, it was me, and not my father"—she said the child was born about three days from that time, in the evening—I said, "What time?" and she said, "It was in the evening"—there was no other conversation.</p>

                  </hi> I am a nurse in the lying-in ward at Whitechapel Workhouse—the female prisoner was brought there on Sunday, the 26th of Sept.—I put her to bed—on the next day, Monday, she said that her father left his home on the Tuesday morning, at nine o'clock, and did not return again till the evening, that during the day she was confined (with a little girl, as she heard them say) there was no one present in the room but herself and her little boy, three years old; she herself had taken the child and put it down the water closet in the next yard; that her father did not know any<lb></lb>thing of what had happened, until the Sunday—she said she put the child down the water-closet the same day it was born—two or three days' after, she said it was her father's cruelty and ill usage that caused her to do what she had done.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in Spitalfields. I knew nothing of the prisoners until this matter occurred—on Sunday, the 26th of Sept., I was called in, and saw the female in the room where she had been living—I asked her if she had recently borne a child—she said, "No"—I then in<lb></lb>timated to her that I must make an examination, and wished the pre<lb></lb>sence of another female—some woman was brought in, I do not know who——I then proceeded to examine the prisoner, and found she had been recently delivered of a child—I told herso—she made no reply—I then proceeded to the dead-house where the body of the child was—I examined it externally, and found it a full-grown male child—the navel<lb></lb>string had been cut—it had passed through the first stool which a child generally voids soon after birth—that discharge would not take place after death—it is a vital action—the umbilical cord had been cut, but not tied—it had not been torn—there were no marks of violence about the child—it was stiff then—it was twenty-four hours or more after the discovery of the body—I cannot form a correct estimate of the time the child had been born—on the Tuesday, by order of the Coroner, I proceeded to make an in<lb></lb>ternal examination—I first opened the chest, and took out the lungs and the heart attached—I found that they floated—the lungs were sufficiently buoyant to sustain the weight of the heart—that indicated that they were fully and perfectly inflated—I then tried the separate lobes of the lungs, and found that each of them floated—I then cut the lungs into a number of small pieces, and carefully compressed them, still every piece floated, from which I am satisfied that they had been fully inflated—I believe the lungs of an infant could not be inflated to such an extent during the progress of delivary—it is possible, where a woman has no assistance—I examined the head of the child—there</p>

               <p>was extravasation of blood between the scalp and the bone, but nothing to indicate that it had been the result of violence—I did not see the privy where the child was found—I do not think a child could live one minute without breathing—a child of that age would have strength to move its head—the act of suffocation might produce a convulsive action of the body—it had been washed before I saw it.</p>

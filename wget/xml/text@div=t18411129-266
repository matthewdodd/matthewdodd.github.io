                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Piercy Ben, a captain in the Royal Artillery, quartered at Woolwich—the prisoner was my fellow-ser<lb></lb>vant. On the 22nd of November, about the middle of the day, she told me she had been discharged—I afterwards saw her bring a bundle down stairs, wrapped in something white—I saw her carry it to the door, and give it to a boy, and the boy left the house—I followed, and brought him back—she took the bundle from him, went into the house again, locked the door after her, and left me outside—soon after I saw her bring another bundle, carry it to the back door, and return without it—I went up stairs from the kitchen, and was ordered to fasten the doors—I fastened the back door, and while fastening the front, the prisoner walked out—I followed her, and told her to come back—she said she would not—I kept her till the policeman came, and gave her in charge—she desired me to let her go several times—I said I would not—she said she would make away with herself—when she said she had been discharged, she said she had not been paid her wages, and she had told her mistress that she might leave it with me, and she would call at my quarters for it the day after—I saw the bundles after they were opened—she had no bundle with her when I said I would give her in charge—I believe the bundles I saw examined at the house to be those I saw her with a few minutes before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness, and am occasionally servant to Captain Ben. On the 22nd of November, between ten and eleven o'clock in the day, I was employed there—I heard Captain Ben give the prisoner notice—she was discharged at a moment's notice—she af<lb></lb>terwards told me she was discharged from the service—I saw her go up to her room after that—I followed her, and saw her take a large bundle from under her bed—she put some more things into it, and brought it down stairs—I heard her tell Mrs. Ben, she was ready to go, and Mrs. Ben told her to wait till the captain returned, and she would pay her her wages—the prisoner said if she would give it to my husband she would call next day for the money—she had put the things into the bundle be<lb></lb>fore she said any thing to her mistress about her wages, and she took it out—I told her Mrs. Ben wished to see the things she had—the bundle was in the passage—she brought it into the hall and opened it—there were some pieces of chintz which I know to be Mrs. Ben's property, also some pillow-cases, a shirt, and pair of stockings, and Captain Ben's trowsers—she had been three months and two days in the service—a pair of drawers were found upon her at the police-station—I believe the bundle I saw in the hall was the bundle I saw her take from under the bed—there was another bundle tied up in it—the two bundles were made into one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went home on Wednesday evening, about 12 o'clock, and saw my wife lying senseless on the floor; I helped her to undress and get to bed; she began quarrelling, and the landlord came up and said he would not have a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the house. She was quiet a little time, and then began again. I said "I suppose you have been with George," alluding to a young man. She said "Yes, and twenty if I could get at them," and she threw a saucer at me and broke it I picked up the pieces and threw them at her. Then she picked up something else and struck me with it. I wrenched it out of her hand and struck her with it, and then she was very quiet and went to bed. We then had another quarrel and the landlord came and advised me to go down stairs till she was quiet I took my clothes and sat on the stairs and went to sleep, and at daylight I went in and went to bed. On the Saturday evening I returned home about 12 o'clock and said "You have not brought George. "She began to cry and said "You will quarrel with me if I do, and what is the matter. "I said "No. "She said "You know what you said about George? "I said "Well, it is true then. "She said "I will tell you. I went to meet him on Saturday evening, and he took me down some dark turning, a thing he never did before, and when he got me there he asked me whether I was married, and when I denied it he knocked me down and kicked me several times. "I said "Where? "She said "You must guess where he kicked me the last time. "I told her to tell me, and she told me, and said she was very bad. After that she went to the hospital.</p>

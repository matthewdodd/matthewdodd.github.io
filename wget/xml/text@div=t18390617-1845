                  </hi>. I live at Palmer's-green, near Edmonton. On Mon<lb></lb>day, the 20th of May, I was at the Fox public-house nearly the whole of the afternoon—I left at eleven o'clock—I went to Mrs. Walledge's, at Palmer's-green, about a hundred yards from the Fox—I stopped there about a quarter of an hour, and then came out to go home, and saw George Gladman and the prisoner scuffling and fighting—I went up to them, and Gladman asked me to be his second—I did so—they kept on scuffling up the road, but I never saw any blows struck—the prisoner then hit me with his fist, I hit him again, and then they ran down the road, and I after them—when I caught him I hit him, and directly I hit him he stabbed me with a knife in the belly—it was not much of a wound—it bled a good deal—I fell down—the prisoner ran off home—two young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> took me up to Mrs. Walledge's, and then home—the doctor came next morning—I did not see what the prisoner struck me with, but I thought it was a knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a washerwoman, and live at Palmer's Green. On Monday night I was in Walledge's house—Gladman looked in at the door—I saw his wife, and beard her scream "murder!"—he had her down on the ground—he was on his knees, ill-treating her, and he bit her on the cheek—the prisoner and his brother are musicians—I saw the prisoner, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Crane, will you come and assist Mrs. Glad<lb></lb>man?"—he was inside Walledge's house at the time, with his clarionet in his hand—he gave it to his brother, and came and said, "For God's sake, George, let your wife get up, do not kill her"—Gladman said, "You b—, if you mean that, I will serve you the same"—he rose, and hit the prisoner, and knocked him to the ground—he struggled to get up, and Gladman hit him another blow, and got him down again—his brother John not liking to see him ill-treated, said, "Come away, <hi rend="italic">Jem,</hi> for they will do you a mischief," and then somebody, I do not knew whether it was the prosecutor or Gladman, knocked the brothers down, and there was one hitting John, and the other hitting James—after that they cleared the way, and there were blows and fighting, lads and men together—I took Mrs. Gladman into her sister's house, and saw no more.</p>

I have seen the Prisoner at the Play-house, almost every Night, picking Pockets.</p>

            . The Prisoner and I, and another, that Night, went to the Corner of Norfolk-street, and there we snatch'd from a Gentleman's Side a Silver-hilted Sword, which we carry'd home and knock'd to Pieces. Then we went to the Play, and as the Gentleman was delivering the Ladies into a Coach, the Prisoner snatch'd away his Sword, and next Morning we broke it, and melted it down into a Bar, in a three-corner'd Pot, with a Charcoal Fire, and the Prisoner sold it to a Silver-smith, by a Pastry-cook's, near Fleet-ditch. I saw him take it, and melt it: The Gripe of the Sword I think was gilt; and both this and that which we had taken before, were melted together. The Name of the Person concern'd with us is Hussar, but I don't know his other Name; and I always knew the Prisoner by the Name of Jemmy the Drummer; I did not know his Surname was James before.</p>

            . I live at Ingrave, near Brentwood, Essex. This day three weeks I was at the <placeName id="t17670909-70-crimeloc418">Half-moon tavern, Aldersgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. How do you know she had your watch?</p>
               <p>Avis. I had it twice in my hand when I was with her, and no body else was in company with me but she.</p>

               <p>I do not know any thing about the man's watch; he came into a house where were a good many girls; he asked me to drink, and was so troublesome, I took up his pint and drank; he called for another pint; he said he was going as far as Smithfield, I said so am I; we went in at a tavern in Aldersgate-street, we had some wine; he pulled and hauled me about, I could not stay with him.</p>

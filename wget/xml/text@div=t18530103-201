                  </hi>. I am sister of Mr. James Maslin, of Newcastlestreet; he is now dead, but I cannot tell when he died—it was on the 11th, but I cannot tell the month—I know a person named Hayes—about Sept. last I was fetched, but not by Hayes, to Newcastle-street to see my brother, who was ill—I attended him for six days and nights, when he died—I was there when he died—after he died I had the keys, and the prisoner demanded them of me; I gave them to my husband, who was present, and he gave them to Randall, the prisoner—I and my husband, Mr. Hayes and his wife, and Randall and his wife and mother were present—Mr. Hayes said he would take care of the keys, seal the things up, and see that no one should touch anything till my brother was buried—we then had very high words on account of my brother's goods; I thought I ought to have some of them—after Mr. Bennett had read the will, or some paper, Randall took away all the goods that were there—there was a bedstead, night chair, three boxes, a great many clothes, a writing desk, looking glass, table, drawers, and some pawn tickets; these were my brother's goods—Mrs. Maslin was not there at the time, and had not been during my brother's illness.</p>

I married a sister of Mr. Maslin—he died on 11th Sept.—I was not present when he died, but I was there about an hour after—I was present when the prisoner, Bennett, and others were there—Mr. Bennett produced a paper and read it—the prisoner then told us we had no business in the place whatever—he took possession of the keys, and he and Mr. Hayes took possession of the whole concern—Mrs. Maslin, the widow, was not there—she was not there at all during Mr. Maslin's illness; she never saw him—the prisoner took away the goods, and books, and papers, and duplicates—one of the books I saw in particular, I thought it was a bank book; I suspected it was, because he hid it immediately—I never saw the inside of it.</p>

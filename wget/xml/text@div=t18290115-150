I secured the house myself on Wednesday night, the 22d of October; the door of the hall, at the back of the house, was quite secure - I locked it myself; the iron door, leading to the garden, was secure - there is an outer door, then a hall door, and then an inner door, which opens immediately into the house; they were all quite secure - I fastened them myself; I was alarmed about half-past one o'clock by the female servant - I got out of bed, partly dressed myself, got a cord and lowered myself from the window by fastening a cord to the bedstead; I took a loaded gun with me - on turning the corner of the house I saw four men, and desired them to stop; they were then coming out of the stone hall, all four of them - I discharged my gun at them and missed fire; the prisoner is the man I knocked down on the lawn of the shrubbery - I am sure he is the man - it was a beautiful moon-light morning; I hit a second man, and knocked him off the gate - he was taken into custody, tried here last Session, and convicted; I conveyed that man away that morning in a cart - I saw the prisoner again on the 10th of December at the Swan with two Necks public-house at Whetstone - I knew him the moment I saw him; this was about a quarter of a mile from Mrs Mountain's - I examined the house after taking the man into custody, the lock of the outer door had been picked, and the pannel nearly cut out of the inner hall door- it had been pierced through nearly all round the pannel with a centre-bit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say it was a very moon-light night, and before you took the man tried last Session, you knocked a man down? A. Yes; the prisoner, now at the bar, is the man I knocked down in the shrubbery - I am quite positive, I cannot be mistaken in his person; I said he was the man immediately - I had my senses about me perfectly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What dress had I on? A. Not the same you have now.</p>
               <p>Q. If you saw my face of course you could tell the colour of my coat and handkerchief? A. You had a black or dark silk handkerchief - I cannot exactly say the colour of your coat; I had a full view of your face as you ran along, and when you were on the wall - at the time you came out of the hall I was fifteen or sixteen yards from you: I had a perfect view of you then - I was close to him when I knocked him down and had a full view of his face; my attention was directed more to his face than his coat, and as such I could see the handkerchief - I had gone to bed about half-past nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Baker of the Swan with Two Necks, at Finchley. On Thursday, the 23d of October. I heard of Mrs. Mountain's house being broken open - I had seen the prisoner on the 22d in company with three others at our house, from half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, or from that to five; our house is a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Mountain's - they had a pot of beer and four empty pipes; I am quite sure the prisoner was one - I saw him again on the 10th of November at Mrs. Baker's, there were two more men with him then; they had a cart, and took some refreshment - and a fortnight after Lord Mayor's day I saw him again at mistress's; I saw him a fourth time on the 10th of December, when Laurence came in and identified him at once - I am quite sure he is the man I had served with the beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who waited on him on the 22d of October? I did; they were not in the house, but drank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150062"></xptr>their beer outside the door - we had lights in the house; they did not come into the tap-room - it was not dark; I could see them distinctly - I served them, and a tall man paid me; I had the means of observing them - I did not notice the prisoner's neckcloth, but am quite sure he is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say four pipes of tobacco were had? A. Four empty pipes; they had them ouside the door- I did not give them a light; the tall one went into the parlour for the light.</p>

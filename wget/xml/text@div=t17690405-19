I lett a ready furnished lodging to the prisoner at the bar about Christmas last. On Easter Monday, about nine o'clock, I had a suspicion of the prisoner and his wife making use of my property. On the 27th of March I followed the prisoner to a public house. I went to him. He said he had been to my wife and paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050013"></xptr> his rent. The boy carried a pot of beer. I went home and got into the room before the boy. I saw a candle standing without a candlestick, and said, What is become of your candlestick? The wife said she left it at such a man's room. I clapt my hand to the bedstead to pull it down. The wife said, I will fetch your sheets, they are out. I pulled the bedstead down, and I saw the blanket, bolster case and sheets were gone; then I mist a brass fender and a flat iron. I then proposed to him, if he would tell me where my things were, I would make up the matter. I could get nothing out of him for half an hour. Said he, If I tell, you will prosecute me. I took him and his wife into custody. Then I found some of my things at two pawnbrokers. I can swear to all the things but the frying-pan.</p>

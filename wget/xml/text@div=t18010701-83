               <p>The prisoner Johns did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Stephens's defence. I was standing at the door, engaged with a customer, when the lad came; he went in, and my wife called to me to know what the brass was worth; I told her to pay sixpence a pound for it; I told her I thought it was about the price of cock-metal, and then returned to the customer at the door.</p>
               <p>Evidence for Stephens.</p>
               <p>- PHILKINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. - I am servant to Mr. Stephens; I was present when the boy came with the brass; my master was standing at the door, talking with a customer; I weighed the brass, and my mistress cut a bit off with a knife, to see if it was brass; she called to my master, and he looked at it, and said it was worth about the same as cock metal, and desired my mistress to give him sixpence a pound; and he returned to the customer at the door.</p>
               <p>ANN KEITH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was present when the boy came with the brass; I was purchasing a bedstead, he was with me at the door; the boy went past me into the shop to Mrs. Stephens; what he carried in, I do not know; but his wife came and asked him what she should give for it, and he told her sixpence a pound.</p>
               <p>- HUDSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am foreman to his Majesty's upholsterer; I was present when the officers came into Mr. Stephens's house, and asked Mr. Stephens for something; I did not hear what, and he took the brass out of a drawer immediately; I have known him twelve years, and always found him an honest industrious man.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - This is not brass, it is a mixture of lead, it is cast and filled up; sixpence a pound is more than I would give for it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Supposing it had been brass, what would you have given? - A. Not more than seven-pence halfpenny or eight-pence.</p>

               <p>ROBERT HARDCASTLE sworn. - I am an engine maker to the Board of Ordinance; I have known him six or seven years, I always found him an honest man; I have looked at the metal, it is a composition, the weight of it is sufficient without any thing else; I think sixpence sufficient, I would not give more.</p>

I live with my father at Old Pye Street, Westminster—the prisoner and I had been acquainted for two years he was paying bis addresses <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>—on 14th December. I was with him in Jeffrey's public-house—we left there between 10 and 11 o'clock p.m. and went to another public-house; and about 11 or 11.30 o'clock we were in Old Pye Street standing close together at the corner—he put his arm round my neck and struck me a violent blow on my side by the force of which I fell on the ground—I do not remember anything after I fell, but I got up, crossed over the road, went into my own house and into Mrs. Burke's room and complained of a pain in my left side—Mrs. Burke said that she saw blood coming from my dress, and I was taken to Westminster Hospital where I was undressed and examined by a surgeon—I am an indoor patient there still—I had had words with the prisoner two or three nights before—I appointed to meet him at my place and disappoiuted him, and he charged</p>

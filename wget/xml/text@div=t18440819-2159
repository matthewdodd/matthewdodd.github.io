                  </hi>. I live at Deptford, On Thursday evening, the 20th of June, I saw the prisoner in Giffin-street, Deptford, creating a disturbance—I saw William Fuggle, the policeman, advise him several times to go in-doors—he said he would, and Fuggle left him, but finding he would not, he turned back to him, and said if he did not, he should certainly take him into custody—the prisoner then struck him a violent blow in the chest, and nearly knocked him backwards—he then ran into the passage of the house—Fuggle pursued after him, and in trying to take him a struggle took place in the place—he got Fuggle's head in between the door and door-post—I stepped up and asked him if I could render him any assistance—he said he should be obliged to me if I would, which I did, and by forcing the door back the constable released his head from his hat—the prisoner then ran up stairs into the back-room, first-floor—Fuggle requested me to go up with him, which I did—he asked the prisoner several times to open the door—he said he should not—at last he opened it, and struck me a violent blow across the head with an iron weapon of some kind—I said, "I am done"—I then fell back stunned and senseless—I was taken to Mr. Arthur's, who attended me for a month—I was not able to do anything for six weeks—I had done nothing to provoke the prisoner more than releasing the constable's head from the door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 43.) On Thursday night, the 20th of June, I saw the prisoner in Giffin-street creating a disturbance, and abus<lb></lb>ing the persons that were by—he was offering to fight with nearly every one—when I came up I advised him to go home—he went away as if to go home—I had got about fifty yards from the place, when I was called back again, and found him still creating a disturbance—I again advised him to go home—he turned as if to go, but began again—I advised him a third time to go home, and followed him a little way down the street—finding he still per<lb></lb>sisted, I said if he did not go home I must take him to the station—with that he up with his fist, and struck me in the chest, which nearly took away my breath—he then ran away into the passage of a house—I pursued him—a scuffle ensued, and he got my head jammed in between the door and door-post—Beale was standing by, and asked if he could render me any assistance in taking the man into custody—I said I should feel obliged to him—he came to my aid, and we got the door open so as to extricate me—the prisoner re<lb></lb>doubled his force against the door, and jammed my hat all to pieces—he then escaped up stairs and into a back room—I followed, and asked him several times to open the door—he refused—Beale was with me—he stood nearest the door—the very moment he opened the door he up with the poker, and hit Beale over the head with it—I distinctly saw the poker—Beale partly stag<lb></lb>gered back, and said, "Policeman, I am done, I am struck, lead me away to a doctor's"—a lad on the staircase took him away to a doctor's—the prisoner said, "If there are any more attempts to come into my room, I will murder them"—sergeant Wilton afterwards came, and we took the prisoner into cos<lb></lb>tody—he was then lying on the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Deptford. The prosecutor was brought to me on the night of the 20th of June last, between ten and eleven o'clock—he appeared stunned, and was bleeding very profusely from the head—he was not insensible—the scalp was completely divided at the anterior portion—it was a lacerated wound and severe, about an inch and a half long, and to the bone—the bleeding might have bad a beneficial tendency—he was under my care about a month—he was unable to leave his room for something more than a week—the symptoms were favourable—it must have been a very severe blow.</p>

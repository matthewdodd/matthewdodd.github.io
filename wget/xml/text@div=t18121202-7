I had suspicion that he robbed me, and I marked fifteen pence in copper halfpence, on the 9th of November. After I had marked them I put them in the all, and on the next morning there was seven pence missing. I sent for Bishop, the officer. He searched the prisoner. He found some loose copper in his pocket, and I picked out the seven pence that had marked, among the loose copper. After that, Bishop searched his bed room. In his coat pocket I found a five shilling paper and some more loose copper.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of November the prosecutor sent for me. I took the prisoner in custody, and searched him, and from his different pockets I took three shillings in penny pieces and halfpence, and from them Mr. Brown picked out six penny worth of halfpence and a penny piece, which he said he had marked the night before. I kept them separate from that time to this. I observed the pencil mark up all of them. I went up into the prisoner's bed room. The prisoner accompanied me there, and shewed me his bed. I there found a coat, which the prisoner said was his coat. In the coat pocket of that coat I found a five shilling paper of halfpence. The prisoner said, them halfpence were given him by a young man, to send into the country, to a friend. I took the halfpence, and showed them to Mr. Brown. The prisoner said, he hoped his master would take no advantage of him I then took him to Worship-street office. He then said it was the first thing that ever he did in his life.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This copper is the same that I marked. It has the pencil mark on them now. I do not know any halfpence in the five shilling paper.</p>

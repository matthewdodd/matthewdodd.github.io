               <p>I am a watchman: as I was crying the hour two another watchman told me, that there was a man lying in the street, and a woman with him; we went to him, and found him without his shoes and hat; the woman came up to us, and enquired the way to Rosemary-lane; the other watchman said, that was the woman he had seen with the man, and that she pretended he was her husband; I had known M'Carthy seven years, and said I knew he was not; she then said, nobody had a better right to take his things than she; that he was her brother: she had the things in her lap, and called him by the name of Jack; I told her then that I had found her out, for that was not his name, and I took the things from her.</p>

               <p>I was walking along the street, and found a pair of shoes and buckles, a hat and handkerchief; I walked a little further and found a man, fast asleep, lying on his back; up came a watchman; I had the shoes in one hand and the hat in the other; he asked me, if I knew the man, pushing him with his cane; the man was lying on his back; whose shoes, says he, are they? I said I did not know, I found them in the street; he said, he supposed I had robbed that man; he searched me, and took me to the watch-house; and said, he would transport me unless I gave him some money to drink, and then he would make it up with me: I have a husband, who was pressed three weeks ago to New York; I was born in Ireland, and bred up in the West Indies.</p>

I have known the prisoner six or seven weeks - she was in distress, and I took her in till she got a situation; when she had been a month or five weeks in my house, she went away, without giving me notice; we missed this property, gave information, and she was taken - the gown and cloak were on her back.</p>

            . I was looking for the prisoner, and found her on the 10th of February, under the Quadrant, in Regent-street; she said she had the gown and cloak on - I asked what she had done with the towels; she said she knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an unfortunate girl - the prosecutor's wife gets her living by taking in such as I am - the cloak and gown were lent to me, and I intended to return them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MAYES re-examined. Q. Did your wife lend her these things? A. She had, but not at that time; the prisoner had to go to the dispensary twice a week, as they said there was something the matter with her - I did not know the prisoner was in the habit of going out; there is a young person who lives in my house and has one child; she is kept by a gentleman - her sister also lives there; a man and his wife, named Bunnings, live in the kitchen - he belongs to the parish; my wife keeps good hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hodgkinson; the prisoner was in his service also. On 26th Jan. my master and mistress were absent, and the prisoner, and I, and a fellow servant were left in charge of the house—the plate was left there in my charge—it was kept in the wardrobe—it consisted of table spoons, gravy spoons, a fish knife, dessert spoons, and other things—they were kept loose in this plate basket, and there was a paper there with half a dozen knives in it—I saw it all safe on Thursday, 22nd Jan.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I recollect the prisoner coming one day in Jan. to our bed room—he opened the door, and said, "There is somebody in the house"—I said, "Nonsense, go to bed!"—he went away and came back again, and said he had heard master's bed room window opened; he said, "Get up!"—I and my fellow servant got up, and we went with the prisoner into master's bed room, and found the window open—I looked out of the window to see if I could see or hear anything—I afterwards looked into the wardrobe—the door of the wardrobe was open, and the plate was gone—three drawers were open, and part of the things thrown out—I went into the adjoining room, and found the window open a little—there was a pane of glass out in the little room—the room in which the prisoner slept was next to our room—he slept nearer to my master's room than we did—when we went to bed the windows were</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, T</hi> 1). In consequence of hearing of this robbery, I went to the prosecutor's house about half past eight o'clock in the morning—Kirby had been there before me—when I went the prisoner came to me at the back of the house—I asked him how the robbery had been committed—he said they had broken the glass in the up stairs window, and had got in that way, and escaped out of master's bed room window—I went up, and saw a square of glass broken in a small room adjoining the master's bed room—I asked the prisoner how they could have got there—he said, "They must have had a ladder," and he pointed to some marks on the flower border under the verandah window—they were such marks as a ladder that was lying there would make—I found two ladders there—I compared them with the impressions on both places, and they corresponded exactly, and they fitted in the holes in the ground—neither of those ladders were long enough for a person to get in at the window—I tried the long ladder; the short one was quite out of the question—the prisoner pointed out some foot marks on the flower borders, which he Raid were the foot marks of the thieves—I asked him to put his foot on the border to make an impression—I said, "It corresponds exactly, it is just like your foot"—he said, "It is something like it"—I asked him to take his boot off, and it made an impression just like the others—I said, "It must be your boot; it cannot be any one else's; I will take my oath it is yours"—he said, "I cannot account for it, Sir"—he had not stepped on the border in my presence before he pointed out the foot mark to me—I found an iron tip under the window of the verandah—I went into the house, and examined the window where the square of glass was broken out, and I believe the glass had been broken from the inside—there was one very small piece of glass in the room—the rest was all outside on the verandah and the border—there were three spots of blood, two on the glass, inside, and one in the room—I examined the prisoner's hands, and found he had a slight cut on the forefinger of the left hand—it appeared to be quite fresh, and to have been cut by something very keen—he said that he did it in chopping some wood on the Monday with a chopper which he produced—this is it—it has a very thick edge—I should think the cut could not have been inflicted by this—I examined about the ground, but could find no trace of any person leaving that spot—I know the spot where the plate was found—a person might have gone there without going by the flower</p>

               <p>bed, by going out of the front of the house and going round—if a person had gone from the place where the foot marks were to the walk, there must have been more marks—I think a person could not have got down from the window without leaving marks—I was present when the plate was discovered in a loft over the place where wood is chopped—the plate was found on the Wednesday morning, the morning following the robbery—it was wrapped in this newspaper, and concealed under the wood and rubbish—this is a Lynn newspaper, addressed to "Mr. Linford, at H. Hodgkinson, Esq., East Acton"—all the plate was in this paper—I found this stone in a box in the prisoner's bed room—I did not see any lucifer matches or candle there—I found another newspaper in a cupboard in the prisoner's bed room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How much shorter was the long ladder than the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four feet—it was only four feet ten inches long—the two ladders together might reach the window—I observed four or five foot<lb></lb>steps on the border—they had come apparently from the veranda—it appeared that they had passed off towards the gravel walk, and from that gravel walk a person might get to the place where the plate was found—the prisoner had no hesitation in putting his foot down by the side of the foot marks—the foot marks corresponded; they were about the same length and breadth—there were no particular marks—they were rather smaller than boots are generally, and are peculiarly made—the mould was soft, it was very wet; it had been recently dug up—there were six marks of ladders, four of the short ladder, and two of the long one—there was a third ladder there that was longer than the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ireland, but I have been stopping in Drury-lane On the 26th of August I was on my way down Fleet-street, about half-past twelve o'clock, going home—I lodged at that time at Mr. Dray's—I returned home from seeing a few friends, and as I came down Fleet-street the female prisoner came out of Chancery-lane—she took hold of me—I was walking very quick at the time, being in a hurry—I thought to get from her, and said, "My dear, you had better let me go"—she pulled me up the street a little, put her hand to my smallclothes, gave it a pull, and worked the watch out, and ran—I went to button my smallclothes and missed the watch—I ran after her, and when I got within a few yards of her she gave the watch to a man in a sailor's blue jacket—he ran with the watch—she took hold of my coat behind to prevent my following, and the watchman came up—the male prisoner was the man she gave it to—he was not above half-a-dozen yards from the spot—I could see the watch handed from her to him—I dare say he was eight, or ten, or twelve yards off—I cannot form a judgment whether he was aware what she was about—these was light—I think he was near enough to see her take it—he was near enough to see me and her—I had nothing whatever to do with the female, and had no intention—I saws her hand the watch to Palmer, and he ran away with it—I was not two yards from him when I saw it in his hand—I could almost have laid my hand on him, only she caught me by my coat to prevent my following him—I remained in that way till the watchman came up—the man was taken about a fortnight afterwards I believe—I have never seen my watch again.</p>

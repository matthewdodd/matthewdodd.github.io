                  </hi>. I live at 17, Sumner Place, South Kensington—last December I was living at Woodson, in Worcester, where I was farming—I had known the prisoner some years as chief clerk to a firm of solicitors in the City who had done business for my late brother—at the end of last year I contemplated giving up farming and taking a wine store in the city—I went to the prisoner's office about the end of November and made known to him my wishes, and told him that the lease of my farm would expire on 25th March last—he said that he could find me something suitable and I engaged him to do so—early in December I saw him again, and he said he had heard of a place called the Horns, in Fetter Lane, and we went to look at it—he said he thought he could purchase it for me; I told him to do so if he could advantageously—he said that the price was about 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not always say the same price—he asked me if he could get it for 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whether he might purchase it—I said very well, he was to do the best he could; the better he bought it the more he would have for himself—he said if he could get it for 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I ought to give him 100 guineas for his trouble, and I said "Very well"—I said I would pay him handsomely if he bought the thing well for me; he was acting as my agent—I received this letter from him of 11th December, 1877: "Dear Sir,—I hope to be able to give you some definite news to<lb></lb>morrow or the next day as to whether or not the Horns can be purchased on terms that would suit you. I have taken considerable trouble in the matter, and have every hope of success, but it is very risky to allow people</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060030"></xptr>
               <p>to carry on a business after they are aware it will leave their hands at a fixed date," &amp;c.—I cannot say whether I replied to that—I afterwards received this letter of 17th December: "Dear Sir,—I was in hopes all last week to be able to write you with a cut<lb></lb>and-dried scheme for this place, but was unable to," &amp;c.—I after<lb></lb>wards received this letter of 19th December: "Dear Sir,—ReHorns. I fear, indeed I am almost certain, that the vendor will not take less than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, more especially if they agree to delay the transfer and payment of the balance," &amp;c.—I believe I had written him this letter the day before, dated 18th December—on 22nd December I wrote a letter in pencil to the prisoner, which is not produced—I also on that day received this letter from him: "Dear Sir,—Thanks for the turkey and apples, which I have no doubt will arrive in due course," &amp;c.—on 27th December I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>, "I am still working for the Horns. They require, first, a heavier deposit; secondly, a larger price; and thirdly, to complete on 1st January.") In reply to that I wrote this letter on 29th December: "I duly received your letter on my return from visiting my brother at Ashford," &amp;c.—I afterwards received from the prisoner this letter, dated 1st January, 1878: "I have purchased the Horns—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a week. It has been a touch-and-go case. It may please you to hear that yesterday I went to a house on which 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been spent, and it was remarked by a solicitor who was there at the time, 'What good stuff the place in Fetter Lane is selling now,'" &amp;c.—I wrote this letter to the prisoner in reply in reference to the deposit: "J. Pensam, Esq., 50, Bow Lane, London—<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Horns—Dear Sir: I am in receipt of yours of this post, and will endeavour to meet it in some way. Let me have full particulars by return," &amp;c.—"B. Powis" is in the extreme comer—I afterwards received this letter from the prisoner, dated 5th January, 1878: "Dear Sir,—The Horns. I have been compelled, as I will explain when I see you, to agree to complete on the 21st, and to make up the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Wednesday next. You must therefore come up on Tuesday or Wednesday morning," &amp;c.—on 7th January I came up to London, and went to the office of my nephew, Mr. Bale, 20, Budge Row, who made a statement to me—I saw the prisoner there that day, and he said, "I have had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Manfred, but the trustee was not at home; you must be prepared with the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by to-morrow or Wednesday"—I said, "All right, I shall be prepared"—he showed me the proceeds of Manfred's cheque, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—I saw him again next day, the 8th, when he said, "I have fixed with the trustee for 12 o'clock to-morrow, and you must be there with the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the deposit. You must have the money ready, or the thing will go off"—he told me, as a reason for changing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, that the trustee would not take cheques; he would have either bank notes or gold—at 12 o'clock next day I went with my nephew and the prisoner to the office of the trustee, Mr. Ashdown, and then on to the office of the solicitor for the trustee—I had with me a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—the prisoner went, into the inner office—I was in the outer office with my nephew, and I heard the prisoner ask one of the firm of solicitors to have the agreement ready, and to send it round to 50, Bow Lane the first thing to-morrow morning—that would be Thursday, the 10th—when he came out he said the agreement was not ready, and he had fixed for the next morning at ten o'clock, when the agreement was to be sent and the money paid over, and I was to be there at 10—I went accordingly, and the prisoner was not there—I was there from 10 o'clock to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060031"></xptr>
               <p>6 p.m.—while I was there the clerk to the solicitor of the trustee brought the agreement, and I read it—I then arranged with the prisoner's clerk to go there again the next day, Friday, when I again waited all day, off and on—on leaving, I met the prisoner on the stairs, and said to him, "Pensam, where have you been to?"—he said, "Oh, all right, old fellow; I have been at the Court; be here at 10 o'clock in the morning; I have put it right with the trustee"—I said, "Very well, I will be here, but it is very inconvenient; I want to be away home; you have kept me here two days"—I went the next day, the 12th, about 10 o'clock—the prisoner was not there, and I remained until about 12.30—his clerk knew what my business was—I then went home—on the 13th I wrote this letter to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Woodson, Tenbury, January 13th, 1878. Dear Sir,—You cannot delay the completion of the Horns; it must go," &amp;c.—in reply to that I received this from the prisoner; "14th January, 1878. Dear Sir,—The Horns, As I anticipated, I received a communication from the solicitor on Saturday, couched in most peremptory terms, to complete at 11 o'clock on that day. I returned reply that I must have agreement left with me for a day, and would complete on Monday. The agreement was sent, and cannot be objected to. On going to Manfred he said he had the cash," &amp;c.—I afterwards received this letter from him: "17th January, 1878. Dear Sir,—The Horns. Although I know of another house of a somewhat different trade, it is very desirable not to lose this, and although it has placed me in a very unpleasant and possibly losing position, I am anxious it should be secured. If you will send me the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance by return of post, I still think I can secure it. I expected to receive a reply to my last"—I then wrote this letter to the prisoner: "January 18th, 1878. Dear Sir,—Herewith you will receive cheque, Thomas Baker 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. You must find the other 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to complete, &amp;c." That letter contained this cheque (On <hi rend="italic">the City of Worcester and County Banking Company, Limited. Drawn by T. R Baker in favour of Mr. Powis for</hi> 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">and endorsed by Benjamin Powis</hi>.) In reply I received this letter: "19th January, 1878. Dear Sir,—Yours to hand. I note your request as to time. Being a short day I have not succeeded in seeing the other side, but will do so on Monday. Will then see Manfred, who perhaps will help me, &amp;c." I afterwards received a letter from the prisoner of 28th January, and on 4th February I wrote this letter to him: "Dear Sir,—Re Horns. I am surprised you have not written me ere this, and returned the letters enclosed to you," &amp;c. I got no reply to that letter until 11th February, when the prisoner wrote me this letter: "Dear Sir,—I have to apologise for not answering your letter. Absence in the country, subse<lb></lb>quently laid up at home, and want of time, &amp;c., prevented my replying, &amp;c. I do not wish to give up the Horns yet if I can get it at a slight premium, I have another which I think will suit. I think as all the work was done for the Horns I ought to be allowed one-third of the fee; half to be allowed out of the commission of any other house I might find for you and you purchase." I replied on 15th February, 1878: "Dear Sir,—I cannot under<lb></lb>stand your way of doing business. I again ask for my money. Yours truly, Benjamin Powis. P. S. Also return of Adams's two letters which you neglected altogether." I never got any reply to that letter, nor have I had a farthing of my money—I went to London, and repeatedly tried to see the prisoner—I spent nine days successively in trying to do so, but I never saw him between 11th January and 24th Apr I—prior to 24th April I had applied</p>

               <p>at the Mansion House for a summons, which I obtained, and which was returnable on 24th April—on that day I was in my nephew's office in Budge Row when the prisoner called—he said "I am very sorry it has occurred, I hope you won't appear against me, and that you will forego this prosecution"—I said "Certainly not, the case is in the hands of the Lord Mayor and my solicitor, and I shall decline to interfere"—he promised to attend at the Mansion House—he then left—I attended at the Mansion House with my solicitor, but the prisoner was not there—there was a solicitor there to represent him, and the case was remanded until 3rd May—the prisoner was not there then, and it was remanded until the 4th, when he again did not appear, and the Lord Mayor granted a warrant for his apprehension—I had in December deposited 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with my nephew Mr. Bale—the other cheque for 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been returned paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. I have known the prisoner for a con<lb></lb>siderable time—I asked him to find a wine store for me—the house was mentioned the first time—he had first called my attention to the Mitre in the Temple, for the purchase of which, I believe, he had entered into negotiations on my behalf—I became acquainted with the statistics of the Mitre, and several letters passed between the prisoner and me about its purchase—I was very anxious to get it—I don't recollect the price—I had not got the money ready for that, and it fell through—they asked more for it than it was worth—I then requested the prisoner to look out again for a house to suit me—I don't know that he went and inspected many houses with a view to their suiting me—my nephew, Mr. Bale, also undertook to look out for a house for me, and in December I deposited 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him—Bale and the prisoner were great friends—Bale was not to use the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he found a house—the prisoner was to buy the house, and Bale to have the money ready—Bale recommended the prisoner to me—I went and saw the Horns, and went thoroughly into the matter with the prisoner, and I believe I said the place would suit me to a T—the price agreed on was 2,275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was prepared to pay the deposit and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. t February—the prisoner was to borrow the rest—he did not press me earnestly not to attempt to take the house if I could not carry it through, that I know of—I will not swear that he did not—I said "I will manage it somehow, for I am sure I shall do well there"—he told me that the former tenant was a man named Anderson, and that the place was for sale by the trustee in bankruptcy, a Mr. Ashdown—I believe he showed me some letters from him, and he told me the Horns was already under offer to other persons—I have no reason to doubt it—I never handed the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the solicitor for the trustee—when I was in the outer office I heard the prisoner talking about an agreement to be sent the next morning, but I cannot tell you the exact words—when I sent up the 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had not that day the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay, but Bale would have found the balance in a moment—I wrote and told the prisoner to find the other 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know Mr. Ashdown—I know this case was to have come on last session, and was postponed at the prisoner's request—he certainly never made a tender to Ashdown of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the lease of the Horns—the agreement is what the solicitor brought to Bow Lane on Thursday, 10th January—the prisoner wrote to me after he had received the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with regard to other houses I believe—nothing was mentioned besides a house in the Strand to the best of my belief—the prisoner did not offer me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he asked me to withdraw from the prosecution—I refused to accept the offer of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never had an offer of the whole.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>.) I arrested the prisoner on Monday, 16th May, in consequence of his not surrendering at the Mansion House—I had occasionally watched his house from Saturday—I saw him at 8.30 p.m. in Ball's Pond Road—I told him I was a detective, and that there was a warrant for his apprehension for fraud—I had seen the prisoner leave his residence, 43, Holly Street, Dalston, previous to this—he said "This is a bad job; can't you let me go, and I will surrender on Thursday"—I told him I could not, and that he would have to go to the City with me then—he said "I will come; I knew it must come to this sooner or later"—I took him to the station—I don't think he made any reply to the charge being read to him.</p>

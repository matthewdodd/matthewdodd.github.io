             . I and the prisoner lay together ; I went to bed a little after ten, my money was then in a green silk purse in my pocket. I mist it as soon as I got up, which was about seven in the morning : the prisoner got up about six, I was then awake; I made inquiry of the landlady of the house; she said there was no such thing found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other people lodge in your room?</p>
               <p>Mackbridge. There was another bed with two people in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not they as well have taken your money as the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Mackbridge I was up before them, and missed my money before they got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever lie with you before?</p>
               <p>Mackbridge. Yes, one night before .</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he get up then ?</p>
               <p>Mackbridge. About the same time that he did before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what pocket did you put your money?</p>
               <p>Mackbridge. In my breeches, and laid them under my head: I met with the prisoner in Rosemary lane between eleven and twelve o'clock that very day; I accused him; then I saw him drop the purse, and took it up; there was in it two half guineas and three shillings in silver; then I secured him.</p>

               <p>Shambrook. No, my Lord, no otherways than this; he told me he had received 30 pounds prize money since he came to town; he was going up the lane to take coach and met some of his shipmates , they went into Alderman Parson's head and had a full pot of hot; then came to my house and had a full pot of beer; then the prosecutor seized him, and said he must go to Mr. Glass's; he dropped the purse in my house, but I did not see him drop it, under the table; then they had him before the Justice.</p>

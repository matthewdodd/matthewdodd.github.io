            . I used to keep my money in my waistcoat pocket: I had lost some; and, in order to find out who stole it, I marked some money, put it into my pocket, an d hung my coat and waistcoat over a door, near the back door, over night. The prisoner was a chair woman; she was to come next morning; I set a person to watch her. When I came down, I missed a guinea out of my purse; and the person that watched her, told me he saw her take it. I sent for a constable; she took it out of her pocket; and there was the mark on it. (Produces it: the mark was very visible.)</p>
               <p>- Spencer. Mr. Cowderoy set me to watch the prisoner: as soon as she rung at the gate, I secreted myself; I saw her go to the prosecutor's cloaths; she took the bag out of his pocket; she opened it, and poured the money into her hand; she put a guinea into her mouth whilst she put the rest of the money into the bag, and then she put the guinea into her pocket. I gave Mr. Cowderoy information of it; he charged a constable with her, and then she pulled it out of her pocket.</p>

               <p>The guinea dropped out of the cloaths: I kept it in order to give it to the prosecutor again.</p>

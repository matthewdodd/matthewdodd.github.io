                  </hi>. I live in Pembroke-square, Kensington. I knew Ann Riley—last Easter she lived in the house of Mr. Kennedy, a surgeon, at Hammersmith—I was very intimate with her—I saw the prisoner there—he was assistant to Mr. Kennedy—Mrs. Riley had the first floor, and a room on the second floor—she died on Easter Sunday, the 12th of April—on the Wednesday preceding her death she handed me a parcel—I cannot say what was in it then—I had seen her put some articles of jewellery in it a few days before, but not the day she gave them me—I saw her putting them up on the Sunday before—I saw some rings, seals, and brooches—I did not sec the chain in the parcel—I saw some bracelets—I know the articles produced—they belonged to Mrs. Riley—on the Wednesday she handed me a larger packet than I had seen her make up on the Sunday—I placed it in the drawer of the glass on the dressing-table—Mrs. Riley died at a quarter before six in the morning—after her death I moved the packet from the glass drawer, and locked it in a chest-of-drawers in the same room—I went to the drawer, the middle of the day, Sunday—I do not know whether it was there then—I locked the drawer after me, but had left it open a considerable time on the Sunday, and also on the Monday—on the Tuesday, before twelve in the day I went to the drawer again, and then missed the parcel—I immediately made inquiry about it—I told Mr. Kennedy about it—I did not mention it to the prisoner—on the 31st of Aug. the prisoner called on me in Pembroke-square—Sergeant Mount was below in the house—I think the prisoner came before Mount—I had an interview with the prisoner—I think he said he wished to make some disclosure concerning the property, but he was so exceedingly ill I can scarcely say what he at first said—I do not think I can correctly repeat his words—it was to the effect that he could give me information about the property, I imagine this property—he wished to speak to me in a separate</p>

I had been to town to make inquiry, and coming back I accidentally called at Miss Church's—I heard the prisoner was there—I afterwards went into a room, and saw him there—Miss Church said he wished to give information where the chains were—I then asked him where they were—he said, in a cupboard on the left hand side of the shop—I told him he must go and show me the place—he did so—I found them in the cupboard, in this parcel, two gold chains, seven seals, an eye—glass, and a small pin—there were no bracelets—they were in two different brown paper parcels, both in a parcel of sulphur, which was in brown paper—he said his former statement was correct—I took him to the station.</p>

I came down at about 6 next morning—I observed the fan-light was open—I cannot swear that it had been shut the previous night—I noticed a dirty pocket-handkerchief, smothered in blood and sand, stuffed in the light—I missed a quantity of boots and shoes from the window; those produced are some of them—I can swear to one, by the name Lehocq, Regent-street, in the inside—I missed about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—the pair of women's shoes produced are of my own work—I had seen them in the window the previous night.</p>

In the afternoon of 23d June, I went to the George and Dragon public-house, Woolwich, and saw Sweeney there—the witnesses, Smith and Sarah Chambers, went with me—they waited outside—I told him I wanted to speak to him; he said, "What do you want?" I said, "If you come outside, I will tell you,"—he came outside, and I asked, in the presence of Chambers and Smith, whether he was one of the men that she received the child's shoes from, and also a pair of women's boots—Chambers said he was one of the marines who gave them to her that morning—I found the women's boots between the sacking of a bed, at the cottage of a relative of Smith's—Chambers has absconded after giving her evidence before the magistrate—Feeney said he had neither had any boots nor seen any boots, and he did not know a marine of the name of Feeney—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned in stealing a quantity of boots and shoes from Mr. Weavell's shop on Parson's-hill—at the station, the prisoners were confronted, and they denied all knowledge of each other.</p>

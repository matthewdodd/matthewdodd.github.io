               <p>Joseph Thompson. On Feb. 21, the prisoner came to the gate on Smallbury-Green, and demanded it to be opened, I opened my door to come out to open it, he thrust by me, and desired me to let him warm his hands; the horse was at the door: he staid 7 or 8 minutes, or more, in the house. I asked him how he came to have no saddle, he being a <rs id="t17520408-4-deflabel28" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

(he produced a knife and soldier's cockade) this is the knife he had liked to have killed me with; this cockade was torn from off him in the scuffle, he took my partner's studded watch out of the cupboard. He ran out, left his horse, and got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Never to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Thompson. I had a candle lighted in the house.</p>

            . I was constable of the night, that night, at St. George's, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house to me and charged with this robbery, (he produces a watch delivered to him at the time) I searched him before the justice and found 2 s. and 2 d. in half-pence, and four six-pences. (One of the six-pences was a very batter'd one, which the prosecutor deposed. he knew to be one the prisoner took from out of his bag, and said, he had had it he believed two months.)</p>

            . I am a watchman at Knights bridge : I had intelligence about five o'clock that morning, such a man as the prisoner was upon the road, and that he had cut the turnpike-man's throat on Smallbury Green, and robbed him of a watch and some money: I saw the prisoner, and thought by the descriptions, he must be the man. I followed him, and knowing there was a house up, I went and called a man, and told him; we went after him; when we came to the turnpike at Hyde-Park-Corner we alarmed the two turnpike-men, they stopped him; I carried the prisoner to St. George's watch-house. After that, as I had seen him throw something out of his hand over Hyde-park-wall, and there being no watch found upon him, I went with

            , and we were informed about four in the morning, that the Smallbury-green turnpike-man had been robb'd, and his throat cut by a soldier; about an hour after we heard the cry, stop thief, from towards Knights bridge, we both run out; there they were pusuing the prisoner under the wall. I had a long staff; I said, stop, you sir; he said, what must I stop for: I said, if he would not, I would knock him down; then I seized him by the collar. We led him into the turnpikehouse; we ordered him to pull his gloves off, having been before told, that the turnpike-man had bit the man's thumb that robb'd him. We saw one of his was bit. He was carried to St George's round-house. Then we sent word to the prosecutor we had taken him, and about eleven o'clock he came and swore to the prisoner before Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Which thumb was bit?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. It was his right thumb; the biggest mark was on the top of the nuckle.</p>

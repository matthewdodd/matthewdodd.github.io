On 2nd Feb., about right o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my father's house, and asked me if I knew what my mother said to him the evening before—I said, "No"—he said I did—I said, "I do not; mother will be here directly"—he said, "I shall not wait"—he kept abusing me, and calling me a liar—he had lodged at the house for a week, and my mother had asked him for his rent—he went up stairs, and desired me to leave the bar and go up and see if his room was all right—I said I could not leave the place—he kept insulting me—I said, "I shall fetch a policeman"—he said, "Indeed! fetch a policeman to such a respectable man as I am!"—my mother came in and wanted to know what it was all about—he kept insulting her—she said she would put him outside—he dared her to do it—she put him out—he gave her a violent blow, and another over the chest—I saw her falling, and went to her protection—he tore the hair out of my head by handfulls, and kicked me in the bottom of my stomach—I have been in very great pain ever since.</p>

                  </hi> I am a cheesemonger, opposite Mrs. Trafford's. I heard screams of "Murder!" and "Police!" went and saw the prisoner, Mrs. Trafford, and her daughter struggling in the road together—the prisoner gave Miss Trafford four or five very savage kicks about the lower part of her person—he had a little hair clinging to his fingers—I interposed—it was I that tore his coat—I did not the witnesses gave him that—I had a great deal to do to keep the people from punishing him—he was given in charge.</p>

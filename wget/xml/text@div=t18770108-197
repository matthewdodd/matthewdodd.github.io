                  </hi>. I am relieving officer of the Leytonstone district—Leyton is part of my district—on 5th December, William Jones called on me for an order to bury a child which had died at George Road, Leyton—I asked him what he was, he said a painter earning about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I told him if that was the case he could not ask the parish to bury the child, he said that he was out of work and had no money and could not bury it himself; I asked whether he was married and whether it was his own child—he said "Yes," and I gave him an order—the corpse of the child was pointed out to me by the female prisoner lying on a sideboard, and from its diminutive appearance it was evident that it had been starved, and I said that I should acquaint the Coroner—she fell down on her knees and begged me not to make any bother about the matter, and said that she had done all she could for the child—I then weighed it, and it weighed exactly 9 lbs. with the clothes on—I searched the house with Sergeant Cox, and found about 1 lb. of bread and part of a packet of cornflour; that was all that was in the shape of food—in the front room was an old table and chair, and part of another chair—the bedroom downstairs was quite empty—in the front room upstairs was part of a palliasse, part of an old sheet and three pieces of sacking—in the back room was part of an old palliasse which was exceedingly wet and dirty—the windows were broken, a portion of the ceiling was down and the tiles were partially off the roof, so that it was neither wind or water tight—the house has four rooms—I said "I presume the children sleep here"—she said "No; no one sleeps here"—I said "Do you wish me to believe that yourself and five children have been sleeping on part of that palliasse?"—she said "Yes"—there were four other children in the house who were in a wretched state of filth, and badly clothed, and they seemed very much neglected—I told the prisoners that I could not leave the children there in that state, I must take them to the union—the woman begged me not to do so, but the man said if I would take them there for a week or two he would try and provide better for them, and I took them there.</p>

I am a district visitor, and was in the habit of visiting the prisoners—I recollect this child being born in November, 1875, and I saw it three or four days afterwards—it was a very fine child indeed—I saw it from time to time up to June, 1876, and it appeared in a fairly healthy condition—I was away from the beginning to the last day of June, and at the beginning of July I saw it again, and it had got very</p>

I am a journeyman bootmaker, of 3, Grange Road Leyton—I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen months—I first saw the deceased child when it was a fortnight or three weeks old; it seemed a very fine child, and it retained that appearance till the mother weaned it when it was about six months old; but was always in a very filthy state, it never seemed clean—after it was weaned it seemed to get thinner—I hare seen it sucking its fingers, and it always seemed ravenous—it was very badly—clothed; I have very often seen it in the yard on a cold day with only a shirt on, and I heard my wife speak to the mother about it, who told her to mind her own business and walked indoors—I have smelt Mrs. Jones very often of intoxicating drink when I have crossed the yard for water and she has passed me—she worked at a fire-work maker's, as far as I know, and she worked indoors part of the time—I have seen the children with firework cases and have found them in the yard—I live next door to them and the male prisoner has come to my door late at night to all appearance intoxicated—I have repeatedly heard their children cry of a night as late as 12 o'clock—their windows were broken, and I have seen the landlord come into the yard and make remarks about them.</p>

It was my husband's habit to pay on Saturday for all they have earned, but if the men want money in advance on Monday morning they get it, because they have to go by train from Leyton to Bromley in Kent—I have seen the male prisoner very drunk while he was in my husband's employ, but he was not obliged to leave through drunkenness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Leyton—on 6th December, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of this child, it was very emaciated; it seemed only skin and bone, the legs had been washed, but they were still thick with matter—I found all the organs of the abdomen and chest healthy, the stomach was distended with food, consisting of starchy matter and lumps of bread—the brain was congested on the surface, due I think to the gorged condition of the stomach, there was no particle of fat in the body, the bowels, lungs and heart were healthy—there is such a thing as consumption of the bowels, but I found no trace of it or any signs of consumption generally—in my opin on the emaciation was caused by chronic starvation, either from insufficient or from improper food—the immediate cause of death, was food which gorged the stomach and produced that condition of brain—there was an absence of disease.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Stratford—I examined the child externally; I have heard Mr. Moore's evidence and agree with it—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, but I saw the body two days after and found it a fearful object, mere skin and bone—I weighed it, it only weighed 8 1/2 lbs., and it was 26 inches long; it was a large framed child, and at that age it ought to have weighed about 20lbs.—I could come to no other conclusion than that it died from starvation and neglect.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. From the state of extreme emaciation in which it was should say that it had frequently been without food, because children's stomachs are very elastic, but it was gorged with lumps of bread and starchy matter given to it shortly before death—I cannot help thinking that that food was put into it four days before its death, and now it appears that the stomach could not digest it, and therefore that food was improper food; but I do not consider that the food was the cause of its death so much as the prolonged starvation had been.</p>

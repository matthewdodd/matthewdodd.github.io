                  </hi>. I kept the Sun Dial public-house, in Goswell-street. The prisoner came to my house on the 4th of December—Bonnell and Anderson came first, and while they stood at the bar the prisoner went</p>

               <p>up stairs and called for a glass of brandy and water, and told the waiter he should he glad to speak to his master—the other two called for a bottle of wine, and went up stairs—they asked me to bring it up drink a glass with them—I went up and drank a glass or two with them—they asked me if I had any objection to play a game of cards with them—I said, "I had none in the house, and did not allow card-playing"—one of them went out, and bought a pack—Anderson said, "If you choose to play, we are respecta<lb></lb>ble men—I am a wine merchant," and the prisoner represented himself as a partner in the firm of Napier and Co., Scotch ale brewers—Bonnell repre<lb></lb>sented himself as a cigar-merchant—the prisoner sent his card down to me, to state who he was—I came up with it in my hand, and he said, "That is my card"—I thought myself in the company of gentlemen and tradesmen from their address, and manner, and we sat down—Anderson said, "If you will sit down to play, merely to make up a game, I will hold you free from any loss whatever, merely to make a fourth"—I sat down and played a game at whist—I and Anderson won it, nothing was bet on the first game, only a bottle of wine—after that they said, "Come, landlord, we may as well play another"—I said, I had rather go down stairs—I was very busy—they said, "Play another game," which I did for another bottle of wine—I was to be free; and as soon as the cards were dealt out, Anderson, my partner, said, "I shall bet on the odd trick, will you do it? I have got a good hand"—I said no, I would bet nothing, he said, "I shall bet for you"—I said, "Do as you please, but if you bet and win, or lose, I have nothing to do with it"—he threw down the shilling—we won the game, and, of course, the odd trick—he threw the shilling to me—I refused to take it, saying I had nothing to do with it—he attempted to put it into my waistcoat pocket—I put it on the shelf, and said, "There it is, I will have nothing to do with it"—I was then called down stairs—they rang the bell, and requested me to come up again—when I came up the glasses were charged—they said they were going to drink my health, and prosperity to me in my new house—I thought them very kind, and drank with them; and my firm belief is there was some<lb></lb>thing in the wine, for I felt very strange after it—they then asked me to play another game—I said, "No, I will play no more"—they said, "Play this one game; it shall be the last;" accordingly, I sat down to play the third game—the cards were dealt out—as soon as I looked at my cards I found I had most extraordinary hand—I think Spades were trumps—I had the four honours, and the ten and nine of trumps—the ace and queen of Hearts and the ace, queen, and king of Diamonds—I thought it an extraordinary hand to have—and smiled at it—the prisoner said, "Why I suppose you have got a good hand; you are smiling at it?—I will bet you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that we win with all your cards"—I said, "You may offer what you like, buy I shall bet nothing, though I am convinced I have the odd trick in my hand"—my partner said, "Never mind, bet them, here is my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you make up the other; and if you lose the game with the hand you have I will make it up to you"—I did not bet a farthing—the prisoner then rang the bell, and said, "Waiter, go down to your mistress to lend your master 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, Bob you need not go, I am convinced Mrs. Tennant will not lend me any thing"—the prisoner said, "Go and do what I tell you"—the boy went down, and came up, saying Mrs. Ten<lb></lb>nant would not lend me a farthing—the waiter then left the room—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "I have hit on the trick now"—he rang the bell and said, "Go down and tell your mistress to send your master change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183611280195"></xptr>
               <p>brought up five sovereigns and put and them on the table—the prisoner snatched it up and gave it to my partner (Anderson) who put it into his poc<lb></lb>ket—I said, "Now hand me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "No, I will give it to you presently"—he insisted that he would not give me the money unless I played out the hand—he said, "I have staked my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I know you have got the game in your hand"—I said, "I will not—recollect I have nothing to do with it"—he said, "Well, play the game, and so help me God you shall have it back, win or lose"—and on those conditions I played the hand out, but most astonishingly we lost the odd trick—I played six tricks and then he laid me a Club—I had not a Club in my hand, and the trick was lost—the moment it was over he snatched up the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was down on the table, which my partner had put down—they then took their hats, and said, "Well, we shall wish you good night"—I said to the prisoner. "No, you shall not wish me good night till I have the five sovereigns you have robbed me of; I insist on having my money;" and I put myself against the door—the prisoner said, "Nonsense, we will call again to-morrow, and you shall have your 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or if you are in want of money, this gentleman shall write me out a draft, and I will lend you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you come down to my counting-house to-morrow"—Bonnell drew it out, and the prisoner signed the name of "Hall" to it—he had given his name as Wells before on the back of the card—when I saw the name I was satis<lb></lb>fied they were swindlers and robbers—I persuaded them to stop and have a bit of supper—they wanted to go away, and said, "No; we must go, we cannot stop"—I said, "Stop; it won't be many minutes"—I opened the door, called to the waiter, and told him to tell his mistress to send up the cloth and supper directly, and whispered to him to tell M'Craw, the officer, to come down directly—they wanted to be off directly—I said they should not leave till they gave me my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—they said, "Sit down and have a bit of supper, and we will settle it all"—they did, and had supper, but were a very little while about it—they were then the going—I persuaded them to have some cheese, expecting the officer to come—I said, "Now, gentlemen, you have robbed me of my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and give it to me"—they got up, and Ander<lb></lb>son said, "I have an appointment, I ought to be there now; I will call on you to-morrow, and take you down in my chaise to show you some wine, and I hope you will purchase of me"—I said, "I am to have my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before you leave the room"—they were forcing their way out, and at that moment the policeman and servant came into the room, and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "These men have robbed me of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Anderson looked at him, and said, "I know you very well," and the prisoner said, "I know you"—M'Craw said, "Yes, I know you too"—Anderson had his two hands in his breeches pocket, and began shuffling—M'Craw said, "What are you shuffling there?"—he took one pack of cards out of his coat poc<lb></lb>ket, and another pack from between his thighs—he looked on his finger, and there was a gold ring—he said, "Where did you get that gold ring?"—he said, "What is that to you?"—he then searched Bonnell and the prisoner, and altogether took from them upwards of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but before he commenced searching, the prisoner said to me, "Well, you are a d----paltry fellow; will you take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>?"—I said, "No, I will not take a farthing less than the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you have stolen from me"—he said, "Then d----you, there it is"—M'Craw put his hand on the money, and said, "I shall take this, and I shall take you afterwards in charge"—they then began to beg to be let go, and offered M' Craw money—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is better in your pocket than for us be locked up; you are a man of the world, and</p>

               <p>we will satisfy you"—but he took them to the station-house, and on the road there Bonnell offered all the money they had if M'Craw would let them go—they were taken before the Magistrate next morning, and were committed—they found bail in two sureties of 40<hi rend="italic"></hi>., and ran from their bail</p>

                  </hi>. I was waiter to Mr. Tennant.

Randall was on my side, and I gave him the money in the indictment, and a three-penny or four-penny piece, some thing of that kind, and a silver watch in a double case, and a metal chain; then they rode off. They were with me not above a minute or two, I should suppose, but a very short time; I saw them again the Tuesday week after the robbery. Each of them had a pistol, they behaved exceedingly well, as a man could expect to be robbed, only threatning the horse. I have no doubt of the men, I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Randall's Counsel. What dress did you see Randall in when he was at Bow-street? - A drab coloured kind of coat, the coat he has on now, apparently to me the coat he had on at the time he was stopped.</p>
               <p>So you swore at that time? - I judged it so.</p>
               <p>It is by that principally that you enable yourself to swear to him? - No, Sir; I have a strong recollection of his face.</p>
               <p>You had never seen either of the persons who robbed you before? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any body with you? - My brother and two little girls.</p>
               <p>Your children are young children, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are they here? - No, the one is about ten, the other six or seven.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any of your things? - No.</p>

               <p>Can you swear to him? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Are you positive? - I am as to his person, because he was on the same side of the chaise where I sat, it was close by my side; they ordered the horse to be stopt; then they demanded the money, my brother asked them if they would take all his money? whether he would not allow him something for his expences on the road? he said, deliver all your money and your watch. I saw my brother deliver his money and his watch, they then rode off towards Harrow. I saw them at Bow-street the Tuesday se'nnight after. I cannot swear to Randall's person.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is a felonious larceny and a felonious putting in fear, but not a felonious assault.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there must be another indictment, we cannot suffer two men to go upon the highway again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. To be sure they cannot be convicted of the same felony again, if they have the misfortune to stand there, I must exercise my judgment; I do not feel myself armed with powers to wave a good objection.</p>
               <p>[The prosecutor and witnesses ordered to go to Hick's-Hall and prefer a new indictment, and tell the person who drew it that he has made a mistake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will advise the prisoners, my Lord, to wave the objection.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot do it, we are bound to take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. If any thing can be found for the benefit of the prisoners I shall be very happy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They are now convicted of a highway robbery on this indictment, of course their judgment may be saved; on the face of this record they will be entitled to judgment, because they are convicted of larceny.</p>
               <p>Court. No, we must do justice to the public, we must have another indictment.</p>
               <p>The two prisoners ordered to be taken away, and to remain in custody.</p>
               <p>N. B. On Saturday Mr. Justice Heath informed Mr. Garrow that he had considered the objection, and thought the indictment good; therefore he should not try them again.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor had obtained another indictment.</p>

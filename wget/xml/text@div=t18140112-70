            . I am a constable. On the evening of the same day, I went to the house of the prisoner; Todd he keeps a green stall, and a horse and cart; sometimes Jones drives the cart and sometimes Todd. It was about seven o'clock in the evening, the shop was shut up; I opened the door; I found the three prisoners sitting round the fire. I told

             I wanted to speak with him; I took him backwards, and asked him if he had received any casks that afternoon; he told me, no. On my looking round I saw this kilderkin with William and Mary chalked upon it; it was in the yard behind his house. I asked him how that cask came there; he told me Jones had brought it, and asked him to let it stay there. I went into the shop to lay hold of Jones, and he had ran away; Gillmore, my brother officer, pursued him, and brought him back again in the space of five minutes. I then asked Jones where he found the cask; he told me he saw it just outside of the kennel, he thought it belonged to somebody, and so he rolled it in there. At that time I found no other casks. I asked Todd if there were any other casks there; he told me there was not. On the next night I went again to Todd's premises; Todd and Jones were then in custody. I went and looked over the wall of the yard; there were four or five barrels there in the yard. I then came round to the front of Todd's house, and found there was somebody in Todd's house; I knocked at the door; Crew opened the door, and when I went into the shop I saw the fire was composed of staves a burning. I asked Crew where he got these staves; he told me in the stable. I had searched the stable the night before, there were no casks there; among the casks I found two were defaced; the barrels belonging to Messrs. Moreton are here. There were other barrels there belonging to different people, they are not here. I took Crew in custody.</p>

               <p>Todd's Defence. About a quarter after four o'clock in the evening this good man brought the cask to my door; he said, shall I leave this cask, and he would take it away to-morrow, as he believed it belonged to his master at Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>Crew's Defence. These men were taken up, I went to the office to them. Todd told me to go and mind the house. In the night three or four casks were chucked over the yard, and one broken one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Lower-Marsh, Lambeth. The prisoner was in my service as shopman about a month—he served behind the counter, and received money which he was to put into the till when he received it—in consequence of something I requested the witness, Tapley, to mark some money—next morning I examined the till—I found 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it; none of it was marked—I went out and returned with Tapley—I called the prisoner and asked him whether he knew Tapley—he said "No," at first—he then said, "Yes," he recollected him coming in the morning and purchasing some goods—I asked him what he had received from him—he said, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half-a-crown—Mr. Tapley said, "Never mind what I gave you; what have you got about you?"—he said that was soon shown, and produced 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his pocket—I think there were three crowns and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was one marked half-crown and three marked shillings—these produced are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, living at Kennington. I marked a half-crown and some shillings on the Thursday, in consequence of Mr. Horwell's request—these now produced are what I marked—I went to his shop with the marked money, and purchased something—I gave the marked money produced, and one other shilling, into the prisoner's hands—I saw him go to the till and open it—about three hours after that I went to the pro<lb></lb>secutor—he called the prisoner into the parlour, and asked him whether he knew me—he said, at first, he did not, and afterwards that he did—he prosecutor then asked him what money I had laid out with him in the morning—I think he said, one half-crown and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I interrupted the prosecutor from asking any more questions, and asked what money the prisoner had about him—he took it out of his pocket and placed it in my hand—I examined it, and among it found the marked half-crown and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. produced—he fell on his knees and begged for forgiveness.</p>

            , a Mercer, opposite the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of Mr Thorn's shop with this piece of shalloon, which she dropp'd at the door; produced in court: which I suppose was by pulling the door after her too hastily.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be this piece?</p>
               <p>Green. I know it by the dirt on the paper it is wrapped in: and also by dirt on the end of the piece; she took it up and ran directly away; I went and ask'd Mr Thorn if he had sold her a piece of shalloon; he said no: then I informed him what I had seen; he and I followed her into Smithfield; he overtook her; she turned about directly, and said she had nothing of his; at which time I saw her drop it again behind her; Mr Thorn went and took it; then the prisoner was very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is this your property?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the piece in the shop; there was another woman there buying of buttons; when she came out, she dropp'd the piece and I pick'd it up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was there another woman in your shop, when the prisoner was there ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No: none but my wife behind the counter; she was serving a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. to Green. Did another woman come out of the prosecutor's shop, at that time the prisoner speaks of?</p>
               <p>Green. No: there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was there another woman in the shop when the prisoner went out?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No: there was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been but a fortnight in this part of the world.</p>

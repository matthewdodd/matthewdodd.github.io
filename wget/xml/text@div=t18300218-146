            . I live in Long-alley, Finsbury. On the 17th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was going home perfectly sober; I saw the prisoner in Bartholomew-lane - I passed her about twenty yards, when I heard some person running after me; I turned, and it was the prisoner - she asked me to treat her, and walk with her - she addressed me in very obscene lan<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180068"></xptr>guage; I said I was going home, and would have nothing to do with her - she followed me till we came to <placeName id="t18300218-146-crimeloc816">Crown-court, Broad-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Upon your oath did you not say you lost four sovereigns? A. Certainly not; there was no gold found on you.</p>

            . I am a constable of Broad-street ward. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; the witness charged her with taking his money from his pocket - I began to search her, and a sovereign fell, I suppose from her person; I removed her, and found a sovereign under her feet, which I believe must have fallen from her - I found a purse, with some halfpence and silver in her bosom, and 6d. in her hand; she said she had not robbed the man - I did not hear her ask for pardon.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I received the prisoner in charge from the prosecutor in Broad-street - she said she had not robbed him, and she hoped he would not send her to the watch-house: she went on her knees, and begged for mercy - I took her to the watch-house; she produced 6d., and said that was all she had - I did not quit her hand till I placed her before the table in the watch-house; she tried to get to the fire-place, and at last I heard a sovereign drop - there were three or four men on a bench, but they declared it did not fall from them, and I believe it could not - she was a yard or two from them; the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were a great many men there - the prosecutor walked up from the fire with the gold and silver in his hand.</p>
               <p>MR. JOEL. I did not take the money out to count before the sovereign dropped; I then took it out to see what I had lost.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long before you counted your money under the lamp had you ascertained what money you had about you? A. I knew I had 14l. or 15l. about me before I met her.</p>

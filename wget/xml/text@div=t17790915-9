On the 27th of August at about the dusk of the evening the prisoner came in for a glass of raspberry; my maid served her; she paid for it and went out; when she was gone out my servant missed the pot; she told me, and I went after the prisoner; I asked her what she was going to do with the pot; she said she was going to draw some water to drink. I did not see her with it; when my servant went out and called after her, she set it down. I found a quart pot in her apron which belonged to another person; I charged an officer with her; she was brought back, and was in my passage when I saw her.</p>

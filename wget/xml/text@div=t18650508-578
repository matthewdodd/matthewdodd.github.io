                  </hi>. I live at Albert-cottages, Albert-street, Newington, and am a clerk in the City—about half-past 12 on Sunday morn-ing, 7th May, I was in the London-road—three men came along arm-in-arm and pushed up against me—I said, "Don't be quite so fast"—they said, "If we are intruding, say so, "and I said, "You are, "and I went on till I reached a butcher's shop, I think, where there was a crowd—I was passing through the crowd when my hat was knocked off, and I received several blows with the fist in the face—I saw several of the men, and recognized some of them as the men who pushed up against me—I defended myself—I saw a policeman at the time, but he was engaged and could not help me—while speaking to the policeman, I received several other blows, and was knocked down—while on the ground, I received several blows with the fist, and people were keeping me down—I managed after some time to get up—I felt my watch and chain going—the prisoner was then close to me—I saw him run away—I ran after him, calling "Stop thief!"—a gentleman stopped him, and said, "Is he the real thief?" and I said, "Yes"—I did not lose sight of him till he was stopped—the chain was broken at the end before, and was not fastened in any way, only through a button-hole—it was pulled away—a policeman came up—I gave the prisoner into custody—I heard a sort of crush near where we were standing in Temple-street—we looked about, but could not find anything then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mason, of 2, Richmond-street, Walworth—a little after 12 on this morning I was in Temple-street, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner coming towards me followed by Mullhauser—I stopped the prisoner, and the prosecutor charged him with robbing him of his watch, and gave him in custody.</p>

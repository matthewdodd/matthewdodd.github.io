                  </hi>. I keep the Hand and Flower beer-shop, in Queen's Road, Mortlake—on the night of 14th January, I went to bed about 10.50, the house was safe at that time, as far as I know—I fastened the back-door the last thing—about 1 o'clock, I was awoke by hearing someone in the house—I got out of bed and opened the window and looked out, I saw a man leave the house, he came out of the back door; I did not know that man—I afterwards saw the prisoner come out of my back door with a lighted candle in his hand—that is the place where I keep my beer—the prisoner had been a lodger of mine—I knew him well, and am sure he is the man—he had on the same dress he has now—I called out "Halloa, what's up there," and the prisoner looked up with the lighted candle in his hand and said "If you will come down you will see"—I put on my trousers, and went down, but the men were both gone—I am sure that the fastening of the back window was all right when I went to bed; when I came down it was on one side—a pane of glass was broken opposite the fastening, and a piece of paper had been pasted over it—it was inside there that the beer was kept—it was an eighteen gallon cask; I had tapped it that afternoon, and bunged it down; it was quite full, and in the morning about six gallons was gone—there was only my wife and children in the house—I had closed the house and bolted the door about 11 o'clock.</p>

               <p>Collins's—<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>: It is about 80 yards)—a wake was held over the body—there were fifteen or sixteen persons there—the prisoner came in about 9 o'clock—he went out about 10.30 with my wife, to go to Mrs. Hoggart's, The Spur, about 15 yards off—he came back with ray wife in about a quarter of an hour, with a gallon and a half of beer—he remained in the house till between 2 and 3 in the morning—he was then absent not quite ten minutes—he went out at the back for a purpose—during the whole night, from 5.30 in the evening till 5.50 in the morning there was two and a-half gallons of beer drunk—no more than the gallon and a-half which he and my wife brought in came into the house—he ultimately left about 4.40, to convey Mrs. Kinahan and her daughter three-quarters of a mile from the house, and he went to his work at 5.50.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is a customary thing to sit up with a dead person during the night, and not leave them by themselves with candles, or they might take fire—we were not drinking pretty well the whole time—what drink we had would not last all the time—I mean to swear candidly and truly that was all the beer that reached the house that night—my wife and the prisoner paid for it—no one else paid for any—every one in the house was sober—about fifteen persons came in, and stayed till 11.40—I am not related to the prisoner—my wife went before the Magistrate. I did not—I did not think it necessary—I went to my work—I thought one was sufficient—there is nobody here from Mrs. Hoggart's that I know of—she served us with the beer.</p>

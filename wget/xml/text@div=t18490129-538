                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Cresent vault-office, wine department, in the London Docks. On 9th Jan. my attention was called to this tasting order—I asked the prisoner were he got it from—he said from a person in a tobacconist's shop—I asked him who he was and what was his name—he replied, "I do not know"—I said I thought it very strange that he should get a tasting-order from a party whom he did not know—he replied that it was so—I then said, "I have my doubts about the genuineness of this order, and I shall consider it my duty to send to the house of Vincent and Pugh to ascertain if the signature be a genuine one"—he said, "Very well, do so, and I will return in half an hour"—I said, "You had better wait until the messenger returns"—he said, "No, I shall come in half an hour"—he appeared to be in a very excited state, and anoxious to get away—he west away, and was not taken till many days afterwards—I have the charge of the wine in these vaults—it is not my duty or Daniels' to be present when the tasting orders are executed—Daniels accepts the orders—one of the coopers in the vaults has to be present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Dock Company. On 24th Jan. I was at a public-house in Blackman-street, Borough, with a man named Sayer and another constable, and saw the prisoner there—Sayer asked him if his name was Thomas Illidge—he said, "No; my name is not Illidge"—a cooper, named Felgate, in the service of the Dock Company was with me who knew the prisoner, and I said to him loud enough for the prisoner to hear, "Is this the man?"—he said, "That is the man"—I then said to the prisoner, "I want to speak to you, if you will step into the parlour; we went in, and I there said to him, "We are officers belonging to the London Dock Company; I have eighteen or twenty forged orders for tasting wines which I find you have uttered"—he said, "I know nothing of twenty orders, I only know about one"—I said, "Do you mean the last one you presented, and which was rejected"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where did you get that one?"—he said, "I got it from a young man at a public-house"—the pri<lb></lb>soner has only been identified in connection with the three orders produced—I took him into custody, took him to the Docks, and showed him the whole of the orders—he made no remark.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I apprehend that this indictment cannot be supported, upon two grounds; first, because the instrument must at the time it is uttered purport to be a valid order, warrant, or request, showing an authority to deliver</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">the goods mentioned in it. Now the witness Daniels, has proved that it is not a valid instrument for any such purpose until he has countersigned it, which I he had not done when the prisoner presented it. Secondly; I submit that the instrument if completed would only give a permission to taste, and would not be either an order, a warrant, or a request for the delivery of the goods so as to enable the party to get them transferred into his own possession or control.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">As to the purport of the instrument, that is matter of evidence or explanation; it is obligatory upon the person to whom it is issued, although for the purpose of the internal management of the Dock business it might be required to be countersigned, (in the same way at a banker's check might, by some private regulation unknown to the party presenting it, require to pass through some particular hand before it is paid;) but its operation as a warrant is complete for the purpose to which it is applied at the time it issues from the merchant. With regard to the second point, there is a delivery of goods within the meaning of the Stalute; although, certainly in very minute par<lb></lb>ticles, and not for the purpose of being carried away to such an extent as might form the subject of a charge of larceny</hi>,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CRESSWELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I do not think the case of a banker's cheek would be the same thing. It has been held that a Bill of Exchange cannot be described as such in an indictment, unless it has been accepted.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A Bill of Exchange is an instrument requiring certain attributes, without which it would not exist; but it might be good described in another form.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CRESSWELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">do not think that observation answers the objection. I have a very strong opinion at present that this is not an order for the delivery of goods. An order for the delivery of goods means that they are to be delivered to the party to be dealt with as his own, in any way he pleases. This wine is not so delivered; it is delivered to him for the special purpose of tasting, and nothing else, he has no other control over it. The order is directed to the cooper. Vincent and Pugh have no power to give an order operating on the cooper; he is not in any way bound to obey their order on the contrary, he is not to do so. Therefore it does not appear to be an instrument issued directly from Vincent and Pugh to the cooper, but it is to go through some other hands. The perfecting of the order is to be received from the clerk appointed to accept it, and it is his acceptance which is addressed to, and which binds the cooper.</hi>

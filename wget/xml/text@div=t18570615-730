                  </hi>. I reside in Hope Cottage, Hammersmith. On Wednesday, 20th May, I was returning home from town—I called at the Sussex Arms about half past 3 o'clock—I had something to drink; I do not exactly know what, but the landlord will state better than I can; it was very trifling—I recollect several persons being there—they asked me to stand some beer, and I did, and paid for it—I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were there—I had that day received from my son two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and I had two sovereigns wrapped in each of the notes, and I had a separate sovereign for the purpose of change—when I was at the public house, I must have taken the notes out, but I have no distinct recollection—I had a puzzle purse—I should imagine I left that house in about ten minutes—I proceeded home, and called at the Windsor Castle Hotel—I merely went to gossip—I had nothing there—I should think I remained scarcely five minutes—a man came in and had some beer, but I do not know who it was—having stayed there about five minutes, I went towards home—I went to cross over to Hog Lane; the Hampshire Hog is at the corner—there is a urinal at the corner, but I did not go to that; I went on a little further—I had not used the urinal; I had not time to undo my trowsers—in going from the gateway further on, a hand was violently thrust over my right shoulder—my coat was buttoned, and the money was in the breast pocket of my coat, having no waistcoat on—an iron hand rushed over my shoulder, tearing my coat open, and the pocket and the money were bodily taken away—I was not injured, but I was thrown or fell on the ground—I was not struck—my back was towards the gateway, and towards the man who touched me; and before I recovered my feet, they were round the corner—before I got to the corner, they were out of sight—my coat is here; the pocket is torn out.</p>

               <p>Arms—Hog Lane is about 200 yards from the Windsor Castle—it turns out of the High Street—the Windsor Castle stands back on the right hand side—in getting from the Windsor Castle to Hog Lane, you pass down the High Street, having to cross over—the urinal is at that corner of Hog Lane which abuts on the High Street, just round the corner—a person passing the High Street, and looking down the lane, would necessarily see it—beyond the urinal there is a rail to prevent cattle going down—I think I was not so far as that rail; I was within the rail, I might be four or five yards down—I know the Hampshire Hog, at the corner—I know the path there—a person on the path could not see a very great distance down the lane, it is so narrow; he could see a few yards—if you were out in the road, you could see a little way down—in front of the Hampshire Hog, you could not see down the lane—the door of the Hamp<lb></lb>shire Hog is in the middle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could a person in a cart at the door see a few yards down that lane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If the cart were drawn in front of that door, I think it would be almost impossible to look down Hog Lane—in that particular place the pavement is very wide indeed—the place where I stopped is rather to the left—it is on the same side of the lane as the Hampshire Hog is.</p>

On Thursday morning, 21st May, I was on duty at Hammersmith, about a quarter past 6 o'clock—I saw Saddington—I was not aware of his name—I said, "Well, Contractor"—he stopped, and I said, "You have a considerable sum of money about you, have not you?"—he said, "Yes"—he was much the worse for liquor—I asked him how he came by the money—he said by work—I asked him where, he said for Mr. Lee and Jardin, at the coal wharf, against the Hand and Flower—I said that I did not believe it, and he must go with me to the station, and stop there till I went to the Hand and Flower to make inquiries—he said that he would not go with me to the station, but would go and see Captain Hammerton—he said that he had a sister married last Sunday, and he had left 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week in Captain Hammerton's hands till it had amounted</p>

On 20th May I was at Notting Hill, just through the toll gate, unloading some clover hay, about 10 minutes before 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw Saddington and Barker, they said that they had got some bits of paper, and asked me to look at them, and they pulled out two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I am quite sure of it, because I took them in my hand, and looked at them—they asked me if I could do anything with them—I said, "No," I did not think they were good—I told them they were not worth a penny to me, for I had been in a bother once before, and I should not get in a bother with other people, and should have nothing at all to do with them—they said they had got them, and a little hard stuff; of a gentle<lb></lb>man from Hammersmith, and they should not have thought that gentleman had any bad money about him—there was a cut on the right end of one of the notes, just by the water mark—I think this is the note by the cut, but the notes were very clean when I saw them—I looked at them particularly—I knew they were good notes.</p>

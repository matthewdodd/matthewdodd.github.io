            . My mother deals in marine-stores. The prisoner came on a Monday, and asked if she would buy these glasses; he asked 4d. for them - I said,"They can't be your own property;" he then offered them for 3d. - he then offered them to a girl at the door; there was a Police-man passing, and I told him - he took him, and he knocked the Police-man down two or three times; the prisoner said they were his own - he was taken to the watch-house; I have seen him before, and he has brought glasses; one of these was up his sleeve, and the other in his hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These glasses are not what I had - I had two, which were my own, and the Policeman took them from me.</p>

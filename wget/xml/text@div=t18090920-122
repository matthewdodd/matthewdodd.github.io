            . Q. Are you a Surgeon - A. Yes, On Tuesday evening about ten o'clock, when I arrived at the Skinner's Arms public house, Skinner's fields, I found the deceased on the steps supported by men, I requested him to be brought into an inner room, finding his pulse to be quicker than I wished it should, I drew blood about a pint, he was in liquor and that is the reason I bled him, when I had bled him I found his pulse amended from that motion. I requested him to be taken to Somer's town in an arm chair his head to be kept uppermost, he died I understand that evening. On Thursday, I opened the head a vessel had burst itself on the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form a judgment what had occasioned the breaking of that vessel - A. Violence of any kind, his own exertion, intoxication, vomiting or falls, it might have proceeded from any thing that made the vessel to be in extortion. I consider the cause of his death being occasioned by the pressure of extravasated blood on the brain, and that was occasioned by some violence, what violence I cannot say.</p>

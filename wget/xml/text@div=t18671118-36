I live with my father at 3, Green Bank, St. George's-in-the-East, two doors from the Turk's Head, which is kept by the pri<lb></lb>soner—it is not far from Ratcliff Highway—on the Sunday in question I saw three children leave the house—I do not know the time, but it was three or five minutes before the fire—after they had gone the prisoner went out of the house at the door in Bird Street, and went in the same direction as the children—that is the front door; he locked it, and took the key with him—I was standing by the lamp-post opposite the house—the street is a little wider than from you to me—in three or five minutes I saw smoke coming from the window below, level with the ground, and heard like some bottles fall on the floor, level with the ground, and smash—there was a pretty fair smash—I ran to see if I could see Mr. Morris in the direction he took, but I could not; I went back, got over our back wall into his yard, and saw three or four people in his yard—I assisted in getting some water—my father went into the cellar first, and I went in with the fireman and another man, and found this parcel of gunpowder lying between two casks in a brown bag—the two casks were close together—I did not notice any appearance of burning—I called the fire<lb></lb>man's attention to the powder—this is it, but this is not the paper.</p>

I am a stevedore, and at this time lived at 3, Green Bank, two doors from the prisoner—on Sunday, 13th October, about four o'clock, I heard an explosion—I went to the front door, and saw the boy Yates outside, and smoke coming from all the windows of the Turk's Head—I got over the paling, which are nine feet high altogether with the bank on which they stand, and went down the yard; the back door was open, and I went in—I saw the cellar door open, and flames coming from a spirit cask in the cellar—there was no appearance of burning anywhere else—there was nobody in the house—I was the first that went in—the cellar door was broken in two pieces—it is a wooden door—one board, on which the lock was, was burst off and burnt in two—it had fallen outwards—I got some water, and put the flames out, and found some bung cloth, light canvas on fire; it was between two casks of spirits—there was not a great quantity of them; they were all taken afterwards and put into a tub—there was no blaze from the bung cloths, only fire—as far as I could see, there was nothing else but the blaze of the spirits—the casks were not burning, the cock was a quarter turned, and the rum was running from the cask—after I put the flames out I discovered a brown paper bag of powder on top of a beer cask which was about six feet from the spirit cask—there was a smell of gunpowder and spirits—the gas was not on, the fireman came in and lit the gas in the cellar—the flame coming from the spirit cask was six or seven inches high.</p>

I went to the Turk's Head at a few minutes after four, it may have been ten minutes—I got in through the tap-room window and saw a coal fire in the grate—I went to the top of the cellar and found the door broken open, and the lock lying on the floor: not on the cellar side, but on the other side, in the passage—I saw Towzell there—there was a smell like mixed spirits, and a great smoke; you could scarcely see, and it was enough to take your breath away—I threw some water down, and then went down into the cellar and saw a little flame coming from some bung cloths which were in the centre of the cellar—I helped to pick them up and put them in a tap-tub—on one barrel, just under the stairs, was a paper packet with gunpowder in it, and there was a packet laid underneath the cellar steps, about a foot and a half from the other barrel—I went over the premises, but found no one there except those who were assisting me—the prisoner came about five o'clock, and I said, "Mr. Morris, there has been afire in the cellar, and there has been some gunpowder found"—he said if any was found there somebody put it there out of spite, and that he had locked the place up before he went away and had got the cellar key, and he showed it to me—I told him that the rum was running—he said that it was not running when he went out.</p>

               <p>Wellclose Square—I am over the whole of the fire offices in London—on 13th October, about twenty-five minutes to five, I went to these premises, went into the cellar, and noticed a quantity of smoke—I saw that some bung cloths had been burning, and some rum had been running from a cask—the bung cloths smelt strongly of rum—my attention was drawn to two packets of powder on some casks—I found 1lb. 6oz. in the two packets—this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been exploded, so that I was obliged to take it out and put it into another paper—I picked up the packet with the name on it off the barrel; that had not exploded—the other, which had been exploded, was picked up afterwards; Sergeant Proctor gave it to me—the smell was like an explosion of powder—I went to the house between seven and eight in the evening, and asked the prisoner where he was insured—he said in the Royal Fire-office, for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him how he accounted for the powder I being on the cask in the cellar below—he said that he could not account for it unless he had some friends about him who owed him a spite—I asked him what that hole in the bagatelle-room was, near the bagatelle board—he said that they must have come in from the back entrance, and gone down that hole into the cellar—I asked him how much rum he thought he had in his cask—he said that he thought it was about half full—I said, "That will be for you and the surveyor to settle in the morning"—I told him I would leave a man all night for safety, and if he heard of anything to let me know—he said that his wife had gone to Stratford, some of his children were at school and some at church, and that when he left the house there was no one there at all—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the bung cloths, more than an ordinary tub full were picked up and put in a tap-tub, more than thirty—I did not see them till they were in the tub—pieces of paper were mixed with them, as there are with this; they were wet with rum and water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of the Commercial Road—on 11th November I was instructed by Mr. Young, the solicitor for the prose<lb></lb>cution, and went over the prisoner's premises to value the stock—I valued a portion of it, and had got to the third room, when Mrs. Morris and an adviser of hers came forward, and we were not allowed to continue—there was a distress put into the premises in May last, but I did not put it in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Salvage Corps—I received orders to stay at the Turk's Head all Sunday night—I asked the prisoner if he had any idea how the powder came into the place—he said no, he never bought any powder, and had no idea it was on his place.</p>

On 21st October I took the prisoner at the Turk's Head—I told him I should take him on suspicion of attempting to set fire to the Turk's Head with gunpowder—he said, "Oh!"—two or three minutes afterwards he said, "Who has done this for me?"—said, "From inquiries that have been made"—when we were in Bird Street he asked the charge against him again, and I repeated it.</p>

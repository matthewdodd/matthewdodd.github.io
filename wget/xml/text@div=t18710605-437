I keep the Elephant and Castle—about 11 o'clock on this night, I heard my wife say "This is a bad shilling"—I went in, the second shilling had then been tendered—I told the prisoner she would have no objection to accompany me to Mr. Eason's, which she willingly did—that is about 300 yards from my house—I called the four barmen together, and said in her presence that she had received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change for a half-crown for a pot of half-and-half about twenty minutes ago—that would be about 10.40—the man who served her said "She paid me with a sixpence, and I returned her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change"—she pointed out the potman, who the said served her, but he said that he did not.</p>

How he came by them? And how those Writs had been obtained? He informed the Court, that he was Clerk to Mr. Miles, who was out of Town; that he had the Writs delivered him by Mr. Miles's Brother, the Distiller; and that he himself knew nothing further of the Matter. - Which Answer not being satisfactory to the Court, the Court was pleased to order him to take the Writs back again, to recommend an Enquiry how those Writs had been obtained, and the Trials to be called on.</p>

             was unjustly accused; but it was her's, and their Misfortune, that it then obtained no Credit. -</p>
               <p>They were Strangers, unknown to every body at the Trial. - Canning was positive, and being by unfair Means confirmed in her Evidence, Squires was convicted.</p>
               <p>Upon this Charge of Perjury great Care hath been taken, attended with great Expence, on either Side, to search this Matter to the Bottom; every Circumstance hath been scrutiniz'd, and nothing omitted to investigate the Question thoroughly.</p>
               <p>It hath a long while been the general Subject of Conversation, and hath engaged the Attention of the Public, more, perhaps, than any private Transaction ever did before.</p>
               <p>Here are the Names of no less than fifty Witnesses indorsed upon each of their Indictments; yet only one of them, a poor Woman, whose Evidence is immaterial, appears to prosecute!</p>
               <p>This Desertion may occasion various Conjectures, and many false Reasons will probably he suggested for not prosecuting these Indictments.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be attributed to a Compromise - It may be said, that these Defendants are to be acquitted by Consent, and that the Indictment against Canning is to be dropped. One cannot easily imagine what Rumours Malice may raise.</p>
               <p>For this Reason, and to prevent any Imputation upon those who are concerned for the Defendants, I beg Leave to assure Your Lordship, and all who hear me, that the Defendants now come prepared for Trial; that their Witnesses attend Your Lordship, ready to give their Testimony with such clear, ample, convincing Circumstances, as would demand universal Assent; and fully prove, the Innocence of the three Defendants, and the Falsity of

            's Story in every particular.</p>
               <p>Here are Witnesses, more in Number than perhaps ever appeared in any one Cause, collected together at a vast Expence, and from different remote Places.</p>
               <p>Here is other Evidence also ready to be produced, such as, in its Nature, cannot deceive.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutors have been invited to meet them here before Your Lordship and the Jury; and so desirous were the Friends of the Defendants that this Matter should be fairly tried, that they have offered to bear Part of the Charges of this Prosecution.</p>
               <p>The Public hath been a long while amused with Promises, that, in the Trials of these Indictments, the Guilt of the present Defendants should be clearly manifested; and the whole of this mysterious Transaction unravelled.</p>
               <p>The Time is come to perform these Promises, and Thousands expect it.</p>
               <p>Why do all these Boaster now hide their Faces? because they are covered with Confusion.</p>
               <p>They are aware how dangerous it is to pursue a Prosecution, founded in the foulest and most daring Perjury; and wisely withdraw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175309060027"></xptr> themselves from a Trial which would involve them in Ruin.</p>
               <p>Had I considered the Case of the Defendants alone, without Regard to any other Person, I should have thought it needless to give the Court any Trouble upon this Occasion.</p>
               <p>They are private Countrymen, without any Connections in this Part of the World, and totally unconcerned at any Reports which may prevail here : - Within the narrow Circle of their Acquaintance, their Characters will remain unblemished, let Fame do its worst; because the Charge against them is the Attestation of a Fact, which all their Acquaintance, all their Parish, and their whole Country, know to be true.</p>
               <p>But there is ONE, whose near Relation to this great City, makes it necessary for me to say thus much.</p>
               <p>It is impossible for Him to be unsollicitous for public Approbation, after having done so much to deserve it.</p>
               <p>Yet all the Reproaches which Malice could suggest to little, dark, designing Men, have been levelled at the Chief Magistrate of this City, only for doing what the Love of Justice and Humanity inspired Him to.</p>
               <p>For His Sake therefore, I have thus trespassed upon Your Lordship's Patience, and only beg Leave to add a few Words more, to shew how unmerited those Reflections were.</p>
               <p>As His Lordship was at the Head of the Commission at the Trial of 
               <persName id="t17530906-45-person421">

            , and was totally uninfluenced by the infamous Endeavours which at that Time had been us'd to give Credit to a most improbable Narrative; he was directed, merely by a Regard for Truth, to make further Enquiry into a Story, pregnant with Absurdities, and unlike any Transaction that ever went before it.</p>
               <p>And the Evidence of Elizabeth Canning depending intirely upon this Question, Whether the Account which these three Men had given was true, where could His Lordship so properly direct His Enquiry, as to those Places, where they swore they had seen her?</p>
               <p>The Success of that Enquiry answered the Wishes of His Humanity; and the most indubitable Proofs of the Convict's Innocence warmed the Royal Heart to Mercy.</p>
               <p>One should have thought, that this Conduct of a Magistrate, whose sole Motive to it was a Desire of rescuing a wretched, friendless, Convict, from the Miseries into which Perjury, and popular Prejudice, had thrown her, should, at least, exempt Him from Censure.</p>
               <p>But His Enemies could never forgive Him the Merit of this Action: As it raised Him still higher in the Esteem of good Men, he became more the Object of Envy; and no Arts were uneslay'd to diminish the Reputation He had so justly acquired.</p>
               <p>Had My Lord-Mayor been present, I should not have said so much; but I have been the more encouraged to it from observing, that His Lordship withdrew Himself as soon as these Causes were called, because He was pleased to think it improper for Him to preside, where any thing that might be thought to concern Himself should come before the Court.</p>
               <p>I have an Apology to make for giving Your Lordship any Trouble, where there is no Prosecution; but as the Court waits for the Return of a Messenger, and no Business is now proceeding upon, I hope I have given no Offence.</p>

On the 9th of May the prisoner came and bought some quilling net, gloves, and stockings, which came to 1s. 10d. - I saw her conceal these articles, which were worth 4s. 9d.; she handed them to her little boy, who is about seven years old, and he put them into her basket; she took them out and put them into her pocket - I let her go out, and as she passed the window I took her back; my master told her to give up what she had - she took them out and put them down.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WRIGHT (Police-constable G 105). I received charge of the prisoner, and produce the articles, which were given to me by Mr. Freeman - the prisoner said her little boy took them, and she was not conscious of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The little boy put them in unknown to me.</p>

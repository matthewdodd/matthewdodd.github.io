                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> Y 263). On the morning of 6th July, about 4.20, I was on duty at the corner of Phoenix Street, Somer's Town, and saw the prisoner and another man—I said to the prisoner, "What are you hanging about for at this time in the morning?"—they said, "We are going to the cattle market"—I said, "All right!" and passed on—I passed Mr. Johnson's shop; it was all right then—I re-passed the shop at about 4.50, and found the door open—I called Mr. Johnson up, and looked through the house—the back parlour window had been forced open, and I found this knife and pickaxe on the floor—there were marks outside the window, and a gimlet was put through the bar—the framework of the window was broken, as though it had been forced from the outside.</p>

               <p>came in for a light for a cigar which he had in his hand—he stood against the counter and looked into the parlour—his father lives opposite, and used to live next door—I was disturbed about 4.45 in the morning, and found every drawer in the shop open, and the things strewed about—I missed a gold watch, a child's money box, containing, I suppose, from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about 30 three-penny cigars, and about 30 two-penny ones—I had fastened the window with a gimlet—I have seen none of my pro<lb></lb>perty since.</p>

I knew you were after me about Johnson's affair, and now I will tell you all about it. My father turned me out of doors when I had nothing to do, and that is the cause of it. The watch I pawned, and the cigars I threw away."—he said that he pawned the watch over Blackfriars Bridge, but he could not name the street—he also said, "I kept out of the way, and my father paid my fare to Birmingham."</p>

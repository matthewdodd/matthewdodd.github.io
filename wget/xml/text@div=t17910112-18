               <p>I have the charge of my father's house, at Stone Stairs; he has lost his eye-sight. I know the prisoner; I first saw him a few days before Christmas; him and his landlord, and the waterman, and another shipmate, had a pot of beer, and went away, and once or twice after. On Friday, the 24th of December, he came in about eleven in the morning, and the landlord was with him I am certain; they made no stay; he asked for the waterman; he went out, and I think he did not stay above half a minute, and returned again alone; he said he wanted to speak to me; I went into the back room with him; then he said, would I take care of his money which he had for his wages? I told him, yes; he said he was afraid of losing it in bad company; he took off his shoe, and put seventeen guineas into my hand, which he took out of the shoe; but it was not in a purse; I promised him to take care of it; he desired I would give it to nobody but himself; I said I should not, without his order, and he went away; I put the money up stairs in a purse; I saw no more of him till Sunday morning, much about eleven; he came and said, I want to speak to you; and I went into the same room; and he said, you shewed my shipmate a watch which I will buy of you; I told him he knew the price of it; and I brought down the watch, and he said, give me the balance out of my money; he said, three guineas out of seventeen, there is how much? I said, you know there remains fourteen; and I asked him if he wanted his money? I said, you had better take what you have occasion for, and leave the rest in my hands; he said, no, his captain had laid him a wager that he had spent his money, therefore he would just take the money in his pocket to shew to his captain, and bring it back at night for me to take care of; I went up stairs and brought down the purse I had put it in, and he took it, and said, good morning; when he got half way out, he turned back and said, he had bought a watch of one of his shipmates for half a guinea, which he wished to have cleaned, would I get it done for him? I told him yes, and he gave me the watch; I looked at it, and told him he had bought it very cheap; I said, I supposed as he had bought the other of me, he would sell that; and if so, he had better have a new face put on her, and some little alterations which I pointed out, which would make the watch sell much better, and cost seven or eight shillings; he then said he would have the chain of the old watch put on to the new; but he said, it was no matter, he would take it as it was, and left the watch in my hands; I saw him no more till I saw him before the justice on the Monday. On the Sunday night, Elby came, and I gave him the watch; I told them of the money, which they seemed to know nothing about.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Sunday, the 26th of December, about six o'clock, a young man came to me and said, he suspected a man was guilty of the murder of the man and woman some time back; and he described the prisoner; I had seen him before, and I apprehended him with Forrester and Groves, at the Spread-eagle, Gracechurch-street; the stage was pretty nigh getting off; I went into the tap, and seized the prisoner; he asked me whether I was going to Portsmouth? Forrester and Groves came in; I searched the prisoner in a back room, and found on him, in his inside waistcoat pocket (I saw only two waistcoats; he might have three) thirteen guineas and a half: I searched him farther, and in the pocket on the other side, I found ten shillings in silver, and three six-pences, and a crown-piece by itself, in his trowsers pocket, on the right hand side; I had heard of Lacey's robbery, and finding this crown-piece, I suspected the prisoner to be the man that did this; and this watch I found in his other trowsers pocket, concealed, with no appearance of a chain; he said he gave three guineas for it; and on the other side was this watch with the chain hanging out; we brought him to Mr. Lacey, to the Black Horse in Goodman's-fields; neither of those watches were Lacey's; I had no conversation with the prisoner, nor heard any promise or any thing between Groves and him: I went to Mrs. Blenkinsop's, and found the prosecutor's watch; and the prisoner went with me, and shewed me where the purse was, under some bricks; I took it up; the prisoner said he did not break open the chest, but the person who did, had four guineas for his trouble; I never heard the prisoner say any thing about the money left with Mrs. Blenkinsop: the prisoner bore a very good character on board of ship, both from the captain and mate; his ship had not been up a week, therefore he could not have been the man that did the murder.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house with William Crawley and his mother, about a quarter before eight o'clock—I was on duty near the spot—on going into the room, I found on the table these articles—here is a checked apron, which was coverd over the remainder—I asked the prisoner how she came by them—she said, she had them to dry from a Mrs. Earl—she did not say where she lived—the husband was there.</p>

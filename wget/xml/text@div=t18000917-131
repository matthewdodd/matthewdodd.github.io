             sworn. - I went to fetch the bed, and paid half-a-guinea for it; that is all that I know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence to the following effect:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. My husband has left me with two helpless infants, I believe he is pressed into the King's service, I have not heard of him since he has been gone. In order to support my children, I went to live as a servant in Cnarlotte-Street, Fitzroy-Square; after that, I went to live in the family of a Jew; their method I found would not suit me, and I quitted that situation in the first week, and the day I quitted, I saw the prosecutor selling greens at the corner of Denmark-Street; I enquired if she could inform me where I could get a lodging; she said, she would accommodate me with half of her bed; I slept with her that night; she had but one room, and in the morning she introduced three men into the room to me, and they over-persuaded me to send for gin; I was over-persuaded to drink, till I was so intoxicated as not to be able to know what I was doing, and they treated me as their brutal design led them; two or three days before she charged me with this offence, she introduced one 
               <persName id="t18000917-131-person1219">
                  Thomas 
                  Jones
               <interp inst="t18000917-131-person1219" type="surname" value="Jones"></interp>
                     <interp inst="t18000917-131-person1219" type="given" value="Thomas"></interp>

             to me, and he made me intoxicated again; and being deprived of my money and clothes, I was over-persuaded to fetch a broker, and sell the goods, for money to get more liquor; I believe he was in the room, or the adjoining room, when the broker was dealing for the bed; the price was half-a-guinea, and half a pint of gin, Jones, myself, and another woman, drank the half pint of gin; the half-guinea was changed, gin sent for, and the broker's man partook of both; the other woman in the house bought some giblets, and some more liquor, with the money that was received for the bed; then they left me in that miserable and intoxicated state; and when I became a little sensible, and saw my wretched situation, and reflected upon my conduct, in order to replace the bed, I went to a pawnbroker's to pledge some things of my own, when she had me taken up. I solemnly declare, as I believe there is a God above, that I never robbed or defrauded any one; and if I had not been intoxicated with liquor I should not have done as I did. I therefore trust this honourable Court will exercise as much mercy as the circumstances of the case will permit; the prosecutrix has had her bed returned, and her expences paid; she is a married woman, and her husband is abroad.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Grotage.) Q. Have you a husband? - A. No; my husband has been dead these eight years, he died in Well-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any truth in this story of men being introduced to her? - A. I was not at home from Sunday morning till Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Dunbar. Mrs. Grotage's own account was, that she went out on purpose for her to have her sweethearts there, that she might get her some money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18000917-131-verdict715" type="verdictDescription">

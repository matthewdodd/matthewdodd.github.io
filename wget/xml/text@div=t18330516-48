Both the prisoners were in my service; Mahony had lived with me two years and a half; she had 8l. a year - M'Carthy had lived with me nearly twelve months; I had given them both warning to leave on the 12th of April - I had not then missed these articles; I did not miss them until after they left; Mahony asked me on the Thursday morning, as she was to leave on Wednesday, if I wished to look over her box? I said I did wish, and did so - they both sleep in the same room, but had separate boxes; on looking over her box at that time I found nothing; I searched M'Carthy's box the same day, and found nothing - when Mahony asked me to search her box, she asked if I had any objection to her taking it away on that Thursday night, and I allowed her - I went up stairs directly I had given her leave, I followed her up; I opened her bed-room door, and she then had a small red box in her hand; I had not searched any thing at that time, and when I did search, I forgot the red box in my hurry; I searched the red box before she left the house, and found in it a duplicate of a pillow, a pillow case, and blanket - I afterwards went to the pawnbroker's, and saw the things, and the pillow case I knew directly; it had no mark on it, but I had made it myself, and know it by my own work; I have since missed a pillow, and don't doubt but that belongs to me; Mahony was not in the room when I found the red box containing the duplicate - the duplicate was found in Mahony's box, but we found it had been pawned by M'Carthy, and Mahony acknowledged sending her to pawn it - I do not recollect telling her it would be better to tell about it; when I found the duplicate, I locked her box again, and went down stairs, and went to the pawnbroker's - I knew the articles; I came back and put the ticket into the box again - I then sent Mahony to the West End of the Town, and sent an officer with M'Carthy to the pawnbroker's, who identified her; when Mahony returned the officer produced the duplicate, and she said it was her - the things were pawned in the name of M'Carthy; the three articles were all in one duplicate - we had both the prisoners taken up.</p>

            . I manage the business of Mr. Robert England, a pawnbroker near the Town-hall, Borough. I have a pillow, and case, and blanket, which were all pawned at one time by the prisoner M'Carthy in her own name, on the 9th of April, towards the evening; I took them in myself - we have a customer of that name in Fishmonger-alley, who she was acquainted with, and I put that address to it; she only asked 1s. on them, saying she wished to take care of them, which Irish people often do when they don't want money - I am quite certain of her person - Mrs. Austin saw the articles about a month after, and brought a pillow-case which matched the one we had.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoners; I took M'Carthy over to the pawnbroker, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160036"></xptr>said she was the woman who pawned them; I took her to the watch-house, then staid at the prosecutor's till Mahony came in; and in the red box I found the duplicate of the articles - Mahony acknowledged that she had given them to M'Carthy, who had pawned them; and M'Carthy said she had pawned them, and they were her master's property; she at first said they belonged to a relation in Fishmonger-alley - she said, "Master, it was yours, but Elizabeth gave them to me" - nothing was said to induce her to say so.</p>
               <p>M'Carthy's Defence. She brought them down to me in the passage, and asked me to pawn them for 1s.; I did not know what they were, and pawned them in my own name, and gave her the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Mahony's Defence. I was short of money, and did not wish to trouble my mistress till I had a settlement with her, so I gave M'Carthy these to pawn, intending to get them out before I left the house.</p>
               <p>MRS. AUSTIN. They had not applied to me for wages - I had a good character with them both - I have lost a great many things for the last two years, but never suspected them.</p>

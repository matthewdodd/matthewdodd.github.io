             is my trustee; I let the prisoner a lodging in a lower room by the week, with goods in it; I missed the things in the indictment, I went there a fortnight after, about the 7th or 8th of May for rent, and I looked about and missed the things; I asked him about them, and he said, he would get them in again in a week or ten days; he said, his wife had pawned them, and he promised to give me some rent in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him, if he would get the things again you would not prosecute him? - Yes, but that was after he said he pawned the things, it was when the constable was there, he locked up the door, and went off afterwards; my first husband bought the furniture.</p>

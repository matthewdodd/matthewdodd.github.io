                  </hi>. I am a lead merchant, and live at No. 97, St. George's-row, Southwark. On Saturday, the 24th of Dec, I left my house, about a qaarter before nine o'clock, leaving no one in it—I double-locked the street-door, and fastened the windows all perfectly safe—I returned about a quarter past nine, with my wife—I found the door on the single lock, but still shut and fastened—I went in, and found the kitchen-door open, and a quantity of lucifer matches lying about—in my bed-room I found a plate-drawer had been opened, and missed the articles stated—the trowsers now produced were in the drawer of a bureau—I went with Lupton to a house in Lock's-fields, and there found a large bundle, containing these trowsers, breeches, and waistcoat, which are mine—I saw three children in bed there.</p>

The prisoner occupied the front room up stairs at the time of the robbery—he had three children—on Christmas eve I saw the prisoner go out at two o'clock in the day—I went out at eight, and did not return again till near twelve—the three Guildays were then in charge—they lived on the ground floor.</p>

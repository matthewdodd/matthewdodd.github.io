                  </hi>. I live at 32, Silver-street, Golden-square, and am a messenger at Verrey's, in Regent-street—the prisoner is my wife; we have been married eight years—we have lived a very uncomfortable life for the last three years—on Sun day-week last, about half-past 1 at night, I came home and found Mr. Byrne at the street door—he let me in, and I went up-stairs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090038"></xptr>
               <p>—I was liquor at the time—on my opening the door, I saw my wife on the bed in the room—there was no light in the room—there is a gas-lamp outside which reflects into the room—when I entered, my wife said, "You wretch! you have come home at a pretty time, past four o'clock in the morning—I said, "No, Mary, it is not so late as that; it is very little after one"—she then struck me on the side of the head, and I fell on the bed—I was close to the bed—I then rose again, and received another blow in the face—I placed ray hand to my face, and found blood streaming down, and called out for help—Mr. Byrne came up with a candle in his hand—I said, "For God's sake! Mr. Byrne, take me off to the hospital; my wife had stabbed me in the head"—she was behind me when I said this—the blow on the side of the head was struck with the hand, I think—I do not know what the other was struck with; the blood flowed out directly Afterwards—it seemed to me a very sharp blow at the moment—I was taken to Charing-Cross Hospital—this knife is one similar to those we use at home.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">BYRNE</hi>. I live at 32, Silver-street, and am a boot-closer—the prisoner and her husband lived in the same house—about half-past one on Sunday, 1st May, the prosecutor came home; he had been drinking—he went upstairs, and about two minutes after I heard a noise as though there was a struggle in the room—I opened my door, and listened—I heard Mr. Poacher call out, "Help!" "Police! I am stabbed!"—I went up with a light—I saw him standing by his room door in a stooping posture, with his hand to the head, and bleeding profusely from the face—he said, "Mr. Byrne, for God's sake! take me to the hospital, I am bleeding to death; my wife has stabbed me three times in the head"—his wife was close by; she did not say a word—I called the police to the door, and she was given into custody—near the place where she was, I found this knife, on the floor of the room where she was standing—she afterwards said at the station, "Mr. Byrne, what you say is true, but to-morrow will show how I have been used."</p>

I was called in to 32, Silver-street, on Sunday, 1st'May—I found the prosecutor there, bleeding; and I also found the prisoner—I took her into custody—she told me, while taking her to the station, that she was very sorry she had not done for him at once—the prosecutor was not exactly drunk, but he had been drinking; the prisoner was quite sober—I took him to Charing-Cross Hospital—I saw the Knife on the floor, and saw Mr. Byrne pick it up—there were three spots of blood on the blade, and one on the handle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-Cross Hospital—I attended to the prosecutor when he came in on 1st May—he had one wound on his head, just beneath the eyebrow—there was a good deal of hemorrhage from the wound—the cause of bleeding was that it had cut a blood-vessel—I think this knife would produce a wound of that description—it was a jagged wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). My husband came home about a quarter to one, drunk—I asked him where he had been—he made use of a very bad expression, and that led to quarreling on both sides—I was rather the worse</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090039"></xptr>
               <p>through drink at the time—I was lying on the bed when he came home—when he abused me, I got up—I went to the table to get a candle to light it, and he struck me with his fist—there was a knife on the table, and I took it in defence, not intending to use it to do him harm—he went to get the knife from me, and we both fell, and it accidentally cut him, which I was not aware of till he cried out "I am stabbed!"—he called "Police!" a lodger came in and fetched the police—we have lived very unhappily through his ill-usage—he has turned me out of his room, and I have had to sleep on the stairs many timed—he has been under medical treatment for the disease he ought to have been ashamed of.</p>

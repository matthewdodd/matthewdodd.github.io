                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and lodge in the same house at the prosecutor—he is a general salesman. On the 28th of March, I was at work in the kitchen, at No. 16, Charlton-street—these shoes were placed between half a dozen decanters and twenty-four flat irons, at the door—I saw Stone, with another person, come across the area railing—I watched, and saw Stone take a pair of shoes from the door—I came up stain—I saw him drop them from under his arm when Mr. Bluett cried out, "Put them down," and he run off—I pursued, and a gentleman stopped him—I said, "You are the person that took the shoes"—he said, "I am not"—I said, "You are"—he said, "If you take me, we will have a fight for it"—I collared him the tighter, and when he came to a turning, he said, "Here is where I live," and down he ran—I went and gave information to the officer—he was taken, but he had changed his dress—I knew him before, as I had seen him about.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 41, Arbour-street, New Kent-road. On Monday morning, the 31st of Aug., about ten minutes after two o'clock, I was going along High-street, Southwark, near Falcon-court, with the witness Cook—we were overtaken by four or five persons, who attacked me without any cause whatever—they began by jostling against me—one of them, not in custody, struck me a blow on the cheek with hit fist, and knocked me down—it did not make any bruise—I got up, and the prisoner Evans seized roe again—he sparred up at me with his fist, and struck me on the jugular vein, under the ear, and knocked me down—I caught hold of him, aod he fell on me—then there was a cry that "the <hi rend="italic">crushers"</hi> were coming, meaning the policemen, I believe—I did not see where Cook was at that time—I caught hold of Evans while I was falling, and he fell on me—some person then attempted to kick me, but kicked over me—I got up, and found my waistcoat open, and my watch hanging by the guard—it had been inside my fob—I am not prepared to swear it was dragged out of my pocket, because I do not recollect feeling it come out—it is rather a deep pocket—I cannot say it might not have come out in the fall—it was quite safe before I was struck—I was rather fresh—I have no recollection of giving them any provocation—I knew Evans by sight before-when I got up they ran off—I saw no more of Evans till after we passed the Mint—Stand ley was then in custody—I turned round, and saw Evans walking behind—I seized him and gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>was watering—I think that was from its being struck—when I got to the station I believe I did not make any charge of robbery, as I did not wish to prese anything of the kind—no charge was made against me—Evans charged Mann with assaulting him—Mann was brought up at the police—court next morning, and charged with assault—Evans appeared as a witness against him—on reconsidering the thing I made a charge of felony—the case was explained to the Magistrate, and Evans was put into the dock, and Mann made a witness—policeman No. 112 did not tell me, if there was a charge of felony, I should get expences, but if it was an assault I should get none at all—he said nothing of the kind—he said nothing about expences, not a word—Mann was a stranger to me—I cannot say that I charged him with felony—I had not been drinking the greater part of the night—I began after twelve.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST.</hi>. I was in High—street, in the Borough, with Pitt—four or five persons overtook us and began pushing and jostling us about—I was knocked down by a blow from one of them—I got up, and was knocked down a second time—I then saw the prisoner Evans rush across the road—he kicked me in the mouth—I saw Evans and Pitt struggling together on the ground—I saw Pitt's waistcoat unbuttoned and his watch out of his pocket, hanging in front of his person by the guard—I heard a cry of "<hi rend="italic">Crushers"</hi> and they ran away—I saw Mann take Standley in custody—he was engaged in this affair.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Brixton. On the 31st of Aug., about two o'clock in the morning, I was in High-street, in the Borough, and saw some men and women standing together—I went up and saw the prisoners fencing with Pitt and Cook, who I consider were retreating—the prisoners wew facing with pitt and cook who I consider were retreating—the prisoners were facing them—I then saw a collision, and pitt and cook them—I Cook were knocked down—there was a cry that the policemen were coming—Standley ran away, and I followed him down Fountain—court—he fell down—I <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him and held him till the policeman came and took him as we went along High—street—Evans was there—Pitt had got up with his watch hanging by the chain out—side his fob—Evans came up, and Pitt said, "You are one of the thieves who tried to steal my watch," and <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him, and then I <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him—the policeman came up and took him—when I got to the station Evans charged me with striking him—I had done nothing but endeavoured to secure him.</p>

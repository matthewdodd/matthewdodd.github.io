               <p>Was the door left open? - No, it was missed a quarter before ten in the evening; the reason for charging the prisoner is, I sent a servant to fetch a coach to take us home; the coach came before we had finished our supper; it was a very cold, disagreeable night, and my friend was so hospitable he requested the coachman to come in and have a glass of spirits, to refresh him; when we had finished our supper, we called for our great coats; all were there but mine, it could not be found; they said nobody had been there but the coachman; so I took two of my friends with me, and the constable, and the patrol, and examined the coach, and found it in the hind seat of the coach; it is my coat.</p>
               <p>Where did you find it? - In the seat of the coach; there is a box under the seat.</p>
               <p>How many other coats might there be there? - I think there were three or four more hanging on the same range.</p>
               <p>Who went for the coach? - A servant of mine, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Were there any questions asked about the coat before you began to search? - We looked all over the house for it.</p>
               <p>Were there any questions asked of the coachman? - No, we asked him no questions, but we looked in the coach, and there we found it; my servant that called the coach was sent home again, he knew nothing of this matter; he came back again with the coach, but he went off directly again; that was about half an hour before we had finished our supper.</p>
               <p>Should you have put on that great coat? - Most certainly; it was a very cold disagreeable night, and wetted very much.</p>
               <p>Do you usually wear your great coat of an evening? - Yes, I always wear it.</p>
               <p>How long has that servant lived with you? - Four years.</p>
               <p>I want to find out, if I can, whether there is any probability, that your servant might have taken your coat, and put it in the coach? - There was nothing of that to be thought of, for he went away before the coat was missed; this is the coat, it is my property.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have very little to say, I was quite dead asleep, I had been up all the night before, and that day, I know nothing of the coat; if there was a coat in my coach, I know nothing of it; whether the servant conveyed it in the coach, or how, I saw nothing of it till the next day, that the gentleman came and said that it was his coat.</p>
               <p>JAMES MACSALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the house about ten o'clock; Mr. Thompson's servant came with a coach to take his family; not having done supper, he said the coach must wait; they said it was very cold, and thought it was right to give the coachman a glass of something; he was called to know what he would have, and the gentleman of the house gave him a glass of brandy; when Mr. Thompson was going home, he looked for his great coat, and could not find it; he could not recollect any person had been in but the prisoner, and I went with him to examine the coach, and found the coat in the hind seat of the coach.</p>
               <p>Court. It would have been a satisfaction to the Jury, to have been told by the servant that he did not put it into the coach.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant LE BLANC sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known this man, I believe, twenty years; during that time I always understood him to bear a very good character; he lived, I believe eighteen years, or very near that time, as coachman to Mrs. Le Blanc, an old lady, an aunt of mine, where I was very often during the last part of her life; on her job horses being sent away, he went away; he left her in the course of the year 1784; since that I have frequently seen the man, he has been at my chambers, and I always understood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090090"></xptr>him to bear a good character, and I believe his master thought so of him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five more witnesses who had known him many years, and gave him a very good character.</p>

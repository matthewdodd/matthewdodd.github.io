               <p>James Lawson thus depos'd. On the 18th of December I was going along Cornhill between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock at Night, and the Prisoner desired me to go and drink with her; so we went to the <placeName id="t17270113-11-crimeloc58">Salutation Alehouse in Bell-Yard</placeName>

             the Constable thus depos'd. Between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock the Man of the House sent for me from the Watch-house in Bishopsgate-street, and when I came there I saw the Prisoner in Liquor, but she denied she had the Money, and asked me to search her, but I told her I had not Impudence enough to search her; however, afterwards she desired me to go up Stairs with her, and then she shewed me the Money, and said that she would give me Half a Guinea to make it up with the Prosecutor: I asked the Prisoner how she came by that Money, the Prisoner told me she Cribb'd it; I took the Money from the Prisoner and have it here.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. I was going along Cornhill, near the Royal-Exchange, and the Prosecutor asked me to go and drink with him, I denied him at first, but afterwards went along with him to this Alehouse; I own I am an unfortunate Woman, and live by keeping Company, but never wronged Man, Woman or Child in my Life, but only what Gentlemen please to give me (and what can be freer than Gift?) and when the Constable came I offered to be searched, and told him if I had such Money about me it was the Prosecutor's, and that he must give it me among some Half-pence which he gave me to buy a Bunch of Rods, for we were both drunk, and I did not mind what he gave me. I asked him what I was to do with the Rods, and he said he wanted to be Flogg'd, but the Man of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172701130003"></xptr> the House said he would not suffer any such doings in his House, and then the Prosecutor sent for a Constable, who carried us both to the computer.

Bank of England note—I had not change, and I sent my niece, Ellen Cannon, to get it—she brought the note back, and said, "Aunt, you must put your name on the note," and I asked the prisoner to write my name on the note, and he was going to place his own name on it, but he said, "Oh! I have just been over to Mr. Godfrey's; I had better put your name on it"—my niece then took the note and brought the change—I can read and write—it was between the lights, and I could not very well see to put my name, so I asked the prisoner to put it—I was willing that my name should be put—this is the note, and this is my name, P. Talboys, that I asked him to write—I was standing by when it was done—the prisoner used to frequent my house, both before and after this, for breakfast and a night's lodging, and so on—it must have been five or six weeks ago that be brought the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I can't tell the time particularly—it might have been two months ago—I know it was some time back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Messrs. Morris and Oaks, of Leadenhall-market, carcase butchers—their slaughter-house is in Gun-yard, Bishopsgate—you approach it by outer gates—I locked the yard gates on Thursday evening, 1st December, about half-past 7, leaving several carcases in the slaughter-house, of beasts which had been killed that day—there was also a horse and cart there—I returned next morning about half-past 5, found the gates open, and four sides of beef and the horse and curt gone—the locks of the gates were not broken or damaged—I immediately gave information to Mr. Oaks—the prisoner was in his employ two or three months ago—I do not know how long—he used to come to the slaughter-house to kill.</p>

On 30th November, I went to the slaughter house—I assist in slaying and dressing the beasts—there were accidental marks by means of which I can identify them—Fuller came to me on this morning and I went to Newgate Market, and received information at Mr. Cockerell's shop—I saw the meat there, divided into eight quarters—I identified it, and then went to the police-station—my cart had "Warrington &amp; Morris" written on it—the prisoner was in my service several months—he has left several months—He was a slaughter-man—his business led him to the slaughter-house, and he knew the premises—he had sometimes to drive the horse and cart—we keep three horses—the right harness was put on this horse.</p>

I am a butcher in Mr. Nicholson's employment—on Friday morning, 2d December, I assisted in moving some quarters of beef from a cart which was standing in Warwick-lane—a young man named Moffling desired me to do so—Mr. Nicholson was in the shop at the time—there was a short man in the cart and a taller man at the tail of the cart—the prisoner is the man who was at the tail of the cart—I am quite sure of him—I took the beef to my master's shop, and it was fetched from there to Mr. Cockerell's—I took no notice of the cart, to see if there was any name on it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not this what they Call the foggy morning of the month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was a nice clear Morning—the gas was burning—I appeared before the Lord Mayor last Friday, when another person was charged with this matter; He was discharged—I could not swear to him—I saw the prisoner in custody on the Monday following—I had never seen him before 2d December—I was sitting on Mr. Perry's board, within four or five yards of Warwick-lane, drinking my coffee, which I always have brought there, and I saw the cart drawn down the lane, and Moffling go and take some beef half out of it—there was no other person in the cart—I have myself been convicted of stealing meat.</p>

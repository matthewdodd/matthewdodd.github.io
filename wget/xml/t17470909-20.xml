               <p>Q. Do you know of any Money Mr Grafton gave you to put into the Till ?</p>
               <p>Boon. He gave me thirteen Shillings; three Half Crowns, four Shillings, and three Six pences.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Marks upon these Pieces?</p>
               <p>Boon. Yes, my Lord; about seven o'Clock I laid them in the Drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Reason of your putting in mark'd Money?</p>
               <p>Boon. Because we had a Suspicion that the Man had taken Money out of the Drawer. I told my Master of it, and we mark'd some Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put all this Money into the Till ?</p>
               <p>Boon. All, my Lord. I saw his Hand in the Drawer about a Quarter of an Hour after I laid it in. I was concealed in the Shop.</p>

               <p>Boon. No, my Lord; there is three in the Shop to serve besides, therefore he has no Business at all at the Drawer. The Candle was on the Counter, and the Till is so placed that I could see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he search'd upon this?</p>

               <p>Boon. He was search'd between the Hours of seven and eight.</p>

               <p>Daniel Demee. I am a Neighbour of Mr Grafton's. I was at the Coffee-house on Wednesday, between seven and eight o'Clock, and Mr Grafton was giving me an Account of the Affair that happen'd between him and his Servant, who had robb'd him several Times. As he was giving me this Account his Apprentice came in, and told him, he had caught the Porter taking Money out of the Till. There was a Constable planted to charge him if he was guilty. The Man clapt his Hand into his Pocket, and did not bring it out so quickly; so I desired him to slip his Breeches off; accordingly the Man happen'd to give me his Breeches, and I took the 2 s. out of his Pocket, which was marked P.</p>
               <p>(The 2 s. were produc'd in Court.)</p>
               <p>Upon that his Box was examin'd, which was above Stairs, and in that Box was found a Taylor's Bill of 13 l. He confess'd he had taken Money several Times out of his Master's Till; and in all upwards of 11 l.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is all done out of Spight.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Witnesses ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I liv'd with a Distiller in Drury-lane, but I could not send to him. They took away all my Money.</p>

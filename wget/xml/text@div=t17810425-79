             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a smith, in Crown-alley, Moorfields. On Good-Friday, the two prisoners brought iron bars to me, above a ton weight, and wanted me to buy it. I stopped it, as I had a suspicion it was not honestly come by, as they asked under a market-price; they asked about 11 l. a ton; then they said they would take 10 l. I look upon it to be worth about 15 l. We inquired after the owner, and Mr. Finnemore said it was his master's property, he knew it by his mark. They said it belonged to a man that they were to meet at the sign of the Ship in Frying pan-alley, Tooley-street.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Jones, a wharfinger, at Allhallows, Thames-street. I went down to the wharf, at the Steel-yard, on Saturday morning, the 14th of this month. I was told there was some iron stolen out of the barge, and that these men were taken up on suspicion. I went to Mr. Leaverett's house; there I saw all the marks upon the iron, the same that was stolen out of the barge; there was none marked in that way but what was Mr. Thornton's property.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a broker and wharsinger. As soon as I came to town, I went and examined the iron. I saw it was the same sort we had lost: it is a particular sort that comes from that country, of that mark. All that had been stolen was found at Mr. Leaverett's; there were forty-three bars.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you inquire about this man in Frying-pan-alley? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Was no part of the iron delivered? - No; we were landing of it: part of it was landed.</p>

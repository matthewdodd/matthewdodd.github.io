I keep the "Hong Kong" Tavern, St. Ann's Place, Commercial Road—On Saturday night, 16th June, I went to bed, locking up my house at about half-past twelve—to the best of my belief the whole of the house in the front was then closed—I was disturbed about three o'clock in the morning by a policeman, and came downstairs—I lit a candle and saw a policeman in possession of the shop—I examined my premises, and missed 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes, a coat, and other articles—I have never seen any of them since—I keep a musical instrument in my house—I had seen the prisoner about three o'clock on the afternoon of this Satur<lb></lb>day—I had not seen him before—he came to me and asked me to go up in the concert-room and hear him play—I went up with him and left him playing there—I went down to attend to my business—I didn't see him leave the place.</p>

                  </hi> (680 A). I was on duty at three o'clock on Sunday morning, 17th June, opposite the prosecutor's beer-shop—my atten<lb></lb>tion was drawn to a noise there—I crossed over the road, and saw the front door open about four or five inches—I heard a smashing of glass—I went into the road and beckoned to a man. who was there, and he fetched two constables—I planted three men at the back and two in front, one at the western door, and one at the corner of the street—I then went in at the same door I had seen open—I went downstairs and saw the back door</p>

               <p>open into the yard—I then went to the cellar—on the way to the cellar I heard a cry outside of "Stop him! stop him!" and turned round to go up-stairs again—on going upstairs I saw prisoner rush from the other part of the house, down the stairs, and out at the same door I had entered by, slamming the door after him—I opened the door, and saw one of the policemen had fallen down in the road—I went in again, and called the landlord and land-lady—of course I lost prisoner then—I took him into custody on the fol<lb></lb>lowing Tuesday afternoon—I went to the "Hong Kong" to make some inquiries, and there found him at the bar—I recognised him directly—there was a dozen or twenty people in front of the bar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many constables were there after this burglar altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five—I was two or three minutes in the cellar—I went to see if anybody was concealed in the premises—finding the back door open, I went to the cellar—the cellar being very dark, I thought it the most likely place for a man to go who went into the house—I was at the bottom of the stairs—the prisoner rushed out of the passage—I got a very good glimpse of him—he turned round, with his face towards me, as he was opening the door—it was broad daylight—his back was towards me during the time he was running—he did not pass me—I was behind him when he opened the door and turned round—I can't say why he turned round—he was opening the door—the door was closed—he could not see me, but I could see him—the house is situated in a very peculiar way—there are two front doors, one east and one west—there is a long passage exactly opposite the western door, leading up to the staircase—at the bottom of that staircase, and at the end of the passage, there are half a dozen steps down to the cellar—I was at the bottom of those steps when I saw prisoner—he was about twelve feet above me—he might have seen me if he had looked for me—I don't think he knew I was there—I was in the dark more than he was—I have not been reported to the commissioners—the other constables have been reported for letting this man escape—the one who slipped down was reported—he is here—the man was dressed in dark clothes, dark trowsers—not those trowsers he has on—I didn't say the reason I took prisoner to the police-court was because he looked so hard at me—I never said anything about looking at me—I gave as a reason for recog<lb></lb>nising him, that I had seen him before—I know he is the man—I had seen him about the east end of London before—I didn't know his name, or what he was—I didn't know he was a musician—the man was described in our information—I told the inspector I knew him before, and that he wore dark trowsers.</p>

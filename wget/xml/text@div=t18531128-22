Mr. Joshua Proctor Brown Wested is one of the firm, and there are two others—Shoolbred and Co. were indebted to us in these two sums of money—the prisoner was a sort of junior clerk and town traveller to us—it was his duty to do the rough work in the counting house, and to take orders and collect accounts—if he collected any accounts, it was his duty to account to our cashier at Little Knight Rider-street, or to my brother, at Walworth, where our factory is.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 437). On 31st Oct. I took the prisoner, at a refreshment room at Ramsgate, with a young woman, about seventeen years of age, named Dimsdale. I said I was an officer, and had come to take them both into custody—I said to the prisoner, I suppose you know what the charge is against you; it is for embezzling a sum of money which you have taken from Shoolbred's, the property of your master, Mr. Bates"—he made no answer; but the female said, Who, and what is Mr. Bates? I know nothing about it"—I said, From circumstances which have come to my knowledge, it is my duty to take you in custody also for receiving the same, knowing it to be stolen"—I asked them if they had any property—the prisoner said he had none; the female said the property she had belonged to her—the prisoner then said, Will you allow me to speak to her?"—I said, Certainly; you can speak to her in my presence"—I allowed them to speak privately, but I was in the same room—the female</p>

               <p>then took out a purse, gave me twelve sovereigns, and said that was all she had—I sent for a fly to go to the railway; as we were going to enter it, the prisoner was going to speak, and I said that anything he might say would be used in evidence against him—as we were coming up in a railway carriage, he said, "What is the extreme sentence they can give me by law for this offence?"—I said, "You may be transported; but you are not found guilty yet"—he said, "But I am guilty; I took the money, and I don't mean to deny it; the female prisoner does not know anything about it; she does not know how I got the money, or how I came by it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Allen, of the Two Brewers, High-street, Wandsworth. On the 21st of Nov. the prisoner came to the bar of my house, and asked for a bed—I lighted him up to bed—he told me he must go in the morning at seven o'clock, on his road to Kingston—there was one</p>

               <p>blanket and two sheets on the bed—it was a single-bedded room—at five the next morning I heard some one feeling in the passage, and my husband went to him—it was the prisoner—he said he wanted to go on his road—I said "This is not seven o'clock"—we called our labourer to let him out—he went out at the back gate—I went into the room just after nine—I missed a sheet off the bed he slept in, and a blanket from the next room—both beds were disturbed, and so was the room below, and a gown and waistcoat which had been below, taken up into the bed-room—I did not see him again till the 30th, when he called again, with his hat over his eyes, and asked for a bed again, in a very hurried manner, as if he had mistaken the house—I knew his voice the moment he spoke, but I could not see his face—I told my husband, he went and fetched him back—I then looked at him more particularly—I am quite certain he is the man—he said he had never been to the house before, or put his foot over Vauxhall-bridge—there were only our regular lodgers slept in the house.</p>

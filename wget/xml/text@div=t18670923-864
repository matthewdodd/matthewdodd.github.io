                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Webster, of 7, Suther<lb></lb>land Place, Pimlico—on 16th August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was at the door and saw the prisoner with a fish barrow—I bought some eels of him, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him a florin with a hole in it—he said that he had no change, but would call again in a quarter of an hour for the money—he went to No. 12 opposite—I laid down the florin and then saw that it was not mine—my fingers became black with it, and I found it was bad—I went over to No. 12 and accused him—he said that he had no other florin about him—I held the florin out to show him, and he took it out of my hand, pulled a handful of silver out of his pocket and gave me a shilling—I said, "You vagabond, you have been passing bad</p>

               <p>money; how came you to say you had no change?"—he went away and I went indoors, and afterwards a policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live with my parents in Rochdale Rpw—I have known the prisoner three years—on 16th August I was with a boy named Croxon in Sutherland Terrace between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock, going towards Ebury Bridge, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner run from Sutherland Street into Sutherland Terrace with his coat and waistcoat off—he had not got his barrow—he put his hand in his pocket and put something down a grating opposite Mr. Pearce's coffee shop—it was like silver, like a half-crown with some sand on it—I heard it drop on the sink from his hand—it jingled like silver—he then ran back the way he came—I was about six yards from the grating—I went to it, and tried to fish up what he had dropped, but could not reach—Mr. Pearce got a pair of tongs and pulled up two half-crowns and two florins—I saw some silver sand about, such as fish-dealers carry with them—I went and looked for the prisoner—Mr. Pearce came round the corner, and when he saw him he ran away from me towards Clarendon Street—I saw no one pass the grating between the time he dropped it and the time we picked it up—there was only one man in the street, standing near the public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often were you before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twice—I stated the first time that I saw something like silver down the grating—the investigation did not take place on the day the money was passed—I am quite sure I told the Magistrate right—Mr. Smith cross-examined me—the prisoner was remanded—on the second occasion I said, "I told the Magistrate on the first examination that I did not see what was put down the sink hole"—I did say on the first examination that I saw something the size of a florin drop from his hand, and on the second ex<lb></lb>amination I said the same—I saw something white—I told the Magistrate I did not think it was money—it looked like silver—I never saw fish scales as large as a half-crown.</p>

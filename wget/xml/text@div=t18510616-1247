                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Lans<lb></lb>dell, in Holborn. The prisoner was assistant in the shop, the same as myself—on 14th May, I and the prisoner were at the shop-door—a person came to purchase a waistcoat, the prisoner waited on him—I heard the money put on the counter—the waistcoat was bought—I was lighting the gas—I saw the prisoner put it in paper, and take the money for it—I heard the man say, "Is 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the lowest?"—it was his duty to take the ticket off the garment, write on the back of it the price he got for it, and put that and the money in the till—after this the prisoner said he had to see a friend at the comer of the Row, and he should be in in a few minutes—he went out, and I went to the till—there was neither the ticket of the waistcoat nor the money in the till—I told my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the shop at 327, High Holborn. Carney and the prisoner were my shopmen—it was his duty to receive money for me—he was to take the ticket off the article, and put it with the money in the till; and if there was no ticket on the article, he was to write on a piece of paper, and put it in the till—he had only been in my service from 12th May—on the 14th, from what Carney said to me, I followed the prisoner, and desired him to come back; I asked him why he left the shop without per<lb></lb>mission—he said he was merely gone to get a glass of ale—I said it was rather singular to go to get a glass of ale when he knew his supper was just ready—he went up-stairs with me, and I asked him if he had sold a garment; describing it—he said he had, and had received the money, and placed it in the till with the ticket—I told Carney to go and bring the till with the tickets in it—I counted them, and the money in it corresponded with the</p>

               <p>tickets in it to a halfpenny—I have not the tickets here—there were tickets for three or four waistcoats, but not one of that amount—I gave the prisoner in charge—I went with him to Bow-street; on my return I looked for the ticket in the shop, it was not there—I went to the end of the Row, where the prisoner said he had been to get a glass of ale, and picked up three or four pieces of the ticket of the waistcoat—the policeman picked up the remainder—these pieces together make up the ticket—it has my mark on it—here is the prisoner's writing on the back of it, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as having sold it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I took the prisoner—I found on him one half-crown, four shillings, one sixpence, and fourpence—he said, "I am as innocent as you are"—on the way he said he had a half-sovereign, and he went to get change, and he had occasion to pay a half-crown—I went with the prosecutor to a public-house in Holborn-bars—I saw him pick up three pieces of a ticket, and I picked up the remainder of the pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. I know the prisoner—on 14th May I had to go into the City; on returning, I met the prisoner—I lent him a half-sovereign, on promise of his paying me the first payment be received—this was about 8 o'clock, or a little after—he went into a public-house—he said it would be very much serving him to lend it him, and I did—by what I have heard he had a very respectable character—I have not seen him lately.</p>

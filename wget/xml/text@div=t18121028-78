            . I am the daughter of the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner going out, I said you have got a sheet, sir. I laid down my work, and pulled a piece of the sheet from his coat; he knocked me down, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am unfortunately blind. On the 24th of September, I had some business to transact at the west<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280065"></xptr> end of the town, and in the course of the day, I took a little more liquor than did me good. A lad told me he would conduct me home, instead of that, it turned out to he a house of ill same. Shortly after I was there, he hurried me out of the house; and as soon as he saw somebody coming after us, he ran away, he put the sheet into my pocket. I was taken and committed. I have fought the battles of my country. I was wounded at Egypt.</p>

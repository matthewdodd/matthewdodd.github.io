               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. What is the value of these three silk gowns: - When she took them from me, I valued them at three guineas.</p>
               <p>Court. Why the pawnbroker says one of them was not worth much more than 5 s. And five yards of flannel there was that was found.</p>
               <p>Court. You seem very eager to have this prisoner capitally convicted, which you need not, there is no reward in this case: Can you swear to flannel? - Yes, my Lord, I can produce more of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any private mark on it that you know it by? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any promise made at the time when she told you where things were? - No, my Lord, none at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the subject matter of your consideration, is the three gowns, one of them is pawned for 5 s. There is no doubt at all about the guilt of this woman as a servant, she certainly betrayed her confidence: This indictment is is laid for stealing goods in a dwelling-house above the value of 40 s. Here are only three gowns proved; one of which was pawned for 5 s. and the pawnbroker says it was not worth much more; therefore I think you may reduce the value to 39 s.</p>

             sworn. - Mr. Hemingway did live near the Hermittage-bridge, Wapping, he kept a shoemaker's-shop; I cannot tell, rightly, when it was, it was about six months ago, as near as I can recollect; I went out with Johnson, Powell, and Harper, about eight o'clock; Johnson took a penny-piece and broke the window; then Powell took out several pair of shoes, and put them into Johnson's apron as quick as he could, and brought them to Mrs. Levy.</p>

               <p>Q.What is she? - A. I do not know what trade she is, but by buying these sort of goods; we sold them for a guinea and a half; there were eleven pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take only eleven pair? - A. No more; I did not go in, I stopped at the door to look out; the other three went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the shoes counted? - A. Yes; eleven pair and an odd one, they told me; they sold them to Mrs. Levy for half-a-crown a pair.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Did you ever see the two prisoners? - A. Never before the 12th of December, they came to my house about eight o'clock at night; at that time I dealt in the Change, in clothes, and other things; there were three of them, Johnson had eleven pair of shoes in his lap; I asked him what he had there; he said he had eleven pair of shoes; he asked me a guinea and a half for them, and I gave him a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they worth a guinea and a half? - A. They were boy's shoes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they worth a guinea and a half? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not more? - A. I cannot say, rightly; they might be worth three shillings a pair; I kept two pair out for my husband to wear; I sold nine pair, I cannot tell to whom; I sold them in the Change for three shillings a pair.</p>
               <p>Q. And no more? - A. No more.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoners before? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.How do you know they are the same boys? - A. I know the little one by the carroty head; I am positive they are the same, (produces one pair); the other pair is quite worn out.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoners, in company with Cook, Brown, and Holebrook, on Thursday the 8th of May; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Hemingway. These are my shoes, they were made for a person in Westminster, but they were too small, and I intended to wear them myself; I can swear to them by the cut of them, I cut them myself; and by the binding; if it had been some of the other shoes I could not have sworn to them, because they came out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not in the habit of cutting other shoes? - A. The shoes that I cut myself are bespoke shoes.</p>
               <p>How many had you cut in the course of the preceding week? - A. I might have cut twenty, perhaps; sometimes two or three hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that among all the cutters about town, no other man could have cut these shoes? - A. I am positive I cut this pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear that these are shoes that you have not sold to some other customer? - A. I can, I know the cut so well; it is a very remarkable pair; the moment Mrs. Levy shewed me the shoes, I knew them directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you usually put the name of your customers in the shoes? - A. I do not at all times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hammersmith, and am surgeon to the union workhouse—on Friday morning, 14th September, I saw the deceased child in the nursery there between ten and half-past ten o'clock—I could not form a very correct opinion as to its age, because it was in such an emaciated condition—it was a few weeks old—it was in a very filthy condition—I examined it particularly—its head and ears were dirty—it had on a white frock, most filthy, saturated with vomit, and stank—the eyes were sunk in the sockets, the mouth half open, and it was con<lb></lb>tinually moaning—it had a napkin on with some fullers' earth, and the thighs were excoriated, ulcerated—it died on the evening of the 5th Sep<lb></lb>tember, about five o'clock—I had ordered it food at first—I ordered it half milk and half water as far as it could take it—it was too weak to suck or take the bottle, therefore food was given by a spoon—finding it did not rally, I ordered milk and brandy every hour; at the same time I requested a young woman who had been recently confined to suckle it—the child attempted to suck in my presence, but could not—the young woman then milked the milk out of her breast and gave it the child with a spoon—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Monday by order of the coroner—I found no particular difference in its appearance at that time—there were no marks of violence at all—the child weighed 51bs. 14 oz.—a newly-born child in good condition generally weighs between 61bs. and 71bs. when born—this child ought to have weighed from 101bs. to 121bs.—I found the brain perfectly healthy, except that it was pale—there was very little blood in the vessels—I examined the mouth—there was no thrush—the lungs were perfectly healthy, only bloodless—the heart was healthy, and contained a very small quantity of coagulated blood on the right side—I think there was very little blood on the other side—the stomach was small and collapsed—it was perfectly healthy inside—it contained but a very small quantity of what I supposed to be coagu<lb></lb>lated milk, about a spoonful—the intestines and bowels were all collapsed and reduced in size—a portion of the large intestine on the left side was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190086"></xptr>
               <p>distended with wind, and the lower part of the bowel at the end contained a small quantity offical matter—I examined the whole lining of the intestine—it was perfectly healthy—there was not a sign of disease about it—the mesenteric glands were healthy, and the liver, spleen, and kidneys—the skin was not shrivelled—it was not pinched up—when a child dies from want of food that is not necessarily the case, it would depend on the length of time—my conclusion was that the child died of inanition, which means emptiness, want of nutriment circulating of the system—I came to that conclusion because I found no internal disease whatever to account for death—it died because it had not been fed—if a child is too weak to draw milk it could have food administered to it—that was what was done at the workhouse—we attempted to make it swallow, but it did not—it was too weak to make any effort on its own part to swallow anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had not sufficient milk to give the child, but I fed it well, and gave it food of a night—it was very ill with diarrhoea, and I took it to Dr. Spurgeon when it was about five weeks old—he was out of town, but a gentleman saw it and advised me to change the food, which I did, and gave it flour, arrowroot, and milk, but it was then very bad and continually fretting, and nothing came from it but blood and matter—Dr. Spurgeon afterwards saw the child, and he ordered me to give it milk and take beer myself, which I did—I was advised to use fullers' earth to the child, as it was so sore—I fed it as I would a bird, and never left it without food.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hammersmith—I know the the prisoner—she lived at 9, Paradise Cottages, Albion Road, Hammersmith—I believe she is a married woman—I attended her when she was delivered of this child, I believe on the 27th June—it was a nine months' child—she had a very good time—I attended her for the ordinary period, about nine days—I believe she was able to give the child the breast—it was not her first child—she had two or three living at that time—when I ceased to attend her the child was going on well—I believe I saw her husband, but I am not positive—my visits were in the day, and he would not return till night—I next saw the child on the 9th September—the prisoner sent to me and desired me to visit it, and I went to her house—she said the child did not seem to be getting on, and that it was suffering from diarrhoea—I saw that it was in a very emaciated condition, and I directed that it should be continued at the breast, and that it should have beef-tea and some drops of brandy occasionally, and a little arrowroot—I also prescribed some medicine to check the diarrhoea—she got the medicine—I saw the child the next day—it was then somewhat better—I did not not see it again till the 13th, the Thursday—then I examined the prisoner as to the nutriment the child had been receiving, my attention having been directed to that point by the neighbours—she told me she had given it the various things I had directed, arrowroot, beef-tea, and brandy—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190087"></xptr>
               <p>asked her to show me the beef-tea, to convince me it really had had it, and a basin of beef-tea was produced, nearly full, and in a stinking state—she said the child would not take the breast—I said, "Let me see"—she then put the child to the breast, and it sucked—I could not swear that it got milk—I felt it my duty to have the child taken to the union the same day—I cannot say at what time it was taken there—that was the last time I saw it—I could not swear whether the diarrhoea had ceased then—the house was always wretched—I believe I have seen her the worse for liquor—I won't say positively drunk—I believe she was recovering from the effects of liquor when I saw her on the 18th, by her manner; her clothes and the room smelt so offensively of vomit that I was obliged to have the child brought into another room—I believe that was her vomit—she had every aspect of recovering from a drunken bout—drunkenness would have a very bad effect on the milk—it would impoverish the system, and deteriorate the quality as well as the quantity of milk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 9, Paradise Cottages, Albion Road, the same house as the prisoner—I have known her just on three years—I nursed her in her confinement for a fortnight—the child was a nice little baby born, small, but rather fat—it was not ill while I was nursing her—she brought the child down to me one day after that—it was rather cross, but I did not see anything the matter with it—she told me it had diarrhea—it looked clean then—I did not examine it—I saw it take the breast—it did not appear to take it eagerly—it sucked very nicely—I remember the doctor being called in—he asked me to go upstairs with him to see the child—he asked to see the arrowroot and brandy which he had prescribed for it, and I showed him the beef-tea—that was bad, and that was all there was that I saw—it was stinking, and the spoon that was in it was all verdigris—I saw no brandy in the house—I have had the child for one week, and the prisoner brought me one or two pennyworths of brandy for it at that time—that was before it was ill—she was out drin<lb></lb>ing the whole of that week—the husband gave it to me to mind—he asked if I would look after it for him—I gave it arrowroot and brandy, and baked flour and milk—the husband provided the milk every night, or else left the money for it before he went out in the morning—the prisoner would be out four or five hours at a time drinking—she did not remain out the whole week—she came home at night, and sometimes in the course of the day—the child would hardly suckle then—she would go and lay down and go to sleep—she sometimes gave it the breast—she was not sober when she came home—I could not swear how often I have known her be away in that manner and come back in that state, but several times—her husband is a plasterer—I do not know what wages he gets—there are three boys now living at home.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Jones. On the morning of the 21st of December, a young man with me counted the money in the till, and two hours afterwards he counted the money again; there was not money sufficient for what we had taken in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that young man here - A. No. I asked him to look if there was any one pound note with the mark on it; there was not. The notes we could not find in the time. The prisoner,

               <p>Q. Did you see the two pound notes and the one pound notes in the till before - A. I did. When Mr. Jones came home the prisoner was asked whether he had the notes; he said, no; he took some silver out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who took them out of the till, do you - A. No. Afterwards I saw

               <p>Hughes. We charged him with the notes; he denied having them. He then took out two two-pound notes, and said that was all that he had got; Mr. Jones took him up stairs and searched his box; he said you may as well give me the notes and go about your business, are all these the notes that you took: he said, no, there are more in the pocket; they are in this paper. These are the two two-pound notes, I put them in the till that morning, not an hour before they were missed. There is the lady's name on them. They are the two two-pound notes that I took of that lady, here is the one pound note that perhaps had been taken the same morning about three hours previous. They were taken out of the till, and the prisoner gave them out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. to Mr. Jones. Where did you get these notes - A. The prisoner gave them out of his pocket to me, when I missed these notes, I took him up stairs and insisted upon searching his box. I took out all his clothes, I found this pocket-book, it contained five pound odd in silver, I said I was certain he had the notes, he had better give them up; he put his hand in his pocket and gave them out before the other witness; they were loose in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you find upon him - A. Forty-seven pounds. He was my porter, he lived in the house and had twenty guineas a year; he lived with me between thirteen and fourteen months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was the other man that is not here a shopman - A. Yes, he is not here; he is in my service now.</p>
               <p>COURT. What parish is your house in - A. St. Peter's Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partners - A. None, at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop part of your dwelling-house - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Shephard. I know nothing of the robbery, the property was given to me, fifty-two pound in bank notes and five pound in cash.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Dobson, of Hammersmith—the prisoner was his journeyman—on Tuesday morning, the 5th of Dec, at a little after eight o'clock, we found the prisoner and another man who was in our employ intoxicated—I went to the prisoner's bed room, and found a pint of rum in a bottle in a rat-trap, covered with the prisoner's clothes and some sacks—I took it down and showed it to my husband—I went into the cellar where I bad a four gallon cask of rum—it was removed out of its place—I had seen it safe about a fortnight before—the prisoner was given Into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Dobson—on the 4th of Dec. I was making the prisoner's bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and saw an empty bottle on the chimney piece—I moved it, and noticed it particularly—the same afternoon, between four and five o'clock, I saw the prisoner go down stairs with a jug in his hand—he said, "I am going to get a little rum, and do not you say any thing"—he said the door was open and his master was gone out—I saw him go back to his own room with the jug.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bosher's-court, Oxford-street—my father keeps a china and glass shop. On the evening of the 28th of Feb., I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner and two others at Mr. Davies's shop, which is nineteen doors from my father's—the prisoner had hold of a pair of trowsers, which were on a rail inside the door, he pulled them down from the end of the rail outside the door—he saw me, and they all walked away towards Ann-street—I crossed over the road, and watched them—they came opposite Mr. Davies's shop again—one of the men not in custody then had the trowsers, putting them under his coat—I did not see them taken—they had just come away from the door—the prisoner was with the man at the time—they went as far as Ann-street, crossed over the road, down Charles-street, all three together, and there the other one handed them to the pri<lb></lb>soner, who folded them up, and carried them in his hand—they went round the right hand of Soho-square, down Carlisle-street, into Deane-street—the prisoner went down Ann's-court, and the other two lost him—one of them called out "Boo"—he came back, and they all three went through St. Ann's-court together—I followed them, and when they got into Wardour-street, the prisoner went into a pawnbroker's—the other two stood outside, on the curb—the prisoner came out of the shop in five or ten minutes, and they all went into a public-house—I afterwards saw a policeman, told him, and afterwards saw them in Wardour-street, pointed them out to the policeman, and he took the prisoner into custody—the other two ran away.</p>

               <p>they came over towards me, further down the road—they could not see me then, that I know of—people were passing by—there might be people crossing the road—there is a coach-stand there—I saw one of the other two putting something under the flaps of his coat—I did not know what that was—when they turned out of Oxford-street I turned too—I kept two or three houses behind them—they did not go very quick—it was in Charles-street they gave the prisoner the trowsers—I noticed it was cloth—it was dark—I kept fol<lb></lb>lowing them all the way—their backs were to me when the trowsers changed hands—I kept on the same pavement with them—they went down Carlisle-street—I said Frith-street, before the Magistrate, but I made a mistake in the name—the other two were both taller than the prisoner—one had an um<lb></lb>brella, and the other a stick—St. Ann's-court is rather dark—there were people passing through it, I cannot say how many—I had looked out for a policeman all the way from Oxford-street, and did not meet one—there were not two passed me on the road, if there was I did not see them.</p>

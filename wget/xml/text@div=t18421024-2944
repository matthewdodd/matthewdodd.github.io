                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 169.) On the morning of the 4th of October, at ten minutes before six o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the door of No. 168, Regent-street—I asked what she was going to do with the coat which she had on her arm—it was wrapped up in a bundle, and in it was a bottle of wine, some bread and meat, and a silk handker<lb></lb>chief—I took her to the station, and these other things were found on her, also a latch-key, which I found would open the prosecutor's door, and en<lb></lb>abled me to go into the house—I went there, and found the butler drunk in the kitchen.</p>

                  </hi>. I was butler to Mr. Joseph Charles Dawson at this house in Regent-street; it was not his house, we were in furnished lodg<lb></lb>ings. I had been out the previous evening, and got a good deal too much to drink—this coat is mine, and these other things are my master's—I never clapped eyes on the prisoner before.</p>

Q.</hi> Where did she get the latch-key? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should fancy, when she got my coat, she took it out of my pocket—I really can<lb></lb>not say at what time I went home—I suppose I got in by my key; that was the only way I had of opening the door—if I had let her in, and given her these things, I must have had some recollection of it, and I never saw her, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>to go into a fit, but my opinion is it was only a pretence—directly she fell down this blanket became entagled with her legs—it was tied round her with an old apron—these other things were found in her pocket, in my presence—she was drunk.</p>

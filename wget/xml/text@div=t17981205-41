             sworn. - I am a watchman in Oxford-street; I went to the house; they told me there was murder cried; I went up stairs, and there were the gentleman and the girl in the room; this gentleman had hold of the girl by the throat, choaking of her; I parted them, and then he turned round and collared me, he was quite drunk; then I went down and sprung my rattle to get assistance, but no property was found.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met the prosecutor about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night, in Oxford-buildings; he offered me 3s. to stay with me all night; I said that was too little, and he pulled my cloaths off my back, and treated me very ill, if it had not been for assistance, he would have choaked me; he put his hand in his pocket, and missed his watch, and then charged me with it; I never saw his watch or money; I have a witness here to prove that he had been with other women before.</p>

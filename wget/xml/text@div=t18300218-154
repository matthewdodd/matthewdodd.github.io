            . I was at the market- I saw the prisoner near Mr. Crook's form, and saw him put his hand into Ward's left-hand coat pocket, and take the purse out; he went four or five yards from the form, and put it into his own breeches pocket - I went in a few minutes, told my father, and he told me to go and tell Mr. Ward he wanted to speak to him; I went to look for the prisoner, but could not see him - he was taken in about a fortnight; I had known him by sight before, and can swear he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you thought it was a perfectly honest thing? A. No. I never saw such a thing before; my father has been an officer two years - I never heard of expences being given here; my father has been here once - I have known the market four years; I am sixteen years of age - I sell fish in the market; I did not know what to do when I saw this - the market was full of people; I did not run after the prosecutor - I did not know what to do; I know it was the 7th of January, because my uncle lent Mr. Ward's brother some money that morning - I knew Mr. Ward before, but I did not know what to do; he was not above a yard from me when I saw this, but I did not tell him of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN RANGECROFT. On the 7th of January my son told me of this, and I sent him to tell Mr. Ward - I understood the thief walked up the market,</p>

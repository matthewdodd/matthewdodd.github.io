            , ESQ. I live on my private property. On Sunday the 24th of May, I was on a visit at Mr. Young's, 28, Parliament-street, who is my brother-in-law; in the evening him and I were walking together in the Park, from nine until ten o'clock, he left me about a quarter after ten near Buckingham House - I was then making the best of my way home; knowing the Horse Guards gates would be shut, I thought I would go out at Queen-square gate-my nearest way to that gate would be across the Pagoda-bridge. When I arrived at the foot of the bridge a man caught hold of me by the breast of my coat and waistcoat, and tore the corner of my cravat off-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170004"></xptr>I believe he made an attempt at my brooch. He was dressed in dark clothes, not in military uniform.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him now - A. Yes, it was the prisoner. When he seized me I put my hand up to defend myself. He turned round and struck my face against the sentry-box, which was two or three steps up the bridge, on the left side-there was no sentry in the box. I immediately called to the sentry, and in the scuffle dragged the prisoner to the top of the bridge, not finding the sentry below. The prisoner said, "give me whatever you have got." When I got to the top of the bridge I called the sentry again, he came, and I insisted on his taking the prisoner in charge; he said, "It is no business of mine." The prisoner asked me again, in the presence of the sentry, to give him whatever I had got; he also said he was the sentry's comrade, and he would not take him in charge; this was in the presence of the sentry. A scuffle ensued. The prisoner told the sentry I had offered him two guineas to ****** him. Upon which I called him a d-d rascal, and requested the sentry to take him in charge while I went for a police-officer. He said he would not. I then requested him to detain us both until the Relief came round; he said he would not do it, and walked away. I then tried to drag the prisoner down to the more public part of the path, upon which he made a snatch at my watch, tore it from my fob, and then ran off. I immediately called Stop thief! he ran over the bridge towards Queen-square gate; just at that instant a gentleman and some ladies appeared. I called out Stop thief! again; the gentleman called to the sentry, who was just by, to stop him; he said he should not. I did not pursue him beyond the bridge, not knowing what accomplices he might have in the dreary part of the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the gentleman - A. Mr. Smith, who lives in Westminster, he was then a stranger to me. As the prisoner passed the sentry I saw him go close to him, and it struck me that he put something into his hand; this was at the top of the bridge. I found the corner of my cravat in the sentry's hand, and took it from him. I then went up the steps again, intending to go to the guard-room. I went towards St. James's Palace, and met some gentleman, I told them I had been robbed - They advised me to go to Bow-street. On Monday morning I went to my watchmaker's, and got the particulars of my watch, as I did not know the number myself. I took the particulars to Bow-street. I had two Napoleons in my pocket at the time, but did not then know it; I knew I was possessed of them, but did not know they were in my pocket - I had put two in my waistcoat-pocket on the Saturday night. I have since discovered that I have lost two Napoleons, but do not know how I lost them. On the Monday after, between five and six o'clock, I was called from dinner to Mr. Jarman's shop, found the prisoner there, and instantly recognized him - He said the watch had been given to him. He was asked if the person was present who gave it to him? he said, No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I did not give him the watch. My grandmother died when I was twelve years of age, and left me independent. I never followed any business. Mr. Young is now in Ireland. My brother asked me to go to Soho-square; as we returned we walked into the Park through the gate opposite to Mr. Coutts's, down by the houses in the Green Park into St. James's Park. My brother told me he was going to call at Pimlico. I declined going with him, as I wanted to go home to my wife, who was not very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the only gates open at that time were the Green Park and Buckingham gates - A. I did not know it. I had lived in Parliament-street five or six weeks, and had lived in London above ten years. I did not know the Queen-square gate was shut - A gentleman told me I could get out. I knew I could get out at Buckingham-gate, but that would be out of my way. I did not know it was ten o'clock until after I had left my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not meet the prisoner before you got to the bridge - A. I swear I never saw him until he laid hold of me by the bridge. I spoke to no person but the gentleman whom I asked if I could get out at the gate. I said nothing to any body about it being a fine night. I took no man by the arm. On my coming to the foot of the bridge the prisoner rushed upon me without saying any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are stronger than him - A. I possibly may be; but I was very ill at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not give him two Napoleons, or two guineas - A. I swear I had not a farthing in my hand from the time I left him until I returned. The prisoner told the sentry I offered him two guineas - He did not say I gave them to him. I did not stop until the Relief came round, as I did not know when it would come. I did not go to the guard-room; a gentleman advised me to go to Bow-street, as I could find the sentry at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Gillham - A. No; I know a Mr. Gill. I have dealt with Mr. Hall, the silversmith. I never took indecent liberties with any man. I have been married two years.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in York-street, Westminster. On the night of the 24th of May I was crossing the Park, with four ladies - I came out at my own back gate, which leads into the Park, and went towards the Pagoda-bridge; when I got on the bridge I saw two men running, the one behind was the prosecutor; he was calling stop thief, and said the person who was before him had stolen his watch, which was worth eighty guineas. I attempted to extricate myself from the ladies, to secure the prisoner, but they screamed out, and I continued with them-the man went on towards the sentry on the bridge - He was about thirty yards from the sentry. I turned round and called to the sentry to stop him, as he was a thief. The sentry said it was not his duty, and he should not stop him. He passed so near the sentry that, if he had put his gun out he must have fallen over it. I never saw the prosecutor or the prisoner before. I mentioned the circumstance to a person belonging to Queen-square office, and they found me out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was on the top of the bridge at the time. I was coming from Queen-square. The people were coming up the steps on the opposite side-we had just got on the level. I could have stopped the man if it had not been for the ladies, he passed me.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in the Strand. On Monday the 25th of May, a watch was brought to my shop, about a quarter after four o'clock in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170005"></xptr>the afternoon, for a glass, by a boy, who said he was a potboy at the Jolly Butchers, public-house-it was a very valuable watch, which excited my suspicion. I asked the boy who it belonged to? he said to a soldier, who was at their house, drinking. I told him I had not a glass that would fit, and he must call again for it. I went to the maker of the watch, he said it was stolen. I told him to send for the proprietor. I took an officer to the Jolly Butchers, which is in Hungerford-market, behind my house, I told him to wait outside; I went in but could find no person who claimed it. I left word for the man who owned the watch to be sent to me when he came in. I do not think the boy was there. I returned, and desired the officer to wait opposite my house. In a few minutes the prisoner entered my shop-he was very drunk. The officer came in, I sent him into the back-parlour, and asked the prisoner how he came possessed of the watch? he said he wanted a glass for it, and it was no business of mine, as a gentleman gave it to him; and began relating the manner of its being given to him. Mr. Hooker and Mr. Young, who lives at No. 28, Parliament-street, came into the shop; Mr. Hooker immediately said, "that is the man who took my watch."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I shewed Mr. Hooker the watch, he said it was his. The prisoner immediately said, "I don't think the gentleman is here who gave it to me, for he gave me this chain also;" putting the chain out of his pocket at the time. He then said, "the gentleman who gave me the watch will never come forward I am sure." I said, "Why not?" He said, "the man that gave it to me took unnatural liberties with me." Mr. Hooker and Mr. Young were present. Mr. Hooker said, "Yes, that is the charge I expected; soldiers always make these charges." I said, "Mr. Hooker, under these circumstances, you had better take your watch, chain, and seals." He appeared willing to do so, but Mr. Edmunds, the maker of the watch, who had come in, said, "Mr. Hooker you cannot do so, you must clear your character." I then called the officer from the back-room, and gave the prisoner in charge. The prosecutor requested me to get the examination put off until the next day, that he might advise with his friends whether he should prosecute. I saw Mr. Hooker in the evening, after he had been to Bow-street, and asked him if he had lost any thing besides his watch, chain and seals? Mr. Young was with him. He said he had not. I said I had heard a whisper about some Napoleons. I at first asked him if he had any money in his pocket at the time of the robbery? he said he had not. When I mentioned the Napoleons, he put his hand in his pocket, and said, "Dear me, he must have taken two Napoleons - I had two, and a sixpence."</p>

            . I am a private in the 3d regiment of Foot Guards. I was on duty at the bridge at the time of this transaction, between half-past and three-quarters past ten o'clock at night; the prosecutor and prisoner came up to me-at that time of night. only Buckingham-gate, the passage leading into Pall Mall, and the stable-gate, are open-the other gates are closed at ten o'clock. I was at the top of the bridge, nearest to Birdcage-walk, and heard the cry of sentinel! I do not know who it proceeded from; I went towards the top of the steps (where the cry came from), and saw two men, each had hold of the other - They gave charge of each other-both their mouths opened at the same time. I asked what was the matter? the prosecutor said the prisoner had attempted to rob him of his watch; the prisoner said he had offered him two guineas to ****** him. The prosecutor said he had no such things as guineas, but he had two Napoleons. The prisoner said, "you young b-r, I'll throw you over the bridge." Each persisted in giving charge of the other. I told them it was quite contrary to my orders to take people into custody, and did not do it. They went from the top of the bridge, waited there, and conversed two or three minutes together. I advised each of them to go for a constable, and they both left me with that intention. When they got to the top of the bridge they stood there - I stood in the middle of the bridge watching them; I could not know what passed, but it turned into quite a mild conversation, and I thought they were making it up. Shortly after that one parted from the other-the prisoner walked by me. I cannot say he is the man, nor do I know that he was one of them. As he passed me he said the other was a b-y s-d. After he had passed me three or four yards I heard the prosecutor call Stop thief! he came up and asked me to pursue him; I told him it was contrary to the Articles of War for a man to leave his post, and he had better pursue after him himself. He then asked me if I would stop him if he came that way back? I said I would, and he pursued after him, calling stop thief. I saw nothing more. The prosecutor returned in about twenty minutes. That is all I saw that night. When the man passed me he went towards Queen-square-gate. I went before the magistrate the next day, and afterwards before the grand jury-the prosecutor ordered me to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. At your examination before the magistrate, did the prosecutor make any charge against you - A. No, nor any complaint, except that I refused to take either in charge, which I could not do. The prosecutor told me to come here to-day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The prisoner was never a companion of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been in the same regiment with you - A. He was never in the company that I belong to; I only knew him when he was in the Tower. I never kept company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he on the bridge before the prosecutor called out that he was robbed - A. The scuffle and every thing else lasted about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the prisoner had been talking together - A. No, I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing - A. I did not know that he was a soldier, he had plain clothes on. I was six months in the Tower with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not frequently meet him on duty - A. I had seen his face before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170006"></xptr>Q. Is it not your duty to order people away who are loitering about the bridge - A. I ordered them away - I never saw the prisoner alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it your duty to stop him - A. If he had been given into my charge alone I should have taken him; but both giving charge of each other, I did not take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that the prosecutor did not desire you to take the prisoner before the prisoner told you to take him - A. I cannot say I know Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not call out to you to stop the prisoner, who was running away - A. I never heard him. The prosecutor walked by me - He never called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Smith tell you a robbery had been committed, and desire you to stop the prisoner - A. No; the prisoner said the prosecutor had offered him two guineas; the prosecutor said he could not offer him guineas, for he had only two Napoleons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention Napoleons at Bow-street, or any where else, until after you heard them mentioned at Bow-street - A. I meant to have said it, but I left it out. I said guineas were spoken of but mentioned nothing else. I did not mention that the prosecutor said he would throw the b-dy rascal over the bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor charge you with receiving part of the property - A. He asked me if the prisoner had not given me anything? I said, No; but I had picked up the remnant of a frill upon the bridge - I had it in my hand at the time. I only saw the prisoner once in the Tower. I only met him occasionally. Nothing was said before the magistrate about Napoleons.</p>

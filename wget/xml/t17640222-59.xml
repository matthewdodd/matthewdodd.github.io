            . On the 14th of last month, between twelve and one in the night, the porter brought a basket, and called out watchman; hollo, said I: he said, here is a basket that belongs to Mr. Mott; he is a salesman, and sells goods for the prosecutor; after that, he brought a sack, and pitched it by the basket: he told me they were Smith's.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The basket contained half a score of turkeys; and the sack, the fowls and ducks mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Ward. In about ten minutes after the sack was pitched, up came the prisoner at the bar; take care of these goods, said he, for they are mine, for Mott. He used to drive a higler's cart from the country, about three years ago: I said, yours,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220045"></xptr> how can that be? they are Smith's. Said he, my name is Smith, he and I are cousins. Said he, I am d - ble cold, wet and dirty (the water squashed in his shoes); said he, take care of my things, and I'll go to the Hare, in Lime-street. He was gone about six or eight minutes, and came again, and said, I am afraid of the sack. I said, you need not; it is as safe as your basket, and all the other things about here. Said he, I wish I could go to sleep a little bit: I said, he might lie down under a stall, which was near; he said, he would not lie there. Then I directed him to go up to the Bee-hive, a night-house. Said he, I am afraid of the sack. Said I, it is as safe, as if you had it in your pocket. Said he, I think, I'll take the sack along with me, and go to the Beehive, and put it in the bar, and have some purl; the sack is not my own, and I am more afraid of the sack than the fowls: he gave me a penny to get me some purl; he carried them away, and I never saw them any more.</p>

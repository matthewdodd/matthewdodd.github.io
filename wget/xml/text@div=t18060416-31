On Saturday evening the 1st of March, at half past ten o'clock at night, there were eight pair of boots on the counter, I went up stairs, and left the prisoner there with two other men; when I come down I found one pair gone, they were black in the sole, and the others were not. On Monday morning I asked the prisoner how many pair of boots he took with him on Saturday evening; he said seven pair, four pair to one woman, and three pair to another, to get them corded; on Tuesday morning I went and got a search warrant, I took the officer with me, and in his apartment we found three pair of boots, and ten pair of shoes; I knew them all to be my property, I came back, and had him taken up at my own house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was at work at your shop at the time that you searched his lodgings. - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in these lodgings. - A. I do not recollect that ever I did, his name was on the door; most certainly it was his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. You may have a very firm conviction of it, but how do you know it. - A. This man is employed by me as a weekly servant, I give him several things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160028"></xptr>to do after his hours of his being with me; we found six pair of Hessian legs in his room (when we found these other things) that I had given him to work at home; he had earned eighteen shillings this week at home, besides the guinea I gave him.</p>
               <p>Court. Is he a married man. - A. Yes, and he has got a child; I have seen his wife at my shop, and she was at the lodgings, and she was in custody for one night.</p>
               <p>- HARPER sworn. I am an officer of Worship-street; on the 3d of March, the prosecutor came to our office, and took out a search warrant; I went with him to execute that search warrant in Paul-street, Shoreditch, and there I found the property which the prosecutor said were his, three pair of boots, and ten pair of shoes; I produce them. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I came from the yard in the morning, at half-past nine o'clock—Mr. Miller had been at work—I went for materials for him to use, and when I came back, I went by his orders to light the fire—I heard the prisoner in the cistern, and heard him knock the lead up—I stepped up a ladder, but could not get up quite enough—he was on a stool to the bottom of the cistern—I saw this piece of lead on him—he told me to go and light the fire—I went down, and then he told me to get a short piece of wood to weight down the lead on the bottom of the cistern—I then went up and missed the piece of lead—I looked round and saw it is a crevice, and his working jacket over it—I did not think he would take it away till seven o'clock—it struck twelve o'clock in a few minutes—I told him it was twelve o'clock—he said he did not think it was so late—he sat a few minutes, and then came down and took the jacket and put it on—I went down and stopped ten minutes, and then called another witness.</p>

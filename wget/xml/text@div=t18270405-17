            . I am in the employ of Mr. Sadler. On the 20th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening (it was dusky - we had lighted candles, but it was light enough to see a man's features outside the house), I observed the prisoner, in company with another young man, lurking about the window, which induced me to watch; I approached the window - they both went away; they came again, and on my approach went away again; they returned in two or three minutes: I placed myself where they could not see me, and then saw the prisoner's hand at the window, in the act of removing something; they went away in a few minutes; I went out, and placed one shutter up, and as I returned, moved my hand along the window (so that I could not be noticed), and found a wire projecting out of the window - it had removed a brooch and a ring five or six inches from the place where I had put them; part of the glass was broken away, about an inch square - it was large enough to draw them out, if there had been time to have done so; I am certain the pane was intire and perfect in the morning; the prisoner and the other were then in company, on the opposite side of the way - I told our lad to call the foreman, and told him the window had been cut, but he did not understand me; I crossed over to them, caught hold of the prisoner's collar, and said, "My lad, I want you;" I could not make a sure grasp, and he ran away, but fell down, and I collared him; I am quite sure of his person - I had an opportunity of seeing his features at the window for some minutes; here are the articles - I am sure the wire had quite removed them from their places.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was near six o'clock? A. About twenty minutes or half-past five. There is an inner glass to the window - I had two panes to look through; there was some property hanging in the window, which would obstruct my view in some degree. Our shop is very dark - the candles were lighted, but at the time it was done there were some bed-steps at the end of the counter, which prevented the ray of the candle light going on the part of the shop where the prisoner was; it was not quite dusk. The part of the window where he stood is not so full of goods as the other part, and I could fully discover his features. There were some spectacles and other things there.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was delivered into my charge; I had not seen him stopped; I took him to Mr. Sadler's house, and asked if he had any thing about him; I found nothing but this piece of stick in his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER. Part of the wire was outside the window, and part in, and it was attached to the property.</p>
               <p>JURY to WM. CAWOOD. Q. Did you say you moved your hand along as you put up the shutter.? A. Yes, in order to see if there was any thing put through, as I thought they might think I was suspicious; I did not stay to look, but merely felt the wire - I saw it moving in the window before I went out; the hole was an inch or an inch and a half large; I did not know but the wire might have been put through the putty. I did not find the broken piece of glass - I might have trod on it - I saw him moving his hand outside, and the wire within.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

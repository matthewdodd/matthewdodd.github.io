               <p>Mrs. Cannon. My pot was lost from my house the thirteenth of June, and it was found upon the Prisoner, who, as soon as he saw me said, this is your pot.</p>

            . The Prisoner came by me with something I observed under her cloaths; I said, what have you got there? she said, what is that to you. I took her gown up, there was this pot; she told me her mistress sent her to sell it, and having seen her asleep not a quarter of an hour before in the street, made me suspect her; so I stopped her and the pot too; the little water that was in it was not quite cold. I asked if any body had lost a pot, and Mrs. Cannon said she had just boiled some pease in it, and set it out in the yard and it was gone. She swore to it as her property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been in the hospital; a woman came up to me crying, saying, she had been boiling some pease for her husband's dinner, and that he was going to throw the hot liquor on her, and she was going to the landlord to desire he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110026"></xptr> would come and seize the goods. Her husband had told her he would sell them all off, but she crying, her husband at last gave her this pot, and bid her take it and sell it, for that would support her a little while. She desired me to carry it to an alehouse in Plumbtree Court, and gave me three halfpence, and said she would be there as soon as I; that gentleman stopped me in Field-lane, and took it out of my hands; I asked him if he owned it, he said no, but would soon find the owner. This witness is a translator. I was going by him once with some old shoes, and because I would not sell them to him, he said, you old bitch, I'll be even with you some time or other; so when he took hold of me I was left to the mercy of the mob.</p>

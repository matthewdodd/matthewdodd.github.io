            . I am a gardener, I live in the New Road, Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Withers. - A. Yes, I have known him eight or ten years or more. On the day before Christmas day, he called at my house in Circuit Street, New Road, Paddington, he asked me whether I was at work, I told him it was such a wet morning I could not go to work, he said he wanted to speak to me about a little job, he was going to a public-house the corner of the street, would I have any beer. We went together to the public-house, there he said if I would come in the morning to the Brazen Head, he would meet me there about nine or ten o'clock. I went there at ten o'clock at night, he was not there, I had two pints of beer and a pipe of tobacco. I staid there till past eleven, came out, and went past his house, I saw a light, I went in, he was sitting by the fire, he said</p>
               <p>"Quelch, you are almost drunk," I said,</p>
               <p>"I am not much better," he asked me to sit down, I did, and fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is his house from the Brazen Head. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200006"></xptr>A. About two hundred yards. I sat there I do not know how long. He awoke me; then we went up the hill to the Brazen Head up Bell Street, he turned down Frost's Gardens, there is a chapel behind that, there he brought a ladder. As we made up the hill, we met a person, Withers told me it was Thorpe, Withers, said to Thorpe,</p>
               <p>"holloa master, do not run over me," that was just before we got the ladder. I said,</p>
               <p>"if that is Thorp, it is not his way home," he said</p>
               <p>"he has come this way because the water is up." I knew Thorp very well, but I did not know him then. Thorp lives down Bates's Row, he could not go along the gravel pits, the water was flooded there after a fall of rain. Withers and I went behind the chapels, and he brought a ladder out.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you did not go with him. - A. I stopped in Frost's passage, he went round the chapel and got the ladder. When we had got the ladder, we went down Bell Street the way we came up, we made a stop in Bell Street, there was a man and his wife next door to the Brazen Head quarrelling, a woman of the opposite side of the way came out with a light. After they were all gone, and all was quiet; we came up to the Brazen Head, he pointed up to the window, and said he was going to take these watches out, he laid the ladder down under a window on the opposite side of the way, we stopped there. Holmes and his wife were making a noise, when they were quiet, three men came down Bell Street, they knocked at the Brazen Head door, the door was not opened to them, they were in liquor; and stopped twenty minutes. After they were gone, Withers then took the ladder, and put it up against the window, he went up the ladder, and raised up the window at the bottom with a small pick axe, he took the watches out, which hung on a frame, he took the frame and all, and handed it down to me One of the watches fell of the frame on the ground, I took it up and put it in my pocket, that is the watch that I offered to pawn at Mr. Dobree's. Withers came off the ladder, we left it just as it was, under the window, and away we went. At Lisson Green he took the watches off the frame, and put them into his hat, I asked him what he meaned to do with them, he said, to take them to Freeland, I knew him, he is a broker, at the bottom of Quebeck Street, in York Street, I said,</p>
               <p>"suppose Freeland will not take them," he said,</p>
               <p>"he will take any thing, if he will not take them, you must take them to your house," I told him I would not have them in my house for any consideration, he said, he knew if he took them home. they would search his house immediately, I must take them to my house, nobody would have any suspicion of me. We both went to Freeland's house as the watch went four o'clock. We went to Freeland's back door, he went round before me; when I went round he was got in just as I got to the window, there was a light, I saw Withers and Freeland in the room, I saw where they put the watches, down on the table, Freeland was standing at the table, I went from the window, Withers came to me, he said, it was all right, I did not go into the house, Withers said, he had got a one pound note, and Freeland would settle the remainder another day, I went home then. I met him the next morning in Circuit Street, he gave me five shillings worth of half-pence, said, he should get the remainder of it the next day. On the evening of the next day, I saw him at the Royal Oak, Circuit Street. We went into Paddington Street. there he gave me four pounds four shillings more, he told me he got it off Freeland, that was my share. On the 5th of January, I pawned the watch I had at Dobree's, I was stopped, and I told this story directly, I have been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you kept all this snug until you thought you should be prosecuted, and then you told it. You do not understand this, you are a lucky fellow. - A. I think I am very unlucky.</p>
               <p>Q. Four pound nine shillings you received, you are lucky that you are not punished. - A. I do not know but I may be punished, I deserve to be punished.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you told this story first. - A. That very night, at Marlborough Street office, I told the officer of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in custody before, honesty. - A. Never before for any misdemeanor for thieving.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been taken up by any constable before. - A. Yes, I was before the justice at Marlborough Street, a man charged me with thieving his tools.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been at Marlborough Street. - A. Never before, or at any other office.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you charged about a wheelbarrow. - A. At Marlborough Street office, I bought some potatoes of a man, he lent me a barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he charge you with stealing the barrow. - A. He did, that was nine or ten years ago, it slipped my memory.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SMEED. Q. You are the landlord of the Brazen Head public house, are you not. - A. Yes, Mr. Seabrook informed me of the robbery in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the night had you heard any knocking at the door. - A. Yes, I did not get up, I think it was about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>JOHN THORP. Q. You live at Lisson Green. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of Christmas eve had you been out your benefit club. - A I had, I was going up Oxford Street as the watchmen were going two. When I came to Lisson Green, I should suppose it was near half after two, I went down Bell Street by the Brazen Head. Going down the hill about thirty yards from the Brazen Head, it was a dark night, one of the men spoke, or else I should have run against him, I cannot recollect the words. As soon as ever he spoke to me, I passed by and went on, I believe it to be Withers's voice, I have no other proof than the voice, I have known him ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that knowledge of him you believe it to be his voice. - A. I do, I passed on my way, and they their way.</p>

            . I am an office of Marlborough Street office. On the 5th of January, my brother brought Quelch to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any communication that he made, did you that night apprehend the prisoners at the bar. - A. I apprehended Freeland, and my brother apprehended Withers, they were both brought to the watch-house that night, they were examined on the Monday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200007"></xptr>the 7th. Withers was detained for a further examination Freeland was discharged upon bail to appear on a future day.</p>
               <p>Q. After Freeland had been discharged, did he come to you. - A. He did. On Monday, the 9th, he shewed me an anonymous letter which he said he had just received. That is the letter. - The letter read; directed, W. Freeland Broker, John Street, New Road, Paddington. To be left at the Duke of York, York Street. Post mark, January 9.</p>
               <p>"SIR - I can give you information that Mr. Quelch has told me this day, that a part of the property he stole, he has planted them in a coal vault, in the carcase of an unfinished house, Lisson Green, Paddington, that he meant to part with them one at a time. I give you this information, I do not like to see innocent men hunted for as thieves for other men's guilt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your brother go with Freeland to Lisson Green. - A. We did, we went to a carcase of an unfinished house. We found the watches in a pickle jar, the ground had been turned up, the mussle of the pickle jar was put in the ground, the sides of the jar and top were covered with bricks. This was in January, a very hard frost. The ground where the jar was buried was soft, it appeared that it had been turned up shortly before.</p>
               <p>Q.Could it have been in that state two days. - A I should think not, every other part of the vault was quite hard, and whatever water had flooded in was ice; the other bricks were frozen by the ice, these were loose I think it could not have been there many hours, if it had, it would have been frozen, the frost had been for several days, and it was a frost then. This is the watch I received at Mr. Dobree's, and here is, I think, sixteen watches and a watch case, Freeland went with me to that vault.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you put them in the carcase of an unfinished house on Lisson Green. - A. No, I never did; nor did I ever tell any body of it. I had a few words with Freeland about fifteen shillings he owed me, I never wished him any ill.</p>
               <p>Wither's Defence. There is some part of Quelch's evidence that I cannot deny, and there is a great part of it false. As to his coming to my house, he did, in a drunken state indeed; he came into my house, I was in bed, he set himself down and snored till about four o'clock in the morning, my wife said,</p>
               <p>"Withers, get up and turn that man out, he has watered the house I believe;" and, I then got up and said</p>
               <p>"go," he said he wanted me to go along with him, I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall not go along with you, recollect my family, I will not do any thing that I ought not to do, my misfortunes has taught me better," I had the misfortune to stand at this bar fourteen years ago, I was capitally convicted, I received his Majesty's pardon, God restored him, from that day I never eat of ill begotten bread, I have worked hard for my living, God has blessed me with health and strength to work for my family, and from whence he must rest his infernal evidence I cannot say, except from my former misfortunes. He has said, he would do for Freeland, he was sorry for me, but he could not do any thing with Freeland without me.</p>
               <p>Freeland left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>SIMON. I am independant, I live in Mitcham Street, Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter. - A. These are the initials of my name that I put to it. Freeland brought it into a public-house, I was setting reading the paper, he read this letter by my side, he seemed much agitated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He asked you to put your name upon it. - A. Yes, that I should know it again</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when it was put in the post-office were you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- RICHEY. I am a taylor, 17, Newnham Street, Edgeware Road. About the beginning of November, I heard Quelch say he would be a match for Freeland.</p>
               <p>MR. PIERCE. I am a bricklayer, York Street, New Road. I have heard Quelch say two or three times, he would do for Freeland in a very short time.</p>
               <p>Freeland called six witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

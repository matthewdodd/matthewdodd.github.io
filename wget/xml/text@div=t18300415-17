            . I was chief turnkey of the House of Correction, Clerkenwell, in January, 1829, and know the prisoner; I was present at his conviction at Clerkenwell January Session, as a common utterer of counterfeit coin; I received him into my custody - he was imprisoned one year, and was to find sureties for two years then to come; he went by the name of William Wilson.</p>

               <p>SARAH WINFIELD. I live at Mr. William Martin's, the Ship public-house, Chichester-rents, which is in Middlesex. The prisoner came there on the 15th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and asked for a glass of gin, which I drew him - he put down a 5s. piece; I saw it was bad, and told him it was a bad one - he then began to use very bad language, and I called Mitchelson, a porter of Lincoln's Inn, who was standing by at the time; he saw it was bad as well as myself, and detained the prisoner till Sullivan, a constable, came - the prisoner took the crown up; Mitchelson took it from him, and marked it, and I marked it after him; Mitchelson took it again - this is it (looking at it) - the gin came to 2d.</p>

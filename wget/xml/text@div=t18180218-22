When I got about 150 yards, he came behind me, seized my ear, said I was a thief, and knocked me down. I got up, he struck me again - A person helped me up, and appeared to take my part. The prisoner knocked me down again, and went across the road back to Russell-court - I missed my watch, I had it safe at four o'clock. I went to Bow-street, got an officer, went back to Russell-court, and took him into custody. I believe two persons struck me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I never heard of a reward. Mrs. Goddard fetched the officer, as she said she saw the prisoner take the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not the prisoner ask you for his orange, or the price of it - A. Never. He said I was a thief - I do not think I struck him. I did not quarrel with any other person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you strike any person that night - A. I do not think I did - I was rather in liquor.</p>

               <p>FRANCES GODDARD. My husband is a coach-maker. On the 9th of February I was in Wych-street about six o'clock, passing the Olympic Theatre, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor - the prisoner said he sold him two oranges for three-halfpence-the prosecutor said, "I have given you a halfpenny, and that is enough." The prisoner struck him, and he fell; he got up again-the prisoner went away. A man came up to the prosecutor and lifted him up, he then said he had lost his watch - I had seen it in his hand; he went behind the man who lifted the prosecutor up, and he gave it to him. We went to Bow-street, and got Tribute, the officer. The prosecutor was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw the prosecutor strike the prisoner, it was blow for blow.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CARTER. I live in Hollywell-street. I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor; another man helped him up, took his watch out, and passed it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN TRIBUTE. I am an officer, The prosecutor fetched me, and took me to the prisoner. I asked him if he had been quarrelling with the prosecutor about an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180010"></xptr>orange? he said he was the man. He went willingly with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He took an orange, and threw me down an halfpenny, I asked him for a penny. I ran after him - He struck me several times; I struck him, and went back to the same place I came from.</p>

            . I was selling oranges in the same place with the prisoner. The prosecutor took an orange-the prisoner put down his basket and ran after him; he came back, and kept selling his oranges for half an hour, when the officer came, and he said he was the man. Goddard asked if I was the man at first.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a sailor. I was going down Drury-lane, the prisoner and prosecutor ran down the street - the prisoner collared him, and asked him for the price of the orange. He struck the prisoner - They fought together for five minutes, the prisoner then walked away. The prosecutor then fought with another man for about two minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Islington-market, and am surveyor to Mr. John Perkins, who has some unfinished houses adjoining the market—I saw the houses about a fortnight before the 6th of May,—the lead was then safely fixed in the gutters—on Friday morning the 6th of May, I received information from the police, in consequence of which I went to the houses and found the gutters cut up and removed—part of the lead now produced is such as was in the gutters of Mr. Perkins's houses.</p>

About seven o'clock on Friday morning I was on duty on Whitmore-bridge, Hoxton—I saw both the prisoners together drawing a track, about half a mile from Islington-market—I saw it was loaded with something very heavy, and stopped them—I found in it these pieces of lead, and several more which I have at the station-house—it was covered over with an old sack, and a piece of carpet—I asked the prisoners where they brought it from—they said from a plumber named Robertson, at Kingsland—I asked where they were to take it to—they said to Dixon, a plumber, near Compton-street, Clerkenwell—I have made inquiries about the plumber at Kingsland, and there is no such person—I took them to the station-house—I went to these premises and found the lead was gone—it was afterwards compared with the lead Fish brought.</p>

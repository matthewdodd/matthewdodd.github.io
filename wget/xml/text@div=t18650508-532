                  </hi>. I am a starch-manufacturer, of Ludgate-hill—the prisoner was my traveller to obtain orders on commission—I knew him as George Phillips—I had some watchmaker's and jeweller's stock in my hands, and on 15th or 16th August, the prisoner said that Mr. Oliff, of the Star and Garter hotel, Copenhagen-street, was in want of a barometer, such as I had to sell—I permitted him to take one to show Mr. Oliff—he said next day that the barometer requited adjusting, which would cost one shilling, and Mr. Oliff would then take it and pay for it—the price was twenty-five shillings—I have never received the barometer or the money—a day or two previous to 19th August, the prisoner said that Mr. Watson, of the Cranbourne Hotel, St. Martin's-lane, wanted to purchase a gold watch, such as I had to sell, to present to his daughter, who was going to be married, and was content to pay the price I fixed upon, ten guineas, if it suited him—I took the precaution of seeing that there was such a person before parting with it, and went and saw Mr. Watson's name over the door, so on 19th August I entrusted the prisoner with the watch to take to Mr. Watson—he was to return it or the money the same evening—I should not have parted with it if he had not told me that—I never saw it again, and never saw the prisoner till 22d April, when I gave him in custody.</p>

               <p>went in a different direction and offered it to my solicitor's clerks—I cannot undertake to say that you did not go to Aldridge's—it was a silver lever stop-watch, and was easily convertible into money—you brought it back to me saying that it required being adjusted and put in going order, and then the person at Aldridge's would purchase it at the additional price—it had stopped when you brought it to me, because you did not understand the stop—I am not able to say whether any one was present when I handed you the gold watch and chain—I did not say at Westminster that it was on 10th August, I said that I was unable to say the date until I went to my office—I bad given orders to my travellers to take you in custody wherever they saw you—your commission was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—I employed you to serve a writ, and asked you if you were in a position to effect sales for me.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Examined by the Prisoner</hi>). About two or three months after 19th August, I met you by the Elephant and Castle, but did not give you in custody as Mr. Crawley had told me, because there was no policeman near—a policeman was about twice as far off as the length of this Court; but it was more through kindness to you that I did not call him—I told you to go to Mr. Crawley, as I had orders to take you up, but would not say anything about it—I advised you to see him, and settle with him—I did not tell him that I had met you—I met you again about a month afterwards, but did not give you in custody, because you promised to come to Mr. Crawley and settle it—you said that you would do so, but that you did not like to go to the office because of the clerks—you asked me for his private address, and I told you he did not like to see persons there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I submit that the case of the barometer falls to the ground, as the landlord of the Star and Garter, Copenhagen-street, is not called. There is a difference of two miles between Copenhagen-street and Caledonian-road. The fact is, Mr. Crawley wanted a writ served, and I served it, which occupied me two days and a night, and I have never been paid. He also employed me to get rid of some shares, and for that I have never been paid. He told me he had several watches, chains, and rings to dispose of, and asked me to find him a purchaser. I found a gentleman who wanted a good lever watch, and took it to him, but unfortanately it</p>

               <p>stopped, and I took it back to Mr. Crawley, who sent it to the watchmaker. A gentleman in Mr. Watson's bar wanted a watch and chain like one which Mrs. Walker had, which I had sold her. I took the watch to him and showed it to him, and when I returned to Mr. Crawley's the place was closed; and wishing to make myself smart, I put it on, got drunk, and was robbed of it, and of a purse containing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got locked up in Clerkenwell station-house. I was so bad in the night, that I was obliged to be taken to the hospital through delirium tremens, and was discharged by the Magistrate next morning. A week and a day afterwards, I met the prosecutor's clerk, and told him all the circumstances.</p>

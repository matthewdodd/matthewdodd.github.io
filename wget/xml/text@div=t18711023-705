                  </hi>. I am a dentist, of 127, Westbourne Grove—I rent a portion of the basement and the upper portion of the house, at 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—last November I hired some furniture of Bartholomew, who is an upholsterer, at 7, Westbourne Grove—I signed this agreement, marked "A," and gave an acceptance for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at three months—when that became due, I paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he subsequently lent me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I signed this paper, marked "B"—I received this letter, marked "C"—he subsequently threatened to take the goods away—on 4th August some men came to my house—they took up my carpets, and put them in a van—while doing this, Bartholomew came up, and I had a conversation with him—a solicitor came up, and said that Mr. Bartholomew was not justified in doing what he was doing; and there was an agreement made that I should give an acceptance of a friend, Major Gray, at one month, to complete the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the hire of the furniture—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due at that time—upon that, the carpets and other goods were put back again—Major Gray went with me to Bartholomew, and I left the acceptance with Acres, Mr. Bartholomew's managing man—I afterwards received this letter, marked "D" (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—on 14th August, about 8.30 in the morning, I heard a noise, went down, and found that all the things had been taken out of the drawing-room—it was</p>

               <p>the rattling of the stair-rods near my bedroom that awoke me—I found several men of Mr. Bartholomew's, several of the prisoners—I went to the station, and when I came back, they were gone—to the best of my belief, this authority to remove the goods, marked "E," is Bartholomew's writing—that was given to Mr. Vincent, my solicitor's clerk—they had removed the goods that belonged to Bartholomew, but they had not room to take away the goods that belonged to me—Jones and Walker were there—Mr. Vincent came and had some conversation with them, and about 2 o'clock in the day Acres came, and withdrew all the men—during the evening, in consequence of information from a person named Graham, I had the chain put up on the front door, and bolted it, and the drawing-room window was bolted—there were no shutters, merely a spring bolt—at that time, my man-servant Rumley, my wife, and family, were in the house—about 9 o'clock I heard a great noise in the street, crowds collected, and we heard shouting, and a few minutes afterwards two men fell into the room, through the window, followed by two others—I made a rush at the men, to try to keep them back, when two or three men followed immediately after them, up a ladder, which was placed at the window—Beer was one, and Green; and I think Walker, or Jones; I am not quite certain which—I had a sword lying in its scabbard, on the ottoman—it was there quite accidentally—it had been knocking about the house in one place and another—Spooner followed up the ladder—Beer made a grab at the sword, and Rumley also made a grab at it—he caught hold of the sheath, and Beer of the handle—the sword came out—Beer flourished it about in a most extraordinary manner—I got a clip on my temple—I succeeded in warding off a slight gash, but I got a second in my hand—Spooner came to my assistance, and Beer tackled him, and wounded him very severely, and he had to be sent to the hospital—they rolled from the top of the stairs to the bottom—I rushed down to see if I could get the police to assist me—I managed to take the sword from Beer, and handed it to the police, and Beer then made his escape—the front door was opened, and then in they poured, and we were attacked both ways—Bartholomew, I believe, got into the passage—he was taken by the police—my drawing-room floor was spotted all over with blood, and on the stairs, and everywhere—I recognize the whole of the defendants as being with Bartholomew on and off during the day—Beer and Green were in the room, and either Walker or Jones.</p>

               <p>which Beer had—I took off my coat, and sprang on him—we struggled on to the landing, and fell down stairs—the police came, and I was taken to the hospital—I was cut, and my right shoulder was hurt—I should reckon that about thirty or forty persons were engaged in the attack—I believe Bishop was there, but I did not see him go up the ladder—next morning I went to Bartholomew's shop, in search of Beer—I saw Acres there, and Bishop, Green, and Jones—they told Acres they wanted settling with for what they had done last night—we afterwards went to a public-house, and I saw Jones pay Green, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other two, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I got nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Vincent paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went up the ladder to prevent the things from coming out—I was about the fifth that went up—I was not struck on the head by Mr. Tucker, with this piece of iron; it was Beer that struck me, with the sword—I did not see Mr. Tucker there at all—I think about nine or eleven of us were paid by Vincent—I saw the window raised; it was unfastened with something or other—I saw both their hands against the window, as if to force the catch back—I can't say what they had in their hands—they forced the catch back, and then raised the window—I did not see any weapon in the hands of any of the men that went up the ladder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the prosecutor—I was in the house about 9 o'clock this evening—I saw the doors and windows fastened—there was nobody there at that time but my master's family—I was in the drawing-room—I saw Beer and Green come through the window—my master sprang on Beer, I turned my attention to Green—there was a great noise outside—Beer snatched up a sword that was lying on an ottoman in the middle of the room—I tried to get it from him—I got the scabbard—my master then tried to wrest the sword from him—Beer made a pass at his head with the sword; my master pat his arm up, and received a blow in the hand—Green crept round behind him, with something in his hand—I believe it was a screw-driver—I thought he was going to strike him, and I rushed on him, and struck him with the scabbard—I then saw Spooner and Jones enter the room—Spooner rushed on Beer; they wrestled, and both went through the door, and down the stairs—I saw Beer take the sword, with the blade dagger-fashion, and stab Spooner in the breast, as I thought, on the stairs—I went down, to assist my master, and keep the men out—I saw Jones there, and I saw Acres outside, standing among the crowd—I did not see him do any<lb></lb>thing—I could not swear to any of the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was summoned for assaulting Green—I did not hear my master say that day that he would have the sword down from up stairs—I did not hear Vincent say "You had better not have the sword"—I was in the room when it was entered—I did not turn out the gas; I believe it was turned out; I don't know who did it—I heard some one call out "Turn-out the gas"—that was when the first man made his appearance at the window—none of the eleven men who were paid by Vincent were in the house at that time—they were there at 2 o'clock, and resisted the removal of the ottoman—there were nine or ten there, then—I can't say how long they remained, I was asleep, and was not well—I did not see Mr. Vincent at 2 o'clock; he was not in the room at night when the window was raised—my master did not strike Spooner, my master had not the sword in his hand—I had seen the sword on the ottoman a few minutes before; I can't say how it came there, it was all about the house, sometimes in one place sometimes in another.</p>

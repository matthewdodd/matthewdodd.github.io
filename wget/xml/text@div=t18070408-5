The goods that were stolen were in an auction room, adjoining my shop, where I dwell; it is the next door to my dwelling house; I have a son that sleeps in that house in the garret, he is my servant. On the 13th of March, the prisoner was detected between three and four in the afternoon, just at the close of the sale; a gentleman tapped me on the leg, and pointed to the prisoner who was sitting at the table. I went to where he was, I saw he was in the act of tying some books up.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he tying up. - A. He was tying up a bible with a handkerchief; I went to the clerk that takes the money and delivers the books, and sent him to him; when he returned I kept a watch over him. The prisoner finding he was detected, untied the bundle, which contained a large quarto bible, and put it on the table; as soon as the sale had closed, I called out to the auctioneer Mr. Walker, and said, I had detected a person stealing a bible. I then took him to Bow street, where he was searched, and a number of duplicates were found on him; which duplicates led to a discovery of a great number of books of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Those books were not taken at this time. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080005"></xptr> No.</p>
               <p>Court. Confine yourself to the bible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Mr. Walker sold for you; therefore whether he sold books to the prisoner, or he bought them at another time, you cannot possibly know. - A. I rather believe he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. That you cannot know, you are only to speak to what you know; I would ask you whether this bible was not one of the prior lots that Mr. Walker put up, for which the prisoner bid twenty-four shillings. - A. I am positive that it was bought by another person who bid twenty-five shillings.</p>

            . Q. What are you. - A. On that occasion I officiated as clerk to Mr. Stockdale's sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his selling any bible. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not more than one bible sold that day. - A. Not of that size, that is a demy quarto.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at that sale. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he bid for that bible. - A. I cannot say. It was knocked down to Mr. Taffey for one pound five.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not received the money for this book. - A. No. In consequence of Mr. Stockdale speaking to me, I asked the prisoner how he came in possession of the book; he told me he had bought it, and paid one pound four for it, to a person at the top of the room. I examined my book, and found that lot had been knocked down to Mr. Taffey, for one pound five; as soon as I was going back again to the prisoner, I observed him take the bible out of the handkerchief and lay it on the table.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called five witnesses, who gave 
him a good character.</p>

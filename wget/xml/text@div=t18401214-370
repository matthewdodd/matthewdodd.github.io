I received charge of the younger prisoner, and went to the house of the elder prisoner in Brook-street—I saw a box by the side of the bed in the room—I pulled it out a little way—the elder prisoner came up and said there was nothing in that box that belonged to Mr. Champion—MR. Champion said it should be opened</p>

               <p>—she said she had not the key, that it belonged to a woman at the West-end of the town, who would be there to-morrow, and the box would be opened then—MR. Champion said it should be opened—I asked her to open it—she then got a gimlet, and broke open the hasp—MR. Champion claimed the property in it, and said he would have another policeman—she said she would go for one—she went, and did not return—this pair of new gloves was found in a drawer in a chest, in which were a great many un-finished articles—we went again on Saturday the 5th of December—we then found this cap and bonnet, with this ribbon on it, a pair of stockings, and some little skeins of silk, which Mr. Champion claimed—the piece of ribbon corresponding with this on the bonnet, we found in the box—one of these pieces of black ribbon was in the box and one in the drawer—this habit shirt was in the box.</p>

On the 11th of June I was in company with a friend, and we fell in with the prisoner and another girl in Phil pott-street, St. George's, about half-past twelve o'clock at night—we all went to a house in Hungerford-street—my friend went up stairs with the other girl, and I was down stairs with the prisoner—I was to sleep with her all night, I paid her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was sober—I had at that time 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left in my purse—I took the three sovereigns out of the purse, which was in my waistcoat-pocket, and put them into my watch-pocket—I was awoke in the morning, about half-past three o'clock, by hearing the door banging, and the prisoner came into the room—I asked her where she had been—she gave me an answer, and came to bed again—I missed my three sovereigns about half-past five—the prisoner was up, but she was in the room—I told her of it, and said nobody had been near the place, and the money could not go without any body being there—she said she knew nothing about it—I put on my clothes, got a policeman, and gave charge of her—she did not leave the room before I put my clothes on, but she might have done so when I left to get the policeman—I believe she must have taken the money.</p>

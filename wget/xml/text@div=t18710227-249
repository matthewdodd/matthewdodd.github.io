                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Hammer Street, Rother<lb></lb>hithe—on 29th December I went to the "Ship Tavern," Rotherhithe, about 5 o'clock—the prisoner was there, a man named Aldridge, and Thomas Wallis, who keeps the "Ship"—I am not aware that James Holden was there—I had some beer with Aldridge—the prisoner was in the next com<lb></lb>partment—he asked me if I was after any cheap beer, and I said "No, what beer I have I can pay for without any grumbling"—ho said "No, you can't, you monkey"—I said "Don't call me a monkey any more, not in here"—he said "Come here," and beckoned to me—I went and asked him what he wanted—he said "Nothing with a thing like you"—I then hit him in the face, and then on the head; two blows—he said "What do you mean by that?"—I said "What you like, go on with it, if you like"—he said "I will go on with it," and he struck me in the belly—the blow hurt me—it cut through my trowsers, and went into my flesh—Wallis said "Stevens, you have stabbed that man"—I then took the prisoner by the nose, and the hair of his head, and pulled him out of the place—I was afterwards taken into another room, and my trowsers were unfastened—I found I was bleeding, and I went out of the room—the wound did not bleed much at first, but I bled wonderfully afterwards—I was in the hospital five weeks, under the care of the surgeon—my shirt was cut as well as my trowsers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner and I worked together at the Surrey Gas Works—I had been in his company very frequently previous to this even<lb></lb>ing—we were on the very best terms—on this evening, before the occurrence, we were on good terms—I went into the public-house with the prisoner, and Aldridge, and another man named Spencer—we all left work together—the quarrel arose soon after we got in—we had not been into any other public-houses that evening—we were both the worse for liquor—there is a door leading from one of the bars—I don't know that the bolt was out of order—I did not see the prisoner use a knife for any purpose—I never saw him doing anything to the bolt with the hook of a knife—he was in one bar, and I was in another—he asked me to come into the next bar, and I went in—I struck him two blows then, one on the face, and the other on the head—he was standing up against the bar, sideways to me—he turned, and came at me like that—he made a lunge at me, the same way as a man would strike a blow—after that I seized him by the hair, and pulled him by the nose—I will swear that the wound had been inflicted at that time—he pulled my hair as well—there was a general scuffle—I did not discover I was wounded till I got into the other room—I never saw the knife in his hand—when I got outside I went oft' to the doctor's as fast as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, York Place, York Street, Rotherhithe—on 29th December, about 5 o'clock, I was in the "Ship" Tavern, with the last witness and the prisoner; we all worked together—I had a pot of ale</p>

               <p>—I did not hear the beginning of the disturbance, but I heard Pearson say that he would punch the prisoner in the mouth if he said that again—what he said I don't know—the prisoner said "You had better come and do it then, "with that he goes round and opens the door, and gave him a shove, and asked him what he meant, and he said anything he liked, and with that he punched the prisoner in the mouth, and struck him a second blow on the ear—Mr. Wallis, the landlord, said he would not have any bother in his house—the prisoner said he did not want to fight at all, and the prosecutor went up and shoved him in the chest, and said "Alter it, if you like"—the prisoner said "I will alter it, then," and made a plunge at the lower part of the prosecutor's stomach—the landlord said "Jack, you have stabbed that man"—he said "No, I have not"—I saw the prisoner draw back from Pearson, and he drew his hand up his thigh, as if he put something in his pocket—I did not see what he had in his hand at that time, but I had seen a knife in his hand some time before—the prisoner and another workman were <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> together at this door—it was unbolted, and the prisoner said "Stop, I will soon fix him," and he opened a kind of hook at the back of the knife, and tried to slip the bolt, to bolt the door, but he could not—that was about three minutes before the quarrel took place—there was not much blood from the wound at first; there was afterwards—after I saw the wound I went and said to the prisoner "Jack, what have you done that for?"—he said "What have I done?—I said "You have stabbed him"—he said "No, I have not"—I said "Yes, you have"—he said "If I have done any<lb></lb>thing it was with the hook you saw me trying to slip the bolt with, I never opened either of the blades of the knife"—I took Pearson to the hospital—they were both the worse for drink—the prisoner was worse than Pearson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were perfectly good friends on this evening, before they went into the public-house—the prisoner only struck the prosecutor once—the prosecutor gave two blows, and a shove in the chest—he pulled the prisoner's hair and nose—when I spoke to the prisoner about the wound, he said he had done it by accident—I saw the knife in his hand about three minutes before—it was a knife with a hook, which closed over the blades—it was a kind of hook, to pick horses' feet with—he was trying to undo the bolt with it about three minutes before the fighting—it is a sharp instru<lb></lb>ment, and has a curved point—the prisoner said he never opened the blades.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of this public-house—on 29th December, about 5 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, the prosecutor, and his mates, came into my house—they had some drink—the prisoner was in one compartment, and the prosecutor in the other—the bolt of the partition of the bar was broken, and the prisoner could not shut it—the knob was off, and it wanted something to shove it forwards—I saw the prosecutor strike the prisoner twice—I did not see what passed before that—the prosecutor asked if he could alter it, and the prisoner said he soon would, and with that he hit him in the stomach, and knocked him up against the partition—I had seen the hook in the prisoner's hand before, and I said "Jack, you have stabbed that man!"—he said "I have not"—he drew his hand up, and put it in his pocket—I never saw the knife—I did not think the man was stabbed; I thought I had spoke out of my turn—the prosecutor seized hold of the prisoner by the nose and hair, and dragged him into the large parti<lb></lb>tion, and I went round the bar.</p>
               <p>

               <p>did not see the knife in the prisoner's hand after he had been pulling the bolt back, and that was what made me think he had stabbed the man, and afterwards I was sorry I spoke, to think he had not done so—they kept on wrangling after the blows, and I went round and parted them—about a quarter of an hour elapsed before the stab was found out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the two blows were struck, I came out to put a stop to it—I have not seen the knife since—I can't say whether he had it in his hand when he struck out—I can't say that it is a fair blow to strike a man in the stomach; but if I was out of temper, I should strike where I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon, at Guy's Hospital—on 29th December, about a quarter past 6 o'clock, Pearson was brought to the hospital—I examined him—I found a clean cut wound in the lower part of his belly, rather on the right-hand side—it entered the cavity of the belly—it was a dangerous wound—he was in the hospital five weeks—he went only fairly, but not rapidly—the wound could not have been caused by the hook which I have heard of, because then there would have been a jagged edge—the trowsers and shirt were cut through—the wound has healed now, but he is still weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the hook had been worn down so as to be as narrow and sharp as a knife blade, it might have caused the wound; but not else—it was a clean cut wound, about two-thirds of an inch long, and it entered the belly. <hi rend="italic">The prisoner received a good character.</hi>

On Monday evening, the 17th of March, I heard cries of "Police!" from Mr. Sainsbury's house—I went there, and saw Mr. Sainsbury having hold of somebody—I received charge of that person—I saw the prisoner and a number of other persons there—an attempt at rescue was made—I observed the prisoner in the crowd, but did not observe him do anything—I was knocked down by a blow from the person I had in my custody—Mr. Sainsbury was also knocked down—while down I received another blow on my head, I cannot tell what with—it rendered me insensible for nearly ten minutes—I was lifted up, and taken to the surgeon's—I was off duty for three weeks, in con<lb></lb>sequence.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop. On Monday evening, the 17th of March, I went up stairs, and found a man kicking a woman—he was taken into custody—I saw the prisoner there—he and the crowd tried to rescue the person—as soon as the prisoner found he could not get him away, he left the house—I was knocked down, and as I was getting up I saw the prisoner come to the cill of the door, and throw a stone at the policeman, which struck him on the head—it was bigger than ray double fists—the stone now produced was picked up two minutes afterwards—it was apparently as big as that—the policeman was on the ground at the time, across my legs—Wilson, my waiter, was standing at the door.</p>

On the 17th of March, when the disturbance took place, there was an attempt to rescue the man that was given into custody—I was at the door—there was a scuffle in the passage—I saw the prisoner go out of the house—he came back to the door while I was standing there—I saw his hand up, and saw</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Brick-lane, Whitechapel. I was at Sainsbury's on the evening of the 17th of March—I went out to get another policeman, and while I was out I saw the prisoner outside the house, standing among some others at the door—I saw him walk across the road, and pick up something, I cannot say what—it appeared heavy—he returned with it towards the door—I did not see him do anything with it—I turned the other way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of the police at Whitechapel. I had the prosecutor under my care on the 17th of March—he had received a severe contused wound at the top of the head—it extended to the bone—a stone like this, thrown, might have produced it—he was three weeks under my care before he could take his duty at all, and I have seen him occasionally up to the present time—it was a very serious injury.</p>

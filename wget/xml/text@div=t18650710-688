                  </hi>. I am a smith, of 35, Upper Ebury—street, Pimlico—on 10th June, about a quarter to 2 o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise which awoke me, and I saw the prisoner close to my bed in uniform—he touched me, and I said, "Halloa I"—he said, "All right"—a young man, who was in bed with me, asked him his name, but he did not tell us—the young man then lit a candle, and I then saw that the prisoner had my hat on, and my coat and Mr. Jackson's coat on his arm—I told him he had my hat on—he said, "If it is yours, take it"—he sat on the bed by the side of me—I asked him what regiment he belonged to, and I think he said the Coldstream Guards—I sent for the landlord, who said, "Halloa, young fellow, I think you are wrong, "and told him to go, but he would not, and Mr. Jackson sent for a policeman—the prisoner laid my hat and coat on the bed—he was not drunk.</p>

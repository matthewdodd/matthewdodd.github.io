               <p>Court to Prosecutor. So large a quantity of goods as are now produced, and were found in the custody of the prisoner, must have been taken at different times? - They must.</p>
               <p>Atkins. He said he used to take them at different times; he said, after they shut up, he took out a bundle, and then made up a box, and took them to this woman's house.</p>
               <p>Court. It is pretty extraordinary to me, that such a quantity of goods as these, should not have been missed by you? - A great part of these goods I had bought only a few days before, and some of them had not been in the house a week; and the next morning after he was taken into custody, I looked round, and the first thing I missed was muslin aprons; these things were kept in my shop; I had not any suspicion of the prisoner before this; I kept him merely almost because I had a very good opinion of his integrity.</p>

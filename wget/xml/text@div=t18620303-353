                  </hi>. I am a dissenting minister, and reside at Plumstead—on Thursday night, 6th February, there was a side of pickled pork in my cellar, and a hammer, a chisel, and other tools—I missed them next morning, and, in consequence of information, I went to the house where the prisoner resided with his father, and asked him if he knew anything about the things I had lost—he said he knew all about the robbery, but had none of the things—I sent for a policeman, and the prisoner led him to the back part of my premises where the pork had been buried in the earth—he then led us to a person in the village, Mrs. Wood—the prisoner asked her if she had some pork—she said that she had, and after some hesitation she produced it, and I recognised it as my ham—the prisoner then charged her with having bought it early that morning; he did not say of himself—I found the tools buried in another part of the ground where the prisoner led me.</p>

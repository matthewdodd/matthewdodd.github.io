            . I am headborough of Holloway. On the 24th of July, at four minutes to twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner come through the Holloway-gate toll-bar, on a horse, riding - there was some suspicion that the horse was not properly come by; I went and asked him where he was going with it, and whose horse it was - he said he was employed by a man at Finchley, and was going to the Sugar Loaf, Whitechapel; I asked what he was, and how he came in possession of the horse - he said he was a hay-maker out of work, and was employed by a man he never knew or saw before, and was to have half a crown to take the horse to the Sugar Loaf, Whitechapel, where the person would meet him; it was a very tempestuous night; I said, "I will go with you, you must dismount and lead the horse, and walk with me" - I knew there was no such a house in Whitechapel; to be certain of it I went to Whitechapel watch-house, and asked the keeper in the prisoner's presence - he said there was no such a house, but there was the Three Sugar Loaves in Mile-end New-town; I said, "Well, we will walk together there" - I went, there was nobody there to meet him; I had put him into the Mile-end New-town watch-house before I went there; I put the horse at livery with the headborough of Whitechapel, who keeps stables; I asked the prisoner how he could be so foolish as to come on a job of that kind without drawing some money to pay the turnpikes, he being out of employment; he gave me no answer - I left him in the watch-house; I saw Young about six o'clock on Saturday evening, nearly opposite the Horse and Groom, at Highgate, and on Monday morning I met him by appointment at the Ram Inn, Smithfield - I went with him to the stables at Mile-end, and shewed him the mare - he claimed it; the prisoner was searched at the office, and on him were found two half horse-cloths, a bridle with a very strong bit, snares to catch hares, a pair of plated spurs, and two whips to tie on a stick to flog a horse with, a razor cut into notches, which will cut any gate through, a girth strap, two keys, one of which will open a gate I suppose; it is not a picklock-key - I have not tried it to the prosecutor's gate; it is the key of his own box, I dare say.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why do you say you suppose it will open a gate? A. I think it will open any thing, it will certainly open a padlock; I have not tried it - it looks like a key for a gate; the razor will cut a gate - I know these are snares; I did not take him to the Three Sugar Loaves, because the houses were all shut up - it was two o'clock in the morning when we got there; I went to see if any body was waiting for him - the watch-house is within three doors of the house, and if I had seen and body, I should have fetched him to know if they were the same; he walked with me very quietly, and never made the least resistance - he was on horseback when I saw him; I have some turnpike tickets which were found on him - he had come through the gate when I first saw him, and paid two pence; I was by his side when I first spoke to him - he never attempted to ride off, nor to run away - there was nothing to prevent his riding off, which was the reason I told him to get off and walk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the man in the road; he said if I would take the horse there he would give me half a crown.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner knew my horses as well as I knew them myself, there is no doubt; he as been out of Mr. Southey's employ from four to six months; he was never employed on my premises - he lived about two hundred yards from me; he has seen my mare it work, and was backwards and forward about my stable and fields.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

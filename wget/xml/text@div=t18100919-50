On the 29th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning, as I was sitting in the parlour, behind the shop, I heard a square of glass break; I went to the shop window, I perceived one of the squares of glass had been broken, I examined the window, I saw nothing had been taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the window before - A. The same morning. It had been cracked about three or four days before, by an instrument being put against it; it was cracked only in one part of it, no part of the glass was out. At first I missed nothing, I retired a little way behind the partition that separates the shop from the parlour. and in a minute or two the prisoner Toomey put his hand into the hole of the window, that he had made, and took out a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the ring here - A. No, it was a gold ring, the fellow one to this.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with it - A. I cannot say, he went off; I went to the window and looked into the tray, I found that one was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to see the boy - A. My sister saw the boy as well as myself. I went after him to Scotland-yard, and took him, I am sure it is the same boy; I found the knife upon him, which had upon the point the same putty; it is a bright red putty; I cannot be mistaken. He said, nobody could hurt him; I could not find the ring upon him. I saw him in company with the other boy, Barry, after he had done the act, but not at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gun-smith, and live in Rosemary-lane—I am employed by messrs. Lacy and Reynolds to polish carbines. On the 19th of January a policeman called on me and showed me two gun-barrels, which I had received from Messrs. Lacey and Reynolds—I am accountable for them—I have got the two stocks here which fit them—I am quite sure they were in my care—I had not missed them—I have seen the prisoner passing the door, but know nothing of her.</p>

                  </hi>. My mother keeps a broker's shop in Back-road. On the 19th of January the prisoner brought those two gun-barrels to sell—I am sure it was her—I knew her before—I told her they belonged to Government and I dare not buy them—she said, "They are my own property, I have had them a length of time," and said a person gave them to her—I said I should stop her and give her into custody—she ran out of the shop and left them—my mother gave them to the officer—I went out of the shop and saw her, but she went down some back streets—I am sure she is the person.</p>

Did the barrels come into your possession with the stocks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I went and got the stocks, to see that they fitted—I know that these identical barrels came into my custody, because there is a private mark on them, the finisher's mark—I am not a finisher, I am a polisher—there are other polisher besides me, but they do not work for the same firm, they have a different mark—I find the private mark on these barrels when they come to me—I had not polished them, I had merely sorted them—I had counted them, and am quite sure I received the number correct—I think there were 600 in the order—so the foreman tells me—I did not put the pri<lb></lb>vate mark on them—the person who takes them to pieces does that, on Messrs.

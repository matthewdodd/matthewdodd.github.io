On the 1st of May, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop with another person, who asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs-the prisoner stood behind the other man, towards the door, and spoke to him. None of the handkerchiefs would suit. The prisoner said, "Buy a cotton one" - I took some down; they would not suit. The prisoner then went out; the other bought nothing, and did not remain above a minute after the prisoner. I heard a neighbour call out, "Mr. Connelly, you are robbed!" Mr. Connelly went out, and brought the prisoner back-there had been no other persons in the shop. I missed a piece of four-quarter Irish linen, worth 4l. 7s. 6d. - it cost my master that. The prisoner was close to the pile on which it stood. I had occasion to go behind the pile, and could not see what was going forward.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live opposite Mr. Connelly. On the 1st of May I was at breakfast, and saw a person go to his door. The prisoner came to the door, and gave him a roll of linen from under his coat - I and my man ran out and followed them. I saw the prisoner running, and never lost sight of him until my man took him-the other man escaped with the property. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I did not see him until he came to the door with the linen.</p>
               <p>ANDREW CONNELLY. I am a linen-draper, and live in King's-road, Chelsea. I was not in the shop at the time. Being informed that I was robbed, I ran into the street, and stopped the prisoner in Shaw-street. I missed a piece of Irish, which I had seen in the shop the preceding evening after shutting up.</p>

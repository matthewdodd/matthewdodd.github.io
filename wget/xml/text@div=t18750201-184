I am an engineer and live at 17, William Street, Greenwich—on Saturday, January 2nd, I met the prisoners about 7 o'clock and went with them to the Mitre public-house—I was drinking with them there for about three-quarters of an hour—I then left and the prisoners came out after me—I called a cab to go to my house, they got in too, and I told the cabman to go to 17, William Street—he drove up the street to within 30 or 40 yards of the house—I got out there and the prisoners hustled and shoved me about—they shoved me down in the mud and I put my two knuckles out as I fell—one of the girls took the money out of my pocket and paid the cabman—I could not say which one it was—they hustled me up a lane and shoved me down and broke my watch from the guard—they stole the watch—I could not say which it was did that—they ran away and I ran home and told my wife that some bad girls had taken my watch—I afterwards gave information to the police.</p>

I am a cab-driver and live in Green Lane, Greenwich—on Saturday night, 2nd January, the prosceutor and the prisoners came to my cab about 8 o'clock—the prosecutor said he wanted a cab and they all four got in—the prosecutor got in first and the three prisoners followed, they asked him to give them a ride to East Greenwich—he told me to drive to East Greenwich; the turning that side of the Union that is William Street—when I was going up the turning he directed me to, one of the prisoners halloed out "Turn up straight to the left and then turn to the right and that will do"—they got out two of the women first, then the prosecutor, and then the other woman came out—I asked who was going to pay the fare and Julia Hart said "Come, dear, pay the cabman his fare"—he said "How much is it"—I said "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—he put his hand in his pocket to feel for his money and he had got none—he said "Let us go across to the light," and as they went across to the light they all three ran after him and shoved him down—I said "Don't shove him down"—I picked him up—they went to the light and he felt about his pocket and took his watch out—I said "Put that in your pocket, you may break it"—Ladd pulled out a penny piece from his pocket and Hart pulled out four sixpences and some bronze money and I was paid in three sixpences and bronze money—the prosecutor had had a little drop, but he was not drunk—I asked them to let me see the man home—they said "You go home cabby, you go on, the wife would not like to see us all go up to the door together," and of course I left the prisoners—Julia Hart said she lived next door but one to him and caught hold of his arm and dragged him him up the lane—that was the last I saw of him.</p>

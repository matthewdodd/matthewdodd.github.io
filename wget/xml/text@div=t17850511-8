             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a day labouring lad, my father and mother live opposite to this house, I never was employed there before; Mrs. Wallis, when she came down to the house, desired me to go and sleep in the house, till they came to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you lay by yourself? - I had a little dog that laid with me, I laid below stairs in the kitchen, and I was going home to bed on the 12th of April as usual, it must be between eight and nine, it was moonish light.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any remains of daylight? - No; there is a gate to the garden about ten or a dozen yards from the house, it is a spring lock, I had the key with me, when I came there I found it bolted withinside; then I went over directly to my father's house, and told him the gate was bolted, and he said, are you sure of that? I said, yes; then he said, stop a bit, I will get a lanthorn and go with you, so he went with me and took a lanthorn, and I got over the wall by the gate, and unbolted the garden gate, and let my father who had he lanthorn, and the dog in; the dog went directly into the shrubbery, where two men lay, and he began barking at them.</p>
               <p>What kind of dog was it? - A little tarrier, I ran directly after the dog, and saw two men get up from the shrubbery and run away, and I run after them, and they jumped over Bushy Park wall, that adjoins to the garden; I jumped over after them, and the prisoner was the person I took, the other man struck me twice, and then run away; I took the prisoner into the first public house I came to, my father came to my assistance, and he and I secured the prisoner; we took him to the sign of the Maidenhead, and there I left him with my father, till I fetched the constable, I came to the house in about twenty minutes afterwards, and it was all torn to pieces, all the drawers were opened, two windows were broke open, and they had shoved the bars out of two windows, and had wrenched one off; and the door was unlocked, the kitchen is a little under ground; I found every thing broke open except one door, I could not tell what was stole out of the house, till Mrs. Wallis came down; the prisoner was searched at the Maidenhead as soon as the constable came, but nothing of Madam Goddin's property was found upon him, at the public house he had a silver spoon found upon him, but that did not belong to Madam Goddin.</p>
               <p>When you first discovered them, were they laying down or standing up? - Laying down on their bellies, I think they must be in the house as soon as it was dusk, by the damage that was done to the house; the man at the public house went with me directly, and I shewed him where he threw some things from him, when I had hold of him in the park, he struck me once over my face, and he went to strike me again, and it fell out of his hand; we took two candles with us into Bushy Park, and there we found this pistol.</p>
               <p>Was it charged? - No, it is the pistol he struck me with, and there were these two black cloaks, and three pair of stockings along with it, and these picklock keys, and a tea cannister, and this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>(The two black silk cloaks deposed to by Mrs. Wallis, as the property of Mrs. Goddin.)</p>

I made them, they are about six shillings value, this cannister was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110016"></xptr> left in the closet with the plate that was stole, it is of no value, there is about an ounce of tea in it; here are three pair of silk stockings, value three shillings, and these five pair of cotton stockings are valued two shillings, they are all marked E. G. these three handkerchiefs were found, they are Mrs. Goddin's; the other things have never been heard of since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him how far it was from the gate to the trees, when he says, he saw me lay down? - It may be pretty near thirty yards, but I did not see him till the dog ran.</p>
               <p>How near was you when he got up? - About fourteen yards.</p>

               <p>These together are vastly above the value of forty shillings? - Yes, I was never in the house, nor anybody since we left it; they broke every lock in the house except one, and that they attempted in two places.</p>

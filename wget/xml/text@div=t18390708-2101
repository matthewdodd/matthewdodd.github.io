                  </hi>. I live in Charles-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner is my husband—we have been married about twelve months last February—he is a Hanoverian—I have lately had some property left me by my father—nothing particular had taken place about it between me and my husband—shortly before this occurred, he did wish it to be made over to him, and I said he might have it—on the morning of the 1st of June, he was out running about, from between three and four o'clock—he re<lb></lb>turned about nine o'clock in the morning by himself, and went away again—I found him at Wapping-wall, and brought him home about eleven o'clock in the morning—I took him to the doctor's and had him cupped, then took him home and put him to bed—this was between eleven and twelve o'clock—I had him cupped, as I thought it would do him good—he complained of his head very much—he appeared very quiet and composed, as I supposed, after the cupping—he asked me for something to drink—I gave him some—he got up and went down stairs, but I got him up again—he sat down on the bed, and asked for something to drink—I gave him some—I thought he was going out again, and I got up to fasten the door of the room, upon which he took a knife out of his pocket and stabbed me in the face and neck—it was a little clasp knife—it was not open when he pulled it out—he opened it—it took the use of my limbs completely away—I fell, and when I was down he cut me in the neck and face—I was not struck at all that I know of—Mr. Stanley came in, and I was taken to the hospital—he never said a word while he was doing this, that I heard—I had not had any quarrel or difference with him since last January—I was in the hospital five weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Charles-street; the prisoner and his wife are tenants of mine. On the 1st of June, in conse<lb></lb>quence of what I heard, I went to their lodgings—I found that a man in my employ named John Watts had got there before me—I forced the door open with the assistance of Mr. Richardson—when I got into the room I stepped over something, which I suppose was the female lying on the ground, but my attention was called to the prisoner sitting on the bed—he had previously cut his own throat—I saw a deal of blood about his throat, and he had a knife in his hand, which he held about two inches from the wound, and as I advanced towards him he commenced cutting his throat again—as I got closer to him his arms fell, and the knife fell from his hand—I picked it up and produce it—it is a small pocket knife—I afterwards saw his wife on the floor, and blood had been flowing from her throat and neck—they were both taken to the hospital—three or four days before this, I was present when some conversation passed between them about her making over the property to him, which she had said she would do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student at the London Hos<lb></lb>pital. On the 1st of June I was there as house-surgeon—the prisoner was brought in first—I examined his throat—there was a cut just below the chin, an inch and a half or two inches in length, dividing only the skin, and not dangerous—I found no other cut about him—he was very soon the better of that—he was in a state of very great excitement, which myself and the surgeons supposed to be caused by passion aggravated by liquor—he exclaimed, "My wife, my beautiful wife"—he was very violent the whole day, screaming and crying the greater part of the day—we were obliged to put on a strait-waistcoat—he remained in the hospital, rather more than a fortnight—he continued in that state about three days—it then went off of itself—he had no more than one dose of opium, which was administered immediately on his coming in, and it was repeated at night—he had two doses—that was all the medical treatment to which he was subjected—we did not take any blood from him—he was very quiet during the other portion of the fortnight, with the exception of one evening, when some friends of his wife came and told him he would be transported, or something of that sort, and then he assumed the same state of excitement as when he first came in—it only continued that evening—he was in the hospital about a week after that, I think, and was tranquil during that time—his wife was brought in about twenty minutes after him—I found on her six stabs, one on the upper part of the chin, two by the side of the ear, and three on the back of the neck—I found paralysis of the lower extremities, and partial paralysis of the upper—I supposed that to be produced by a blow on the spine—the two wounds by the ear were dan<lb></lb>gerous—she is still suffering under paralysis, but is out of danger—she was under my care five weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you keep the man in the hospital a fortnight for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For debility and weakness—he was in a weak state when he was brought in—I do not know what it arose from—the cut was not cured for eight days—it is difficult to cure cuts in that position, from the motion of the head—he did not tear open the wound—a policeman sat up with him constantly, and a nurse was in the same ward—the po<lb></lb>liceman did not sit up to take care of him, he was in custody—there</p>

               <p>were several policemen—they changed and relieved each other—I never beard from the policeman that he had attempted to open his wound several times—I thought it was excitement—I did not know whether he was dis<lb></lb>sembling or not—he had not the symptoms of insanity about him—I kept the strait-waistcoat on him two nights, I think—that was because ha, was violent—insane persons are often violent—if I had been told he had tried several times in the night to open his wound, I should have considered that a reason for putting the strait-waistcoat on him—I gave him nothing but two doses of opium, and a small dose of opening medicine—that was all he had—he was kept on low diet for a day or two, and then on full diet—I heard when he came in, that he had been cupped in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 27.) I went to the prisoner's lodging—I found the prosecutrix on the floor—the prisoner was there—I asked him why he did this—he said, "I did it myself, policeman, we have both consented to die together"—he was trying to open the wound, which I endeavoured to prevent, and he bit me on the arm—he bit through my coat—he said it was all very well while he worked for her, but when she had had a little money left her, she despised him—that he had done it that no other might have her—I saw him again that afternoon at the hospital, and he said he wished he could get a cut or two more at her, but he had lost his knife—he said, if they would give him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides what he had, he would leave this country, and go to Germany, for he would not be hanged, he would be tried by the Hanoverian law—I helped to put the strait-waistcoat on him—he was very violent then—I continued there with him till half-past nine o'clock at night—he was very violent most of that time—another policeman then took my place, and I did not see him after<lb></lb>wards—when in the hospital he made an attempt to enlarge the wound in his throat once—that was when the strait-waistcoat was on him—he struggled, and got his hands adrift—he was prevented from putting his hands to his throat—he said, "Oh, my lovely wife, I have not been the death of her."</p>

               <p>that morning, and could make no one hear him—he said his pocket had been picked, and the copy of his wife's deed stolen—he said he was sure my own father had died worth 60, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is not the least foun<lb></lb>dation for that—I am married, and have a brother-in-law named Anthony—he said my brother Anthony wanted to get possession of the whole 60, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was a very good thing he had lost the copy of the deed out of his pocket, for nobody could touch the money but himself—I gave him some coffee, to keep him quiet, as he was singing and laughing, and making horrible accents—he did not appear at all to know what he was doing.</p>

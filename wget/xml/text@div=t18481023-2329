                  </hi>. I am in the service of Sir Henry Meux an another. I had the management of the storehouse—the prisoners were in their service—Biddle had the management of a van; Farr was foreman under the loading clerk, to see that the drays were properly loaded—he would know, as a matter of course, what were the loads the drays should take out—on 9th Sept., about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, I gave Farr instructions about loading some beer, and what to do while. I was gone to breakfast—he suggested that Biddle's van and team were at liberty, and there was a load of sea-beer to go, I think, to Beresford's-wharf—he went to the storehouse, returned, and said they were not ready, but there were four puncheons and six hogsheads ready, which Biddle could take to Gun and Shot-wharf, Tooley-street—I left with him two delivery-notes, one for the four puncheons, and one for the six hogsheads, in the ordinary course of business—it would be Farr's duty to confine himself to the loading of the matters mentioned in the delivery orders—I did not instruct him to take any other articles by Biddle's van—I had given Potts instructions—I returned a few minutes before nine—Potts made a communication to me—I went to Gun and Shot-wharf, and found that the goods had been delivered—I did not find any other goods of ours there—at a quarter-past two that day I saw Biddle in the Brewery-yard—I asked him what he had brought back with him—he said, "Two kilderkins and one empty barrel"—I asked if he had brought any full casks—he said, "No"—I saw him again that evening near the brewery with his van and horse—I gave the van and horse to another man, called Biddle into the counting-house, and asked what he had done with two barrels of beer that he had taken in the morning loaded into the tail of his van—he denied having had them—I received from him his delivery-notes for the beer delivered at Gun and Shot-wharf, and it appeared that was delivered right—he gave me the difference between 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the money which he had paid—I gave him into custody—I sent for Farr, and asked him two or three times what bad become of the two barrels he had loaded into Biddle's van—he denied having loaded any.</p>

Meux's service—I suppose he had two horses that day.</p>

               <p>puncheons, six hogsheads, and two barrels were put into it—Farr assisted to load it—the barrels were put at the end of the van on the near side; pitched up, standing on their head—I saw Biddle pitch one up; I cannot say who pitched up the other, or where Farr was at the time—I saw Farr with Bidlle after they were pitched up—I saw the van going across the yard, driven by Biddle; Farr followed it; I do not know how far, he was only away a few minutes—Biddle returned with it at ten minutes to one, with one empty barrel and two kilderkins—there was no full barrel of any size on it—Mr. Jenkins returned from breakfast, and I informed him.</p>

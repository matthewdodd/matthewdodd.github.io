I watched the prosecutor's shop, on the 2nd of January, about six o'clock in the morning—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner about the same time he was carrying a basket—he came from Graf<lb></lb>ton-street way—he passed the prosecutor's shop, went into Piccadilly, crossed the road, and went towards the Green-park—in the course of a few minutes, he returned, went up Albemarle-street, passed the shop, and looked in, the door being ajar—he went about half-way up Albemarle-street—he crossed, and stood on the opposite side of the way two or three minutes—he then walked down the street again into Piccadilly—I walked past him, and saw the basket he had in his hand was empty, and it had a cloth in it—he then went half-way up Albemarle-street again, and stood there for five or ten minutes—I then saw a boy come out of the prosecutor's shop, and go into Piccadilly—directly the boy was gone, the prisoner ran across</p>

               <p>with the basket on his arm, and went into the shop—he came out directly without the basket—he went towards the end of the street in Piccadilly—while he stood there, Merriman came out of the shop, and looked up and down the street—he then went in again, and came out with the basket full, and a cloth over it, which he put on the steps of the next house—he then went to the shop door, and stood there—the prisoner then crossed over, and had some conversation with him—the prisoner then went and took the basket on his arm, from the steps of the next house, and walked away towards Grafton-street—I followed, and stopped him—I asked what he had got—he said, meat which he had just bought in Newport market—I asked him who he bought it of—he said he did not know—I said he had made quick work of it, as I had seen him with an empty basket just now at the bottom of the street—he said I must be mistaken, he was positive it was not him, he was just come from Newport market—I told him he was my prisoner—that I saw him give the empty basket into the butcher's shop, and I saw the butcher's man give it him out—I took him into custody.</p>

            : I lost the things in the indictment, my husband's property; they were lost between six and eight, on the 25th of October, Monday evening, out of the garret; nobody else was over the threshold but the prisoner, who lives in the two pair of stairs, from four till between ten and eleven in the evening; she has lived there above two years; an elderly gentlewoman lodges in the first floor; the prisoner went in and out of the house two or three times; my door was open all the time; I set in the parlour; I went into the garret about six, and knew them; in the evening, I went up much about eight to light the boy to bed; I never found the things; I have no servants, nor had no visitors; nor I do not know that she had any.</p>
               <p>What is she? - On the town; I have given her warning several times, but she would not take it; I gave her warning last, much about the 12th of August; I have a shirt which was found in her bed loose, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270016"></xptr>three pieces, by Winder the officer; her room was searched on Tuesday, much about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do the three parts make one shirt? - No; the collar is gone.</p>
               <p>William Winder called on his recognizance, and did not appear.</p>

On the 6th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was dining in my counting-house - my young man, hearing a noise in the shop, went out; he called me, and I found the prisoner, who was a stranger, behind my counter - the till, which was closed before, was partly open; I accused him of stealing some money- he said he had not stolen any, but had dropped a halfpenny behind the counter, and came there to look for it; I sent out for a constable - I inquired of my servant what was in the till, and missed a 5s. piece; the prisoner turned all his pockets out, but I thought one waistcoat pocket was not turned fairly out, and in that I found 3s. - he was taken to the watch-house, and three more shillings were found in the same pocket; he stood round the counter for a quarter of an hour, with his hands behind him, and after he was taken away, I found the 5s. piece behind the counter in the bin - he could easily have dropped it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HOUSE. I am in Mr. Plumbe's employ. I did not see the prisoner till he was behind the counter close to the till - I knew there was a 5s. piece and a quantity of shillings in it; I called Mr. Plumbe, and then went for a constable, who was not at home - I returned and examined the till; there was no 5s. piece, and there appeared less shillings than when I saw it last, but how many I cannot say - I had examined the till about a quarter of an hour before; I do not recollect whether any customer had come afterwards, but I had given no change - I said I was certain there was a 5s. piece in the till; he said he was willing to be searched - the 5s. piece was not found on him, but after he was gone, I found it in the bin, near to where he stood, a little covered over; nobody but master and myself had access to the till.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH SWAINSON. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner at the watch-house - he said he knew nothing of the 5s. piece; I went back and found it among the tares behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had 6s. 0 1/2d. - I went in to ask for some peas, my halfpenny rolled over the counter; I ran round to pick it up - this man came and collared me.</p>

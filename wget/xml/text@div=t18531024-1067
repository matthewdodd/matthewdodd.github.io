On Monday, 3rd Oct., J saw the prisoner at the bar of my house, about 11 o'clock it night—he had been in the house during the day; I had seen him there once I—when he came to the bar he called for some beer or half and half—I served I him—it came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I said I thought it was not I good—he said, "Well, it is"—I looked at it, and put it into the machine, and it gave way—I put it on the mantelpiece behind the bar—the prisoner I stopped in the bar about half an hour—he then said, "You have a meeting I upstairs; is it free?"—I said, "Yes"—he went upstairs—my waiter, Jago, afterwards came down, and brought me a shilling—I took it, and compared it I with the other shilling, and it was the same make and die—I kept that with I the other shilling—I saw the prisoner again about 12 o'clock; he came down with the rest of the company—he asked for half a quartern of gin, and he gave Jago a shilling—Jago bit it with his teeth, and a bit came off it—the bit fell on the ground, and we have not found it—I took the remainder of it—I said to the prisoner, "Powell, you are acting very <hi rend="italic">fast</hi>; you knew these were bad; this is the third this evening; I shall lock you up"—he said, "Do as you please"—I went to look for a constable, but I knew where the prisoner lived, and I let him go—I saw him again the next morning, at the comer of a street in Wild-street, and gave him in charge to Pocock, and I gave him the two shillings and the part I have saved of the one that was broken.</p>

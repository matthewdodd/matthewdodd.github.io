               <p>- CANNON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am carman to Mr. Rivers; I was driving a cart from Messrs. Townsend's to Mr. Rivers's house; I was loaded with cloths; I met the prisoner and three more, who were walking together under the Artillery-wall; just as I came by the Red Lion, at the corner of the fields, the prisoner said, Old fellow, will you be three farthings towards a pint of beer? I told them I had no money.</p>
               <p>Did you know them before? - I don't know that I did. One of them said, Poor old fellow, give him a pint of beer; the prisoner said, I will give him a pint of beer, if he will drink it; I said I would, and thank him too, for I had not had a draught of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250026"></xptr> beer that day; I said here is a public-house here, on the right hand, which is the Castle, if they would give it me here; they walked on, and took no notice of it; the prisoner kept close to me all the way, and the others kept company with me till I came to the King's Arms, which is at the top of the Tabernacle Walk; the prisoner went in there, and called for a pint of beer, and paid for it; I stopped my cart, and we drank the beer up; then they said, Will you have any more? I said, no; I would go home with my cart.</p>
               <p>How near is the King's Arms to your master's house? - About 100 yards. I refused to have any more beer; the prisoner called for the beer, and paid for it; he stood within the house; there was another belonging to him stood at the door; he wanted to push me farther into the house; that made me suspect him; I went and stepped up into my cart; I saw this piece of cloth and another lying without any wrapper; I took hold of my horse's head, and led him along towards my master's; the cloth was all safe then; the prisoner followed me, and asked me for one George, a dyer, who he said was in the woollen way, and said he would be obliged to me if I could find him out; I suspected him then; I said, if I heard of him, I would let him know; I had not the presence of mind to turn my head round; this man followed to my master's door; he then said, God bless you, good-b'y'; when I got to my master's door, I looked at the end of the cart, and missed a piece of cloth; I called out, I have lost a piece of cloth; then I ran down to Tabernacle Walk; I saw one of them running with the cloth under his arm; the prisoner, I believe it was; I ran, and halloo'd out, Step thief! stop thief! one ran one way, and another the other; I could not tell which it was; when I took the prisoner, who was the hindermost, I knew him directly; the cloth was thrown down; I am certain this is the cloth; the other ran; I passed the prisoner; he said, it is in vain for you to run, for they have got a mile now: this was about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes; I had tasted nothing but small beer all day, except that pint.</p>
               <p>Does it often happen that perfect strangers meet you, and ask you to drink? - I never met with such a thing in my life before; but it being holiday time, I thought they were some young fellows going out, making an holiday; I had some jealous thoughts of them after I had the pint of beer.</p>

I was sitting drinking tea: I saw a man, with a piece of cloth under his arm, move quick; and he looked over his right shoulder, to see if any body was running after him; presently after, I heard Cannon say, Where shall I go to find my cloth? I told him what I had seen; and presently after, the prisoner was brought back; I believe he is the person I saw with the cloth, but I am not sure.</p>

               <p>I am a saw-maker. I live in Barbican; I was in Tabernacle Walk this day week, about seven o'clock. I saw a man with a piece of cloth under his arm; he was about the prisoner's height, in a dark-coloured coat; he passed me; he had not got thirty yards past me, before there was an outcry of, Stop thief! I saw him drop the cloth by the Tabernacle Gates, and many people ran after him; I among the rest; we ran down Rus-in-urbe Gardens; we lost sight of him; I came back, and then they had got this man in custody.</p>

               <p>Did you swear there that he was not the man? - No: the justice would not hear any body that would speak for him.</p>

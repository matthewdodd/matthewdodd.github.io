                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mrs. Way<lb></lb>mouth, the wife of William Way mouth, by a former husband, and live with them at No. 30, Park-street, Islington. The female prisoner came into our service on the 26th of October—on the 23rd of December, about half-past five or a quarter to six o'clock in the evening, I had occasion to go from the upper part of the house to the store-closet in the basement to give out some articles—on passing down stairs I observed that the parlour and street doors were both shut—I was followed down stairs by Toye, who had a candle in her hand—she was in the habit of lighting the passage-lamp every evening at half-past five o'clock—she had not lit it that night—I remained below two or three seconds, and returned up stairs immedi<lb></lb>ately after—I then found the street-door wide open, and the parlour-door open, with a chair against it—a neighbour came across, and went for a policeman—we examined the premises immediately after, and missed the property stated—the cloaks had hung up in the hall; the writing-desk was on the parlour table; the tea-spoons had been placed in the tea-cups on the parlour table; the umbrellas were in the umbrella-stand in the hall; the table-cover was on the table; and the coats were folded up behind the front-parlour door, in a chair—it was Toye's duty to set the tea-things</p>

               <p>a little before six o'clock—they were set rather earlier than usual that evening—she had no directions to do that—when the discovery was made Toye inquired whether there was any money in the desk—she did not ap<lb></lb>pear particularly anxious about it—no suspicion attached to her then—we heard nothing more until the 6th of January, when Toye asked leave of absence for the afternoon, and said she should return about nine o'clock in the evening—she had permission to go, and did not return all night—on the following afternoon, between one and two o'clock, a boy with oranges came to ask for the keys of her boxes—I made inquiry of him—he told me from whom he came, and pointed out the male prisoner to me in the street—he was standing nearly opposite the house—one key was given to the boy by the other servant, but the boxes remained—between five and six o'clock that evening the prisoner Heaphy came himself to the house—I immediately knew him to be the person I had seen in the morning—I had seen him several times before at the house, talking to Toye—he took away Toye's boxes that night—I do not know what took place—my mamma was exceedingly ill at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and live in this house. On the 23rd of December I left my great coat, among other things, in the par<lb></lb>lour—I had been out the whole day—I returned about seven o'clock, and was informed what had happened—Toye asked me whether there was any money in my desk—I afterwards saw one of my coats at the office—I was not at home on the 6th of January when Toye went out—she did not return—on the 7th, about five o'clock, Heaphy came and said he had come from Elizabeth Toye, to say she was very unwell, and was sorry she could not return, but hoped to do so in two or three days, if her mistress liked her to return—(in consequence of suspicion I had procured a policeman to attend at my house—I (opened the door to Heaphy myself, expecting him to come that evening)—I asked him if he knew Elizabeth Toye—he said yes, he had known her some time—I said, "Are you any relative?"—he said, "Well, I have a very great affection for Elizabeth; and, to be candid with you, we have been some time living as man and wife "—this was in the hall—the officer was at this time in the kitchen—I then asked him to go below with me into the kitchen, and I questioned him more parti<lb></lb>cularly as to where Toye was, and got from him that she was waiting in the street—he said so to Mr. Redpath, a solicitor, who was in the house at the time—I sent for Toye, to where Heaphy said she was, and Mr. Red<lb></lb>path brought her back—her boxes were searched, by her consent—Heaphy manifested great willingness to have them searched before she came in, but I thought it right she should be present—I asked Heaphy where Toye was on the night she left—he said the reason was they had been to Drury-lane, and had a little too much to drink, having been at a raffle, and she could not return—she was present—they were afterwards allowed</p>

The blow did not hurt me much; I felt my watch go - it was a gold one, and had a gold chain and three seals - it might be worth 40l. or 50l. together; my watch-chain hung out. I saw the person who took the watch, and followed him; it was after the mud was thrown in my eyes that he took it, and whether he came in front of me I cannot say, but I saw him, followed him, and seized him by the shoulder, and am certain that was the person who took it - he had ran about fifteen yards before I took him; he then turned, struck me a violent blow in my mouth, and disengaged himself by struggling; and left a piece of his coat in my hand; I am certain he left it in my hand - I dropped it, pursued, and caught him again, about fifteen or twenty yards further - I then struck him - we had a struggle; he struck me, and he fell from a blow of mine; I fell upon him(this was in one of the narrow streets in St. Giles', I do not know the name) - he then disengaged himself again, and ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get away at that time? A. By struggling on the ground, and crawling on his chest; I followed him again a very little way, and then caught him by the skirt of his coat, and that came off in my hand; I dropped it, and pursued again; he ran about ten yards, and entered a house - I was about to go in, but was surrounded by an immense number of men and women, who had collected; they said if I did I should be most probably murdered, and I declined it; I am not able to say whether the prisoner is the man - I cannot form an opinion about it. I do not know what became of my watch.</p>

            . I am a cooper, in the employ of Mr. Ladd, a wine-merchant, and live opposite to where this robbery was committed; it was in George-street, a most notorious place; I was in the street, going to the permit-office; I saw the prosecutor coming up the street; there was a young woman following him, soliciting him to give her something to drink - that made me notice him; he put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and gave her a shilling - I was three or four yards off; I noticed, at the same time, that the chain and seals hung a long way down Mr. Helder's thigh; Mr. Helder then passed on, and the prisoner was waiting at the corner of a little street, called Ivy-street; immediately on Mr. Helder's coming up, the prisoner drew his watch from his fob; I saw his hand go up; Mr. Helder said, "You d-nation villian!" and immediately pursued him; he ran round the corner; I am quite sure the prisoner is the man - his face was familiar to me; he and his friends live in the same street as me; I lost sight of him for a moment, while they turned the corner; I ran up, immediately, and when I got to the corner Mr. Helder had hold of him, against the wall, endeavouring to take him into custody; the prisoner struggled with him for half a minute I suppose - they both fell on the ground, and Mr. Helder came nearly between my legs; the contention continued altogether about ten minutes; the prisoner's coat was torn almost to pieces in the contention; they came on to the end of Church-lane, and there Mr. Helder knocked him down; he got up again, and ran up the lane; Mr. Helder pursued him, and I saw no more of them at that time; I returned to my own place, because I had left my door open. I attended at Marlborough-street, nearly five weeks afterwards, and saw the prisoner; I was quite certain of his person. I had seen him walk up the street one evening, about three days after the robbery - he merely walked past.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said he lived in the street? A. Yes, with his father and mother; I do not know that they are his father and mother - I did not assist the prosecutor, because I had just recovered from a violent fit of illness - I saw no blow struck previous to taking the watch - I was then five or six yards from the prisoner, and behind Mr. Helder; the prisoner's face was towards me; a blow or push might have been given without my seeing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310110"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could a blow have been struck without your seeing it? A. Not if a man had lifted his arm up high; if he had run against him with his hand in his pocket I might not have seen that; if there was a blow it must have been so (making a sort of thrust) - Mr. Helder must be the best judge whether he was struck; I did not see it. The prisoner lives with his friends - I did not give information at any office; but I did to Furzman, the officer, the day following; I both named and described the prisoner, and saw him at the office five weeks after - I may have seen him twice in that interval - Mr. Helder appeared perfectly sober; I was pretty near him, but saw no blow. The prisoner was not an instant in his presence before he took the watch; he was waiting at the corner of the street - all the fighting and struggling I saw was afterwards - I solemnly swear the prisoner is the man, although his life depends on it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see any mud thrown? A. I did not, nor do I think there was any thrown - I did not observe any mud, my attention was so much taken with to the contension.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. HELDER. Q. This was at six o'clock in the evening? A. A little before six. I was going to my sister's in Bedford-square, and going the nearest way; I had dined at two o'clock; the mud, the blow, and the taking of the watch came all in a moment; it was not a raised blow; he struck me in the belly. I think the blow must have been given with one hand, and the watch taken with the other; the same person did both certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you quite certain the blow was given before the watch was taken? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What sort of a day was it? A. A lowery day; it had rained in the morning and the evening before - it was dirty there.</p>

I was in the employ of the prisoner, as a woodcutter—I cannot say exactly when it was, I was young at the time—it was before he and his first wife parted—they were married before I went to them—the last time I know of their living together is about eighteen years ago—the wife left the husband, and I went with her—shortly after that I came home and found her with a man named John Dowding—he slept with her one night, and I slept in the same bed—I was then nine years old; I am twenty-seven now—I then went back and lived with the prisoner at the same house in Cooper's-gardens, for seven or eight years—during that time I never saw his wife again.</p>

               <p>Q Did your wife make her any promise? - No, I am sure of it, because she was hardly in the room before I was; I sent for the constable, and when he came, she gave me the duplicates of things she had pawned, of her own accord; we could not go into the room not through the door, because she had put the key so far under the door, the constable was obliged to go and borrow a ladder to get in at the window to see what was gone; when we went in we found nothing gone except the sheets and bolster she gave the constable the duplicates of; I never saw her before she came to take the lodging; she appeared rather poor but the clothes she had on were very clean; I thought her a working person as she said she was, but I found she was not, and that made me want her to go out of my lodging.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective</hi>). Shortly after 9 p.m. on 7th Angust I saw a four-wheel cab stop at 79, Paul Street—Burke is the occupier of the house—Wilder and Burke brought out some rolls of carpet, which they pot into the cab—I told Burke I belonged to the police and asked him what he had got in the cab—he made no answer—I repeated the question several times and he said, "Only some stuff to sell for a man"—I had received on 5th August information of this and other burglaries in the neighbourhood and I watched Burke's place on the night of the 7th, having previously written him a letter the same night and saw it delivered to Burke in hi shop—shortly after my messenger left I saw Burke come out of the door and look excitedly up and down the street—he went inside and Wilder came out and returned with the four-wheeled cab and they put several bundles in and Wilder got inside and Burke on the box, and the cab drove off and I stopped it—the cab was then driven to Old Street Police Station, and Mr. Knott was sent for and identified the carpet as part of the proceeds of the burglary—after the charge had been taken down I returned with Constable Bandall to Burke's shop and found some silk and satin in a box under the window, and a backgammon work-table (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which has been since identified by Mr. Stringer, of 81, Curtain Road, from whom I had received a complaint—I found also some plates of silvered glass in the shop and cellar, which I have shown to Mr. Sanders, of Phipps Street; and in the cellar another backgammon table, which I have shown to Mr. Schwier of City Road, from whom I had received a complaint—on my return to the station I said to Burke, "I have found a quantity of silk and satin and some bed-ticking and some backgammon worktables, at your shop"—he said the silk was some sample patterns he had bought from a traveller, and the bed-ticking he had had by him for years, and the tables he bought from a man at the door—I searched him and found 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upon him.</p>

I am only engaged for Mr. Burke"—I think the hour when the burglary was committed was mentioned at the station before Wilder, but I did not hear him say anything about it—he said he could prove he was sleeping at home every night—I helped to search Burke's place and found this glazier's diamond (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a drawer with a key in it in the shop—I have shown it to Mr. Lang, of 44, Charlotte Street, who had made a complaint to me</p>

It will run to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "That is a very good job"—he said, "It's my father going to take some property away, because he expects the brokers in.

            . On Monday Evening, June the 12th, I was at Vauxhall, and got a little in Liquor; but I remember I had a Guinea in my Pocket, beside-Silver, when I came on this Side the Water. The Prisoner (I suppose) pick'd me up, and we went to a House-in <placeName id="t17380628-32-crimeloc161">Vinegar-Yard, by Russel Court</placeName>

I was so much fuddled, that I did not know where I was, 'till the Landlord wak'd me in my Chair the next Morning. He ask'd me where the Woman was, that I came in with? I told him I did not know the Woman that was with me; I saw you had a Guinea and some Silver in your Pocket last Night, says he; upon this I turn'd out my Pockets, - but all my Money was gone, except a few Halfpence, which were scatter'd about the Floor. The Landlord said, he knew her, but while we were talking about her, she came in, and he secur'd her. I don't swear to the Prisoner; the Landlord told me, she was the Person.</p>

            , Constable. Knowing the Prosecutor, and hearing of this unfortunate Story, - that he was at the Horse-shoe, in Russel-Court, Drury Lane, I went to the House, (the Landlord's Name is Rarisom ) and there I found the Landlord, the Prosecutor, and the Woman sitting together; this was about 9 or 10 the next Morning. They were all jangling together, and I would have had her confess'd the Money. Instead of that, she deny'd she took any Money from him. The Landlord said, that the Prosecutor shew'd him a Guinea and some Silver, when he came in, that he might not be afraid of his Reckoning. After a good many Words, she desired them to walk out, and she would speak to me; for I am an Antient Briton, and she is the same. I persuaded her to confess, and at last she pull'd out a Pair of Mittens, with 6 s. and 6 d. in them, which she confess'd was the Property of the Prosecutor, and said she had no more. Then I carry'd her before Justice Hilder; and after he had examin'd her, she was search'd by his Maid and another Woman, and while her Rags were some off and some on, 6 d. dropp'd from them, and another 6 d. was taken out of the Crown of her Head: But this Money, she said, was none of the Prosecutor's. Upon this the Justice committed her to the Gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Money I had about me, was my own; I never was in Jail before in my Life. When they took me, I was frighted, and did not know what to say, or do. If I had had more Money about me, I should have let them have had it all. <rs id="t17380628-32-verdict162" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and occupy apartments at No. 85, Hatton-garden. The female prisoner was in the service of the landlord—I know nothing of the male—I only came into the house a few days before she went away, and during that time she did not attend to me, although she was to have done so—she had access to my apartments—the last I saw of her was on the Monday after Christmas-day—when she was gone, I missed some wine out of my room down stairs—I cannot tell precisely how much, but I missed two bottles of claret and several bottles of sherry—I certainly missed four pint bottles of sherry and I believe one quart bottle—I saw them last on the day before Christmas-day, when I brought them in and placed them in the parlour I occupied—there were no locks to the cupboard or door, and I left the hamper open—I never saw the wine or the bottles after—I did not know I had lost it until the Tuesday, and then, in consequence of what I was informed, I searched the basket and found some had been taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live at No. 85, Hatton-garden; I have a lease of the house. Mr. Underwood had apartments there—Dowman was in my service, as housekeeper, for seven weeks or two months—she had the entire charge of the house, to wait on me and my lodgers—I did not know Smith till after this matter—I understand he passed as the husband of Dowman—I left town on the 24th of Dec., and returned on Monday, the 29th—Dowman had then left—Smith came to the house that afternoon, and I taxed him with being concerned in taking five or six bottles of wine—he denied it at first, and then said he had some wine which Dowman had given him to drink, and he imagined she had liberty to have it—I asked how much he had—he thought there might have been a bottle—I asked if he thought there were two—he said he did not think they had had two; he was sure they had not had three—I asked if he had four or five, and he acknowledged that he had had part of five with her—he had no business at my house—I cannot tell how he came there, but I had desired, if he came, that I should be called down to him—I saw nothing of Dowman till she was at the station—Smith acknowledged to me that he had been at my house from Saturday night till Monday morning, and that the whole of the wine was drank on the Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a charwoman. I was at the house of Mr. Linton on the Saturday after Christmas-day, the 27th—Mr. Linton was from home at that time—I went there on the Wednesday before Christmas-day, and never left the house after that—both the prisoners were in the house on the 27th—Dowman was living in the house—Smith came on the Saturday about half-past three o'clock, and he remained till Monday morning about half-past eight—he slept in the house on those nights—on the Monday morning I found five bottles in the kitchen cupboard, and one on the dresser—I think there were three pints, and the rest large—they were empty—I could smell there had been wine in them—Smith left on Monday morning about half-past eight—I saw Dowman about half-past nine that morning—she said she was very ill—I went out with her, and as we returned, and I was unlocking the door, think<lb></lb>ing she was coming in with me, she absconded, and did not come into the house any more—she seemed very low and very ill—I was in Mr. Under<lb></lb>wood's room about half-past eleven on Monday morning—there was a hamper there, and the straw from it was littered about the room—Mr. Underwood's room was unlocked on the Saturday night—I was generally in that apartment every day—I had been away on the Sunday—I first saw the littering of the straw on the Monday—the hamper and straw were in the room on the Satur<lb></lb>day—Mr. Underwood slept in the second floor.</p>

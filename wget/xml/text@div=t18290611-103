            . I am a clerk in the drawing-office of the Bank of England; the Bank keep cash the same as private bankers. The prisoner came to the drawing-office on a Saturday in May, and presented me a cheque for 4l. 13s. 7d.; this is it (looking at it); it purports to be drawn by Parrinton and Son - the Bank have no account with that house; I asked him if his name was Ridgeway, being the name in the body of it; he said it was not; I said, "For whom do you receive it?" he said,"For Mr. Ridgeway;" I asked him in what way he would receive it; he said "Cash" - I handed it over to Mr. George Griffith, and said that gentleman would pay him; Griffith immediately left the office for an officer; the prisoner staid before me, expecting to receive the cash - an officer was brought, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who are the firm that cash at the Bank? A.Parrinton and Son; the signature in the cheque bears very little resemblance to theirs - it is spelt Parrontin; we do not pay cheques under 5l.; they are drawn at times, but we invariably refuse them, except in special cases - if a person drew for a balance under 5l. it would be paid, but not under any other circumstance. I never knew the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. The Bank could not be defrauded by that cheque, as it never would have been paid? A. I cannot say it would not have been paid; I should not have paid it unless under special circumstances - I did not examine their account, to see if it was the balance.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GRIFFITH. I am a principal in the Drawing-office at the Bank. I received this cheque from Wheeler on the 16th of May, and marked it before I parted with it - the prisoner was detained when Leadbetter, the officer, came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He staid of his own accord till the officer came? A. Yes - I went for the officer myself; I had not the slightest hesitation of the cheque being forged.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did the prisoner know you were going for an officer? A. I should think not - I was not gone many minutes.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Strickland, who keeps a coffee-house in Little Queen-street, Holborn. - The prisoner came there one evening - I do not recollect the date, or the day of the week; I found him there when I came home - he slept there: he went out next morning and I went into his room - nothing attracted my attention that morning he remained there; a few mornings after I was sweeping his room, and saw a bundle under the bed; I lifted it up, and some sand came out of it - it was his bundle; I had seen him bring it in, and nobody else slept there - on seeing the sand come out, I opened the bundle, and found several printed papers; I called my cousin, showed him one, and he looked at the others; an officer came, and apprehended the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was his bundle in a handkerchief, or what? A. In a handkerchief; I am sure I had seen him bring that bundle into the house - I was not at home when he first came, but he took the lodging for a month, after the first night, and I saw him bring the bundle in - nobody but him used the room; the last tenant had been gone a fortnight.</p>
               <p>RICHARD STRICKLAND. I keep a coffee-house, No. 38, Little Queen-street. The prisoner came there on Thursday, the 7th of May - I did not see him bring the bundle in; he asked for a lodging for the night, which I let him have, and next day he engaged the lodging for a month - he remained there till he was apprehended: Curtis showed me the papers in his bed-room - I took one of them into my custody, and took it to the Bank, but the Bank was closed, and I gave it to Collins to take there the next day.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL COLLINS. I am Strickland's uncle - he brought a sheet of blank cheques to me, containing four, and at his request I took them to the Bank of England -I gave them to Mr. Griffith; I did not lose sight of them while in my possession.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street, Police-office. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, the 16th of May, in the drawing-office at the Bank; I took him into a private room, and asked him where he had received the cheque which was in the possession of the cashier - he said he had found it on the Thursday preceding, on Snow-hill; I asked if he was in a situation - he said he was not - I asked if he had been living with Parrinton and Son; I believe he said he had - I searched him, but found nothing - he said he had found the cheque, and would not have presented it had it been advertised - that he had looked in the paper, and it was not advertised, and he thought he had a right to present it; I asked him if any person came to the Bank with him - he said there was a young man, who I saw; I asked where he had been lodging - he said at a coffee-shop in Little Queen-street; I went there, and searched the room which Strickland showed me, and I found eight sheets of cheques, and part of a sheet with three cheques on it - I produce them; this cheque tallies with one of them: it is No. 2057 - the first number on the sheet is 2058; this is the sheet containing the three cheques.</p>

            , JUN. I am in partnership with my father, in King-street, Cheapside; our firm is Parrinton and Son - we keep an account at the Bank: neither of these cheques are signed by me, nor by any body authorised to sign for our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Why, your name is not to them? A. The one for 4l. 17s. is spelt tin and Paro, as well as I can tell, but here is a blot - the prisoner was in our employ at one time.</p>

               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Was he in your employ? A. We employed him as a porter occasionally - nobody signs cheques but me; my father never signs them - it is not his writing: the prisoner was never employed to obtain cheques from the Bank; we draw on this description of cheques.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He of course knew your names perfectly well? A. He did; he bore a good character in our service, and has left us six weeks or two months, only a few weeks before the cheque is dated.</p>
               <p>MR. GRIFFITH. There is no Parrontin and Son keep cash at the Bank, nor any name like it, except the prosecutors; these cheques were applied for for Parrinton and Son, and the cheques presented are drawn on cheques furnished by that application.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Who writes the receipt for them? A. The person applying for them - we only insert the figures - the receipt is spelt correctly.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Do not you take a receipt in a book as well as on the counterpart of the cheques? A. Yes - we make a memorandum in the pass-book, but that was not in my possession at the time; it used to be customary not to deliver out cheques unless we had the pass-book, but for the last year that has been discontinued.</p>
               <p>Q. I think within the last year I have been refused cheques for not having my pass-book? A. I think you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110046"></xptr>must be mistaken - it is always the practice to produce the pass-book or a note from the person sending for the cheques.</p>
               <p>RAYNES KELLY. I delivered out these cheques in the usual way: to the best of my belief the person produced a written order, which is usual; I then make a memorandum of the numbers of the cheques delivered, and the party signs it - if the pass-book is brought we enter them there, but if it is a written order we make no further memorandum - I delivered these to a written order, which has been destroyed; we do not keep them: it comes from the party themselves - I should not deliver cheques without an order or the pass-book.(The cheque was here put in and read.)</p>

             was with me, and had hold on my arm; the prisoner at the bar, and two others, rushed out of an entry; he clapped hold on my left shoulder; I asked what he wanted? he knocked me down; I had several blows from him and the others. I called out murder, and watch; the other men made off: the prisoner kept on his blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel or dispute between them and you in the street?</p>
               <p>Owen. No, there was not. I held my hand up a-cross my head, to keep off the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he strike you with?</p>
               <p>Owen. It was something short and heavy, I took it to be a stick. I saw my hat in his hand, I said he had stole my hat. He said, if I made any noise, he would knock my brains out, and took something up and throwed at me as I lay on the ground. A man and his wife called out at a window; then he made off, and threw my hat away, seeing the watchman coming, and said, D - n you, there's your hat; I went and took it up about 10 yards from where I lay. The prisoner was taken up the next day, and offered any money to be let go away; he was carried before the justice, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070008"></xptr> I gave the same account as now: he owned there that he had the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Owen. No, I never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he demand any thing of you?</p>
               <p>Owen. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in that house he came out of?</p>
               <p>Owen. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any women at the door of that house?</p>

            . I live in Buckle street. Upon hearing murder and watch called, I went and opened my window, and saw the prisoner beating the prosecutor on the ground; there was another man there, but he made off in an instant: it was right against my window. The prosecutor got up, and said, Stop thief, I have lost my hat; the prisoner flung it away, and said, if you make any noise, I'll take a brick and knock your brains out, he spoke that as to himself. He took up something, whether a brick or a stone, I know not; he flung it at the prosecutor, but it missed him; he then made off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thorp. I heard murder called in a very lamentable manner, I went out of my own door, and stopt the prisoner; he asked what he had done? I said, if you have done nothing but what is right, you will be let to go again; he made a slender excuse; he pretended the prosecutor and his companion had hit a window-shutter with a stick, which brought him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say they had broke a window?</p>
               <p>Thorp. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of October, I had been at Rumford Market, I left the market-place about seven in the evening, and went towards home; my father lives in a court in the Minories; going along Buckle-street, I went in at the Bunch of Grapes; there was a pot of beer on the table; I sat down, and in about half an hour, somebody coming by, hit their stick against the window shutters: I went to the door, and said you have broke the window, I hope you will make recompence for the damage done. Mr. Owen said, I'll knock you down, if you don't go away; he had a stick in his hand; I laid hold of that, we both fell down; after that he followed me with the stick, attempting to hit me; we got to pulling one another about for 7 or 8 minutes, the other man calling murder at the same time. I said to the landlord, I would go and call a watchman; for they were breaking the windows. I went to the watchman, and said, Come and take charge of a man for breaking the windows; then they gave him charge of me, for striking him and his companion. I went with them readily to the watch-house, and Mr. Owen was so drunk that he made a disturbance all the night there. I was in the Bail-dock. The next morning we went before Mr. Pell at the Angel and Crown; he asked him whether I demanded his money; he answered, no In the evening Mr. Owen and Mr. Roberts came to Clerkenwell to me, and said, if I had not charged them with breaking the windows, they would not have appeared against me. He said he would go home and drink with my mother, and discharge me in the morning.</p>

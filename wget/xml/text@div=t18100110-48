            . Q. Do you know any thing more to alledge against the prisoner Connor, than what you related last night - A. I saw him take sheets and different things out of her hand in the street; when he saw me, he run and hid himself. I do not know of his being present when any thing was stolen by the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever articles she took she possessed herself of some time before, did not she - A. Yes; but those things which he took from her, she had taken that evening some few minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles that you are speaking of now - A. A petticoat, a frock trimmed with lace; they were the property of other persons, in my care to be mangled. She had them in her possession when she was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in company with her when she took them, was he - A. No.</p>

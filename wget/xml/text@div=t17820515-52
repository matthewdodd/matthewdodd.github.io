               <p>I am a night-man. On the 9th of May, between four and five in the morning, as I was going along with my cart, in a lane that leads from Whitechapel to the New Road, I saw the prisoner, with the lead rolled up upon his shoulder. He had nothing over it.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the prosecutor's house? - About the 8th of a mile. Upon seeing me, he threw it over some pales into a rope-ground, and went on towards St. George's turnpike. I followed him, and stopped him opposite the house the lead was taken from. I desired him to come back and take the lead he had thrown over into the rope-ground. He said he knew nothing of it. I told him he was the man, and must go back with me. He was never out of my sight. He offered me a pint of purl to let him go. I said, I would not. I took him back, and found the lead that has been produced. My master said he would take care of him while I got the lead; but as soon as I let go of him, he threw down his bag and ran away, but I pursued him, and took him immediately.</p>

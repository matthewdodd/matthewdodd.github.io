               <p>I am servant to Colonel Glover; the prisoner came to our house with a waggon of coals, and de livered a ticket to me, expressing that there were twenty-six sacks of coals in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you got the ticket here? - A. No; it was left with Mr. Addington, at Bow-street; I went down into the kitchen when I had received the ticket of the woman servant, before the men shot them; I went to see the sacks told, the prisoner told twenty-five sack to me; I asked him where the other sack was, he said, it was a mistake; he looked behind him, and it was then standing in the waggon; there were six sacks then in the waggon; he shot another sack out of the cart, and I asked what he was going to do with the rest; he said, his master had got a chaldron of coals to deliver in Tottenham-court-road, and the rest were to come in the next waggon; he drove away from the door with five full sacks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. John Shortridge, trading under the firm of Yeovil, Shortridge, and Co., a wine merchant, at No. 17, Mark Lane. The counting house is on the ground floor—there are two rooms; a front one and a back room—there is an iron safe in the front count<lb></lb>ing house—the key of the safe is kept in a desk in the same counting house—that desk is open during the day—at night it is locked, and the key is put into a sample chest—on Wednesday, 28th Jan., I received two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Currie and Co., the bankers—one I sent to the Custom House in pay<lb></lb>ment of duty, the other I put into the cash box that was kept in the iron safe—I did not have occasion to open the cash box till the morning of the 30th—when I opened it, the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was not there—there are two clerks in the office; one besides myself—Mr. Shortridge and Mr. Chip, the other clerk, have access to the safe—the prisoner was employed to clean the count<lb></lb>ing house, after we had gone of a night—she was employed at the beginning of the year, until she was taken into custody—her husband was not in the employ of Mr. Shortridge—it was my duty to pay her for her services in keeping the offices clean—I did not at any time pay her that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I have not paid it away to any one—I am quite sure of it—that is the note that I put into the cash box on the afternoon of the 28th—I took no memo<lb></lb>randum of the number or date; I cannot speak to it positively, only by having obtained the number after I had missed it—I did not take any notice of any part of the notes when I received them from Messrs. Currie—I did when I paid one away to the Customs; I wrote the name of Shortridge on it—this is not the note that I paid away at the Custom House.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Shortridge, and have been so more than forty-five years. I recollect seeing Walton, the porter, give Lorton two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; he was sent to the bankers for them on 28th Jan.—I did not use any of the contents of the cash box between the afternoon of 28th Jan. and the 30th; I abstained from doing so in consequence of great deficiencies—that reason makes me recollect it better—I was present on the 30th, when Lorton took out the cash box from the iron safe—at that time he missed the note—I do not think I opened the safe on the morning of 30th Jan., nor for several mornings before that—I usually locked up the safe at night—it was my duty to do so every evening, being there later, and attending to the business that had to be done, principally in the cellar—I have no doubt I locked it up on the 28th—the key of the desk in which the key of the safe is kept, is kept in a sample chest—the sample chest is locked; I have the key in my pocket—I do not think I opened the chest on the 30th—I do not recollect whether Lorton took the key of the desk out of the sample chest, or whether I did—Lorton kept one key of the sample chest, and I another—when I left the counting house in the evening I gave the key to the prisoner, or her husband; I generally gave it to her—I am quite certain that the sample chest was perfect on the morning of the 30th.</p>

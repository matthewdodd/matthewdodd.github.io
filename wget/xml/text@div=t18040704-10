               <p>Q. Had he any body with him? - A. He seemed to be alone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see this transaction? - A. No, I received the prisoner and the book of Mr. Smith. (Produces the book.) This is the book, and that is the young man I received of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>(The book and note identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

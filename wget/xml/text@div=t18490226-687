                  </hi> I am a labourer. I knew Edward Rumball the de<lb></lb>ceased—on the evening of 5th Feb., about seven o'clock, I went with him and several others to the Anchor, Dove-row, Haggerstone—Rumball had bad several pots of beer, and was not sober—a quarrel arose between him and a man named Hunt, and they got up to fight—they struck at each other, closed, and fell across the fender, Rumball undermost—they got up again—Rumball did not appear to be hurt—no complaint was made by either of them—they did not fight any more, but sat down on different sides of the room—I left the room—I afterwards looted through the glass-door and saw Hunt bleeding, and when the door was opened I saw Rumball lying on the floor<lb></lb>he was carried out, and died almost directly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been with Rumball all the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he drank no spirits, nothing but porter—he has worked on the railway, but generally worked in the brick-fields in the summer—he weighed about twelve stone—Hunt was his mate—I did not see him quarrel with any one before Hunt—Hunt was taller than him, but not so heavy.</p>

                  </hi> I was at the Anchor—a quarrel took place between Rumball and Hunt; Rumball began it—he used some irritating language and struck Hunt with his elbow, and provoked him to fight—after they bad struck at each other, they closed and fell down, Rumball undermost, with his shoulder across the fender—he got up without assistance—I told Hunt he had better not get fighting with his mate—he said, "Well, I wont fight him, for he does not know how to hit again"—Rumball was tipsy—he still tried to provoke Hunt; calling him a coward, and laughing and jeering at him—he did not appear injured by the fall—the prisoners were in the room at this time, but had not interfered—about twenty minutes after the quarrel with Hunt, Hunton got into the middle of the room and said, "You struck my father, now here is his boy that will <hi rend="italic">whack</hi> you"—his father-in-law was in the room—the deceased then said, "Oh, very well, "and began to take his clothes off—they both took off their frocks and waistcoats—Parrott stood by Hunton as his second, and he said, "Go in <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and hit from your shoul<lb></lb>der"—I saw Hunton strike Rumball in the face, somewhere between the cheek and neck, with great force—it caused him to fall into a sitting position, and in a moment or two after he slid sideways off the form on to the ground—he never spoke a word from the time he was struck—I saw as he was raised that his face was of a bluish colour, and said he was either dead or dying<lb></lb>he was carried out, and I believe he died before he was got out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you were quite sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Hunton was not, but he was not so drunk as Rumball—when he fell across the fender he fell close at my feet—I did not see that he struck the back of his head against the stone; I could not have been off seeing it if he had: it did not happen—Hunton's father-in-law is a hearty old man.</p>

                  </hi> I was at the Anchor on Monday night, the 5th, in the tap-room—I looked through the glass, and saw Hunton standing up to fight, and Rumball standing, doing something to the belt of his waistband; he had his frock off—he seemed perfectly well then—Hunton struck him somewhere about the neck or face, and knocked him into a seat—I then saw him roll off the seat on to the floor.</p>
               <p>*******<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN RICHARD MORGAN</hi> I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased, and saw him outside the Anchor, supported by several persons—he was quite dead—next day, in company with Mr. King, a dresser at the London Hospital, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the brain, caused by some external violence—I found a slight abrasion on the forehead, and at the back of the head was a large <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi>, and a quantity of extravasated blood escaped from that part; that injury, I think, was done by a blow—it is my decided opinion that the first blow caused the mischief, and the. second caused the death—I found clotted blood, with effusion in the ventricles of the brain, and I believe that arose from the injury at the back of the head.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the pressure of that blood on the brain the imme<lb></lb>diate cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my opinion—if, by the first blow, extra<lb></lb>vasation was caused, I think the shock of the second would cause death more rapidly; but I consider the first blow to be the primary cause of death—he might be able to stand up and fight after receiving that blow, because it might only take a small effect on him at first; he would gradually become worse.</p>

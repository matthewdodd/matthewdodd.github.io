On the 6th of June, about twenty minutes or a quarter before nine o'clock at night, I locked up the stable; I returned about a quarter past ten, and found the three prisoners there - Smith stood with the door ajar; I said, "What are you doing here?" I collared him and led him out - he whispered to me, and said there were two more in the stable. He was about a yard within the door; I held him fast, and pulled the door too with my left hand. Wheeler, the groom, locked the door, and called the watchman. I held Smith. A watchman came, and called two others; we opened the door, went in, and found Wright and Wells in the stable; they had moved from the bed-room to the stable five coats, three pairs of breeches, two stable jackets, a silk handkerchief and other things - I had seen them all in the bed-room(which is over the coach-house, and is part of the stable) that afternoon; they all laid loose on the stable floor - one coat was tied in a silk handkerchief, which did not belong to us - they were livery coats. The stable joins master's house, and is surrounded by the same wall - there is a way through the house into the stable.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Drummond. I was with Benwell, and saw all the men secured, and saw the clothes which had been removed; Smith had three of the coachman's coats on his back, besides his own, when we took him - they are all strangers. It was a quarter or twenty minutes before nine when we left the stable; we found them there about twenty minutes to ten - it was quite night.</p>

               <p>The prisoners put in the following Defence: - The Defence of the prisoners sheweth, that on the 7th of June, about ten o'clock in the evening, we went down the mews for a necessary purpose, when a genteel looking man came and asked if we could inform him where he could find a porter, as he wanted some goods moved; we said we could not, but, being out of employ, we would do it for him - he showed us the stable door, and told us there were some bundles and linen there, which we were to carry to the Feathers public-house, at the corner of Brown-street, and he would wait there for us; we went there by his desire - the coachman came in immediately, laid hold of Smith, and shut the door; we knocked inside, and he called the watchman. We hope you will shew us mercy, as we are entirely innocent, but were led into it by this man.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Smith a good character.</p>

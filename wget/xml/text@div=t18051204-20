               <p>Q. Upon missing your box what did you do? - A. I went to all the pawnbrokers down Shoreditch, till I came to Mr. Davison the pawnbroker.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other of your property there? - A. Yes, another shirt and a cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040024"></xptr>handkerchief. I told the pawnbroker that was my property; he said the lad had just run out of the door that brought it in; Mr. Martin and me run out of the door after him; he had not pawned it, he had offered it to sell. When the lad saw me come in the shop, I suppose he ran out. Martin took the boy, but he was rescued from me by three women; I followed behind and took the prisoner William Gross, the father, with a bundle upon him of mine, tied up in a coloured handkerchief; I laid hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he had got there; he said it was his own property; I looked the man in the face and I knew him, and he trembled a great deal; then I said let me look at the bundle; he said you may, but it is my property; I looked at it, and saw that it was part of the property that I had lost; I took him back to Mr. Davidson's the pawnbroker, and gave charge of him to an officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live with my parents, at Caledonian Street—I am errand boy to Mr. Walker, of 9, Caledonian Street—the prisoner and her husband lodged there—on Saturday, 22nd April, she sent me for a pint of porter, and gave me a half-crown to pay for it—I had no money about me at the time—I went to the Queen's Arms, which is two or three minutes' walk—I saw Miss Marsh, the barmaid there, and asked her for the porter—it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she served me, and I handed her the half-crown to pay for it—she put it in the tester, and then sent for a policeman, 28 <hi rend="italic">Y R</hi>—she asked me who gave it to me—she did not let me go till a policeman came—he went with me to the prisoner's lodging—I left the beer, and took the jug back—the policeman took the half-crown—I called the prisoner up, and the policeman said to her "Your half-crown is bad"—she said "I did not know it"—he asked if she had got any more silver about her, and she said "No"—he said "Turn out your pockets"—she did so, and there was a half-crown, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he bounced the half-crown on the ground—he said she must go with him to the Queen's Arms—she put on her bonnet, and went—I went, too—I heard Miss Marsh say the second half-crown was bad—I went to the station with the policeman and the prisoner—I did not hear what passed on the way to the station; I was in front.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Queen's Arms, in the Caledonian Road—I serve in the bar—the house where the prisoner lodges is thirty or forty doors off, I should think—on Saturday afternoon, 22nd April, about 4.30, the little boy came in, and I served him with a pint of porter, which was 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he handed me a half-crown—I tried it, and found it was bad—I asked him where he brought it from—he told me—I detained him, and sent for a constable—I gave the constable the half-crown, and he left, with the boy—he came back shortly after, with the prisoner and the boy, and I gave her in charge—the policeman gave me another half-crown,</p>

               <p>which I discovered was also bad—when the policeman showed it to me, he said "I think this is a good one"—I said "No, it is not good; it is bad, like the other"—I saw it was bad, the moment it was handed to me, and I afterwards broke it in the detector—it was a very good imitation, indeed—the prisoner said "I hope you won't give me in custody, after knowing me so long"—I said it was my duty to do so—I have known her for years, I daresay.</p>

I found the first witness there. Miss Marsh told me something, and gave me a bad half-crown. In consequence of what the boy told me, I went with him to 9, Caledonian Street; I saw the prisoner there. The boy said 'That is the woman who gave me the half-crown, and sent me for the beer.' I said to her 'It is a bad one.' She said 'I did not know it.' I said 'Have you any more silver in your pocket? She said 'No.' I said 'Turn your pocket out, and let me see.' She turned her pocket out, and there was a half-crown, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers. She gave me the half-crown. I said 'I don't know whether it is a good one or a bad one; but it looks very well.' I sounded it on the floor, and I could not tell then whether it was good or bad. I said 'You must go into the Queen's Arms, along with me.' When we got there, I saw the last witness. I said 'This is all the money she has got; it is another half-crown; I think it is a good one, but I am not sure.' Miss Marsh said 'Oh, that's a bad one, too,' and she broke the second one, and said she should give the prisoner in custody. On the way to the station, the prisoner said 'For God's sake, policeman, don't you say you found the second piece; if you do, I know it will go hard with me. You keep that, and I will see you when I come out.' I produce both half-crowns; one I took from the prisoner at her house. Both are bad." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined:</hi> "I could not tell it was bad; I am not much of a judge. Prisoner said she did not know it was bad. When I offered Miss Marsh the half-crown, prisoner said 'Perhaps you'll say that is bad.' Prisoner was searched at the station.")</p>

               <p>I am a coach-wheelwright's wife; I was at Mr. Thirlwall's, these people were in before me; while I was getting a receipt for some taxes, some poors rates; I see the man put his hand on the counter, and take something and put it in his pocket, he turned out of the shop, and I told Mr. Thirlwall of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what it was he took? - No. He sent the shopman out after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him take something. Did he go out directly? - No, I believe he was looking at some stockings, he bought the stockings afterwards, and paid for them, and then he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go out together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the woman do any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them brought back? - No, I went home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What was it that I put in my pocket? - It was something that you took out of a blue paper, the blue paper was on the counter; and it was something from under that paper, while the shopman was gone to get the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what it was? - No, I cannot say what it was.</p>
               <p>Court to Stevens. When the alarm was given you went in pursuit of the persons immediately? - I went towards Smithfield, I mistook the way; and after going towards Smithfield, coming back I looked up St. John's-lane, and see them crossing St. John's-lane, I went up St. John's-lane, and met them, and told the man he must come along with me; almost at the same time Mr. Dobson called, you have lost your handkerchief, sir. I turned about immediately, and picked up a remnant of cambrick, I was convinced at that time the man was a thief, and I seized him; then Mr. Dobson called out, there are more goods you have dropped, or something to that purpose; I looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200143"></xptr>about, and see the two other remnants laying on the ground; I begged Mr. Dobson would give them to me, he seemed to hesitate, till I told him the man was a thief, and where I came from; he gave them to me, and I took the man home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? - She ran away in the mean while, she ran under an arch way, and was out of sight immediately; when I passed the arch way she was out of sight; I told Mr. Thirlwall to take care of the man, while I went in search of the woman; I went back again, and searched two or three houses in this yard, it was no thoroughfare, and I was told she was hid, and she ran out of a front door, and a woman told me, and I ran after her, and took her in George's court, in St. John's-lane, and took her home, and the constable was charged with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you got in your hand there? - The three remnants that were picked up, a remnant of buttiller, a kind of muslin, and India article, and two remnants of cambrick.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of those been sold by you? - Neither; he had bought some cambrick, one eighth, which was in the parcel that I took from the woman; I searched the man's pockets, nothing was found in them belonging to us; I did not search the woman, there was a lady in the house that did, there was nothing found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things that he bought? - I gave them to him at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had them in possession when they were taken? - The woman, she gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did these remnants drop? - I did not see them, I supposed the man dropped them, Mr. Dobson said it was the man dropped them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why were not three pieces brought against me at the first hearing at the magistrate's? there was only two brought then? - In the hurry of the moment I forgot the piece that I picked up myself, and put into my pocket.</p>

               <p>I am a grocer in St. John's-lane, Clerkenwell. On Tuesday last, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar (Archer) passed by my door, and dropped two or three pieces like handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to drop them, by accident? - That I don't know; I calls out, you have dropped your handkerchiefs; at that instant I see the prosecutor's servant take hold of him, and to him I gave the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they dropped from the prisoner? - I am certain of it, there was nobody by, I was unloading a load of sugar, and the carman was in the cart, consequently it could not fail from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the woman? - I see nothing of the woman at that time, about ten minutes after that I see Stevens in pursuit of the woman who ran up George's-court, and Stevens took hold of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know the reason he did not swear to the things the first time I was before the justice? - It is not to be supposed that I can swear to things that I had not above a moment in my hands; one piece I think I can remember by the small stripes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Stevens. These are all the same pieces you received of Mr. Dobson? - Two of them are.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property were they? - Mr. Thirlwall's, all three of them, I know them by the shop mark.</p>
               <p>Harris. They all three belong to Mr. Thirlwall, I sold him no cambrick at all, only a square of muslin.</p>

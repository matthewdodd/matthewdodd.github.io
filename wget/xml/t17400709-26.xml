               <p>Houston. She carried away my Watch and Chain the 14th of June last. I happen'd to be taken in Liquor that Night, and this Woman met me in <placeName id="t17400709-26-crimeloc135">Rosemary Lane</placeName>

She told me she'd carry me to a good Lodging; and when she had got me there, she stripped me of all. I afterwards got Intelligence of my Things, by her, and by others, whom she had employed to sell them. My Watch this Gentleman has in Custody now, but I had it in my Fob, before I missed it. As to the House - I can't tell what House it was,- for I was so drunk. that I don't know where I went with her. I lost my Watch, and there was a Silver Chain to the Watch; and I lost a Silver Knee-buckle besides, and 2 Silk Handkerchiefs, and about 7 s.6 d. in Money; and several other little, small trifling Things, not worth mentioning; but I neither know where I lost them, nor where she carried me. I was in no Company but her's,- as I know of And she was the Person that offered to sell my Watch and this Man was so good as to stop it.</p>

             . On the 13th of June an old Woman brought this Watch to my House,- I forget her Name; but she was bound over to appear here,- I asked the Old Woman some Questions about it, which she not answering to my Satisfaction, I told her I must stop it, till I found the Owner. She told me, she would bring the Owner to me presently, and so she stepped to the Prisoner (who stood about 3 or 4 Doors off) and brought her to me. I asked her, How she came by the Watch? And she told me, her Brother gave it her. This was the 13th of June, and on the 14th she was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor gave it me for lodging with me.</p>
               <p>Houston. It was Friday the 13th of June,- in the night-time, when I was in Company with the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Warner. It was on Friday she brought the Watch to me. This is the Watch; it was brought to me without a Chain.</p>
               <p>Houston . This is mine: I know it by the Man's Name who made it.</p>
               <p>Warner . The next Day the Prosecutor came to me, and said, he was informed I had stopped the Watch. I asked him if he could find out the Prisoner; if he could,(I told him) I would go before a Justice, and he should have the Watch. The next Day he produced the Prisoner, and Justice Dennet bound him and me, and the Old Woman over to appear against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He pick'd me up one Night, as I was going Home; He was drunk, and I was not very sober. He asked me, if I had a Room to go to? I told him Yes; then he said, he would go home with me, and when he came there, he laid himself down upon the Bed. Then I asked him to give me a Pot of Beer; He gave me 6 d. to fetch the Beer, and I gave him the Change. After this, he gave me 6 d. and then he gave me his Watch; I put it into his Hand again, but he forced me twice to have it. <rs id="t17400709-26-verdict136" type="verdictDescription">

            ; we live on the ground floor. The things mentioned in the indictment were in a chest of drawers between the window and the bed. I went out about seven in the evening, and returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at most. There is a great gate; as I came in I saw a man sitting down at the door; I said it was an indecent place to ease himself in; I staid till he came away. When he had buttoned up his breeches the prisoner came over the gate, upon which I looked in at the parlour window and saw the drawers were all open; I clapped my hand on the prisoner, and said he had robbed me; he gave me a knock and ran away; I cried stop thief! and Mr. Distan pursued him and took him by the wooden rails at Fleet-ditch. There was a pair of silk stockings found upon him; I then went in and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Waterloo-street, Limehouse, and am a policeman. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 4th of December, I went to this workshop and saw the prisoner, and there were ten or twelve feet of leaden pipe turned up, but not cut—it was unnailed from the roof, and the prisoner was there—when I first saw him I took hold of him, and a short scuffle ensued, but seeing I had assistance he laid down apparently drunk and asleep, and we appeared to have a hard matter to awake him—we then got a ladder and got him down, and then he could walk as well as</p>

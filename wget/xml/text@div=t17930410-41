               <p>Q. Were these men talking together do you know? - I did not see them talking together; they came out of the house as near together as possibly could be; as soon as they heard the cry of stop thief they throwed down the things, and a witness that is here see them do it, and this man was never out of my sight till he was taken; I am sure I did not lose sight of the prisoner after he threw the things down from under his arm; he was brought back to my house, and from there he was taken to the New Compter; I saw him brought back to my house and I went with him to the Compter and things likewise, and the things were given into the hands of Mr. Prior; these two boxes contained all the articles; the things here are only the things that were in this paste board box, the other box has not been meddled with.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go back to your room after you took the prisoner? - In less than two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you conceive they got into the room? - They must pick both the locks; there is a lock which is fastened on the door, and a padlock outside; neither of the locks were broke, neither the one nor the other, and the lock, which was the padlock, was found behind some tubs close against the door, in the same stair case, the staples were not in the least injured they were all as when I went out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This you say is your dwelling house; - I rent two rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down first in the morning and left your wife at home, you left the keys with her of course? - I never see any thing more of them till she brought them to me.</p>

               <p>Q. So that if the indictment states that no person was in the dwelling house, it is not so. You know that you have indicted this man capitally? - I suppose it is for a capital offence.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever heard there was a reward for convicting a house breaker? - I have.</p>

               <p>I am a cutler and headborough in the parish of St. George's. On Saturday the 23d of February between two and three in the afternoon as I was going down Fleet-lane I saw some people running and I walked leisurely after them, they were running in a lane on the right hand called Sea Coal-lane, and I saw them stop, when I came near I saw a man holding the prisoner at the bar by the collar, somebody said, why do you collar the man? for he is no thief, and if he is you have no right for you are no constable; and he let go the prisoner and the prisoner ran off, and he ran down by me, and I pursued him, and took him in a Baker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Mansell present when you took him? - He was not in the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100049"></xptr>when I took him; when I took him in the shop I put my hand on his shoulder and told him he was my prisoner; several people came into the shop and one of them assisted me to take him to the Compter. There was two boxes laying in Sea Coal-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you never been here before? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps convicted your man before? - I convicted!</p>
               <p>Q. What was you here before for? - I have been here several times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ever a person convicted on your evidence? - I don't know it was on my evidence, but I was a party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear on conviction of a man for house breaking that there was a reward? - Since I found he was convicted I was told of it by a person in this court.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were some persons running up Sea Coal-lane? - Yes, the prisoner was one; I don't mean to say I saw him stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the good fortune to run into a shop, it was the likely way for him to escape? - He certainly could not see me till I took him in the shop; there he was secured; I secured him myself.</p>

               <p>I am a watch maker; I saw the prisoner come down with the box in his hand and another man with him, with another box; the prisoner had a bonnet box the other had a wooden box; they came down from the one pair of stairs of Mr. Mansell's dwelling about half after two; I saw him go down the steps with it in his hand, and the prosecutor was within three doors of his own house, he went in and went up stairs, and came down again and pursued after the man, and the prisoner threw the box away into Sea Coal-lane; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I did not see the prisoner taken; I saw him go by my window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp You had never seen the prisoner before? - Never.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What is alledged to me I am totally innocent of. On Saturday afternoon I was coming down Sea Coal-lane, I had got a bad leg; I had been to have it dressed, and I saw two men pass me, and I saw a man throw a box off his shoulder, and the other from under his arm; with that I went to pick up one box out of the kennel, and they said, don't touch it for they will say you are the thief; I was going to alderman Boydell's and this man came and took me; I said, for what? I said I will go wherever you please; I went to the Compter, and then that Mansell came and the watch maker, and swore that I came out of the house; I am as innocent as any gentleman of the Jury.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

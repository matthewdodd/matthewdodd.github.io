               <p>Q. Is it permitted the Custom-house watermen to carry lumpers? - A. It is not, under pain of dismission, and he was upon the sick list besides; in the evening of the same day, I saw him again in his wherry, bringing them on shore again, and Millmett, a Custom-house officer, rowed after them in his boat; when he had landed the lumpers, Millmett took a lump of sugar out of his boat; three lumpers jumped out of his boat, but I did not see them have any thing; then I saw Aaron Baker hand some sugar out of the boat to one Archy Cockburn, who is gone off; he handed them from under the benches of his boat; Cockburn was a lumper.</p>
               <p>Q.How near was Baker's boat to the Bushey Park? - A. So close, that they stepped out of the Bushy Park into the lighter, and out of the lighter into his boat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you been here very often? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You belong to the Custom-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were discharged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They never discharge people for any good deeds, I believe? - A. I was discharged about some bad words with another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What bad words? - A. I detected an officer of the Customs robbing the Custom-house, and I took the goods away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean the Jury to believe, that the Custom-house fools, as they are called, dismissed you for detecting a brother officer in robbing them? - A. It was for bad words.</p>
               <p>Q. You were on board a tender, were not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not discharged from there? - A. I was, upon two persons being found to supply my place.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot take this as any imputation to the man's character; he was pressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you run away from the tender? - A. I ran away from the Leander.</p>
               <p>Q. This affair happened the 25th or 26th of October? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give the first information respecting it? - A. I gave it in November.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - A. I dare say it was some weeks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. There were five officers on board the ship? - A. Yes; two Excise, and three Custom-house officers.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you all upon deck, or where? - A. Sometimes upon deck, and sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, at the time of the lumpers going away, you are sometimes upon the deck, and sometimes below? - A. When they are going, we wish to be upon deck.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that he ran away? - A. I do not know whether he ran away or walked away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from information, or your own knowledge, or any way, that he ran away from the ship? - A. I never heard any thing at all about him since he quitted the ship.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you there at the time she was cleared out? - A. No, I was taken off to go to an Indiaman; I saw part of the delivery of her cargo; I am not sure whether it was the 25th or 26th that I was taken off, I was there twenty-one days; I took the account of the cargo, and delivered the cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Morgan there? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180012"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Q. We have heard the last witness talk about washing? - A. When I went in, out of the whole delivery, there were more than fourteen or fifteen hogsheads, the chief part of them washed out, through bad stowage; it frequently happens so.</p>
               <p>Q. If lumpers or other persons came on board for the purpose of taking away this sugar, you, giving your attendance on board twenty-one days, should not you, and the other officers, have seen it? - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did any thing, with your knowledge, go out of the ship? - A. No, it did not, to my knowledge, more than what was put into the craft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say, it is impossible for any person to take a bag of sugar out of the ship without your observing it? - A. No, it is not impossible; but they might take it while I am writing, and taking an account.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that there was great plunderage on board the Bushey Park? - A. There was not, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that there was great plunderage on board that ship? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time to this, have you not heard that it was plundered? - A. Not till the last trials.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not present before the Magistrate, when people have been there about it? - A. No; I have been down at Purfleet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is it not the duty of the Custom-house officers,upon any person going out of the ship, to examine them? - A. Yes; and we always pay that attention.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you, during that attention, find any sugar? - A. It is the duty of the officers on board.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.(To Millmott). You said you were alongside Baker's boat, where was Baker's boat at that time? - A. Near the starboard quarter of the Bushey Park, sometime after six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe from what ship she came? - A. They came over a lighter that laid between the boat and the Bushey Park. My attendance was chiefly in taking the cargo.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where was your situation principally? - A. On the deck. The cargo was delivered in a very short time; about nineteen or twenty days.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to say a few words in my defence. I am innocent of the charge, and I cannot be answerable for what people have secreted round their bodies; these lumpers have large frocks and trowsers on; they had nothing about them but what was secreted about their bodies; they had nothing that I could see, or any body else; it is my duty, as a waterman, to carry them backwards and forwards.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am an Excise officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the Bushey Park unloading? - Q. Yes; I was on board her for the purpose of watching the property. The owner was there every day almost; there were five officers on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible, do you think, for any person to take any sugar out of that ship, without either them or the captain observing it? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual, when persons are leaving the ship, to search them? - A. Yes; if they appear any way bulky, we always examine them.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen, that from bad weather, there is what you call washing, and a considerable deficiency? - A. Yes, very common; and that was the case with that ship.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who had known him from five to twenty years, and gave him an excellent character.</p>

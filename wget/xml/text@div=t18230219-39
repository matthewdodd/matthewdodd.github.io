I had drank 6 d. of gin and water, and half a pint of half and half, two hours before that. When I fell down, four persons came up - the prisoner was one, but I cannot recognize the others. I am confident he was one; they lifted me up, and led me by the arms about three yards; the prisoner had my left arm, and another my right. One of the other two put his hand into my pockets, and turned them inside out. I could not hinder him, as they held both my arms; they took four sovereigns, and four or five shillings out, a pair of spectacles, and a silver medal belonging to my volunteer corps. I do not know that the fourth man touched me at all. I am sure the prisoner was not the fourth man. When they had robbed me, three sovereigns, a half, and some halfpence fell on the pavement; they all ran off except the prisoner; he pretended to come up as a friend, and assisted me into the house, and then asked for some cold water to wipe my face; my wife gave him some warm water out of the kettle; he washed the mud off my face. I saw three sovereigns laying on the table - my wife put them there; they were three of those I was robbed of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you lived at this house - A. Nearly thirty years. I dare say the prisoner knew me very well; I did not know him before. I was neither drunk nor sober. I did not apply for drink at the watch-house - I might ask for beer, for I was knocked all to pieces by the dreadful fall I had, and a blow which one of them gave me. The man who robbed me had a white rough coat on - there was nothing to prevent the prisoner's running away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Bays, I am sorry to see you in this distress, and will help you into your house" - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I heard his voice, and went to the door. I found him close to the door, with four men round him; one had old of each arm, another was in front, and another behind. There was one with a white coat, whom I pushed with my hands, and made the money fall out of his hands on the pavement; he ran across the street, with the medal in his hand - I pursued him. When I got up to him, he knocked me down, and ran off, and dropped the medal - the watchman picked it up, and gave it to me; the other two men ran off. The prisoner remained, and still had hold of my husband's arm. I came back, and picked up three sovereigns. a half crown, and some halfpence, close to the door. The prisoner wished my husband to go into the house; he said he could go in without his assistance, but the prisoner forced him in, and sat him down in a chair, and asked me for some cold water. I had gone in before the prisoner, and laid the three sovereigns down on the table. My son came down stairs naked, hearing his father call, but went out of the room directly, to dress himself. I saw the sovereigns on the table after he left the room. The prisoner washed my husband's face. I turned round to get him a towel, and on turning again, I missed a sovereign off the table - they were there when I put the bason down. I said I missed the sovereigns; he seemed agitated, and said he would show me what money he had, and produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190022"></xptr>three half crowns, and a sovereign. I said the sovereign belonged to me, and he had better deliver it up and go about his business - he refused. I heard him call my husband Mr. Bois. I never saw him before. There was nobody else in the room when the sovereign was missed - we gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not your son been in and out of the room - A. No, my son saw me pick the sovereigns up, and put them on the table, and left the place immediately; he did not come in again till it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there not been a debate, whether there was not a farthing on the table instead of a third sovereign - A. No, I said nothing about a farthing; my son gave me one after I picked the sovereigns up.</p>

            , JUN. I looked out of window, and saw my father laying in the kennel - I ran down stairs naked, and helped him up. The prisoner was there then, and the other man was gone. My father had complained of weak legs - he had been drinking, but was not so intoxicated as not to know what he was about. I and the prisoner put him up against the door, and took him into the house. I saw my mother lay down three sovereigns, half a crown, and some halfpence, but do not know how many. I picked up a farthing afterwards in the street - I thought it was a sovereign till she brought out a light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not go into the parlour to assist your father - A. I went into the house - the prisoner was wiping my father's face; my mother asked how many soveriegns I saw her put down - I said three, and if one was missing it must be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go in to assist your father - A. The prisoner would force himself in - my father kept saying he did not want him, and I was looking for the other sovereign. I live next door to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your father's house unknown to him sometime ago - A. No. I do not know Valentine. My father never charged me with stealing any truck wheels; I had lent a pair to one Viner. I never ran away. My father was told that Valentine had stolen them. I did not keep out of the way while he was examined.</p>

            . I live in Middlesex-street, near the prosecutor's. About a quarter past twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery, I saw him laying on the stones near his own door - he was intoxicated; only I and his wife were near him. I called the watch; two watchmen came up from about two hundred yards off; one of them had found the medal. I and Bays's son picked him up - some silver, gold, and halfpence were found on the ground. There was nobody else near - I wished Bays good night, and told his wife she had better take him in doors - I went to my own door, and then the prisoner came up, and asked what was the matter; I said a neighbour of mine was knocked down - he asked if he had been robbed, I said, I thought he had lost nothing, for his wife had picked up the money, which had fallen out of his pocket. When I was with Bays, he said he had lost his medal, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then the first thing you saw was the prosecutor laying in the gutter, and his wife by him - A. Not in the gutter - he laid along the pavement; there was not a soulinear him. I went out upon hearing her call out</p>
               <p>"Stop the two men with white coats." I never saw the prisoner go up to him - the prisoner deals in glass. When he left me I went in doors, and he went up the street. I never spoke to the watchmen.</p>

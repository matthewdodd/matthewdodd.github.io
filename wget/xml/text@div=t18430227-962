                  </hi>. I am assistant to Thomas Butler, a linen-draper, in High-street, Shoreditch. On the 15th of Feb. the prisoners came into the shop together—they wanted to see some cotton dresses—I showed them a quantity—Pamphilion placed one on the top of the others on the counter; then Jackson opened one, and covered those that were placed on the top of the others with it—I laid hold of the dress that was covering the others, folded it up, and told her she did not want it open—Pamphilion then pointed my attention to a dress that was in the fixture behind me, and before I turned round to reach it, I cast my eye on the quantity that were on the counter—I then turned my back to the counter, and took the piece from behind—I re<lb></lb>turned to the counter, and missed one off the counter—I showed them the dress I brought down—I afterwards went out of sight, to the other shop, told one of the young men what I thought, and gave him instructions to go out<lb></lb>side—when I returned, Jackson was pointing to a dress that Pamphilion had on—she wanted one similar to that—I said I had not got one, but very likely I should have one in a day or two—one of them then said, "Are you sure?"—I said, "Very likely"—"Don't deceive us?" said one—they then went out, and I went behind the counter to see if the dress had dropped down—in the mean time the other shopman had stopped them at the door—I took them towards the counting-house—there is a desk at the end of the shop, just by the door, and a small place where the cashier goes into—Pamphilion moved on one side, and in that place I picked up the dress—she had passed that place—it was not near where I had shown them the dresses—this is the dress—it is my master's—it is one that was shown at the counter.</p>

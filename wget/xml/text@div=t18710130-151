I am getting on for fourteen years old, and live with my father, at 41, Kensington Road—on 16th January, about 1.30, I saw the prisoner at the top of Kensington Street—he said "Will you go on an errand for me?"—I said "Yes; where to?"—he said "Get a bottle of <hi rend="italic">Old Tom</hi>"—he got a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a half-sovereign—I went to Mr. Dear's, and said "A quartern of <hi rend="italic">Old Tom</hi>"—he served me—I gave him the half-sovereign, and he gave it to the barmaid—he said some<lb></lb>thing to me, and I went out with the gin in the bottle, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the way, not in the same place as before, but a very little way from it—I went up to him, and he said "Have you got it?"—I said "Yes, I have;" and Mr. Dear came up and took hold of him.</p>

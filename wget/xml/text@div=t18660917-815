                  </hi> (Policeman K 468). On the morning of the 18th August, about one o'clock, I was in Salmon's Lane, and noticed that the shutters and window of the "Prince Regent" public-house were down, and a pane of glass broken—I listened, and heard a lucifer-match struck, and immediately afterwards saw a light in the parlour—I called to a man and woman who were passing by for their assistance—I then saw the prisoner Collins look over the window and the shutter—he then jumped out of the window, and I caught hold of him—I had a struggle with him—he got away, and was shortly afterwards stopped—I saw Thomas also look out at the window, and I tried to get in, and he pushed the shutter up inside—I was then admitted by the landlady at the door—I burst open the parlour door—Thomas then jumped out at the window, and was stopped by another constable—I gave my rattle to some one to spring—I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Wright's Buildings—about one o'clock on the morning of 18th August I saw three men standing outside the "Prince Regent"—the prisoners are two of them—I am sure of that—shortly afterwards I heard a window go down, and some glass broken—I called my father, heard the door shake very much, and then saw a man in custody, not either of the prisoners, a third man—I saw Collius jump out of the window, followed him for about 300 yards, and saw him stopped by a policeman—I never lost sight of him.</p>

On the morning of 18th August I was on duty, and heard some hallooing—I ran to the "Prince Regent" public-house, and saw Thomas jump out of the window—I turned my light on him, and showed him my staff—he said, "Don't ill-use me, policeman; I'll be quiet"—I jumped over the railings and caught him between the railing and the window—I charged him with burglary—he said nothing—I searched the house and found some matches on the floor, and a piece of wood broken from the parlour door, near the lock.</p>

I am a widow, and keep the "Prince Regent" public-house—at eleven o'clock on 19th August I saw the house all locked up and safe—the window and shutters were both safe—I was called up about one o'clock, and found the parlour door and window broken—I think I had left a few matches on the table—these instruments are not mine—they were not there when I locked up—I did not lose anything—they did not get into the bar—my house is in the parish of St. Anne, Limehouse.</p>

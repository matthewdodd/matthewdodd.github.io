On the 7th of April I desired he should be watched, and about twelve o'clock, when he left the shop. I sent a watchman after him - I found him in the watch-house; these raisins, which he acknowledged taking, were on the table - I asked for the key of his box; he said his boxes were at Chelsea, but he lodged in a court in Fleet-street; I went there to the house he pointed out, and found in a bag 16 ozs. of almonds and 21/2lbs. of sugar - he said he had taken the almonds from the back part of the warehouse, but had saved the sugar up out of half a pound which he bought every week.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Lee's service - the prisoner was an out-door porter. I went to the watch-house- the prisoner said he found the almonds in the warehouse, by the mill; and the lemon-peel on the floor, as he swept the shop, and that he had saved the sugar up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Elmes present when he said he found them? A. Yes; I have eaten a good many almonds without master's leave - that is allowed, but we are not allowed to take any thing out - they are worth 1s. 6d.</p>

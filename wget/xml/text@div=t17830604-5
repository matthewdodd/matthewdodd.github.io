               <p>Court. Did you see the other woman at the time you was busy serving your customers, can you exactly say where the other woman stood at the time the ham was lost?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040008"></xptr> - I had not the woman in my eye all the time, but nobody was near her when I came up with the prisoner I delivered her into the Rotation office, she did not say a syllable; at her examination she said her name was Siddons, also Field, the ham is mine by the mark in the handle, J. D.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not put your best hams in the window, they are generally old, indifferent hams? - No, my lord, they are not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went into Mr. Davis's shop on the 30th of April, to get some butter, about a quarter after five the prisoner came in with a bit of a broken plate under her arm, as if she came for some butter, she asked the price of a bit of bacon, and she laid the bit of bacon down and went out of the shop, and spoke to another woman, they went and stood at a door as if considering whether they should go back and buy the bacon; Mr. Davis said to me and another of his customers, watch them women, for I know them to be both thieves, I turned my back to get change for half a crown, and the ham was drawn away.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot tell which of the two took it away? - I saw Mr. Davis take it out of the prisoner's lap.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I came into the shop to buy a bit of bacon, but whether I bought it or no I cannot say, I was very much tosticated in liquor, but as for any other woman, whether I spoke to her or not, I cannot say, I have no witness, I have no friend but God and you gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Court. My lord, is the outside of the shop window, a part of the shop?</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether this is a private stealing or not, and I am afraid if you think she is guilty of the offence, it is a private stealing, because nobody was present at the time, but both these people were upon the scheme of getting something out of the shop, the other woman was on the outside, and was not all the time in Davis's eye, they were both on the same scheme undoubtedly, therefore it is a doubt whether this woman took it privately or not, now the construction of this statute is this, that only one person can be guilty of the capital felony, and that is the hand which actually takes it; supposing for instance, half a dozen women of the town, or pick-pockets, were to surround you coming out of the play-house, the man only who puts his hand into your pocket is guilty of the stealing, the rest are only accomplices; therefore unless you believe she is the woman that actually took the ham, you may acquit her of the capital part of the charge, which is that of stealing privately; the other woman might take it and give it to her: with regard to that merciful distinction, which one of the jury pointed out, whether the outside of the window was part of the shop, I am afraid it would be rather too nice to say, that the window where the goods were, is not a part of the shop; in regard to the value of hams, I believe they do not put their best hams in their window, and if you find under the value of five shillings, it is not a capital offence, even though you think she was guilty of privately stealing; but the whole must be left to your consideration.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a native of Germany—I have been ten years in Bermuda—I have lately come to London and reside with my wife at 4, Ladbroke Grove, Notting Hill—I became acquainted with the prisoner shortly before 11th November, he was then living at 4, Lime Grove, Shep<lb></lb>herd's Bush—he made a proposal to me with reference to the discount of bills of exchange—the first was a bill for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we were to go halves; we were each to provide half the discount and share the profit—I provided 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and afterwards got it back from him—on the evening of 14th November he was at ray house; my wife was present—he proposed to dis<lb></lb>count a bill of 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of one Horton; each of us were to pay half and get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each interest—I had not heard of the name of Frank Bouts at that time—on 15th November this letter was brought to me with an envelope and letter enclosed—to the best of my belief it is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed a letter, signed Frank Bouts, asking for the money by</hi> 11 <hi rend="italic">o'clock; the prisoner in his letter requesting Mr. Sauer to forward by the bearer (the pri<lb></lb>soner's daughter</hi>) 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 55., <hi rend="italic">the half for the discount of the bill</hi>.) The letter enclosed a bill of exchange for 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated 14th November, at two months, drawn by the prisoner on Mr. F. Bouts, wine merchant, Holloway, accepted by Frank Bouts, payable at the London and County Bank—in consequence of that I handed to Miss Trevelli 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—subsequent to that, whilst the bill was current I lent the prisoner 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he wrote and gave me this I 0 U—I also received from him these eight letters which, to the best of my belief, are his writing—I kept possession of the bill until two days before 17th January, when it was due, when I gave it to the prisoner in my wife's presence; he said he wanted to get it cashed—on the evening of the 17th he came and said that when he went into the City to call on the man for</p>

               <p>tie money he found the man was killed and that his' widow was at Scar-borough and he was going to write to her—he subsequently sent me back the bill in this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 25th January, and stated that his Idler to Scarborough had been returned, as Mrs. Bouts could not be found</hi>.) When the bill was returned to me the words "No orders, refer to acceptor" were on it—after that I employed Mr. York, my solicitor, and a summons was obtained at the Hammersmith police-court—I appeared there and my wife and I gave evidence; the prisoner was remanded from the 10th February to the 17th—on 15th February I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had made over his furniture to the witness, which he hoped thortly to redeem and pay all that fie owed</hi>.) I did not take possession of the furniture, but in consequence, of that I attended before Mr. Bridge on 17th February and refused to be bound over, and my wife also, and we were locked up—I afterwards consented, and was liberated.</p>

On the night before Miss Trevelli brought tie 48?. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill the prisoner asked my husband if he would lend him the amount on the bill and go halves with him—he mentioned Mr. Horton's name, but I can't say whether it was about that bill or not—the interest was mentioned, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; my husband agreed to that—I did not hear the name of Bouts mentioned—on the morning of the 17th the prisoner came for tie bill <hi rend="italic">to get</hi> it cashed—when the bill came came with the words "Refer to acceptor" on it I went to the London and County Bank, West-bourne Grove, and made inquiries and looked in the Directory, and went to Mr. Fork—on 10th February I was examined as a witness before the Magistrate—after the letter-of the 15th I went again before the Magistrate on the 17th and was locked up for a short time.</p>

            ? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; he lodged at my house in the two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing happening on Monday night? - Yes; Mr. Gibson and I were standing at the door between seven and eight in the evening; Collier asked if Mr. Gibson was at home; I told him that was Mr. Gibson; he went and fetched a tall man from the public-house; Gibson in the mean time went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did he know the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was the tall man? - Downes; they came into the house and went into the parlour; I told them that was not Mr. Gibson's room, that his room was up two pair of stairs; they went up, I followed them up one pair of stairs and stood on the landing place; Mrs. Gibson stood in the passage at the head of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibson is the wife of the prisoner? - Yes; Downes went up and asked if Mr. Gibson was at home? she answered, yes, and asked him his business, he said he wanted Mr. Gibson; she asked his name; he said it was Downes; Gibson answered from the inside he did not know the name of Downes, and nobody should enter his room till he knew his business; after that I heard a great noise, and Mrs. Gibson called out murder.</p>
               <p>You don't know whether the door was locked? - No, that was the time they went in.</p>
               <p>The two men got into the room? - Yes, I believe, by Mr. Gibson's voice, that the door was shut; I heard no more; I went down stairs and called my master; he went up stairs, but did not stay two minutes, his business called him into the shop; I went up stairs again then, and Mr. Atterbury and Mr. Mountain went up with me; Downes had got Gibson on the top of the stairs in the passage, holding him fast by the collar at the bottom of the garret stairs; the gentlemen asked Downes what he wanted with the gentleman; he said he had a warrant against Mr. Gibson, and we all went into the room; the deceased then lay on the floor.</p>
               <p>What did you see when you first came into the room? - I saw the short man, Collier, lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Was he living or dead? - He was living, but wounded; they asked for the warrant, and Downes produced it out of his pocketbook; Downes sat down in a chair by Collier, and asked if he was hurt; he answered very faintly, Yes; then I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did it appear from any thing that passed in conversation then who he had been hurt by? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. KELSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the deceased being brought into your house? - At the time he was brought in I was not at home; he was upon the point of expiring when he was brought in.</p>
               <p>You know nothing from him of the manner in which he received his death wound? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>He was wounded in a manner that was fatal? - Yes, he had received a mortal wound.</p>
               <p>There being no other evidence attending for the crown the prisoner was not put upon his defence.</p>

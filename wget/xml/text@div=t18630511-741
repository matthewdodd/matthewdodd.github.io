                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Woodford—on Saturday, 5th April, I was possessed of a pair of pistols in a case and two photographic lenses—on that day the brace of pistols were in the case on a box in a back room on the ground-floor, and the lenses were on the table—I saw them safe late on Saturday night, and on the Monday morning they were gone—they must have been stolen—the door of the room was shut, but not locked—it com<lb></lb>municated directly with the backyard—I attended on the following Friday at the police-court—the prisoner was there, and one of my pistols was pro<lb></lb>duced by the constable—this is it—I identified it at the police-court.</p>

I am a butcher of Woodford—on Wednesday, 6th April, at half-past 12, I saw the prisoner in Woodford New-road, going to<lb></lb>wards the prosecutor's house—about a quarter-past 1, I saw him again about 100 yards from the house, coming away—he had something under his coat, which appeared like a dressing-case, brass bound at the corners—he passed me—I walked on some distance, thinking something was wrong—he then ran round the corner into the forest—that was the last I saw of him.</p>

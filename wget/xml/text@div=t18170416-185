            . I am a watchman. On the 26th of February, about half-past one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in Golden-lane, with the bundle; I asked him what it was - He said it was a bed, and that he was in debt and wanted his things away, for fear they should be seized - He appeared intoxicated, and said he came from George-yard. I watched him to see if he would go there, - he did. He went into a room that was kept by a bad woman, there was no other person in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said the woman had robbed him, and he had taken the things to make up for the loss; her name is

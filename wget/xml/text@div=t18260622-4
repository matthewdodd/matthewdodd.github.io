               <p>ISABELLA CURRY. I am between nine and ten years old - my father's name is Stephen. On the 18th of May my mother sent me to Mrs. Ashdown's, in the Commercial-road, where I received 3s. 9d. in copper, and put it loose into my pinafore; I was going home, and there were several boys heaving at a post between the Commercial-road and Back-lane; one of them came near me, and asked what o'clock it was - I said I did not know; they then all came up - there were found or five of them; one walked alongside of me. I walked on - then one came and jumped on my back - he did not throw me down; I screamed out, and one clapped his hand on my mouth - then another took hold of my pinafore, and shook the money out of it - he tore the pinafore. The money fell out on the ground; they picked it up, and ran away with it. A gentleman brought the prisoner to me while I was going home - I cannot say whether he was one of them; I cannot speak to any of them. I did not pick up any of the money myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The boy could not jump heavy on your back - he did not throw you down? A. No. I did not shake the half-pence out - it was between seven and eight o'clock, and quite light - I have got 2s. 3d. back since.</p>

            . On the 18th of May, between seven and eight o'clock, I was coming from work - by the Commercial-road, in Stepney-field, I saw a little girl - I was crossing over the hills, and saw four boys throwing stones at a post; the prisoner said to one of them, "Hold your hand - you will hit the man;" they all passed away from the post. I went on, and when I got about a hundred yards I heard a scream; I got up on the clay, looked on the hill, and saw three or four boys round this child; the prisoner had got hold of her by the shoulders - another had his hand over her mouth - another, who was before her, took her pinafore and tore it; I saw the half-pence drop out - she ran away. I saw them picking the money up, and they all ran away. I ran towards the prisoner, who had held her by the shoulders, and took him - he dropped some halfpence from his hand before I got up to him. I took him to the girl's father, and sent for an officer. I returned to the spot, and picked up 9d. where I had seen him drop part of the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner had his hands on her shoulders? A. Yes. They picked the halfpence up before they ran away. I was about thirty yards off.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN CURRY. I went with the witness to the spot, and found in all 2s. 3d. My daughter's pincloth was torn.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

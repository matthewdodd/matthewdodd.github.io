                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in Bull-court, Queen-street, Cheapside. Lines was in my service about three months ago, and left for robbing me—on Monday, the 20th of Nov., I had a machine for sweeping chimneys in the cellar under my house—I locked the cellar when I left at nine o'clock, and then saw the machine safe—you can get into the cellar from the court outside by a door, and from the cellar, up stairs, into the other part of the house—I returned at half-past nine, found the door open, and missed the machine, also a brush and shovel—I saw the machine on Thursday, at Pollard's shop, in Silver-street, Clerkenwell.</p>

                  </hi>. Last Monday evening week, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock, I was standing at the bottom of George-yard, and saw Lines run<lb></lb>ning through George-yard, about four doors from Mr. Tyler's premises, with a chimney-sweeping machine with him, and a shovel—I knew him before, by formerly living with Mr. Tyler at the same time as he did—when he got to the entrance of Bow Church-yard, he turned round and looked, he then ran out of my sight—about ten minutes after that I saw the door of Mr. Tyler's cellar, where the machines are kept, open.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Tyler, in Queen-street, Cheapside. Last Saturday week, the evening before the robbery, I saw Lines close by Mr. Tyler's, in George-yard, with another young man—he wanted me to go and see if Mr. Tyler was at the door—I told him he was—he wanted me to go and see again—I would not do so, and asked why be wished to know—he said he wanted to <hi rend="italic">ease</hi> him of the machine—I said, did he want to steal it?—he said, yes, he did—in consequence of that, on returning from where I had to go, about six o'clock, I went and put Mr. Tyler on his guard.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 80.) On Thursday, the 23rd, I went to Pollard's house—he was standing at hit counter—I said, "You have got a sweep's machine, Mr. Pollard?"—he said, "Yet, I have, I will bring it you"—he brought it out—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "I bought It"—I said, "Who from?"—he said, "I believe it was from a sweep, some<lb></lb>where out of West-street"—I said, "Can you show me the man, or where he is to be found?"—he said "Yes"—I went with him—he took me to three or four places, but he never took me near West-street—I said, "We have no occasion to go any further, you had better come with me to the station."</p>

After Pollard was charged I went with him to his house, to search for a brush and shovel—as soon as we got in he took hold of a book and a pen, and wrote the name of Barry—I took hold of the book, and said, "What are you writing?"—he said, "The man's name I bought it of"—I said, "Can you direct us where we can find this Mr. Barry?"—Bingham said, "We have been everywhere he wished to go, and can't find any man answering the name"—I asked him if he had any other book-—he said "No"—I found there was nothing entered in this book since 1809—it is a marine-store shop.</p>

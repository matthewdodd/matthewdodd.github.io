On the 25th of May, be<lb></lb>tween four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty in New Crotss-road, Deptford, and saw a brewer's dray drawn by three horses—it stopped at the Marquis of Granby—Walton was driving, and Ashton was on the side—when it stopped, Ashton tried to get some hay out from between two butts, and Walton held a butt on one side—Ashton threw the hay into the road, Brighton came and took it up, put it into the stable, and locked it up—brother officer came, and we watched for about half an hour—I saw a man go and speak to Brighton—we went and asked him for the clover which was taken from the dray—he said there was none—I said there was—I took him down the road, and told him to unlock the door, which he did, and I pointed it out, lying on the right hand side—he said it had been there the whole of the day—I sent Walton for Ashton, and asked him if he had any clover on the dray—he said he had—I said, "Do you know where it is?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I am certain you do; you were here when the man took it away"—he then said he thought the man was going to feed the horses with it—the horses remained in the dray, and were not fed with it—I said I should take them into custody—Ashton</p>

I am a post-chaise driver; on Thursday last I drove a gentleman to the Three Cranes at Edgware; while I was there a gentleman came in a one horse chaise, he asked if I was going to London? I said I am, and he went away. I asked the hostler the meaning of it? and he told me, the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180009"></xptr> was afraid of being robbed, and wanted one to keep him company; I threw out the long reins and got into the chaise myself. Just as I came to the five mile stone, a man came up to the chaise and laid hold on the horses head, and another man came up to the side of the chaise and said. Holloa, who have you got here? I said only myself.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not mention any thing of what they took from you.</p>
               <p>Ivers. When they left me I went on to a public-house on the road, which is kept by Mr. Errington, and told what had happened. Mr. Errington and another charged two guns, and we went back in the chaise as far as the Welch Harp, about a mile and a quarter beyond the place where I was stopped; we staid there and had some beer, and as we were returning back we saw two men on the causeway; we jumped out and took them; it was then about seven o'clock; M'Guire said, if you are going to rob me don't use me ill; the other man that was with me said, no, we don't want your money, and put him into the chaise.</p>

I said only myself; they asked what money I had? I told them only two shillings and a few halfpence, which they took from me. I asked them if they were not ashamed to rob so poor a man of such a trifle; then he who was at the chaise side asked the other if he should give it me again? he said no, keep the silver and give him the halfpence, which he did; then they went off; I went on to Erri ngton's, a public house on the road, and he and his brother charged two guns, and we went back in the chaise in pursuit of them as far as the

I jumped out of the chaise and came up to Winter first, but did not remember him; I said, he was not the man; when I came up to M'Guire, I knew him directly; we took them to the house of Errington. M'Guire was one of the men that robbed me; I knew his voice again as soon as he spoke, and I knew his lappel coat.</p>

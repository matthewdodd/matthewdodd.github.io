About half-past five o'clock on the afternoon of the 4th of December I was in Fenchurch-street, opposite Billiter-street—I saw a man put this tub of butter en the prisoner's shoulder in Billiter-street—I went after him—the other man made his escape—I stopped the prisoner, and took him—I found the owner—he lives close in that neigh<lb></lb>bourhood.</p>

I was in Fenchurch-street, and saw two men about the prosecutor's door—I believe the prisoner was one—I thought there was, something going on wrong, and I watched a minute—one of the two persons took a cask of butter out of the cart on his left shoulder, and crossed the road—I endeavoured to follow him, but lost sight of him—in turning up Billiter-street I saw a man with the cask of butter on his shoulder, who I suppose was one that was about the cart—the officer came and took him.</p>

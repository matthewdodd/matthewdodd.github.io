                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Eady, and live in St. John-street—the prisoner rented a furnished room of us, and lived with a man named Roby, as his wife. On the 7th of September, I went to examine the room and they were both gone—I missed two blankets, a sheet and two pillow cases—the man was charged with it at first, but the magistrate wanted to know who pawned them, and he said his wife—she was outside, and the policeman brought her in—I have no reason to know that she did not do it under the direction of her husband—a quantity of lead was stripped off three houses next to ours, we accused them of it and they both ran away.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not examine the room with me, and find that nothing was missing but what I had told you of, and say I could gel I them out in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did offer to restore the things, but the magistrate ordered her into custody—I cannot say her husband did not send her with the things to pawn—I think she meant to redcem them.</p>

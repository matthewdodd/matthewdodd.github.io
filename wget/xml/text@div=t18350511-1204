On the morning of the 17th of April, the prisoner came to the shop with this advance-note, and said, "Will you cash me an advance-note?"—I came into the shop, and looked at it—I took it in my hand and saw the name of "Stebbing" at the back of it—I asked him who Stebbing was, seeing "Palmer" inside—he said, "That is my landlord"—I said, "Did he put his name to the back? what, 'Mr. Stebbing' of Whitehorse-street?"—he said "Yes, I have got a little house of him, and have lived there</p>

               <p>eight or nine years"—I said, "Did he put his name to the back?" he said, "Yes;" that he had lived there eight or nine years, and he was very kind to him—I then cashed the note, gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in goods, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was allowed for cashing it—that is quite a regular thing—I went on board the ship, and got information—I went to Mr. Stebbing's, who said, it was not his hand-writing.</p>

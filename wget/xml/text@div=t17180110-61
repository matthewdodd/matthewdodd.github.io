The Prisoner pleaded in her Defence, that she went to the Tavern to see a Person that came from her Father in the Country, and coming down Stairs, they invited her to go back with them, telling her she should drink a Quart of Wine with them, which she refused, till by their Urgency, and pushing her up Stairs and giving her inducing Language, she did; that being there with the Prosecutor and his Friend, one held her, and the other attempted to lye with her, which she would by no means permit; that then the Prosecutor call'd the Drawer and bid him bring some Oil, and some Feathers , with a large Pewter-Dish, and Six penniworth of Whipcord . Upon which she reply'd, she did not know what he meant: That he then told her, she must either flog him, or he would do so and so. To which she reply'd, she had heard of Flogging, but never of doing so and so. That then she would have come away, but he would not let her go till she had paid her share of the Reckoning, which she refusing, he tax'd her with picking his Pocket. That as for the 6 Guineas and a half, she had received them that Day of her Husband, who appear'd in Court and deposed, that he did give her 6 Guineas and a half that Day, he having received 7 l.19 s. and 4 d of a Person for whom he had made half a Dozen of Silver Spoons and Forks.

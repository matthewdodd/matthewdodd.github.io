                  </hi>. I am a printer in Wardrobe-terrace, Doctors'-com<lb></lb>mons. The prisoner was in my employ as overseer or foreman—his wages were 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he had access to all parts of my office and stock—I employ sixty or seventy men—I went with the policeman to the prisoner's house in Blackfriars-road, on 26th Sept.—one officer went in the back premises with my foundry-man, and there found some metal lead—I did not go with him—I found this metal block, or moulding, in the front room, on the first-floor—I believe it to be mine—this cast is made use of in the working of the wrapper of the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>—that is a work that has been printed on my premises—the prisoner would have no business to take any type or mould from my premises to his own—this is stereotyped—I had printed the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> about a year and a half—I was not present when the prisoner was given into custody—I had not charged him with it before I went to his premises.</p>

Barlow and Co., to be employed on the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>—I knew it on the Friday following, before I searched his house—all that I can recognise of these articles amount to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in value—the printing of the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi> did produce a profit, but a very small one—I believe this block to be mine, as far as a man can speak to property on his premises—I mean to swear to it—it had been made for myself—I know a person named Miller—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a sheet</hi>)—this is not the impression of my block—nor is this other—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>)—here is part of it here—this one has been cut and pieced about—this centre appears to be it, but the top and bottom have both been cut off—Miller had nothing to do with this casting—he had to do with some former blocks—these were at one time in separate casts—they were sent to me to work, and I cast them for my own convenience—the small blocks I have no doubt went hack to Mr. Barlow, or Mr. Miller as their agent, but this block was never out of my premises—I know that Cap<lb></lb>sey and Cole, two men who were in my service, lodged in the same house with the prisoner—I did not employ them, or either of them to make any search at the house—after I heard that he was going on the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi> they went there, being anxious to find out the guilt—I told all the men in my employ that property was missing, and every man must look out—I deny that I gave them authority, or direction to make any search there—I believe Capsey and Cole, and the prisoner all left my service together—it was not at my instance that Capsey and Cole left, nor by any interference of mine—I</p>

               <p>had no reason to believe before I gave the prisoner into custody that he had received this block from Miller's hand—I had never been told so before he was in custody—in coming out of the Court, Miller said, "That has been in my possession"—I learnt with utter astonishment from Miller, when I was at the station, or police-court, that he had given this to the prisoner—he did not say he gave it to the prisoner—he said it had been in his possession—I knew the prisoner was about to be employed on the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>, and that Miller told me it had been in his hands—I did not ask whether Miller gave it him—from a memorandum found, it appears that Miller gave it him on the previous day—this plate would be of no use to anybody that did not print the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>—Messrs. Barlow and others were about to employ the prisoner to print it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just understand me; supposing one of these to be used as a model, and put into a mould, would not the impression it made have this effect, that if metal were poured into the mould, it would come out with the same deficien<lb></lb>cies as this—it would make an entire assimilation of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because casting in a metal mould would be entirely different from a sand mould—I know the prisoner was casting, because it was found on bis premises—the Queen's Arms on the "Court-plaister" stamp had never been thrown into the refuse box to my knowledge—I do not know that any of these had been worn enough to have been put into the waste metal box—they might have been condemned by the printer, and then they would be, but it so happened that this was not printed lately—these lead types I charge to be of the value of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the mould casting 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the Court-plaister and the King's Arms 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the brass rules at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; making altogether 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know that the</p>

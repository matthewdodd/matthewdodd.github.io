               <p>On the 27th of July, about half past twelve at night, I was coming from <placeName id="t17850914-95-crimeloc471">the Strand</placeName>

               <p>Where was your watch? - In my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>How came you to carry it there? - The glass of it was broke, and there were no hands upon it, so I had it in my waistcoat pocket, open; this is the very watch; I had it about a fortnight before, I am very sure of it; I know it by the condition it is in, without the glass, and no hands; I did not give her the watch.</p>

               <p>I searched the prisoner, and found the watch in her pocket; she said she had the watch in her pocket, but she would not give it till she went to the watch-house; she said the man gave it her, but he denied it.</p>

               <p>I had lately come out of the workhouse, and I was very distressed, I met this gentleman coming along the Strand, I asked him where he was going, he said home; I said, I wish you would give me something to drink, and I asked him for two shillings first, and he said he would give me two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140128"></xptr> shillings after I had obliged him, and he gave me the watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you perfectly sober? - I had been at the Whitehorse Inn, in Saint Martin's Lane; I was not in liquor; I never knew my watch was gone till I came out, and saw my pocket turned out; I was not above three minutes from the first time I saw her; when I was coming out of the Alley she met me, and laid hold of me, I told her I would not go with her, and she snatched it out of my pocket.</p>

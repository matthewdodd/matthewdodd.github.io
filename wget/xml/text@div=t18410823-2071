I stopped the prisoner on the 16th of July, at half-past ten at night, in Hudson-place, Shadwell—I asked him what he had in his hand—I was going to detain him—he ran about eight yards, then threw down this pipe, and metal cocks—he then ran on to the bottom of Shakespeare-walk—I nearly caught him—he turned up Farmer-street, and at the corner of Elbow-lane he dropped down—I never lost sight of him.</p>

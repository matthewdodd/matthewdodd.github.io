            . I am an officer. On Sunday evening the 1st of October, I apprehended the prisoner - his mother being dangerously ill, I pretended I wanted him to mind his master's house. I took him to the watch-house, and found a 1 l. note, and 18 s. 6 d., a knife, and a box of brass dominos upon him. I asked him where he passed the note? he said in Long-lane, and shewed me Barton's house there; I took him in, and asked Barton if he knew him? he leant across the counter, and said to the prisoner</p>
               <p>"Do I know you" - he made no answer. I said</p>
               <p>"Should you like to give a boy in this situation change for anything?" he then said to the boy</p>
               <p>"Have I given you change for anything?" I told the boy he had better say nothing, and asked Barton if he had given him change or not? he said he was not in that dress; I told the prisoner to pull his great-coat off; he then said</p>
               <p>"That is the dress he was in, I gave him change for a 5 l. note one day this week." He produced the note, and it corresponded with the number I had received, 17825. The prisoner said he bought a donkey in Smithfield for 18 s. out of it, and paid 2 s. for a day's keep, at the livery-stables for it, and 2 s. for shoeing it, he paid 1 s., to a costermonger for letting it be in his stable, and 9 s. he paid for the breeches he had on. Barton said he gave him 2 l. the first day, and the rest a day or two after.</p>

            . I am a baker. The prisoner came to me, asked for a quartern loaf, and laid down a 5 l. note; I said I had no change; he said perhaps I could give him part, and he would call again. I gave him 2 l. and next morning 3 l. I took him for a customer, who comes every week with money in his hand. The note found upon him, is one of those I gave him.</p>

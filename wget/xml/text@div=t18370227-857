                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Mill-wall, Poplar. On the 26th of February, I gave the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to Erby-court with her, and went to bed—I put my clothes under my head—I had three half-crowns in my fob-pocket—I went to sleep, and the prisoner took the money from my pocket—it awoke me, and I seized her—she bit my hand I called the policeman, and he found half-a-crown in her hand.</p>

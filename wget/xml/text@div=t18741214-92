                  </hi>. I am clerk to William Charles Anderson, a wine merchant, of Lime Street—I gave the prisoner a pipe of mine to mend in November, and on 19th November I left the office leaving the cash-box on a ledge on the swing door between Mr. Anderson's office and mine—there is a small passage between—it contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps, a cheque for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., seven wine warrants, and a copy of an invoice—I missed it on my return—the prisoner never came afterwards about my pipe.</p>

There are two offices in one room divided by a glass par<lb></lb>tition and there is a shelf on the swing door between them—mine is the front and is a public office; Mr. Anderson's is at the back and is private—you have to pass the swing door to go to—Mr. Anderson's room, but not to go through it—the distance between Mr. Anderson's door and my door is four or five feet, and this swing door is half way between, that would make it 2 feet 6 inches from the front door to the swing door—I did not carry the box into Mr. Anderson's office because he was engaged—I left no one in my office—I do not know-what time elapsed before the prisoner came in. <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> You have worked in the office for me twice and I have twice paid you out of the cash box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant of Lime Street—my office is on the left hand side as you go in and it is divided by a glass partition railing off the clerks' part and next to that there is a swing door with a flap on the top for receipting accounts—I saw the cash-box there after Mr. Bell had placed there—there is another office downstairs where a clerk named Simpson sometimes works—I remember Bell going out on the afternoon of 19th September, and Simpson came up to take charge—the prisoner who I had never seen before came into the office and began speaking about a pipe—I was busy and I told him I knew nothing about it, he must call again when Mr. Bell was in—he left and had had time to get to the front door when he came back and said "Would you give me a <hi rend="italic">wet?</hi>—I felt annoyed and told him if he had any business to see my clerk, Simpson, downstairs—I had sent Simpson down to copy some letters before the prisoner came in and there was nobody in-the office—I told the prisoner to go away and he did so—Mr. Simpson afterwards missed the cash box—nobody could have taken it except the prisoner, nobody was there after Mr. Bell left but Simpson and the-prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I last saw the cash box at 5.5 or 5.10, it was then on the spring door—I told Simpson to go down about 5.15 or 5.20—you knocked at the door and I answered you—you walked up to the table to me—it was then 5.25—I did not take the cash box inside because it was there for the purpose of the letters being stamped for the post—when you left the office the third time you partially drew the glass door—I can see into the office from where I sit, but I cannot see the cash-box though I can see into that part of the lobby where anybody must come to get in—I cannot swear that the cash-box was there when you came in or that you took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Anderson—about 5.20 I went down to the lower office to copy some letters leaving the cash box on the counter—I was about six minutes copying the letters and had to come up for some stamps out of the cash-box and it was gone—I did not see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I copied about half-a-dozen letters in the six minutes—I enclose them upstairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been in the habit of going round for years past repairing for wine merchants and no one has ever said that they lost anything while I was at work I knocked at the door, Mr. Anderson said "Come in." I went in and if there had been any cash-box there then I should have seen it; there was free ingress and egress to everybody, and there is no telling who goes in. Mr. Anderson was out of temper and answered me as if I was a dog. I may have asked him for a <hi rend="italic">wet,</hi> which is not unusual when we are working for wine merchants. I do not believe the cash-box was there when I went there. It was not impossible for a person to have gone in and taken the cash-box, and because I went in next I am the victim.</p>

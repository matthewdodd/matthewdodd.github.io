            . I am an officer. I produce the handkerchief which the prosecutor gave me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 13th of August I was in Oxford-street, and saw something lying on the pavement, and took it up, not knowing I was doing wrong, it being only a handkerchief. I was induced to put it in my pocket, as nobody claimed it. Shortly after Mr. Latham charged me with stealing it. I informed him how I became possessed of it, and wishing to convince him I was no thief, I offered to accompany him to Mr. Biggs, of Gate-street, tailor, who had been my employer for a year.</p>

             re-examined. He did say he picked it up; I took him in less than a minute after I felt the pull. I saw him immediately I turned round; a gentlemen touched me on the shoulder and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who has your handkerchief;" I might lose sight of him while feeling in my pocket.</p>

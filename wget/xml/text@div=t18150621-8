On the 15th of May, I was at the house of a person named Cleveland, between the hours of eleven and twelve in the forenoon; there was a soldier of the same regiment, who had some claim upon his agent, and came up to me, and asked me to make it out for him, as he could not write himself. Knowing that it was a just claim, I went to make it out. I put my cap beside me with my pocket-book containing the notes, and a handkerchief in it. While I was writing, the prisoner sit on my left, where the cap was; I knew him before. I was going to return to my friends in Ireland by the coach that night, and the prisoner engaged to carry my trunk for me to the coach office. He said to me while I was writing, Serjeant, I am just going out, I will return in two minutes. I replied very well, and told him to make haste. I shortly afterwards missed my pocket-book, and the handkerchief in which my arm had been slung. The prisoner did not come back, so I immediately went to the Royal College, and asked the Serjeant of his ward, if he was in, he was a Chelsea pensioner. The serjeant told me he was not. In returning, I overtook him. I took him into custody immediately, I and an officer accompanied him to Sloane-square. I there insisted on his being searched, and on him were found some three shilling bank-tokens, a five and sixpenny piece, a shilling, and eleven pence in halfpence, together with the handkerchief, in which my arm was slung, and which he took out of my cap. I found neither pocket-book nor notes; he said, that he had changed one, and that the pocket-book and the remainder were stolen from him by a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that the handkerchief which you found upon him, was the handkerchief which you missed - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say that if I would give you two pounds, you would not prosecute me - A. No, I did not.</p>

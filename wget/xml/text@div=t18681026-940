                  </hi>. I am a banker, of the firm of Guinness, Mahon, &amp; Co., of College Green, Dublin—we have a client in London named Foxall—our firm received from him this bill of exchange for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before we agreed to discount it we wrote to Mr. Foxall for an explanation about the transaction, and he then sent us this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), to show us the bond fides of the transaction—we got the agreement on 14th August, and remitted the proceeds of the bill the same day, amounting to 778<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we sent it by draft on the London and County Bank, our London bankers—this is is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 7th September I happened to be passing through London, from Germany, and in consequence of information, I went to the office of Mr. Newton—whilst I was there the prisoner Farrar came in—I said to him I was surprised to find that Lord Dudley had repudiated any knowledge of Mr. Hullett, who was the drawer of the bill that had passed through his hands—he said that was very strange, as he knew it to be his lordship's bill—I said, "What do you know about the trans<lb></lb>action?"—he said, "I know it is payment for an opera that the drawer, Mr. Hullett, was to write for Lord Dudley"—I said, "Do you speak of your own knowledge, or is it what Mr. Hullett told you"—he said he spoke of his own knowledge, and that he knew the opera to be nearly finished, on the point of completion, and I think he said that he had seen it, but I would not like to speak positively to that—I said, "It is very strange, under these circumstances, that Lord Dudley should not know Mr. Hullett, if he is writing an opera for him"—he said Lord Dudley was a very strange man, and he was not surprised at his disowning Mr. Hullett—I then said, "I suppose you were the solicitor who prepared the agreement"—I don't think this agreement was before me at that time; the agreement had been referred to, and he had spoken of a previous agreement—he said the arrangement was made by deed, there was a written agreement, and that was substituted for a previous agreement which was made between Mr. Hullett and Mr. Mapleson for the opera, but after it had been so pre<lb></lb>pared, Mr. Hullett considered he should have the security of Lord Dudley for writing the opera, and that a new agreement was prepared which was exe<lb></lb>cuted by Lord Dudley—I then said, "I suppose it was you prepared this agreement—he said, "No, it was prepared by solicitors in the Temple" or Lincoln's-Inn Fields, "I think the Temple, "a most respectable firm of solicitors—I said, "Who are they; what is the name of the firm?”—he said he would rather not mention their name, as the matter seemed to be a little unplea<lb></lb>sant—I said I did not see why he should object, and that I would wish to know the name—he said he must declince to mention it—he then said, "But would it not be much better to end all this business, by taking up the bill?"—I said, "Very well, I should much prefer it—what is it you propose?"—he said, "Well, I will give you half the sum in two days (this was on a Monday; it was to be given on Wednesday) and Mr. Eversfield's bill for the other half, Mr. Eversfield, of Denne Park, Horsham, I think he said; I wrote it down at the instant (<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>) it is "Charles Gilbert Eversfield, of Denne Park, Horsham"—I made that memorandum at the time, in Farrar's</p>

               <p>presence"—I said, "Give me his name," and he gave me that—I said, "Who is he?”—he said, "He is a gentleman of large fortune, and Mr. Hullett's uncle"—I said, "Who are his bankers?"—he said, "I could not tell that; I know his bankers, but I could not tell you; I would not like any inquiry made of them"—I then said it was impossible I could take his bill without making inquiry about him—he still declined to give the name, and Mr. Newton interposed, and said he thought it was only reasonable that he should give the name—he then told the name—he said, "I will tell you in confidence, his bankers are" so and so—I forget the name, but it was a well known banker, a name I was quite familiar with; I took no note of it, for I did not mean to take the bill—I then said, "As to the proceeds of this bill; I understand you have received the proceeds from Mr. Newton"—Mr. Newton (who had previously told me so), interposed, and said, "Yes, I have given all the money to Mr. Farrar, except 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I looked at Mr. Farrar to answer that question also, and he said, "Yes, that was so"—I then said, "Have you handed over the proceeds to Mr. Hullett"—he said, "All, with the exception of 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—(I should state that at the very commencement of our conversation, when I threw a doubt upon the <hi rend="italic">bond fides</hi> of the bill, he said at once that he had the materials to make it per<lb></lb>fectly plain to me that it was a bond fide transaction as between Mr. Hullett and Lord Dudley, that I need not feel the least uneasy about the bill, that it was quite right and genuine; he knew it of his own knowledge, that he had the means of satisfying me, and would do so)—I then said, "Well, pending the investigation of the genuineness of the bill, (of which he was to satisfy me) I suppose you will have no objection to hand me over the 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which you have in your hands?”—he said he did not see why he should do so—he seemed to me to throw a doubt on the safety of handing it to me; so I said to him, "Suppose you hand it over to Mr. Newton, that will be quite satisfactory to me if you leave it with Mr. Newton, to be added to the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he has in his hands, and he will hold it as a stake-holder, till the genuineness of the bill is proved"—he said that he had no objection to hand it to Mr. Newton, but he had not the money with him at the time—I said, "You can give Mr. Newton a cheque for it, that will do as well"—he said, "Oh, I have not my cheque book"—I handed him a piece of paper that was before me, and said, "Write a cheque, a blank cheque is just as good as a printed one"—he said, "Oh, I never write blank cheques, I could not do so at all; but I will give it to Mr. Newton on Wednesday next"—I said, "I want to leave for Dublin to night, and it would be more comfortable for me to see the money in Mr. Newton's hands before I leave"—he said that I might rely upon it that he should have it on Wednesday"—I again pressed, and said I could not leave Lon<lb></lb>don without seeing the money in Mr. Newton's hands—he then said, "I must decline to do so; I will not be pressed so—I will pay it on Wednesday, I think you should be quite satisfied with my assurance"—seeing that he would not give the money, I said, "How do I know that if I leave London, Mr. Hullett may not call upon you for this money, and you will have no answer but to hand it to him"—he said, "I will give you an undertaking that I will not pay the money over to Mr. Hullett"—I said, "Well, give me that written undertaking," and I handed him a sheet of paper—this is the undertaking he gave me—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should say that I dictated the writing I required—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Messrs. Guinness, Mahon &amp; Co., bankers, Dablin. September 7, 1868. I acknowledge to have in hand the sum of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,</p>

                  </hi>. I have heard nearly all Mr. Guinness' examination; what he has stated of the conversation is substantially correct—I am engaged at the South Sea House, Threadneedle Street as an accountant—I have some connection with financial parties who discount—late in April last Mr. Farrar called on me—I had known him previously—he asked if I knew any channel through which Mr. Mapleson's promissory notes, endorsed by Lord Dudley, could be discounted, and he mentioned an amount of 26, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the sum likely to be brought forward, as the amount of the bills—I told him that through a channel at the West End I had no doubt such an amount could be discounted—I made a communication to a party at the West End, and subsequently bad another interview with Mr. Farrar—the matter extended from late in April till early in May before it was finally brought to a close—the second interview with Farrar was a few days after the first—I then told him that the bills could be dis<lb></lb>counted—he said he had not got them, he expected to get them, and he would see me again—I saw him again in the course of four or five days, to</p>

               <p>the best of my belief—he called upon me—he then said that the bills were not likely to come forward, he understood that the Earl of Dudley's bankers had heard of the proposition, and that they were willing to advance him any reasonable amount upon fair terms, and that the transaction could not be carried through—I saw him again in June, but it is quite possible he may have called previously—at a subsequent period he brought me a bill of exchange for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be drawn by Hullett on Lord Dudley—to the best of my belief this is the bill (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>)—at the same time he handed me this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "July 25. Dear Mr. Farrar, I enclose you the bill of Earl Dudley, which I named to you before, and should be extremely obliged if you could let me have the cash for it, what you think fair. I ought to add the reason it was not made payable at Dudley's banker's, is that his lordship seems to have a wish it should not be, probably because he did not wish it to be in their hands, being a private one to me on account. It will be met at the bank made payable at, without fail—yours, J. Hullett")—I have since ascertained that the date of this inter<lb></lb>view was 31st July—under a misapprehension I have said it was in the beginning of August—It was at the South Sea House, where I am engaged—Mr. Farrar asked if the bill could be discounted, and having been informed previously that bills of Lord Dudley's could be discounted, I said I would place it in the same channel, with a view to its being done—I took it up to the same quarter, at the West End, and left it were with that object—the gentleman with whom I left it in the first instance was Mr. Gisborne—Mr. Foxall is in the same office, it is in the Strand—I saw Mr. Farrar again in the course of a few days, four or five, probably: it was understood that the bill was going to be offered out of town, and it would take two or three days to get the answer; therefore it was arranged that he should call again in a few days—he did call, and I told him the terms upon which it could be discounted out of town appeared to be so high that I had not been able to accede to them, and that the bill would be sent to a different quarter, to try it there—on 6th August it was placed with Mr. Foxall—on 15th August I obtained the proceeds of the bill, in a draft from Mr. Foxall for 777<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—between the 6th and 15th August I had an interview with Mr. Farrar—it was about the 10th or 12th—I then told him that further evidence was required in reference to the transaction—on the 15th I saw him again—I told him on that day that Mr. Foxall had received the proceeds from Dublin, but that conditions were attached to the transaction, which, without his (Mr. Farrar's) authority, I could not proceed—the conditions were that the agreement should be retained—he said he was going out of town, and knowing that I had only to go up to Mr. Foxall to receive the proceeds, I gave Mr. Farrar these two cheques on account of the transaction, one for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they have been subsequently returned to me in the ordinary course as having been paid—Mr. Farrar's endorsement is upon them—on the 21st I saw him again, and on that occasion gave him these two cheques for 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 21st and 29th August—they have been returned in the ordinary course as paid—I did not give him the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on the 21st, I gave him the 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then—that makes 705<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—he owed me between 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. previously—the balance of the 777<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was made up of that sum and the commission and discount—I know Farrar's handwriting—the endorse<lb></lb>ment on these different cheques are his writing—they are all endorsed by him—three of them appear to have passed through Williams, Deacon &amp; Co.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) purporting to be drawn by Hullett on Eversfield—it bears the endorsement of John Hullett—he asked if I could get it discounted: he had previously told me that Mr. Eversfield was one of Mr. Hullett's trustees, and his (Hullett's) uncle—I dare say that was two months before: he had a bill for a similar amount at that time: that was not discounted, he showed it to me: this 353<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was discounted by the firm of Wright and Gamble—Mr. Farror received the proceeds of it himself—they accounted to him for the proceeds.</p>

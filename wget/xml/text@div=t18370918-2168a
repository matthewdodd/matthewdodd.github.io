                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Southwark, and am a linen draper. The prisoner was in my employ as porter—it was not his duty to attend to the shop, but he was left in the back part of it occasionally—I have not missed this shawl in particular, but I have missed several things from the warehouse—I know this shawl is similar to what I have in my warehouse—I have sold several of them—I believe this to be mine.</p>

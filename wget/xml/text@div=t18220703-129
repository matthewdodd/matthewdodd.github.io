            . My father keeps the Arrow, public-house, at Stratford. On the 25th of March, at about one o'clock in the morning, I was returning from the Adelphi Theatre with Murrell - Metcalf laid hold of us by the collar in Gray's Inn-lane, and producing a staff to Murrell, wished to know what he had about him. Murrell asked his reason for it - Metcalf then collared me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let us see what you have got, young fellow;" - he took us into the Peacock, public-house; he called Poole across the way to him by the name of Jack; then Metcalf took a handkerchief out of my side pocket; he also took two from Murrell's pocket and one from his hat - this was in the Peacock, behind the bar; Pool stood by his side. He then asked me to have something to drink; I said I did not care, and a shilling's worth of shrub was called for, which I paid for. Then Metcalf tied our hands together, and took us as far as Hatton-garden. Both I and Murrell had told him where they could find us - this was in the street - they untied our hands. We then went down somewhere to see if there was a house open, to have something more to drink, and none being open, they took us back to the Peacock, where we had six-pennyworth more liquor, which I paid for - Some females were there, who had walked behind us all the way as their companions. Metcalf asked what they would take to drink - they said some porter; the landlord said he could not draw it, for he wanted to shut up, but they might take some in a can with them; half a gallon was drawn, which I paid for, and Metcalf carried the can to a house in Charlotte-buildings, where the women accompanied us. Poole and the two females sat down on the bed, and told us to sit down too - we did, on a chair. We kept drinking the porter for about half an hour - Murrell kept saying he wanted to go home. The girls stopped behind, and the prisoners said they would see us part of the way - they came down as far as Fleet-market with us.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen did you pass in the way - A. I do not know. They wished us Good night, and returned up towards Smithfield, and we went towards Snow-hill. I did not ask for the handkerchief. Poole told me to come next day to No. 10, Duke's-court, Clerkenwell, for them. I wished to get home, so I did not ask for it. I thought he meant to steal it - he gave us a false direction. I have seen my handkerchief since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you complain to any officer - A. No, not till three months after.</p>
               <p>

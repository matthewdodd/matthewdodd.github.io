               <p>visit my mistress, and I knew that she was in the habit of attending the Presbyterian services at the Lecture Hall; I saw her there on the morning of the 2nd March; she took the sacrament in the morning—I saw her again in the evening at the same place, about 6.45—she used to generally occupy a particular seat—I spoke to her in the lobby, and I noticed that she ap<lb></lb>peared very excited—the service had commenced when she came in, and she sat down in a seat behind the door; that was not the seat usually occupied by her—when the service was over I noticed that Mrs. Thomas was not there, and I never saw her again alive—Vine Cottages are about a quarter of an hour's walk from the Lecture Hall—the bonnet now produced I have no doubt is the one that was worn by Mrs. Thomas; I had seen her wearing it on previous occasions.</p>

I live at 1, Mayfield, and am the leaseholder of the next house, No. 2, which I let to Mrs. Thomas from Michaelmas last—a little girl, named Edith Menhennick, lived with Mrs. Thomas from September till nearly the end of January, and the prisoner came quite at the end of January or the beginning of February—Mrs. Thomas came to me on the last Thursday in February, I think it was the 27th; I did not speak to her but received a message from her—on Saturday, 1st March, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw her planting a flower in the garden, and I never saw her again—on Monday, 3rd March, I heard a noise in No. 2, as though washing was going on, and some clothes were hung out in the garden before 8 o'clock; all that morning there was a very strange smell, and I mentioned it to one of my apprentices—I saw in the garden a white flannel vest, two pairs of flannel drawers, one or two sheets, and a white cotton or calico petticoat—they were not there on the Sunday; they remained till Wednesday—on the Monday and Tuesday night I heard noises in the house, a deal of moving, but no voices, and we heard them light the fire and a sound of chopping wood on the hearth and poking the fire up to about 9 o'clock—about 1.30 on the afternoon of 3rd March I noticed the breakfast things on the table in the dining room, and they were there the next day at the same time—I cannot say whether they had been removed and replaced in the interval—I noticed at dusk on the Tuesday evening that they had been removed—I sent Mary Roberts to the house with a message on the Tuesday morning, and she came back with a message to me—Mrs. Thomas's bedroom was what was called the long room over the hall and over the side entrance, it goes right through—I do not mean the drawing-room—on the Tuesday evening we heard the noise of people coming into the house—we heard their footsteps, and male and female voices, but could not hear the words—we also heard some one touching the keys of the piano to make a sound—I have heard Mrs. Thomas play well—I saw Mrs. Keighley on the Wednesday afternoon; I think it was about 4 o'clock, and in the evening I heard sounds like the filing of iron</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300135"></xptr>
               <p>in Mrs. Thomas's front kitchen—I recognised a man and a child in the house—I saw a cabdriver go to the house on 11th or 12th, and on Saturday 15th I saw the prisoner in the dining-room with the window open—I suppose there was some one with her, for she said, "Lizzie, I think you want a pin or two"—about the end of that week I was in the garden; the fence is low, and I saw a man in the back dining-room writing in a small note book; his hair was like Church's, but the window sash came across his head so that I could not see him—on Tuesday, the 18th, about 11.40, I saw the prisoner in the front garden going into the next house; she looked at me and went on, and I went in—about the 7th two furniture vans came, a large one and a small one—I saw Weston there; he was a stranger to me, but I had some conversation with him outside—the prisoner was coming down the stairs of Mrs. Thomas's house, and the door was wide open—shortly afterwards the prisoner came to me and said, "Is it Miss Ives who wishes to know where the furniture is going to?"—I said "Well, I should like to know"—she said "Mrs. Thomas has sold her furniture; a man here can show the receipts; Mr. Weston is going to take it to Ham<lb></lb>mersmith"—I said "Where is Mrs. Thomas?"—she said "Don't know," and turned herself away—she was very much agitated, her face was quite convulsed, and she could hardly speak to me—I said "Can't you give me her address?"—she said "No"—I said "You must excuse me, I will attend to it," and shut the door—she came forward to come up the steps to speak to me, which made me say that, because she looked so frightful—I then went to my agent, and was away nearly half an hour—when I got back one of the vans was just moving; that was about a quarter or 20 minutes to eight, and it was quite dark; but I saw the prisoner and six or seven men standing outside the gate; it was hardly light enough to recognise who they were, except Weston—as I went up the path one of them, I think it was Weston, looked over the gate—next day, two men, strangers to me, came to my house and asked me some questions, and I gave them some answers—I thought the first was Mr. Porter—in the evening Church and Porter came to inquire after Mrs. Thomas—on 22nd March, Mr. Hughes, Mrs. Thomas's solicitor, came, and Porter and a police inspector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was nothing unusual in washing taking place in Mrs. Thomas's house, and then they would use the copper to the best of my knowledge, but the clothes were out unusually early, 8 o'clock; it was never so early before, but I will not undertake to say that they were not washed the night before—on the Sunday night, about 8 o'clock, before my apprentice left, I am sure I heard the voices of men and women—I said at the police-court that I heard several voices, and that they appeared to be the voices of men and women—that was while my apprentice was there—I was in the workroom with her before she went—she could hear them too if she was listening—they were such as to attract my attention, and she was sitting at the same table with me—I was the nearest to the next house—I heard the sound up to nearly 10 o'clock, but did not hear any one go out of the house—Mrs. Thomas's side-door is away from my house, and I should not hear anybody go in that way—I heard no one go up on the Tuesday night from the draw<lb></lb>ing-room to the bedroom; we could not hear that usually—the gas was alight; I cannot tell if the gas was put out that night, but Mrs. Thomas's hack bedroom window was left open for a day or two; it was open early on</p>

               <p>Wednesday morning, and it was in the same position the day before—on the Wednesday, about 6 p.m., I heard sounds of a man and a child; the man was singing in the kitchen, but only at intervals, and this filing was going on, but he was not singing so as to deaden the noise of the filing; he only gang a note or two; it was discordant, and then he stopped—the filing went on all the evening, but it ceased now and again—I said nothing at the police-court about singing and filing, but I said that I heard a man's voice—I said it first at the Treasury—it was on the 11th or 12th that I saw a cab drive up about 11 o'clock at night, and two women, and two or three men, and a little child got into it—one of the women was shorter than the prisoner, and one about the same height—the prisoner was one of them; I am sure of that—I said at the police-court "One woman resembled the prisoner," but I am sure it was her, because she had on the large waterproof cloak and the black hat which she usually wore—during 10 days or a fortnight people were con<lb></lb>tinually coming to the house at all sorts of odd hours, and taking away things in cabs, and we thought it strange—when they came that night the woman had a large white parcel—I only saw cabs come there on two nights; one came on Saturday—I only saw a parcel taken away on one night—the prisoner did not ask me before I shut the door whether I wanted my rent; she did not say a word—I did not see her when I came out again to go to the agent; as far as I know she had gone into the house—I was away half an hour, and when I came back I saw her in the road—I have not the slightest doubt about that; she was the nearest to the gate—the men went away with the last van; they all moved together, but the prisoner was first—she did not look to be separate from them as if she had left them—I said at the police-court that I thought it was Henry Porter who came in the middle of the day; I thought he came twice, in the evening and in the middle of the day—what I said was that Church came in the day, and came with another man in the evening; he was a much younger man than Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I only saw things taken away once—I saw a cab twice—I did not recognise anybody with the van but Weston—I only waited at the door while they were letting me in—the first van was just passing the gate and the second had not moved.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I imagined they were empty—I did not see any dresses flung in or anything of that sort—the people were standing still—the first van had got half a dozen yards from the house, not more, when I shut the door; the last van was then just passing our gate; they were both moving—Mr. Long is my agent—he did not come with me—on the Monday morning between 9 and 10 I first smelt a strange smell, and mentioned it to all the assistants—I did not mention that to the Magistrate because I did not think of it—we thought it was an escape of gas in our place, but we examined and found it was not; it was worse than that—I had two or three other assistants besides Roberts, but none of them are here.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be 16 next birthday—I have lived at 10, Rose Gardens, Hammersmith, with my father and mother nearly nine years—I was employed at Mr. Young's, the painter's, early in March; but I left there—I saw the prisoner at my father's gate on 4th March, at 5.30 or 6 o'clock—I know the date because it was my birthday—she said "How are you; Bob?"—I did not know her; I said, "Quite well, thank you"—she came into the house and waited till my father came in—she had no bonnet—my mother was there—I recognised the prisoner as having lived next door to us 5 or 6</p>

               <p>years—I knew her as Kate, but not by another name—she had a black cloth bag, glazed, under the table; about so long and so deep, with handles which were loose, there was no string to attach them—the bag was open, and I saw a brown paper parcel in it—my father returned after 6—it was half an hour since I first saw her—my father's name is Henry—she said "Halloa, Harry I how are you?"—he said "Quite well, thank you"—we then had our tea, during which she said that she had a nice house at Richmond—after tea my father and Kate went out, and she said she wanted me to go with her to carry the bag as far as Hammersmith Bridge, as she was going to meet a friend; I said "All right," and my father said he would go a little way with us—we three left the house at 7; my mother went to bed before we started, as she was not well—I carried the bag as far as the Angel, and then my father carried it, it was heavy—I saw my brother at the Angel—we started from Rose Gardens, through Boston Terrace, through Baynham Street and Cambridge Street, through the town towards Bridge Road, and then we turned to the right to the Oxford and Cambridge—we only went through part of Glenthorne Road—before we started Thurlow came to our house—we went past the Angel to the Broadway, and then to the bridge—my brother is employed at Chipmell's, the baker's; my father and Kate spoke to him; I did not hear what they said, but he carried the bag from the Angel to the Oxford and Cambridge, which is close to the bridge—my father, Kate, and I, went in there and had something to drink, and the prisoner said she was going to take the bag to a friend over the bridge—my father said "How long will you be?—she said "Not long"—I said "I will help carry it if she wants me"—she said "No, I can carry it myself," and left the house with it—I did not hear my father say any<lb></lb>thing—I went outside and saw her go to the bridge; it was dark, and I missed her going past the only shop that is in the road—I then went in again—it was 9 o'clock when she left—it took us over an hour to walk from Rose Gardens to the Oxford and Cambridge—we did not go fast—we stopped at the Angel, and I went to a water-closet at the Royal Oak for five minutes; they were going on, and my father halloaed back for me—we were at the Oxford and Cambridge half an hour before the prisoner left with the bag; she came back without it in twenty minutes; I don't remember her saying anything as to—where she had been—she showed us three or four rings in a box like a cigar-case; I had it in my hand; she said they were her sister's, who had died, and had sent them to her; my father saw them; I cannot say whether the landlady was there—the prisoner also produced some photographs; one was as big as a shilling; she said it was her por<lb></lb>trait, and said "It ain't like me"—it was not like her; the other was a young woman, who she said was her sister who was dead—she gave me the rings in the cigar-case, and said "Mind these till we get home"—I said I had no good pockets, and gave the case back; she put it in her pocket, and gave me two keys, and said "Mind these; they unlock the door"—she asked if I might go to Richmond with her; he consented; it was understood I was to return the same night—I held the keys in my hand—my father went with us as far as the District Railway, Hammersmith; that is the new station to Richmond—Kate took the tickets—I heard her say that she was Mrs. Thomas—we went to the new station at Richmond, and then walked to Vine Cottage—I still had the keys—we did not stop anywhere after we got out of the train, and I do not</p>

               <p>think she said anything, but when we got to Vine Cottage she said "Give me the keys"—I did so, and she opened the side door and we went in—she said that the front door lock was broken—we went into the sitting-room, where the glass doors are, and she found some matches on the table and got a light and we went into the front room—she gave me some rum, and said "I want you to help me carry a box to Richmond Bridge, because I have to meet a friend there"—she showed me two 51. notes, which she took from her pocket in a Monarch Building Society's book which I should know again—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and there was a post-office savings bank book—she said that they were her aunt's, who was dead and left them to her—she asked me to cast them up—I did not understand it, but I reckoned up for her the shillings and pence—I do not know what it amounted to, but I know I reckoned some of it up—I do not know whether she pulled the books out of her pocket—I got them out of the cupboard—she left the room; I don't know whether she went upstairs, but she came into the roam again in about ten minutes, or it might be more, with this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) corded up, and said "This is the box I want you to carry"—I afterwards saw it at Barnes Railway Station—I laid hold of one side of the cord and Kate laid hold of the other—the end was tied twice round; I did not notice whether there was a handle to it—it was not broken then, it was complete—I noticed that the box had also these two hinges—I did not know Richmond before, and I went the way she took me—we carried it together on to Richmond Bridge—it was near on 11 p.m. when we left the house with the box—I had no watch—I was in the house about three quarters of an hour or an hour before we left with the box—I saw a piano in the house, and Kate ran her fingers over it and said it was a nice one—I saw no one in the house but the prisoner—I did not hear any noise before she brought the box into the room—I think I pointed out the way we went to one of the policemen—I do not remember his name—we carried the box to the last recess, I think they call it, on the bridge—the prisoner then said "Put it down and you go on; my friend will be here directly," and I put it down in the recess on the ground—I don't think there is a seat there—I walked away on the other side the same way I had come—when I got to the first recess on the other side I heard a slight splash—I did not know whether it was the box or a barge coming under the bridge—I did not see a barge—I then saw a tall dark man on the same side as I was, walking towards Richmond, about half a dozen yards in front of me, at least two or three yards away—when I heard the splash he stopped and looked round and walked on—I was walking on slowly—the prisoner caught up with me when I had got nearly to the end of the bridge—she had no box with her then, and said "Bob, I have seen my friend; now get towards the station and get home," and I says "All right"—there was' also a carpet bag which I had carried from the house which I saw contained eatables, tea and sugar—she said, "Take those home to your mother, I shall be down with you for some tea"—I found that the last train had gone, and the prisoner said "Oh, I ain't got enough money to pay for a cab," and I went back with her and carried the bag—she opened the door of the house with the key, and I slept in the same room that the prisoner did, over the side door—there was a window back and front—I had my breakfast in the morning, and caught the 7.5 train—I took the bag—the prisoner said she would be down for some tea—I went home to Rose Gardens, and left the bag there and went to my work—</p>

               <p>I think I noticed on the Tuesday that the prisoner was wearing a gold watch and chain—I went to Richmond on the following Saturday—I don't know whether I had seen her at my father's in the meantime—I don't think I went to Richmond the next week—I might or might not have seen her at my father's house that week—I went there on another Saturday—I remember some old chairs and flowers being brought to my father's from Vine Cottage by Ricketts, and an india-rubber plant—the prisoner said the india-rubber plant was worth two guineas—I was at home on the evening of Tuesday, 18th March, when the prisoner's little boy was staying at my father's—he had been there perhaps five or six days, and was five or six years old—he was in bed when the prisoner came for him about 8 o'clock—my father and mother were not in, and the prisoner said "Go upstairs and fetch him"—she said she was going to take him to her father's—I went upstairs and dressed him, and then the prisoner went in the front room and brought out a bonnet box, and she asked me to carry the little boy to the top of the street, which I did—there was a cab waiting; there was nobody in it; the little boy got in, and the prisoner whispered to the cabman and got in—I did not notice whether there was anything in the cab—I asked her if she was coming back, and she said "Yes"—I said "Good night" to the little boy, and they drove away round Albion Road—in March my brother slept at home, and a little girl and the lodgers—the box I carried was not so very heavy—we rested now and then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Recalled and further Cross-examined</hi>). I first knew the prisoner between five and six years ago—she lived next door to us—she was very kind to a sister of mine, who has since died; she was between three and four years old at that time—the prisoner used to talk and play with her over the wall—I did not see her take her on her knee—she did not come in and out of our house very often—she did come in and out, and took notice of my little sister—I never saw her take the child on her knee, she used to play about with her—I knew her by the name of Kate—when I heard the splash in the water I wondered whether it was the box that went into the water or whether it was the splash of a barge—that was on 4th March—I heard of a box being found in the river on the day but one afterwards—I only heard different people talk about it—I heard that it had been found at Barnes, near Richmond—I did not know that it was the same box—I did not think it was the same—I only heard that it was a box, and that there was a woman's body found in it—when I went home on the Wednesday morning I don't think I told my father what had taken place about the box the night before—I saw my father in the evening—I don't know whether I told him or my mother that I went on to Richmond Bridge with the prisoner—I was to have come home that night—I don't know whether they asked me why I did not come home—I don't recollect telling my father at any time about being on the bridge with the prisoner and the box—I spoke first about it—I told Inspector Jones on the Sunday following from the 18th March (the 23rd)—from that night to the 23rd I never mentioned a word about the box to anybody, not to my recollection—I cannot say that I did not tell my father about it the very next day when I went home, I might have told him, and I might not—I did not tell my father that Kate had got a friend to meet over Richmond Bridge—I don't</p>

               <p>know whether I told him or not—I have got a bad recollection—it did not strike me as very curious that she should take a box and go and meet somebody without letting me go on over the bridge—I think it was a thing she she was likely to do—I think I gave my evidence three times at the police-court—I don't know how far it is from Rose Gardens to the Oxford and Cambridge; it might take me more than half an hour to walk it, it all depends on how you walk, whether slow or fast—I did not stop at the place of convenience a quarter of an hour; it is at the Angel—I don't exactly know whether I said at either of my examinations at the police-court that my father, the prisoner, and I, all three went inside the Angel; what I said was "I carried the bag as far as the Angel, my father took it and carried it to the Oxford and Cambridge"—I did not say anything about going inside the Angel or about going to the water-closet—the prisoner gave me the keys in the Oxford and Cambridge—I might have stated that before the last examination, or I might not; I might have said so in the first place—I don't know whether I said anything about it until the 10th May—she went in at the side door—she gave as a reason for that that the lock of the front door was broken—I only thought of that yesterday—I went out at the front door sometimes—on that night I went out at the side door—there are some steps to the front door—she and I did not carry the box and bag down the stops of the front door that night; I think it was at the side door—when the prisoner first came to our house on the Tuesday, my mother was at tea with us; I can't swear it, I can't be sure she was at tea with us—she was not lying on the bed at the time we were having tea; I will swear that—I did not hear my father give evidence at the police-court—I had no conversation last night about saying my mother was at tea; nor this morning, with my father and mother—I shall not say whether she was or was not at tea with us—the prisoner might have asked my father and me to see her off to the railway station, and she might not—she wanted me to carry the bag; we walked along as far as the Angel, and my father then took the bag; he might have taken it a little before we got to the Angel—I saw my brother William at the Angel; father spoke to him and then carried the bag to the Oxford and Cambridge—I don't know whether I said anything at the police-court about meeting my brother William and going into the Angel and having some beer—I don't think I said so up at Richmond—I think it was at the Oxford and Cambridge that she asked my father to let me go home with her; that was near 8 o'clock—we started from the station for Richmond about 9 o'clock or a little after—I don't know how long it took us to get from the station to Richmond; it might take more than a quarter of an hour—I don't know what reason she gave my father for asking me to go with her to Richmond at that time of night; that is best known to himself—I did not hear her give him any reason—when we got out at the Richmond station we turned to the left, up part of the town, and then through an alley—I saw a public-house, the first public-house out of the railway station—I don't know whose house it was; the prisoner did not leave me and go in there and have a glass of ale, I am quite sure of that—when we got to the house we both had some rum—she asked me to count up the figures in the bank books and building books—I might or I might not have said that before; I don't recollect—I counted up some of them—I did not trouble how I counted—I did not count all of it up—I did not tell her any amount; I don't recollect, I won't</p>

                  </hi>. I have lived at 10, Brightwell Cottages, Rose Gardens, Hammersmith, nearly nine years—I am a painter, and have been in the employ of Mr. Bird 23 years—my son William slept at the house, as well as the last witness—I first knew Webster six years ago by living next door—I knew her as Kate, without knowing her surname—she was a servant out of place—I knew her for five or six weeks—I had a little daughter, who is since dead, of whom the prisoner took very much notice—she went away from next door, and said she was going to Norland Crescent, Notting Hill, into a situation—I saw her about a week afterwards; she came to my house on a visit, a call—she cams afterwards on several occasions in the same way,</p>

               <p>not to stay, seven or eight times within a few months, and the last time I saw her, till last March, was nearly six years ago—I had not heard from her in the interval; I had lost sight of her altogether—on the 4th of last March, Tuesday, at 6 o'clock in the evening, I found her at my house when I came home—I did not recognise her at once; she seemed a great deal more respectably dressed—she said, "Hullo, father, here you are!"—I replied, "Kate, I should never have known you if you had not spoken first"—when I had known her before she had been in the habit of calling me Harry—we had tea together—at tea she said an aunt had died and left her a very comfortable home at Richmond, that she had been very unfortunate in letting her apartments, and she wanted to dispose of her home, as her father wrote from Ireland wishing her to sell off and come home and see after him, as he was very feeble and on his last legs—she asked me if I would go and see her off to the District Railway—I did so, with my son Robert—I had not noticed anything with her, only a black bag—it was a common bag, about 18 inches or 20 inches long, and nearly 12 inches in depth—we were about 20 minutes in the house—Kate, my son, and myself were at tea; no one else—my wife was upstairs in bed; she was not very well—before we started Thurlow came in; he is a neighbour, living nearly opposite, a painter and decorator—he stayed about 10 minutes; he had no tea—it was 7.20 or 7.30 when we started to the railway—Thurlow had left at that time—my son, Kate, and myself started—my son carried the bag—I had first seen the bag under our tea-table—I had not noticed whether it was open or closed—Kate and I walked together, and the boy behind—I had some conversation with her about her home at Richmond, which she wanted to dispose of—she asked me if I could find a respectable broker—I said I could, but I said, "Can't you find one at Richmond, as it would be much handier?"—she said she was not acquainted with the Richmond people much, and would prefer leaving it to me—that was the only conversation between the two of us before we went into the Oxford and Cambridge—about half the distance, opposite or near the Angel, I took the bag from the boy—it appeared to weigh about 20lb. or 25lb.—the boy lagged behind, and I thought he was looking in the shop-windows, and Kate and I waited, and when he came up I said, "What are you looking about for?" and he said, "Take the bag, father; it is rather heavy"—that was opposite the Angel—the three of us continued together till we got to the Oxford and Cambridge—we did not go near a baker's shop—I met my eldest son, William, at the Angel; his business is close by there; he was outside—we went into the Angel, Kate, myself, Robert, and William—Kate and William shook hands outside the Angel, and they asked after each other's health; the conversation lasted about 10 minutes—we had a glass of ale at the Angel, William, Kate, and myself—the Oxford and Cambridge is not on the way to the station—after leaving the Angel, Kate said she had a friend over at Barnes, and she wanted to go and see him, but she must not stay long—at the Oxford and Cambridge she proposed to have a glass of ale—Kate, I, and the boy went in; I called for a pint of ale; I paid for it, and asked her to drink; she did so—she said "I want to get over to see my friend at Barnes; I don't want to make it too late before I get home; I want to get back to Richmond"—she asked for the bag, and I proposed for the boy to carry it—"Oh, no," says she, "I can manage that myself; I shan't be long gone"—we stayed there till she came back—she was</p>

               <p>gone nearly half an hour, from 20 minutes to half an hoar—when she came back she had not got the bag with her—she said she had seen her friend—we had a second pint of ale—she showed me some photos; she represented one of them to be her father's portrait, and another her deceased sister's—one was the photograph of a man with a long beard, to the best of my recollec<lb></lb>tion; one of them was very small, about the size of a shilling; the man's was ordinary size; the very small one was her sister's, she said—she pro<lb></lb>duced five gold rings in a small box in wadding, I believe; they were rather small plain rings, one more remarkable than the others; it had a stone in it, I think, and was different from the others—the others were plain—I had them all in my hand—I do not recollect any writing on them—she said they belonged to her deceased sister, and had been sent over as a keepsake—I did not know Mrs. Cox, the landlady of the Oxford and Cambridge before—I had been there but very seldom—Mrs. Cox was present at the conversation and took the small—photo, in her hand—there was another person, a young person, behind the bar—there was no one in front of the bar but ourselves; the bar reaches as high as the ledge of the witness-box—the conversation about the photos, was after Kate had come back again—she told me her name was Mrs. Thomas; she said that several times that evening—I believe she mentioned it at home in my own house; she said she had had a husband, but he was dead—after she came back we stayed about a quarter of an hour at the Oxford and Cambridge; we then went to the District Railway, in the Broadway; it was 9 o'clock when we got there—she pressed me very much on the way to find her a respectable broker—I said I would do so—I mentioned Mr. Brooks—at the station she asked me if I would allow my son Robert to go home with her—I said I would, on condition she would send him back the same evening, as he was due at his work in the morning at 5.30—she said she would—I saw them off—my boy did not come back that night—I next saw the prisoner on Thursday, the 6th, about 6 p.m.—she had, as on the first night, the gold watch and chain—she said she hoped I had found a respectable broker, as I had promised, and about 9 o'clock or past we went to Mr. Brooks's—his shop was closed—we came back home, and I believe she stayed at my house the whole of the night—I went to Mr. Niblett's, the jeweller, on the 10th or 11th of March—I am not certain about the date—I believe she brought the gold with the teeth on that day—on the 6th, when she slept at my house she slept downstairs in the front parlour—on the Monday after the 8th, either on the 10th or the 11th, I first took her to Church's—she and I went in to have a glass of ale—I had been to Richmond on Saturday, the 8th—on the 6th she asked me to coma down to Richmond to see her comfortable home that she wanted to dispose of—I promised to go on the 8th, because it was a half holiday—I went at 2.30 p.m. by myself—I found out the place by inquiring—she had given me the address—the prisoner let me in—I looked over the house—she asked me what I thought about the. house—I said, "It is a very comfortable one, very respectable"—she said she would like to have a broker, and that they would not allow her to have an auction sale on the premises—she said she was going to keep for her own use the best bed and bedding—I was there three hours—we came home together—she stayed at my house and went away on the Monday morning—I am away early in the morning—I know she slept there on Sunday night—I saw her last at 9 o'clock on Sunday even<lb></lb>ing and next on Monday evening, about 6 p.m.—she was then pressing me</p>

               <p>about finding a broker for the furniture—she thought I was neglecting it—J could not say whether it was on the Monday evening or the Tuesday that I introduced her to Church; I should think it was on the Tuesday—the prisoner and I went to Church's—it is ten houses from mine—we had a glass of ale—Church came in—I spoke to him in her presence respecting the furniture—I said, "Mr. Church, here is a friend of mine has a respectable home to dispose of"—he said, "Has she? I want a few things; perhaps they will suit me"—we were in front of the bar—he said if the things would suit him he would buy them; and if there were more than he wanted, he would put them in an auction sale—we were there a quarter or half an hour—I rather think we went into the bar parlour to arrange matters—Kate and I then went home to my place—I did not notice any conversation between Church and the prisoner while we were in Church's place—they spoke together; the prisoner said, "Church, don't you know me"—he said, "No, I don't"—she said, "I'm an old neighbour of Porter's"—she slept at my place that night—I saw her nearly every day up to the 18th—I heard from heron the next day or the day following, that Church had been down—on the 13th, 14th, and 15th (Thursday, Friday and Saturday), I was at the house with the prisoner and Church, looking over the furniture—I went with the other two on all three days—we were looking the furniture over to get a proper under<lb></lb>standing to buy it—previously to our going down he had offered 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not think it was sufficient—the prisoner and I went into each room separately—I left her to value it, knowing better what the things were worth—I put down the figures she gave me, and it made 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in my and her presence Church agreed to give that—the valuing was done on the 13th, and the extra 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was agreed to on that day, on the Friday, and he gave her a cheque; I believe it was a note—she preferred having gold instead of a note—he said, "It don't matter to me, at the corner of the Grove is my banking account You can go there in the morning and draw the gold"—the bank is in the Broadway, Hammersmith—we all three came away together—grocery was sent or brought by the prisoner to my house; she said some of it was for her own consumption and her little boy's—she was a good deal at my house from the 4th to the 18th—linen was also sent there—I brought it away from Vine Cottages on the Saturday, the 15th—the prisoner packed it up and put it in a cab—I left in the cab, leaving her there—I remember some plate being packed up by the prisoner—it was cleaned in my presence by the prisoner—that went to Church's—she said she had got the silver ready to take with her to Ireland at the same time she took the linen—the prisoner took it to Church's; she said she thought it would be safe there—on Tuesday, the 18th, in the evening, about 6, I went to the house and found there the prisoner, Church, and another man named Mary on—about 7 came the vans with the proprietor and two or three men—a chest of drawers and two or three other things were taken out of the house to the vans—Miss Ives next door spoke to Mr. "Weston—the prisoner said "Who is it inquiring after me?"—I said "The lady next door, that you say is your landlady"—she went to Miss Ives next door, and returned in a few minutes; she certainly seemed a little agitated—she said "Harry, come upstairs and take down a dress or two off the pegs; I want to send them to Hammersmith"—I went up with her and took down the dresses and a fur jacket—we came downstairs together and she went out at the front door I called Church's attention—she went out at the front door, and I saw no</p>

               <p>more of her till I saw her at Richmond—I don't know what she did with the dresses—I helped to put hack into the house the things that had been taken out—in a quarter of an hour from the time we missed the prisoner the vans left the house—I and Church went home by train—I had had the prisoner's little boy at our house seven or eight days—when I got back home he was gone—next day we went to Richmond, to Miss Ives's, about 6 or seven in the evening—Church went to Miss Ives's door and knocked; I believe the servant answered the door, and Miss Ives came forward—the prisoner showed me some artificial teeth at my house, I believe on the 10th or 11th; she said they had belonged to her deceased aunt; she wanted to dispose of them, would I go to Hammersmith and take them to a jeweller's shop?—I took them to Mr. Niblett's, a jeweller's, and the prisoner stood outside looking through the window—I sold them for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave it to the prisoner, who gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my trouble—on Sunday night, 2nd March, I was at home a portion of the time; I was not at Richmond—I was at Church's house from 9 o'clock up to about half-past 11—Church was there all that time, in and out—on the Monday evening, the next night, I was at home at my own place—I was not at Richmond—I was at Church's that night—I did not see much of him that night, because he was upstairs, engaged with his club—I believe I saw him—I might have been there near three or four hours—I would not go in till half-past 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About five or six years ago I knew the prisoner, I should think, for nearly five or six weeks; it was not six months, she was not next door six months, nothing near it—she used to take notice of my child over the wall—she came into our house once or twice, and played with the child—she seemed fond of it—she was not fre<lb></lb>quently there, she did not ask one of my daughters to go over and see her at Norland Crescent where she was in service; it is an untruth—during the two months following her leaving she came over and visited us half a dozen times—she was on friendly terms—she did not bring eatables or anything with her—she did not have tea there in my presence—I don't remember her being there one Sunday and having tea with me and my wife; it is so long ago I don't recollect; she might have done—I gave evidence about the photographs before the Magistrates at Richmond—I believe I said one was the photograph of a man with a long beard—I cannot swear I did—I cannot say whether this is the first time I have mentioned in a Court of Justice the photograph of" a man with a long beard—I might have sworn before the Magistrates that the photographs were those of three females—I might have made that mistake—I did not at Richmond say a word about meeting my son William at the Angel—my son William was not called at the police-court till the 8th of May, when I had given my evidence on both occasions—when I was seeing after the disposal of her furniture I expected to be paid for my loss of time—I thought she was in good circumstances—I did not go to Mr. Brooks myself, nor did I speak to any broker—I had promised to find a broker—she was providing meat and groceries the whole fortnight, a portion for herself and child—I had my share—I did not find a broker, because I was otherwise engaged—I did not have short time that first week, it was the second—my hours are from 6 to 5.30—on Sunday night, the 2nd, I was at Church's from 7.30 to closing time—I did not go out till then—I don't know how long it takes to drive from Richmond to Rose</p>

               <p>Gardens in a cab; it would not take less than 35 minutes—I might have said at first that it was on Monday, the 10th, that I introduced the prisoner to Church—I could not say whether it was the 10th or 11th—I might have said that on Tuesday, the 11th, she told me she had been down to Rich<lb></lb>mond with Church—I will swear it was not on Monday, the 3rd of March—Tuesday, the 4th, may have been the day Church ought to have been to Ken<lb></lb>sington for his bagatelle licensee—I left the house on Tuesday evening at 12.30 as the house closed—I went there after leaving Kate "Webster at the station—I saw the prisoner take the tickets at the District Railway Station, Ham<lb></lb>mersmith; 1 mean the station on the opposite side of the Broadway, not the one next to Mr. Ayre's public-house; it is the same side as the Clarendon public-house, which Mr. Ayre's brother used to keep; the District Rail<lb></lb>way used to stop at Hammersmith before it went to Richmond, and the old station is still there; that is the place where she took the tickets; you do not go under any road, but the trains run under the Broadway; the station is down under the Broadway level; the first thing you would have to do would be to go under the road right through the Broadway—the train started soon after we got there, but I could not see because I left them on the top when they took the tickets; I did not go down on to the platform to see them away—I do not remember asking Kate if she would have another glass of ale before she went, or her saying "No, I shall lose the train;" she made no remark about losing the train; she said she wanted to get home as early as she could—when I got back to the Rising Sun at 10 o'clock I saw Church there serving customers—he or his wife are generally there—it was at the station that Kate asked me to let little Bob go down to Richmond; I don't know what that was for; she said "Robert, you might have a ride down to Richmond with me," and she said "I will send him home to-night"—I said "He has got a very nice place of employment, and I do not want him to lose that"—he was not to come back by the next train; she gave no reason for taking him down; I did not think it strange, or I should not have let him go—I know a house called Hartley's at Rich<lb></lb>mond—she did not say in my presence, "Church is to meet me at Hartley's"—I have met Church at Hartley's on several occasions since this case has been on—I never met him there in the first or second week in March—on the 18th I met them at home; he might have called in at Hartley's on the 18th—I never knew Hartley's until 8th March, Saturday—he keeps the Bell and Anchor—I went down on that Saturday by the prisoner's permission to see the furniture—I was not at Hartley's on Tuesday night, 4th March—I did not know where it was—I did not say to Kate in my house, "Is not the boy going down with you, Kate?"—nothing of the kind, that I swear—we had some conversation at tea; she had not proposed at tea-time that he should go down—I did not see my son William at tea-time; I very seldom see him at all; his business keeps him away—I saw my son Robert on Monday night, 3rd March, at home; he never goes away from home after he has done his day's work, but he may run about the streets—I was at home that night but not all the evening, because after I have had my tea and had a wash I generally spend an hour or two at Church's—I was there that night, I cannot say how long to an hour or two, but I never go farther—I was never out of Hammersmith I am certain—the prisoner did not say to me on the road to the station "Are you coming down to-night?"Nothing of the kind—I lost two and a half days' work between</p>

               <p>the 4th and the 18th, because Saturday was a half-holiday—I cannot say whether the prisoner was at my house when I got home on Tuesday, 11th; it's possible she may have come in afterwards, for she spent most of her time at my place—she put down the amounts and I cast them up to 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—J don't believe Church knew the value of the goods any more than I did—she wanted to wait till Mrs. Porter came down—I did not say that I thought 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a very fair price for the things—after Miss Ives came out and the prisoner came out and spoke to her, the prisoner went into 2, Vine Cottages, I cannot say whether into the front room—I don't know whether Church was in the front room or not, but I know that he was somewhere about the house preparing to move—she did not remain five minutes after Miss Ives had spoken to her—I did sot see Miss Ives go out with her hat and cloak on—the prisoner was standing in the hall when she asked me to take down the dresses, but I did not bring them down, she brought them down and took them to the van, and never came back—I don't know that she and Church were in the front room talking—after that the vans both went away at the same time, and we went away with them; the large one was first, the one we had put the dresses into; we followed the vans and then went into a public-house—the prisoner did not say in the presence of Church and myself "It is all very well, but who is to pay me"—Church paid her half a sovereign deposit, but what he paid her afterwards I don't know—he did not pay her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Vine Cottages, but I believe they settled it afterwards—Weston did not refuse to take the things out of the van unless he was paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor was the matter compromised by his getting 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard of the Barnes mystery—I saw Kate at Richmond the night before, and I expected my son home, but he did not come—I did not see him next morning before I went away; I saw him in the" evening—I did not ask him why he did not come home the night before—I allowed my son to stop out all night without questioning him—he had my permission to go, but not to stay out all night—he did not tell me what took place at the prisoner's at Richmond; I do not remember his saying a word—I did ask him what he thought of the home—he said it was a very nice home, nothing else—he did not tell me till afterwards that she had given him some rum, not till his mother was reading <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper</hi> about the Barnes mystery—I cannot say the date, but I suppose that would be the 9th—the box was dropped in the river on the 4th, and on the 9th I heard of the Barnes mystery—my son Robert then began to tell me more of what took place on the night that he went to the prisoner's—he told me that he had been on the bridge at Richmond with the box on the Tuesday night with the prisoner, and that he heard a splash—I am quite sure he told me all this on Sunday, the 9th; he described the size of the box with his hands, it answered the description in <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper</hi> of the box found in the river—I understood from him that he thought the box might have been the one found in the river—I heard previous to March 18th that an inquest had been held on the contents of the box—I may have read a report of the inquest in the paper at which Dr. Adams gave evidence, but I don't know—I take in Lloyd's, the Graphic, and the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>—I do not know that I read the report of the inquest on the 18th; my attention was called more to the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi> than to any other paper—I read the one before the 9th—sometimes I do not take up <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's</hi>, on a Sunday, but I happened to do so on Sunday, the 9th—the inquest was held on the 18th—we did not give any informa<lb></lb>tion</p>

               <p>—we saw Miss Ives; I had the door closed in my face—I cannot tell you the date when I gave any information—the first person I informed was Mr. Menhenick, of Finsbury Park; Church and I went to him together—I don't know whether Church came to me or sent for me; he did not come and have a conversation with me in my front parlour; the conversation which resulted in our going to Menhenick was either in the public-house or my back room, but he wanted to know what had become of his 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell you whether he spoke to me in my back room or not, he had very seldom been in my house before the 18th—I don't think he ever had, only calling for cans; he never was in my house but once to my knowledge, and that was when we went boating on the river—I do not think he came on the 20th, the day before we went to Menhenick's, or that he and I went into my back room together, but I cannot swear it—I believe I had the conversation with him the same day that we went to Menhenick's, it was the evening part because we got to Menhenick's about 7 o'clock—I don't remember his mentioning anything about an inquest upon the contents of the box—I won't swear that he did not tell me that Dr. Adams had given some evidence about the bones in the box—I don't believe he ever mentioned there was likely to be a police inquiry, but I cannot swear it—he told me he had got a letter which was written by a friend of Mrs. Thomas—we were not nearly an hour talking together, nor yet a quarter of an hour—I do not know whether anybody else was present; we went away together—I did not think it was a very serious matter after hearing that there was an inquest—I did not think I need trouble myself at all; that being so we went away to Mr. Menhenick's; Church was the principal spokesman—I did not go to the police and give information when the box was found in the river, although my son had spoken about a box, because I had no sus<lb></lb>picion, or else I should have been the first to make a complaint and to lay information—I had a suspicion after my son told me that it was like the box, but I did not give information, because I did not suspect the prisoner in the least—Church never paid the prisoner 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my presence—I did not swear at the police-court that I saw two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes paid on one day, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold on another day, they might have been two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; they were bank notes—I have said on two different occasions I saw 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid—I told the Justices at Richmond that I did not have any of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor had I—I did not suggest to Church that he should send the police and try to get his 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back from the woman, until 21st March—Church did not pay a bill in my presence while the vans were waiting—Church did not speak to me between the 18th and 21st, only respecting his 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he thought was lost, he used every energy to get it back, and so did I; I did not go to the police about it, it would have been very wise if I had—when we went to Mr. Menhenick's, Church told the whole story as far as he was concerned and I said a few words—I did not tell Menhenick that I had had various pre<lb></lb>sents from the prisoner; I may have told him that while she was professing to have a comfortable home at Richmond, she was sleeping in my cottage at Hammersmith—most likely I told him that I was having grocery and meat and all sorts of things from Richmond at her expense—I know a person named Ricketts, he keeps a van, which I hired on Saturday, 15th March, to go to Vine Cottage and to bring the prisoner's boxes, or a portion of her things, but he came back without them; he only brought four chairs, an India-rubber plant, and five or six common flower pots; I paid him for that</p>

               <p>—I burnt those chairs before 18th March on a Sunday morning—I believe I had nothing else from Vine Cottage on the 15th; I did not come away with the prisoner, I came home with the laundry work when the chairs were brought to my house—I did not know that 12 lb. of beef was also brought away and that it went to Church's; we had a leg of mutton raw on the 15th from Vine Cottage, and it was cooked at a bake house next door to Church's—I was at Vine Cottage when the plate was taken away; that could not be on the 15th because we came home in a cab; it was in a small square basket, it could not have been brought away on the same Saturday before the furniture, because I came home with the prisoner and Church by the railway, and she had the basket with the silver in it then—she was at my house that night and slept there; I was at Church's that Saturday night, we all went in together, three or four of us; Church, Webster and I, all went from Richmond to Hammersmith in a cab together, and the plate was in a basket; that was on the Saturday—I made a mistake before when I said it was not the 15th—on the day I went down to value the furniture there was no one there but Webster, Church, and myself when the furniture was valued at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor was there the next day; we went down together the next day—before the 15th, when the plate and the chaise and the other things were removed, no other man but Church and myself was with Webster at Vine Cottage in my presence; I saw Church draw a receipt; I did not hear the prisoner ask him what he drew it for when the thing was between themselves—I did not hear her say anything about a receipt; it was drawn up before we got there—after I got down in the evening, Church asked me to get a receipt stamp, and I got two, one was for her to give a receipt to him on the bill; she did not in my presence, instead of signing the receipt for the money, say "What do you want a receipt for when the matter is between ourselves V nor did she say "To make it all square"—I fetched two stamps, because I did not think a penny stamp would receipt a 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—they had a bottle of brandy that day, and the prisoner could not find the corkscrew—I have no recollection of Church saying "I believe you have got it, Harry"—I had not got it—I did not leave, and say "I expect some of the property as well as you," Nothing of the kind—I went down more on her part to see that he paid a fair price for the furniture, and gave her the fair value—he knew no more than I did about it, and I only jumped at it—I went that she should have justice—I was never there till after the 8th; I was not there on the 6th, or the Wednesday or Thursday after the Tuesday—I was there on one or two occasions after the 8th, and I may have been there once for four or five hours—I never came home from Richmond but twice in a cab; we did come home late one night, about 10 o'clock; that would be from the 10th to the 16th; I cannot say the night—I went down about 6.30—I was all that time arranging about the furniture, and how it was going to be removed; Church, me, and the prisoner had something to drink, but very little—I cannot say whether that was Wednesday, 12th—the furniture had not been attempted to be packed—that was long before the plate was taken away—when I got down at 6.30 the prisoner did not appear the worse for drink—that was not Tuesday the 4th—I slid not leave Vine Cottage three times in the week which began on the 3rd and ended on the 8th—I never was there; I swear that.</p>

               <p>Porter went with me to have a glass of ale—next day, Tuesday the 18th, I went down with two vans and got there before 7 o'clock; Maryon was there, but he had nothing to do with me—some things were brought out of the house and put into one of the vans—Miss Ives spoke to me in the garden at the front door of No. 2, and wanted to know where the furniture was going to be taken to—I told her I did not know exactly, and said, "There is the lady at the door," pointing to the prisoner and Church—the prisoner went on and spoke to Miss Ives, who went back into the room—Church then said, "There is something wrong, we had better fetch the goods back out of the van," and that she had led him astray, or something to that effect, and he would not have anything to do with it—I had been paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a deposit on the 14th, and Church made it up 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the things were taken back into the house, and the prisoner brought some dresses out on her arm and threw them into the van and said, "Take them home, I am off to the station"—that was ten minutes or a quarter of a hour after she came from Miss Ives—I think she also brought out a bandbox, similar to this, but I won't be sure—she said, "Give me that black dress back," it was taken out of the van and she took it away with her and went towards the station—that was the last I saw of her—she was alone—I did not notice whether she had a bonnet on—I was in a covered van and could not see where Church was—the goods were put back, the house was shut up, and we moved off with the vans—there were three men who I took with me, and Marion, Porter, and Church—we all went away together, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the prisoner left; and went to a public-house round the corner and had some drink—I heard that Church, Porter, and Marion, went back by train and we went by van—when we got home I took the dresses and the band-box out of the van at Church's and put them on a form, and Church told me to take them to No. 10—that is Porter's, but I left them at Church's.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Alfred Clark, of Church Street, Twickenham—on the morning of the 10th of March I was on the allotment ground at Copthall, rented by my master—it is bounded by two roads, and a pathway leads through it; a heap of dung was there for some time—I was wheeling dung from the heap—I dug a foot and ankle out of the dung—it had been sawn off recently—the heap was some 10 yards from one footpath, and about two from another; I covered it over again—ultimately I took it to Dr. Clark's surgery and showed it to Mr. Cameron, who showed it to Dr. Clark, and then I took it to the police-station, and gave it to the sergeant on duty—this was on Tuesday, the 11th, and on the same day I took it to the mortuary at Twickenham and left it there.</p>

I live at 45, Ambler Street, Finsbury Park—I had known Mrs. Thomas 10 years as a friend—on January 11 I last saw her at 2, Vine Cottages—on Friday, March 21,1 remember the witnesses John Church and Henry Porter coming to my house in the evening—Church showed me a letter, in my wife's writing, to Mrs. Thomas—Church made a commu<lb></lb>nication to me—they were with me more than an hour—Church left his name and address—I communicated next morning with Mr. Hughes, Mrs. Thomas's solicitor—the photograph produced is that of Mrs. Thomas—she was about 5ft 3in. in height.</p>

I live at 12, Chapel Street, Bedford Row, and am a solicitor—my brother is executor of Julia Martha Thomas—I have known her over 30 years—she first married a Mr. James Murray—Mr. Thomas died in 1873—on Saturday, March 22nd, my brother was ill, and I, at his request, went to Hammersmith between 3 and 4 p.m.—I saw Church—he showed me a purse—it contained five rings wrapped up in wool, two wedding-rings, a keeper, a mourning ring, and a dress ring of some sort with name and date engraved on it—these are the rings—I asked Church a number of questions with reference to Mrs. Thomas, and he gave me information—I expressed a wish to see Porter, and Church sent for him—I asked him questions and got information from him, and the three of us went to Rich<lb></lb>mond Police-station, and then to 2, May field—it was 5 o'clock when we got to the house—we got through Miss Ives's house and made an entry—I saw Church find in the closet in the front room a gold watch and chain, at least he said he found it, he produced it; he had his back to me—he made some remark about a large photograph, which I recognised as a photograph of my father—it was not in an album—I believe Miss Ives came in—Church and Porter gave their answers to me very frankly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Porter told me that Mrs. Thomas had said to him her father was a solicitor in Scotland—according to Porter's account, she was going to Scotland—I am certain Porter said Scotland, not Ireland—he said at first that she went away in a cab; but when I questioned him he said he did not see her go—when we got into the front room, Church went straight to the cupboard and immediately turned round and said, "Here's her gold watch and chain"—the first thing he did was to go to the cupboard—when I was talking to Church in his own house he told me the portrait of the father, was in the hall—I did not see it in the hall—I said to him, "There is the photograph"—he went and moved the palliasse away and stood in front of the cupboard, blocking up the view, and said, "Here's her watch and chain"—I was not in a position to see whether he took the watch and chain out of the cupboard or out of his pocket—the police inspector and I had only casually looked at the cupboard—the palliasse did not hide the cupboard entirely—Porter said the woman stayed a long while, several hours, at his house when she first came.</p>

It is very hard the innocent should suffer for the guilty"—I had previously cautioned her not to make any statement without considering the whole thing; and I also said, "I hope you will not say a word against an innocent person"—I said that before she said a word about any other person—the night before I said that she said she intended to tell the truth and the truth only—on the steamboat between Dublin and Holyhead she made a very long statement—it was a continuous statement—she stopped sometimes because she was not very well, she was inclined to be sea sick—it was all one statement—I did not take it down as she said it—it was very rough on board—at the police station at Richmond, on 30th March, I repeated her statement verbally in her presence to Inspectors Jones and Pearman, and it was then taken down by Jones as I repeated it—then Church was called in—he was not then in custody—the statement was read over to him and the prisoner—she said it was true—during the writing down the prisoner said she wished to make some addition, which was not then taken down, but afterwards it was—at the end of the reading Webster said, "That is quite true"—Church seemed to be laughing at it—I told him to be careful, I thought it was a serious case—he said, "The lying woman, how can she say that about me? I know nothing of her"—when Church was brought in first he was introduced to identify the prisoner—he said, "I think that's Mrs. Thomas"—Church at the end of the interview was given into custody—in consequence of a letter I received I went on the 15th of April with Inspector Jones to the House of Detention—Mr. O'Brien, the prisoner's solicitor, was there with the prisoner—she made a long statement, after being cautioned, which was taken down by Inspector Jones from her lips, word for word.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am assistant surgeon at the Westminster Hospital, and lecturer on forensic medicine there—I live at 17, Delahay Street—on the 12th March last I went to the mortuary at Barnes, and saw. some portions of a human body, but they were not then in the box, and also some portions in another box—there were the upper part of the chest, with the upper ribs, the heart and part of the right lung attached, the right shoulder and part of the right upper arm, the whole of the left upper arm, the right thigh, cut off below the joint, the right leg divided from the thigh at the knee joint, and cut off from the foot above the ankle, also a part of the pelvis, with the uterus attached, and the left foot cut off above the ankle joint—I did not notice the ovaries; they were shrivelled and dried; the soft parts appeared to have been hacked—he bones had been sawn roughly, and the division had been made without any relation to anatomical structure—the divisions of the bones might have been produced by an ordinary meat saw; with the exception of one thigh the remains were very dry, shrivelled, shrunken, and very brown, and the soft parts easily tore, the cartilage easily peeled off, and the tendons were very soft; I had no doubt that the parts had been boiled—the thigh was in a natural state; it contained fluid blood; the muscles were red, and not retracted; it appeared to have been dead a week or a fortnight, but no decomposition had taken place—that would be to some extent dependent on the weather, which was very cold at the time—I examined very carefully the articular surface of the natural thigh bone and the articular surface of the boiled lag, and found that they matched, and I also found that a bit of cartilage which had been cut off from the leg bone was adherent to the thigh bone—the pieces matched, and I formed a positive opinion that the thigh and the leg belonged to the same body—the foot had been boiled—I found no evidence</p>

               <p>of disease about it; it had been separated in the same unskilful manner as the other limbs—it was a smallish foot and matched in general size the other remains—I am sure the person to whom the remains belonged was a short person—only one long bone was entire; I measured that, it was 11 1/2in., and if we take the average of an arm bone 11 1/2in., that gives a height of a little over 5ft.—the remains were those of a woman—I found some dark-brown hair under the arm-pits, not grey—on 26th March a carpet-bag was brought to my house, tied up, containing human remains, and a little box with some burnt bones, and on the 28th I received some more bones—I have examined them, and I have recognised pieces of the left thigh bone, the small bone of the left leg, the small bone of the right arm, the hand bones of the right hand, some pieces of the haunch bone or pelvis, and some fragments of the spinal column—I found a piece of the large bone of the leg and a part of the large bone of the arm—I cannot say to which side they belonged—they had all been burnt to a cinder—there were no duplicates of those I had already found in the box—I prepared a diagram of a human skeleton, show—the burnt parts red and the missing portions differently coloured—there was no fragment of any skull—the specific gravity of the human body is such that it may float in water after death—the head will not float by itself—the body floating or not depends on the state of decomposition, and whether it is fat or not—a solid limb thrown into the water would sink, unless very much decomposed—a fat body would float while a lean one would sink—the head. would always sink—if in a box with air between the specific gravity of the wood would help it to float—I examined some black grease which the inspector produced to me in a pot, but I can only say it was black grease; it was such as would be produced by boiling any flesh, and it had been in contact with metal—that is all the remains that I had—I examined a linen cuff in the bag that came on the 26th both chemically and microscopically, and found a spot of blood on it—I found smears of blood on a house-cloth, as if it had wiped something, and a stain of blood on a flannel petticoat, as if it had soaked through some<lb></lb>thing; it was a pale stain—I examined the bonnet produced, and found a thick clot of blood on the velvet, a clot of blood on the rim, a clot of blood on one of the leaves, stains of blood on one of the strings, and a stain of blood on the end of one of the strings—the stains here were very thick, and looked as if the bonnet had fallen into blood—there must have been a con<lb></lb>siderable quantity of blood—I call it a clot in contradistinction to a stain—I examined a piece of wall paper that had been cut out and brought to me—that contained a splash of blood about three, or four inches long—it was clotted on; it must have been a big splash—I had to take part of it to examine it, and gave the rest to Inspector Pearman—the quantity of blood would be as much as from 10 to 15 drops; it had apparently struck against the wall and then run down—I also examined a little chip of wood; that also had a stain of blood on it; there was no clot there; it was as if something bloody had just touched the wood—I know it was the blood of a mammal, that is all, not that of a fish or bird; with that qualifica<lb></lb>tion I have no doubt whatever that it was blood.</p>

               <p>over 50—I am quite sure she was more than 4 feet unless she was deformed—I approximate it to 5 feet 2 inches—there was not the slightest means of finding out whether she came by her death naturally or by violence—a woman may die from heart disease, or apoplexy, or she may burst a blood vessel and die from vomiting or from hemorrhage—if a woman were excited and burst a blood vessel she would drop down, and there would be a copious flow of blood from the mouth—it is not possible in my point of view that they were the bones of a woman under 50—half of the pelvis has never been recovered, and a portion of the ribs and the lower portion of the body are both missing—it was never suggested to me that they were anybody's bones—I heard of a young woman being missing at East Sheen, near Richmond, but no one spoke to me about it afterwards—I had no means of judging the height by actual measurement—parts of the body had been boiled, by which I was puzzled at first—I do not agree with the theory that the remains had been in the water some days—assuming that the woman had fallen down, breaking a blood vessel, the bonnet might have fallen off and dropped into the blood-intense nervous excitement, a tremulousness of the voice, and flushing of the face, are symptoms which would naturally precede a person being attacked with a fit; if I had heard of a woman being intensely excited, so that her bonnet fell off, and her hands trembled, and her face flushed, I should con<lb></lb>sider those premonitory symptoms.</p>

I enlisted in 1857—I went into the 11th Hussars in 1860, and purchased my discharge in 1866; I went into service in 1866 with Mr. Allen, of Pall Mall, and I was afterwards with Mr. Fish, of Charlwood, Surrey; that brings me down to 1871, when I took the Rising Sun, where I have been ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The following Statements by the Prisoner, alluded to in the evidence of the officers, were read as follows:</hi>—No. 1. "I have known John Church for nearly seven years: I first got ac<lb></lb>quainted when I was living two or three doors from Church's at Porter's. He used to take me out to London and to various public-houses. I met him again some months ago, and he came to my mistress's house one night worse for drink. After remaining there for some time I told him he would have to go, as I expected my mistress home from church. My mistress came home and knocked at the door, and I let her in. Church was in the back at this time. My mistress went into the front room, and she said,' Kate, don't you think I am very lute?' I said, 'No, as I have company.' He (Church) had previously told me to say that he was my brother. Mrs. Thomas said,' Who have you got here?' and I said,' My brother, who has come, to see ma' At this time he was getting sober, Mrs. Thomas went into the back room and spoke to him, and asked him to come into the front room by the fire, and she asked me if he would wish to remain all night, and he said, 'No, I must not stay all night,' and turning round to me he said, 'You know I must not stay out all night,' and I said, 'No.' Shortly after that he left. A few days after he came again into the house, and during conversation I had told him the mistress had no money in the house; he said, 'Couldn't we put the old woman out of the way?' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said,' Oh, poison her!' I said, 'You must do that yourself; I'll have nothing to do with that.' Church said,' We would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300188"></xptr>
               <p>have her things and go off to America together and enjoy it, as I am getting tired of my old woman.' He left late in the evening. He came again on the Monday night, the 3rd of March, and bad tea with Mrs. Thomas. I waited upon them. After tea I asked Mrs. Thomas to go out to see my little boy; she said, 'Yes, Kate, and you need not hurry back.' When I returned late in the evening I noticed the light was turned down. I knocked three times at the door; the third knock Church opened the front door, when I saw Mrs. Thomas lying on the mats in the passage struggling and groaning, and he said,' Come in.' I drew back on to the step frightened to go in. At this time there was a policeman standing on the opposite side of the road, a tall dark man. Church catched me by the arm, pulled me in, and closed the door. I said, 'What<lb></lb>ever have you done?' He said, 'Never you mind, I have done it for her, and if you say a word about it I'll put this knife into you up to the bundle.' That was a carving knife belonging to Mrs. Thomas. I felt very faint, and when he said he would put the knife into me, I said, 'No, John, don't; I won't tell I' He offered me what I thought was a glass of water. I said, 'No, I am better now,' thinking it was poison, and that he was going to serve me the same as Mrs. Thomas. Shortly after we left the house together, leaving Mrs. Thomas there, and took a cab. I had told him I would not stay in the house by myself. We drove to near Church's house. Church saw me into Mrs. Porter's, and I remained there for the night. I got up early the next morning and went into Church's house. Mrs. Church remarked that I was out early. Church was there, and beckoned me to go up the street. I went up, and he joined me shortly afterwards, and he said, 'I can't get over to your house before one o'clock, as I got into a row with my old woman last night for being out so late again, and I must stay at home this morning to make it up with her.' I said I should not go back to the house by myself. He had the keys of the front and side door, and said be should be down by two. He asked me what time I would be down; I told him I would not be down there before night. He told me where to meet him, at the Richmond Hotel, over the bridge. I took the boy Porter with me, and as I passed the hotel I saw Church inside. I asked the boy to go on a short distance and wait. I went to the house (hotel), and spoke to Church, and he asked me what I would have to drink. I had some whisky. He then gave me the keys of the house, and said I was to go to the house, take the boy with me, and I should find a box in the back room which he had packed up tied with cord. The boy was to assist me to bring it away, not to take a cab from the house, but if we passed One on the way to the bridge we Were to take it; but we didn't, so we carried it to the bridge. Church told me to let the boy Porter keep back and not see him when I went with the box, but he would be there to see me. I took the box on to the bridge, and placed it up on the bridge; the boy went away and Church appeared. I said, 'What are you going to do with the box?' Church said, 'That is my busi<lb></lb>ness.' There was a tall gentleman near on the opposite side of the bridge. I left him, and he said,' Follow the boy.' I left and heard a splash in the water. I joined the boy Porter at the foot of the bridge carrying a carpet bag, which we had also brought from the house, containing books and meat. We went to the railway station and found that the last train had gone. The boy asked a cabman what he would take him home for, and he said three shillings. The boy having only two shillings, and I no change, I said,' You shall come home and sleep with me.' We both slept in one room. On going down<lb></lb>stairs in the kitchen I found the carpeting rolled up, and the table with a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300189"></xptr>
               <p>leaf let down put up against the cupboard, and the boards wet, as if they had been washed, and a large fire in the kitchen, and a large saucepan on the fire full of water, but I saw no blood. About two days after, when I was cleaning up the scullery, I saw some blood on the carving knife. There was a meat saw hanging up by the fireside, but on that day I found it on a box ill the scullery quite clean. Since Mrs. Thomas disappeared, Church, Porter, and his boy has been frequently at the house, Church directing me to order meat as if it Was fur Mrs. Thomas. It has been taken to his house, cooked, and eaten there, likewise to Porter's. He called Porter in to value the goods and furniture in the house, and said to me, 'Don't you pay him for the valuation, I'll pay him.' I paid several bills; he said, 'Never mind paying them, pay Miss Ives, the landlady, to keep her quiet.' I went to pay her when they were removing the goods. I went to pay her, and she said, 'No.' She refused to take the money, and thought there was something wrong. I went back into the house and told Church, and said there was some noise being made. He said, 'I'll go out to Porter, and say I think there is some<lb></lb>thing wrong about this; don't move the things.' He came back and said, You will have to clear out and go to your friends,' and I left soon after. He knew where I was going; he gave me a card with his address, and said I was to write to him, and 'I'll—stop at home and braze it out,' This was on Tuesday, the 19th, and I reached my uncle's house at Greenanne on the following Friday night. I wrote to Church to his address in Hammersmith, telling him I had arrived home safely. Before leaving it was partly arranged that I should remain at home for about three weeks, that be would send me money to come back with, and then we were to go to America. I never laid a band on Mrs. Thomas, and nothing to do with murdering her, but I knew Church had done it. All the money left in the house belonging to Mrs. Thomas was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and thirty shillings. This note I changed at a fishmonger's in Richmond. Church and Porter were with me at the time. I intend to tell the whole truth, as I don't see why I should be blamed for what Church has done. I wouldn't accuse my greatest enemy of anything wrung, let alone a friend, which Church has been to me up till now."</p>
               <p>No. 2. "Mr. Church wanted to know how to get the furniture away. I told him he could manage that as well as the other business. He then asked my consent to let Porter value the furniture, so as to have a witness; he (Porter) did value the furniture at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Church drew the receipt himself, but he has not paid the money. On the next evening we were sitting on the sofa in the front room. Porter was there, and another man, I don't know his name. Church told me to look after the furniture till he removed it. He suspected Porter of moving anything. He then gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and called Porter's attention to it. I asked him why be wanted Porter to be acquainted with our conversation on the subject. He said,' To keep things on my side square.' Porter and the other man went on to Hammersmith. At the same time Church and I remained till the last train; that was on the Saturday night, 15th. On Sunday we went on the water. On Monday, I think about 11 or 12 o'clock, we reached down here (Richmond), and went home about half-past ten on Monday night On Tuesday morning we left home about 8 o'clock. He brought a roan with him to collect the furniture and get it ready for the vans. I asked him what he wanted to draw the receipt for, as it was between ourselves. He said, 'If I should be stopped by the landlady I shall have the receipt to produce.' The vans came at half-past 6.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300190"></xptr>
               <p>As soon as Miss Ives saw the furniture going out, she came in and asked the carman where the furniture was going to be taken, and he declined to answer her. I was in the front room at the time with Mr. Church. He asked me who she was, and I told him the landlady; he told me not to show myself, and he would go out and tell the men to stop bringing out the furniture, and then it would not be noticed. He then returned into the house and came into the front room and asked me to go and see the landlady, and if she wanted the money for the rent he would give it to me to pay her. I asked him what I should say to the landlady. He replied, 'If she asks to see Mrs. Thomas, say she will be here in a few days' I then saw the landlady, and asked her if she wished to speak to me. She said, 'No, I want to see Mrs. Thomas.' I told her she was not at home. I asked her if she wanted her rent; she said, 'No, I want to know where the furniture is going to.' I told her it was going to Ham<lb></lb>mersmith. She then said, 'I will see about that.' I then went back and told Mr. Church what she said, and he said, 'I thought she was going to inform the police;' he then said, 'I have the agreement to produce, and I am not frightened, you get out of the way.' He then told me to write to him, and in case I should forget his address, he gave me his card and also his own portrait. I then left and went to Rose Gardens, and took my child away. I thought I had not enough money to travel with, and I went on to Mrs. Church's, the Rising Sun, and asked her to lend me a pound. She gave me a half-sovereign and ten shillings in silver, and I left the house. Church took the plate away on the Saturday before the Tuesday the furniture was to be removed. He was accompanied by me and Porter. We had 121b. of beef and a leg of mutton, 8lb. of cheese, 1lb. butter, 4lb. sugar, 1lb. tea, I quartern of flour, 1lb. suet, 1lb. wax candles, and 1 cake; these were taken to Church's and divided. Church taking the beef and candles and Porter the leg of mutton, cheese, butter, sugar, tea, flour, suet, and cake. All I have now told you is quite true."</p>
               <p>No. 3. 'On the 2nd of March, when Church pulled me into the house, I heard a cough in the back room, and I fell inside the front room door against the chiffonier, and upon recovering myself I saw Henry Porter standing on the mat at the front room door. He said to Church,' What is the matter with her?' Church said, 'Oh, she'll be all right in a minute,' Porter said, 'Didn't you see me coming in after you?' I said 'No.' He said, 'I was coming behind you for a long way.' I suspected he had not followed me, and I asked him,' What way did I come?' He said, "Straight up the hill by the church.' I said, 'No, I came the Cemetery way.' He then said, 'There was someone very much like you on ahead of me.' Church said, 'Don't hesitate, you both got here somehow.' Porter said, 'That's quite right, but I never saw anyone so much like her in my life.' Church and Porter then went into the back room. Alter about twenty minutes Porter came out; he turned to Church and said, 'Jack, I'll go on a little before you.' Church said, 'We are all going now in a minute.' Porter said, 'There'll be too much notice taken of us all going together.' Porter then took his hat from off the front room table, and said to Church, 'I suppose I'll see you at home to-night, and then we can talk about matters.' Porter left, and afterwards Church and me followed. We went from Richmond to Shaftesbury Road Station, and when we got to the Rising Sun, Rose Gardens, Church said, 'They are shut up; but there, come in.' I said, 'No, I won't, it is too late.' Mrs. Church then opened the door; she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300191"></xptr>
               <p>said to Church, 'Porter is here waiting for you;' she also said, 'Isn't Kate coming in?' Church answered, 'No, she wants to get home.' Church insisted that I should go in, but I would not; he said, 'Perhaps Porter wants to see you.' I said, 'He must see me when he comes home.' I then left Church, I did not see Porter that night. I went to Porter's house, the door was opened by me, and I went into the front parlour and went to bed on the sofa. I heard Porter come in about half an hour after; he fastened the door and went into the back room, which is called the kitchen. I have often slept at the same place, and have lodged at Porter's house for six months in 1873. Shortly afterwards I heard the handle of the door of the room where I was sleeping turn, but I had it locked on the inside. I asked who was there, and Air. Porter spoke and said, It is me, Kate; I want to see you.' I told him I was undressed, and he should see me in the morning. He then said, 'Good night; I'll be going out at 5, and I'll call you.' I saw Porter at 10 minutes past 5 in the morning; he said,' I must go to work today to keep things straight; will you go home to Richmond before I come home to-night? I'll be home at 5,' I said, 'It all depends, perhaps I won't go then.' Porter said,' Church is going down, but he won't go till after dinner.' I says, 'Where did you see Church so early?' He said, 'I was there last night when you came home, didn't you know that?' I said, 'Yes; Mrs. Church said so,' He said, 'Church and me has arranged matters,' and that 'I must see him to-night if I can get off. I'll get off, for I'll not do overtime.' He then went away to his work. I stopped there till 5 o'clock that day, Monday, 3rd March, when Porter came home. I got the tea ready, as Mrs. Porter was the worse for drink. After having tea Porter said, 'Are you going down?' I said, 'Yes; I think I'll go.' He said, 'Church is to meet me as 'Hartley's. Isn't the boy going down with you, Kate?' (meaning his son Robert). I said, Yes.' The boy went to wash himself, and Porter said, 'Don't let that boy know anything only as little as you can. Porter, me, and the boy then went down Hammersmith. We went into a public-house near the old railway station and had something to drink. This was about 7 o'clock, and I said, 'Now we must get on if we are going to Richmond to-night.' We went to the new station, and finding we had some time to wait Porter said we might walk to the Shaftesbury Road. We 'done' so, and when we got to the top of the Shaftesbury Road the boy said, 'Ain't you going home now, father?' He (Porter) said yes, he would go and have another pint to himself, and then be would go. Porter asked me to come into a public-house with him, but I said, 'No, I'll lose the train if I do.' The boy was waiting for me, and he hurried him on, and said, 'Kate will catch you in a minute.' Porter arranged that he would come on to Richmond by the next train. I said, 'Can't you come by this train?' he said, 'No, I don't want the boy to know it. I don't suppose I shall see you any more to-night.' We then parted, and I went to Richmond with the boy. I saw Church at Hartley's, the Richmond Hotel. I told the boy to go on in front of me. I went in and saw Church there, and spoke to him. I told him Porter was coming by the next train; he asked me to have something to drink, and I had some whisky and water; he then gave me two keys, one of the side door, and one of the glass door at the back of the house, and said, 'You'll find a small box in the back room on the ground floor between the sofa and bookcase, it ain't very heavy. I think the boy and you can manage it; don't take a cab from the house, if you think you can't carry it; if you meet a cab you can bring it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300192"></xptr>
               <p>with you to Richmond Bridge; I'll be there some time before you; I'll wait here until Porter comes. Does the boy know his father is coming down?' I said, 'No, the boy suspects something, for he asked me in the train, "What is there, Kate, between father, you, and Church?" I left Church in the public-house, and joined the boy up the street, and went to the house with him. We then went in through the side entrance round to the glass door and into the back room. I he the lights, and after stopping in the house a short time we left by way of the front door, carrying between us the box mentioned by Church, and a large carpet-bag. I did not know what was in the box, but the bag contained a large family Bible and seven other books, some meat, and a number of things. We carried the box on all the way, we met no cab. Getting on the middle of the bridge we put the box down. I said to the boy, 'Now, you go on to the station and I'll catch you;' he said, 'Very well, Kate,' and went. Then Church came up to me, and I said to him, 'How long have you been here?' he said, 'Not very long;' I said,' Where is Porter, did you see him?' he said,' Yes, I waited for him; don't let the boy know we are here, go on after him as quick as you can;' I said, "Where is the cab for this box? you can't carry it;' he said, Never mind that, I'll see about it' I then left Church and, following the boy, I got a short distance away, when I heard a splash in the water. Turning round, I saw a tall dark man standing on the bridge, it was too dark to recognise him. I caught up to the boy and said, 'Did you hear anything like falling into the water?' he said, 'Yes, Kate, I thought I heard a splash of something.' We then went to the station carrying the bag between us. Finding the last train was gone for Hammer<lb></lb>smith, the boy insisted on going home; he had two shillings, and I having no change, I said, 'You can't get a cab for two shillings to take you.' A cabman said he would take him for three. I said, 'You had better come up and stay all night, and we'll go home in the morning early enough.' We went, and going in the same way to the house, I told him to go into the front room; I then went upstairs and took my bonnet off, coming downstairs and into the kitchen. I found a large fire there, a large iron saucepan full of water; the table with one leaf let down was removed to one side of the kitchen against the cupboard, the carpet pushed back right off the floor; the floor was all wet as if washed or scrubbed. I missed the meat saw which always hung against the fireplace, but two days afterwards, when I went into the washhouse, I found the saw standing on a large box which always stood there, and on that day I also saw a carving knife lying on the scullery floor, partly behind the box. I picked it up and found it rusty, and marks (streaky) of blood on it. I also found at that time brown paper under the sink, with dirty-looking marks upon it. The boy Porter stopped at the house all night, and slept in the same room with me. I made him a bed. I saw Church and Porter on the next evening, Tuesday, 4th of March; the two came down together about half-past 7; I had been to Hammersmith all day. Church wasn't at home, and I was home at Richmond some time before them. Church brought a bottle of brandy in his pocket; he asked me for the corkscrew, I told him I couldn't find it. I thought him or Porter had taken it. He said he didn't take it, and Porter commenced laughing. I said to Porter, You have it, then?' He said, 'Yes, of course I claim some of the things as well as other people.' Porter and Church then began talking how they would dispose of the things. I went into the back room, leaving them in</p>

               <p>the front room, and stopped there some time, then returned into the front room, and found Church and Porter in deep conversation. Porter said,' Do you know how to act, Kate?' I said, 'Yes, I know when you tell me.' Church said, 'It's easy for her to act if she'll only listen to what we tell her.' I then took a chair and sat down; I said to Church, 'Now let me hear what you have got to tell me.' Porter then said, 'If any one comes and asks for Mrs. Thomas say she is gone to the country for a few days.' He then said to Church, 'Ain't that the best thing to say?' Church said, 'Yes; and another thing you had better to do, when you want anything order it in Mrs. Thomas's name as you have always done since you have been here.' Porter then said, 'The tradespeople will think by doing that that Mrs. Thomas is here.' But I. said, 'When the bills want to be paid, she pays every week, they'll know she is not here.' Church said, 'Oh, damn the bills; we'll be moved before the bills come in. Let us get all we can while we are about it; it is no good in being too honest in this world, is there, Harry?' Porter said, 'No; if you can do it on the quiet; the thing is in not being found out' Church said, 'There is only our three selves that know it. I want a piece of the sirloin of beef for Sunday; and what do you want?' Porter said he would like a leg of mutton. Church told me when the butcher come to order it in Mrs. Thomas's name. Mrs. Thomas had two butchers, one beyond the railway station and one at the top of Richmond Hill, where the beef and mutton was got from. We bad sapper, and came off to Hammersmith. The above statement has been read over to me by Inspector Jones, in the presence of Inspector Dowdell, and is correct."</p>

The prisoners were in their em<lb></lb>ploy, Lillywhite as engineer, and Marable as labourer—Elliott and Co. were in the habit of buying large quantities of coals from the ships—they are Llangannan coals, not the sort used in private families—it was usual to lighter them to the wharf of Dalton and Co., and for them to cart them to the brewery, but they had no property in the coals. In May last 210 tons of coals were delivered at the brewery—I received the delivery tickets for them—it was the usual course for me to receive them from Marable—it was his duty to take them from the carman, and deliver them to me—Lillywhite had nothing to do with the coals—on Tuesday, the 22nd of September, after the prisoners were in custody, I went with the policeman to Lilly white's house in Hensdon-street, at a quarter to five o'clock, I saw some Llangannan coals in the cellar there, with some New-castle coals—the Llangannan coals were at the bottom of the cellar, and the others were spread over them, for the purpose, I should say, of con<lb></lb>cealing them—there were about two tons of Llangannan, and one ton of Newcastle—in consequence of suspicion, the police were on the premises of Elliott and Co. about three days before this, but up to the time of the prisoners being taken, no charge had been made against them—the police had not been communicating with them,</p>

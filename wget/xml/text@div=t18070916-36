On the 28th of August, about two o'clock, in consequence of information, we asked the prisoner what he had got in his pocket, he was in our shop; he took the old brass out of his pocket; he said he never saw any of the men save old brass; we deal in old iron; it was bits of brass that we were collecting from the old iron. He was employed in taking the bits of brass off. My partner afterwards took some nails out of his pocket, three papers, about four pound weight; and when the constable came he took two dozen of files out of his pocket; he said he picked the nails up off the ground, they were new nails. I believe these nails and files to be my property; he first said the nails did not belong to us. I cannot swear the nails and files to be my property; the brass I can swear to.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I keep an Italian ware-house in Warwick-street, Regent-street. The prisoner was my servant, and had been so three months—I had him taken into custody I think on Saturday, the 30th of September—his box was searched in my presence—an officer was with me, and in it was found a pawnbroker's ticket and four bottles of catsup—the catsup-was wrapped up in a waistcoat—I had bottles of catsup of that description in my stock—I think they belong to me, but will not take an oath of it, as I have a large stock—these boots are mine—I never gave the prisoner any authority to pawn them.</p>

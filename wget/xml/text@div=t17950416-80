                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160207"></xptr>Q. Who is the owner of the house? - Mr. Samuel Goodwin, who lives himself in the first floor. Last Thursday evening, about eight o'clock, this little boy was sent, by his mother, down stairs, to fetch some water from the area. While he was near the kitchen stairs, he saw a man go down into the dust-hole, which was a little cellar that we made a dusthole; he returned up stairs, and told his mother there was a man in the dust-hole. She did not believe it, and took a candle herself, and went down; but when she got nearly down, she see the glimpse of a man; on which she returned up, and gave the alarm to me, who was standing in the parlour, saying, Mrs. Staples, there is a man in the kitchen. I ran across the shop to the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop is it? - Mr. Staples's, a surgeon and apothecary. I turned round, and met Webb in the passage, the biggest of the prisoners at the bar. I asked him where he had been? He said, below stairs, to a convenience. I told him, that would not satisfy me; I would go and see if I had lost any thing. On which there was a gentleman passing by the door; I asked him if he would be so good to come in a bit? He did; and I took a candle and went down the kitchen stairs; and when I got near the bottom, I see the other in the area, buttoning up his clothes. I returned back and said, here is another; on which he followed me up stairs, and made the like excuse, the same as the other. I then took the candle and went down stairs, and unlocked the kitchen door. The lock was the same as I left it, a little bit of wood had slipped off on the inside, but the pannels beneath had been very much shattered, so much so, that I could have pushed the lower pannels in with my hand; they were not broke so about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they broke out? - No, they were tried to be pushed in; they were not pushed intirely in, but so loosened, that I could have pushed them intirely in. Going into the kitchen, I went to the bed, and I missed the coverlid and cotton gown, and stuff skirt off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a cotton and worsted counterpane described in this indictment, is that what you mean? - Yes, it is. Then I turned round to the dresser, as you come in to the right hand, and there I missed the other things; they laid underneath the dresser altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. These were all your's and your husband's property? - Yes. I then went out of the kitchen, looked into the dusthole, and found nothing. I then went up to the window, and there I found a pane of glass taken out; it was cracked before.</p>
               <p>Q. About his crack in the pane of glass, do you think that that would enable them to get in? - I conceive that the least of these boys might get in; they could not reach the things else, either from the dresser or the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you conceive that they got into your house by means of this pane of glass being broke? - I am sure they got in no other way. The window I fastened down with a nail.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen this pane of glass? - About five o'clock the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they could both pass through that window? - I have my doubts whether the biggest could or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this window communicate with the area of the street? - With the area. I found a boy's working apron in the kitchen, which did not belong to me. The water tub was likewise emptied of its water, which an hour before was full, the water having just come in; and hanging about the tub and pipe, and in the tub I found all the things I missed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the water emptied? - I don't know; there was no one belonging to me emptied it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160208"></xptr>Q. Whereabouts was this water tub? - Close by the window in the area. I then returned up stairs, and sent a young man that was in the shop for a constable. In the mean while Webb kneeled down, and begged for mercy; that I would forgive him; but having been robbed before, it rather made my heart hard, and I sent for a constable; on which the young man went to Marlborough-street office, and brought Mr. Brown, the constable; till he came I kept the street door shut, and then when he came I gave charge of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the water tub in the area? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Webb in the passage, which way was Webb going? - Going out of the street door. We always keep the street door open, on account of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you conceive they got out of the area into the passage? - They came into the street door, and there is a passage that goes strait along to the kitchen stairs; the kitchen stairs are at the end of the passage, turning to the left, and when you go down stairs, there is a door on the left that goes into the kitchen, and the door facing goes into the area. The area door was open. Webb I found in the passage, going out of the house up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the things that were removed were all removed from the kitchen? - Yes; into the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend that the people put the things by the water tub out of the kitchen through that pane of glass, and then have gone back again to the area? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, from the situation of your kitchen, there was no other means by which they could have got into this kitchen? - None at all.</p>

               <p>Q. And by your account you don't think it possible for any person to have got into this kitchen but by this pane of glass? - I am sure they could not; I tried the window and that was fast down.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the time be when you found these lads? - A little after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. You had light candles, I suppose? - Yes, I was at tea in the parlour at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so dark you could not see a person's face? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What day do you state it to be? - Last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure that you had lighted candles, and you could not distinguish the features of a face? - I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen these things there? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Goodwin's name is Samuel? - Yes; his wife told me so, and I had a receipt in his name for my rent.</p>

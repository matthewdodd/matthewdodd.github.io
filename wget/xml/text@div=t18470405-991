                  </hi> I am an inspector of the Metropolitan Police. On 12th March. I stopped the prisoner in Jermyn-street, about eight o'clock at night—I asked if his name was "Manvell"—he said "Yes"—I told him he was charged with marrying Hester Betty, his former wife being alive—he said, yes, Hester Betty knew he was a married man at the time he married her—it was her fault, not his.</p>

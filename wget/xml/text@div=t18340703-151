               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You would not swear, I am sure, that the bag you saw fall was the same bag exactly as you saw Harris carry? A. I do not know how I could positively swear it was the same bag, because it was out of my sight a minute or two - I should consider there was no other bag - I will not swear it was the same bag - how is it possible I can? - I should not like to swear it - I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When was it that you had seen Hartrup with Harris? A. I think on the Tuesday morning as I sat at breakfast - my husband heard him go in, and could swear to him by his walk - he said, "There goes Harris" - I got up and looked out of the window and saw it was him - I do not know whether they talked together at that time; but I saw him go into Harris's house - they did not talk together in my hearing- on the Wednesday night before that, in Vine-place, they were both together, and I heard them talk - I do not know what time it was - that was the time I heard Harris call Hartrup "Master" - I have been in trouble before, and Mr. Clarkson defended me - that was last September twelve months - I was charged with stealing some ribbons in the other court - I remained here five days after my trial - Mr. Harris and his wife had been twitting me about that - they told me I had been tried - I do not owe them any spite for that - I do not associate with them - I have not spoken to them - they continually upbraided my child with my fault.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were convicted - were you imprisoned five days? A. Yes - Harris upbraided my innocent child, who is not ten years old - that was most undoubtedly one of the motives that made me watch him- I saw no bag that morning, except the one which was thrown out of the window - the alley is wide enough for people to pass and repass - whether it is six feet, or more, I cannot tell - the bag I saw on Harris's shoulder looked like the same bag I saw fall - it was the same colour and bulk - I did not see any other person come out of the alley with any bag - I did not see any bag in the alley after he brought that one away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HALES. I am the husband of Elizabeth Hales. I know both the prisoners perfectly well - Harris lives three doors from me - I have seen the other prisoner coming to Harris's place - on the 14th of May I saw the prisoners coming through Spitalfields Market, and go into a gin-shop - I saw them come out of the gin-shop - my wife followed them directly afterwards - I saw them go towards Union-street, East - I did not follow them farther.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at No. 14, Priest's-alley, about a dozen yards from the Excise Office window. On Wednesday morning, the 14th of May, I was standing at my door about eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner Harris opposite the Excise window - I saw the Excise shutters open, and a sack thrown out - the prisoner took it up, and walked down the court with it - I had seen him there before - I never saw Hartrup before - I know Harris by seeing him twice in the Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you first go to tell the Excise of it? A. I did not go to tell them - they came to me - a gentleman came - I told him what I had seen - he asked if I had seen a bag thrown out of the window - I told him "Yes" - he asked if it was a man named Harris - I said "Yes" - he took down my evidence - he said I should not lose my time - I did not ask what I should have for my time - he did not mention what I was to have - I sell fruit in the street, and I expect to be paid for my lost time; but I do not know how much.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I ask you, did the gentleman in any way tell you, you should be paid for giving false evidence, or doing what was wrong? A.

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 14th of May, on Tower-hill - I saw Mrs. Hales within the gate of the tower - in consequence of something which she said, I followed the prisoner Harris to opposite the Mint - I then stopped him - he was carrying a sack on his back - I told him he had better stop, and come with me - he went with me - I took him to Denmark-street station-house - I looked into the sack, and found in it the Excise papers, which I produce - on Tower-hill I asked him what he had got in the bag - he said it was old paper - I asked where he got it - he said at the Excise Office - I asked him from whom he got it there - he said from the foreman there- I asked the foreman's name - he said he did not know - I asked him if he had any paper or note along with it - he said not - I asked where he was going - he said to Mrs. Davis, in St. Mary Axe - I saw the way he was going - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030072"></xptr>was behind him - when I stopped him he was going over towards the Minories; through the Tower is not the nearest way to St. Mary Axe - it is perhaps a mile out of the regular way.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the H division of police. Craig brought Harris with the sack to me - I was on duty in Denmark-street, on the 14th of May - I examined it - it contained Excise papers - I asked the prisoner where he brought them from - he said from the Excise Office, Tower-hill, and he was going to take them to Mrs. Davis, in St. Mary Axe, who contracted for store papers - I asked him if he had any account of the weight - he said he had not - I asked if he was in the habit of carrying them in that way - he said he was repeatedly, when Mrs. Davis was short of paper - I asked if he in general carried them without an invoice to show the weight - he said he never had an invoice - I said I did not believe that was the way the Excise did business; I should send a man to inquire, and detain him till I found the truth - I asked him to refer me to the man at the office who gave him the bag - he said he did not know his name, he believed he was a sort of foreman there - I asked if he knew any body there he could refer me to - he said he did not know any one - that was all that passed then - I sent Craig with a sample of the papers to the Excise Office, and detained the prisoner and sack till he came back - I had received private information, and went to the Excise Office in Broad-street, City, and apprehended Hartrup near upon eleven o'clock - I saw him in a room belonging to the sorting department of the store papers - I asked him if he had been that morning to Tower-hill - he said he had - I asked if he had called at Spitalfields market on his road there - he said he had not - I asked if he went in the coat he then had on, or the one which hung up in the room - he said the one which hung up - I asked if he had seen the prisoner Harris that morning - he said he had not - I asked if he had not seen him, and drank with him that morning - he said not - I asked if any body accompanied him down to Tower-hill to the Excise Office - he said no one - I asked him if he had ever drank with Harris at all previous to that - he said he had, when he had been employed by Mrs. Davis, when she moved papers, but not on that morning, nor had he seen him that morning - I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Mrs. Davis? A. I do not - I have seen Excise papers before - I do not know that the Excise are in the habit of selling waste paper, Except that the prisoner said Mrs. Davis contracted for the waste paper - I never saw a sale made myself - all my questions were put on mere speculation to ascertain the truth, which it is my duty to do - I was in the station-house, and he was brought in to me - he did not satisfy me - it was before I thought proper to lock him up I questioned him, to ascertain whether it was correct or not, but not with any view to give evidence - I was there to take charge of persons, and do the duty of the inspector in his absence - I consider it was my duty to question him- that is my instructions, which I receive from Colonel Rowan and Mr. Mayne - it is my duty to ask questions, to ascertain whether a parcel has been stolen or honestly come by - I do not take down in writing the answers they give.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him before you examined him you would give evidence of his answers on his trial? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The man was brought to you after you had received information; had you received information? A. I had not previous to his being brought in - I received it during the time he was brought in - I put the questions on the speculation of my own mind - the constable brought him in, and said, "I don't think this is all right" - the papers are returns which come in from the different districts for different years, some as late as 1829 - no man could look at these, and not know they were Excise papers - some of them are returns of tobacco districts, tea districts, and other things - they are waste paper.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in St. Mary Axe. I know the prisoners - I did not employ them on the 14th of May to bring any paper to me - I had not purchased any at that time - I am in the habit of buying waste paper from the Excise - we contract for the whole of it - it is brought to us in carts or waggons - we contract for it at a regular price - when they wish to part with it, they give us notice - we never have it in that way; we have notice to receive it, and some gentlemen are appointed to see it weighed - it is never sent out without our having notice of it - when they wish to send it, they give us notice, and we endeavour to take it as soon as we can.</p>
               <p>Q. They don't of their own authority, and without notice to you, send any quantity they have? A. They do not - we fetch it away in carts and wagons, at our own expense, and my sister attends to see it weighed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been connected with the Excise? A. About twenty years - we buy the paper by the son - we pay £28 for a ton of it - this sack weighs nearly 1 cwt. without the sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not the Excise sometimes sent paper to you when you did not expect it? A. No; not that I know of- it has not come when I did not expect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not sometimes happened, that they came when you did not expect them - have they not sent you paper without regular notice? A. No; there has been one bag, or two, which we had not notice of - they came in bags, not in wagons - I cannot tell how long it is since the last bag came in that way - my sister can tell better than I can - she manages the concern - it was brought, I know - I cannot say how long ago it is - it is a few months back - it was only that time it came in a bag without notice - I do not think I was present when it came - it was taken in and kept, but we gave notice immediately at the office, that a bag of paper was brought - that was recognised by the office, and I paid for it - it was only in that single instance - I did not think of that before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear none ever came except in carts and wagons? A. That is the regular way for it to come - no other instance occurred to my knowledge, but I cannot positively swear it - we had employed Harris about two years ago - he used to come with the cart to bring the Excise papers - he brought that one bag without a cart - he has never been in the habit of bringing papers, never but that one - he always accompanied the cart or wagon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. For two years past he has come with the cart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030073"></xptr>and wagon, and in the particular instance in question, he brought the sack? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And only once in a sack? A. Not to my knowledge or belief - within a few days after he brought the sack, my sister applied to the Excise - we made it known to them, and they acknowledged the sale - it was a sack that was left behind, as we understood.</p>
               <p>Q. When paper was brought, was it a custom to bring any document from the Excise? A. No - because there are always two officers to weigh it, and my sister attends the weighing - my sister always has the management of the business - she would know whether things are regular or not- it would be her duty not to keep the sack if it was irregular.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When that sack was sent in, was any account of the weight sent with it? A. No; I understood it had been weighed, and was left behind.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the weight of the sack come to you from the Excise office? A. No; it was weighed with others at the office - they always came weighed - I did not say the sack was paid for separately.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying, you did not pay for it separately? A. I cannot explain things - my sister can explain it - I cannot answer questions that I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had been dealing with the Excise for papers for twenty years? A. Yes; I always know the quantity I am to have from them - the paper is weighed at the Excise office by two Excise officers, generally in the presence of my sister, and then I have to pay £28 per ton for what is delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the circumstance happened some months ago, about a sack being brought - did you speak from your own information and knowledge, or were you present? A. I spoke from information - my sister went afterwards to the office about it - I never go - I know nothing of it except what I was told - my sister had been to the Excise office just before the 14th of May - no paper whatever was to be delivered to us on the 14th of May - we had no expectation of any.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand you to have no expectation on the 14th of May of the particular sack forming the subject of inquiry to-day? A. No; nor had I of the delivery of the sack, of which I gave notice to the Excise - my sister can answer that.</p>

            . I am the sister of Ursula Davis, and carry on business with her in St. Mary Axe. I transact the business for her with the Excise, on Tower-hill - I generally conduct the business - the Excise let us know when there is any paper to be removed - the store-keeper lets us know - the store-keeper either comes to me or I go to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever have Excise papers delivered on your premises, except in consequence of such notice given one way, or the other? A. On one occasion a bag of paper was brought by Harris, and I went to Mr. Powell, the sorter - I was not at home when Harris brought it - I went to Powell, and told him Harris had brought a bag of paper which I had weighed, and gave him the account of the weight, and they had it put down with a load of paper, and it was paid for - it was paid for with a load of paper which was brought afterwards - I had known beforehand that the load of paper of which this was to form a part was to be delivered to us - that was weighed by the two persons authorized to weigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you received the bag, did you know you were going to receive a load? A. I think not - there was generally some time between one load and another - I know of another instance where a separate bag was brought, which Mr. Mayhew has a receipt for, that was sent by the storekeeper - this is the receipt which was had for it - Mr. Taylor is store-keeper - I was made acquainted with this sack before it was delivered - I had a knowledge of that bag coming before it was delivered, from an order from Mr. Taylor, the store-keeper - that was another transaction, for which a separate receipt was given - that was not part of any load that was delivered - it was a distinct thing. (Receipt read.) "Old Acts of Parliament belonging to William Parish, Esq., late commissioner, - of cwt. paid to the store-keeper.

            ." Those were old Acts of Parliament - quite a separate transaction to the Excise papers - I believe Hartrup brought that sack - on the 13th of May I went to the Excise office about some papers - I saw Mr. Powell in Hartrup's presence - I told Mr. Powell we should be glad to receive a load of paper on Thursday, the 15th, and they were to be got ready to be delivered that morning - I had not employed any body on the 14th to receive any part of that paper for me - about a fortnight before that, Harris had assisted in bringing a load home - Hartrup knew of my being engaged in purchasing papers - he has assisted in weighing it - I should think he knew the whole process well - neither Hartrup nor Harris had any commission from me to send or bring any paper on the 14th - the paper was to be brought down to the Excise office on Tower-hill, weighed, put into a van, and brought home - I was to send the van for it - that is always the way the business is conducted - they employ persons to weigh it, and I find the van and take it away at my own expense - I said nothing to Powell in Hartrup's presence, except that I should be glad to receive about a ton and half on Thursday morning, if it could be got ready - Hartrup was in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, on any occasion, employ Hartrup to do any thing with the paper to be delivered to you? A. Nothing; only to get it down from the rooms it was in, ready to be weighed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Hartrup employed by you or by the Excise? A. He was to be paid by us for getting the papers down stairs - he is employed by the Excise generally - it was to be brought from the rooms where it was deposited up stairs, - I am not in the habit of going up the stairs, but it came from rooms above.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have mentioned a second instance of some irregularity in the delivery of waste papers from the Excise - my friend asks if they were not old Acts of Parliament? whatever they were, did you pay for them to the Excise as waste paper? A. To the store-keeper - I did not on account of the Excise - I paid the store-keeper, but had a separate receipt, and not from the Excise - I did not intend the money for that to go to the Excise - it was paper belonging to one of the commissioners - I do not know him - my sister knows very little of the transactions.</p>

            . I am sorter of old stores, at the Excise office. I remember Miss Fellowes coming to the office - I do not recollect the day - I remember the day the prisoners were taken up - I think Miss Fellowes had been there three days before that - some store were to be made up, to be delivered on the Thursday - the day after the prisoners were taken up - Thursday would be the 15th - on the 14th, about twenty minutes past six in the morning, I went to the front gate, at Tower-hill, and rang the bell - I went up stairs - there are two staircases - Bateman's rooms are at the foot of the staircase in Tower-street - I went up the other staircase - I was not on the staircase which it is said Hartrup went up - I had not been into the room the paper was in for six weeks - the room the papers were kept in is in front of Tower-hill - the books were cut, and left there to be taken away, about a ton at a time, by Mrs. Davis - they are survey books, and documents belonging to them - the books she was to take away were only survey books - there were no papers of this kind for her to take away - she said herself she would take about a ton and a half - there is nothing there but survey books - they were old books - we call them survey books - there was no waste, but survey books - these papers are daily entries - they were not in the same place- the store-keeper determines what shall be sent - I am not a store-keeper - this is waste paper, but not survey books.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the waste paper to be sold put into one particular room, or dispersed in many rooms? A. It is put into one place when it is to be sold - there is not any such books, as those produced, put into that place - the waste paper is intended to be deposited in the upper room, that faces Tower-hill - it cannot, by any means, except improper ones, be in the lower room, fronting Priest's-alley - there is no waste paper, intended to be sold, in that room looking into Priest's alley - the paper is taken down from the chief office in Broad-street - it is kept there seven years- it is then all taken up to the top room, to be cut with the machine - this has not been cut with the machine - it was to be sold shortly, but not at present - this is not cut with a machine, nor would this sort of paper be cut with the machine before it is sold - it must be weighed before it is sold or delivered - I had been on duty there on the 13th - I had been there about three months - I had not been there all that day - I was there that morning about twenty minutes after six - no paper had been weighed that morning - it could not have been weighed without my knowledge - Hartrup is at times employed about the Excise office, at Tower-hill - he had no business up that staircase that morning, that I know of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he was engaged in moving paper, who would tell him what to take and bring down? A. He was to receive his orders from me, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you were not there overnight? A. Not all day - I was there in the morning - I left at three o'clock - I went at four - I again left at half-past five - we all left then.</p>
               <p>Q. If paper had been weighed the night before, or in the day, would it be separated from the bulk so as to be known that it was weighed? A. Yes - there was none separated - the store-keeper's name is Cox; he cannot give directions to move paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Three months ago, we hear a bag was delivered which did not go in any wagon or cart, did you deliver that? A. I did not; I had weighed it with the rest of the paper the day she took a load - a sack was weighed and left behind - I and Cox weighed it with the rest of the paper, and it was paid for- it is my business to see that it is delivered - Hartrup sent it down before I gave my orders for it - whether it was paid for with another load I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are we to understand in that case Hartrup took on himself to deliver the paper without your taking any step to weigh it, or otherwise? A. It had been weighed with the rest of the paper, a day or so before, and left behind - he sent Harris to take it down - she was not charged with what she had, or it would be charged twice; for Hartrup told me it was left behind after being brought down - it was weighed, as I understood - I had nothing to do with weighing that - I weigh all the paper - they had no business to take it away - it left the premises, I did not weigh it afterwards - I had superintended the weighing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whiskin-street, Clerkenwell, and am a jeweller and gold chain maker. The prisoner was my journeyman—on the 6th of Dec, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went into my shop—I had about 6dwts. of gold filings delivered to me by Chapman, who had been working for me during the night—the prisoner was not there then, but he ought to have been there at work—in consequence of information, I went to Barbican—I waited outside Mr. Syrill's, a refiner's shop—the prisoner came out there about a quarter before ten o'clock—there was no one with him—I stopped him, and gave him in charge—he asked me what it was for—I asked him what he had been to Syrill's for—he said, "To melt some gold"—I said, "Gold filings, I suppose"—he said, "No, some gold rings and other pieces"—I went and made some inquiries—I missed from six to seven dwts. of gold filings.</p>

I am a gold chain-maker, in the prosecutor's service—on the night these filings were lost I had been up all night—I remember the prisoner coming to work at half-past eight o'clock in the morning—a lad opened the door to him—I had done all my work, and I sat down by the furnace, put my hand before my eyes, and was going to sleep—the prisoner was at the other end of the same shop—he went and stood at his own place, which is next to mine—I had left my filings in a tin box at my place—I did not notice what the prisoner was doing—there were two lads in the shop, who had been up all night—they were sitting at the furnace with me, and the errand boy was sitting at the drawer bench behind me—I saw my master there about half-past nine—I gave him my tin box—I did not look in it before I gave it him, to see if any was gone—there had been about twelve dwts. in my box—the prisoner remained in the shop about a quarter of an hour—he said he was going in the City to see a young woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Syrill, a refioer, in Barbican. On the 6th of Dec., about nine o'clock, the prisoner brought me some gold filings to be melted into a lump, which I did—this is the lump I melted it into—there were no pieces of rings that I saw—there was a piece of metal, which was flat—it appeared to be a piece that had not been used—I delivered the lamp to the prisoner—he took it to the front shop, and disposed of it to Mr. Syrill, or his young man—I know this to be the lump that was the result of his filings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> The pieces were parts of broken rings; it was my own property, which I have had some time; the filings were engine filings; I used to buy old gold when I had not much to do; I have bought and sold at Mr. Syrill's five or six years; the pieces I sold are not the same quality, by 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an once, as that of my master.</p>

                  </hi>I am a surgical instrument casemaker, and live in Queen's Head-court, Giltspur-street. I missed some brass caps and things—I suspected my errand-boy—I taxed him with it—he took me to the prisoner's house, and I found the metal there, and found her at home—I asked her if she had got any thing of that description, showing her a pat<lb></lb>tern—she said she had got nothing of the kind on her premises—I came</p>

                  </hi>I was the prosecutor's errand-boy—I took these pieces of brass off his shelf, and sold them to the prisoner—I did not know her before I went there—I said, "Do you buy brass?

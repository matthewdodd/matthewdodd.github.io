On the 25th of July 1 put 23 s. in it, and the next morning there were but 15. As there was no body up but him at the time I missed it, I suspected him, and sent for a constable and charged him with him; then he was searched, and there was found upon him 5 s. 6 d. He confessed he did take it, and that he had paid 2 s. 6 d. of it away, towards paying for a pair of breeches.</p>

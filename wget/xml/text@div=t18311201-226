            . I lived in Marchmont-street, Westminster - the prisoner was in my service. On the 7th of November I gave my wife two guineas, to give him to purchase bacon; he did not return, but was apprehended on the 15th; he went to buy the bacon at a warehouse in Tooley-street - the persons from the shop are not here; he brought no bacon to me - I did not desire him to go to a particular shop, but expected he would go there- when apprehended he said he went to a wrestlingmatch, took off his coat and waistcoat, and a fellow ran away with his waistcoat, with 2l. 10s. in it.</p>

            . By direction of my husband I gave the prisoner 2l. 2s. in silver - it was in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; I told him it was to buy bacon- he said, "Yes, I know that;" he never brought any -I have not seen him since till to-night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Master owed me ten weeks' wages, and gave me 10s. to pay as earnest for the bacon. Witness. I gave you the money, and you showed me a handful of silver besides; I think he had run more in debt than my husband owed him - he used to sleep at our house.</p>

            . On the 10th of November the prisoner came to my house - he said he had been to a wrestling-match, and taken off his waistcoat, but as luck would have it, he had taken his money out of that pocket, and put it into his breeches pocket, and they did not rob him; he pulled out a handful of half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, to the amount of 2l. or 3l. - I keep an ale-shop in Union-street; he is in the habit of coming and leaving meat at my house - he paid for what he had in silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the money from him to pay for the beer. Witness. I paid him 8s. 5d. that night on his master's account, not knowing he had left, but he paid for his beer before that; he said he was going to pay 2l. or 3l. for carriage - I am certain he paid me before I paid him any money.</p>

            . I am a weaver. I saw the prisoner at Giblet's - he said he had been wrestling with a man at Hackney; that he put his coat and waistcoat on the taproom table, went out for a certain purpose, and when he returned the waistcoat was gone, but as luck would have it, he had put his money from his waistcoat pocket into his trousers, and I heard the money jink; he drank part of two pots of beer with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer and engraver at 8, Queen's-terrace, Marlborough-road, Chelsea. About five years ago, I engaged the prisoner as errand-boy, and he remained with me about two years—about nine months ago he returned to my service, and remained till two month's since, when he took a house in the same street, and com<lb></lb>menced business on his own account—on 9th Nov., between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, in consequence of information, I went with a policeman to his printing-office, and found property belonging to me—I asked him where he had obtained it, and he said, "I, am sorry to say, Sir, that that property I have taken from your premises"—I then drew up this rough document, and an order to remove my property from the pre<lb></lb>mises—I told him to sign it, and he did so—I used no inducement to him to do so—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"I, James Wakeham, do acknowledge that the things found on the premises belonging to Mr.—situated in the Marlborough-road, Chelsea, was purchased by means furnished by Mary Ann, servant of Mr. and Mrs. Miller, residing at Marlborough-road. I also acknow<lb></lb>ledge that all the goods in the front-room, situated at the house, No. 37, Arthur-street, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, belong to Mr. Miller, aforesaid; 9th Nov. 1850. <hi rend="smallCaps">J.

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Miller. The prisoner left there about two months ago—he was pressman, and used to work at the cases and presses sometimes—on a Monday morning, about five weeks ago, since he has left, when I came to the premises at half-past seven o'clock, I found him there—he showed me where the key was, and then left—he had come to me on the Sunday, and said, Jane, who is the mother of Mary Ann, had sent him for the key—I was present when the foreman locked up the premises on the Saturday night, about half-past eight, and he then gave me the key—my master came home on the Monday, between twelve and one.</p>

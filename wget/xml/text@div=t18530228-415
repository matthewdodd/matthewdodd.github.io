                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old last Oct., and live at Chadwell-heath; I go to Ilford National School, in the county of Essex. On Tuesday, 8th Feb., I was going to school—I know Barley-lane; it goes out of the road that you travel from Chadwell to Ilford—about a quarter to 9 o'clock, I saw a man standing against the handpost at the corner of the lane with a stick in his hand—that is the man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prisoner</hi>)—I kept on going to school, and had not gone far when I looked back, heard him say something, and saw him hit a man on his hat, which knocked it off, and the man picked his hat up and ran away, not up Barley-lane, but in a different direction, towards Chadwell; the prisoner followed him, hit him again, and knocked him down—I ran away to school.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 8th Feb., I was working on the high road between Ilford and Chadwell-heath, near Barley-lane, on the opposite side to it, but not opposite to it—about 9 o'clock I heard some cry, and thought it was the children going to school, but looking over the pales I saw the prisoner hitting a man on the head in the road; it was Mr. Toller, who is dead—I called to the prisoner twice to leave off, but he would not—I got over the palings into the road, and went towards them—when I got within about forty yards of the prisoner, I saw him take a knife from his pocket and run it into the man's neck, who was then on the ground, and the prisoner was standing up—he stooped down, and ran the knife into the deceased's neck at the side; he ran it through—I did not see the deceased move after that—I had not noticed him struggling or moving at all after I got into the road—I went right up to the prisoner, and said, "You have killed the man"—"Well," he said, "he tried to murder me, and now I have murdered him"—William Clark came up at that time—the prisoner had the knife in one hand and the stick in the other; the knife was covered with blood—I ran away towards Chadwell for the police, and when I returned with a policeman to the spot the prisoner was not there—I was not on the spot when the prisoner afterwards came there down Barley-lane; I was then gone into the garden—the deceased was lying on the ground, and I took the policeman to him—I soon after saw the prisoner in custody.</p>

I was passing along the road, which leads from Ilford to Chadwell-heath, on Tuesday, 8th Feb.—I passed Barley-lane about 9 o'clock, walking in a direction towards Ilford and London, and from Chadwell—I cannot tell what distance Barley-lane is from Barking—I did not notice any person standing there when I passed Barley-lane—when I had got nearly a quarter of a mile from Barley-lane, I heard something which induced me to look back, and I saw a man beating another with a stick; he</p>

               <p>knocked his hat off, and the man cried, "Murder!"—Mr. Toller was one, and the prisoner the other—I returned towards them, and shouted, "Leave off! leave off!"—I saw Mr. Toller knocked down by a great many blows with a large stick; he held up his hands to defend himself—as I was advancing, I saw the prisoner take a knife from his person, and cut the throat of the deceased—I was at that time about forty yards from them—I saw Mr. Willis in the other direction—on getting up, I did not speak to the prisoner; Mr. Willis spoke, and said, "Why, you have killed the man"—the prisoner said, "He tried to murder me, and now I have murdered him"—he had a knife in one hand and a stick in the other—Willis went away towards Chadwell for the police; he ran the same way as I did—neither of us said what we were going for—I noticed the prisoner going away towards Ilford; that way leads to the Seven Kings' Watering—Barley-lane leads out of the high road, and the Seven Kings' Watering is a running water that crosses the road—the prisoner went running off—I never saw the deceased move—this is very like the stick I saw the prisoner beating him with (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I will not swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, living at Chadwell-heath. I knew the deceased perfectly well, I believe he was a commission agent; he has told me that he sold things on commisson—he was in the habit of going to London; he mostly went on foot—I think he went every day, I have been in the habit of seeing him every day on the road (Chadwell-heath is ten miles from Whitechapel Church); he was a quiet man in his disposition, and had a wife and five children—he was, I believe, about forty-eight years of age—his place of abode was about a mile, or perhaps a little more, from Barley-lane—it would be his regular way to London to pass the end of Barley-lane—on that Tuesday morning, shortly after 9 o'clock, I heard the report that Mr. Toller was murdered—it caused very great excitement—I saw several persons who had been to see the man who was murdered, but I did not see any of them looking after the prisoner—I commenced my rounds with my cart to serve my customers—I went towards a place called Little-heath, and palled up at the opposite end of Barley-lane, to where the murder had been committed, to serve a customer at a tobacco shop, Mrs. Inglish—at that place three roads join, one goes by Chadwell to Little-heath, which I went along; Barley-lane is the second, and the third goes to the Forest—I know the brook, Seven Kings' Watering, that does not lead directly to the tobacco shop, but a person could get to it by going round—I was inside Mrs. Inglish's house, which is a beershop and chandler's shop; the prisoner came to the door, and asked for a halfpenny worth of tobacco—he did not come into the house; he said he had got a box, and asked for a lucifer or two—the tobacco and some lucifers were supplied to him, and he left the house and went towards, Barley-lane—I had never seen him before—I was going away when I saw my dogs following him down Barley-lane, which I thought very strange, as they are very shy of any one—I followed him shortly afterwards (he had no stick with him at the shop)—I came up with him just at the end of the lane, when he was with a policeman—I said to Metcalfe, in his hearing. "You have got him just in time, I was after him;" the prisoner is the man—I went for Willis, the gardener, brought him back, and he identified the prisoner; he said, "That is the man"—I do not think the prisoner made any answer to that—I took the policeman and the prisoner to Ilford gaol in my cart; on the way the prisoner said something (he was not asked any question before he said so, nor was anything said as to whether it would be better for him to tell the truth)—he said, "I will tell you the truth, he once attempted to murder me, and now I have murdered him; he once hindered me</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "This predisposition to insanity is much more readily transmitted through the female than through the male parent"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite true—I saw the prisoner in Ilford gaol; I was called to treat him for the wound on his finger—I had conversation with him several times—he appeared to me to be labouring under a delusion, not only as to the deceased having attempted to murder him, but that several other persons were in a conspiracy to murder him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon all the circumstances of hereditary insanity in a family, and that the party committing the crime was cognizant of the consequences of that crime, which would be the loss of his life, and that on the commission of that crime, instead of attempting to escape from justice, he delivered himself up to the law, and seemed reckless of the consequences, are you, as a medical man, prepared to say whether those circumstances taken together, and the commission of the crime, indicate a sound or unsound state of mind in the criminal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unsound, rather; certainly they would—I have not of my own knowledge known persons become suddenly insane whose conduct had been previously only eccentric—I have, as a medical man, given my attention to the subject of insanity.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You believe that there may be sudden insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; because insanity may be latent until aroused by certain circumstances—the result of the various interviews I had with the prisoner was, that he produced on my mind the impression that he was not in a sound state of mind on this particular point, at the time I had the conversation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">COOKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After his committal to Ilford you first saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; for the wound on his finger—he did not complain to me in any of the conversations I had with him of Mr. Toller having injured him, and deprived him of a night's lodging—he did not mention to me that it was not want that drove him to it—I saw him four or five times—I have been three years at Ilford and have also been in practice at Putney and at Barnet—I have been a surgeon since 1848, and am a member of the College of Surgeons—I have been called in to several insane patients, and have had them under treatment, at Ilford, at their own houses—in two cases they have been removed from their own houses to private lunatic asylums—I am assistant to Mr. Allison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, living at Chadwell. I was acquainted with the late Mr. Toller—I sometimes drove a horse and cart from there to London—on 30th Dec. last I was in London with my horse and cart, and on my return in the evening I pulled up my horse in the Mile-end-road, where Mr. Toller was waiting for me at the appointed time, to ride home with me—while I was waiting to give my horse some water and corn, the prisoner came up and asked me for a few halfpence to help him to a night's lodging; I told him I had nothing to give him, I had nothing but what I worked for, told asked him why he did not go to work; that he was as well able to work as I was—Mr. Toller said, "He will not work; he is a regular impostor, I have seen him before"—I then went away to feed my horse with the corn, and while I was doing so, they were on the quarrel—I did not hear what they said, but I could hear high words between them; and when I came back they were still at words, and Mr. Toller said, "If there was a policeman handy, I should not mind giving you in charge"—I told the prisoner that his best way would be to <hi rend="italic">toddle</hi> off about his business—he turned round, and Mr. Toller said, "We have got nothing to give you"—the prisoner said, "I should like to give you something"—we then went into the public house to get some refreshment, and when we came out we saw no more of the prisoner—it was between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon when I pulled up at the public house—I know the spot at Barley-lane where Mr. Toller's body was found—I saw the prisoner not quite a quarter of a mile from that spot, nearer Romford, about four or five days before the murder was committed; he had a short stick under his left arm—I was in my cart, going to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On the first occasion when you saw the prisoner, had not he a short stick with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I would not swear, but I do not think he had—I rather think he had not—I have only seen him three times, once on the evening I mentioned, once in the Romford-road, and at the Bench at Ilford—Mr. Toller and I stayed at the public house three quarters of an hour while my horse baited—we had two pints of porter and some bread and cheese—I did not mention anything about the conversation with the prisoner till after the murder—I did not think of taking any notice of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married; my husband is a corn dealer, and lives at Kensal New Town. I am the prisoner's sister—our mother has been dead three years and a half—she died in the County Lunatic Asylum at Wandsworth—the last time of her derangement she was sixteen years there—she had been previously three times at New Bedlam—the prisoner is</p>

               <p>younger than I am—not quite a year and a half after his birth his mother was confined in a lunatic asylum—she was a lost woman from the time of his birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the mental illness come on at the time of her confinement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was the puerperal fever—she had never been in confinement before his birth, but in each of her subsequent confinements, which were two, it was necessary to take her from home.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen much of your brother during the last few years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; occasionally he would call on me, but he has been a wanderer for twelve or fourteen years—I saw him last, as near as I can remember, a month before Christmas—he stayed with me about a quarter of an hour—he was very much excited—his conversation was on the Catholic religion—he said there were men after him who would kill him, go which way he would—his conversation was of an excited nature during the whole of the quarter of an hour he was with me—he left me after that—he wandered outside my door for a long time before he entered the house on each occasion that he called—I had to press him to come in each time that he visited me—I endeavoured to reason him out of that, but to no effect—he considered that he was superior to any other person, and that he should have a good deal of money and be a gentleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">COOKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him more than once last year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two or three times—the last time was a month before Christmas, as near as I can recollect—about four months had elapsed between the last time and the last time but one—he did not mention the Catholic religion then—that was the time about a month before Christmas; that was the only time he mentioned it—I have reasoned with him many times about his mode of life; I have remonstrated with him about living as he did without a home, and not doing work, but living in idleness—he did not on those occasions put me off by saying that he expected money and should be a gentleman—he did not appear to have sense enough to get his living; he appeared to ramble about from one thing to another, but I still continued to remonstrate with him—I am about a year and a half older than he is—he has worked at different places, I can hardly tell you where; he has been a rambler all over the country—I generally gave him food and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My learned friend asked you about remonstrating with him about not working; did you also remonstrate with him when he told you about people going to kill him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but he still argued against me, I told him we were in a free country, where there was protection for all; but I could not reason him out of the idea that people were going to kill him.</p>

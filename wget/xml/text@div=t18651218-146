I was on duty in Rotherhithe in plain clothes, and apprehended a boy in Church-street—he was carrying some<lb></lb>thing—I asked him what he had got—he threw it away and ran—I followed, and caught him—it turned out to he some wheat—I went into Church-passage with him on the way to the station, and was repeatedly struck by the prisoner Webb, who called out to parties there to rescue my prisoner, and pitch into me—two men, not the prisoners, caught hold of me, and Webb struck me a strong box on the forehead—he also struck the other constable, Hughes, who was down at the time—both the prisoners struck him previous to his falling, and after he was down I saw parties kicking him—I cannot say who they were, but I saw Forbes among them—there was a great crowd—I have repeatedly seen Webb before passing backwards and forwards—I know him sufficiently to say that he is the man who struck me—I was about a yard from the lamp—I apprehended him 10 or 20 minutes afterwards, 100 or 150 yards from the spot—the boy got away—I had not told him what I took him in custody for, and yet he said that he had nothing to do with it—Forbes was taken at 10 o'clock that night—the door was open—Hughes rapped, and asked if Forbes was at home—Forbes said "Yes, I am here for you,"and came out with a poker in his hand, and his wife had a poker also—Forbes raised the poker at Hughes, who raised his staff, warded off the blow, and at the same time struck him on the head—here are the two pokers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), this is the one he had—he held it in this way (<hi rend="italic">with the knob upwards</hi>) Forbes knew my name, as I had had him in custody previously—he said to me, as I took him to the station, "Doyle, I will give you a b—good punching on your b—head; and I cut or "kicked the b—countenance of that b—Hughes."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PETER TOFFIELD</hi>. I am a boiler-maker, in the employ of Haughton, Son, and Kendrick—Webb was in their employ—we were engaged in a job as Rotherhithe, on the 5th December, fifty-six of us, and had been so for a fortnight—we were sent down by Mr. Kendrick to do a particular job—on 15th December, I saw Webb at work at 7 o'clock in the morning—he was at work with us till 6 o'clock, when I left with him and the other four witnesses—we went to the Ship tavern, Rotherhithe, that is about a quarter of an hour's walk, and had some beer in the tap-room—we remained there till twenty minutes to 7, and then we left together, and proceeded on our road home—we were followed by some tall man in black trousers and a black hat, to the Europa public-house, where Reynolds and I went into a urinal—we both came out together, and as we came out, the tall man took Webb by the cuff, and said, "I want you to go with me"—that was Doyle—he said, "What do you want with me?"—Doyle said, "Come, and you will see"—I said. "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, what does he want of you?—he said, "I do not know, I have done nothing"—I followed him to the station, and the constable that had charge of him would not tell us the charge, or let one of his mates go in to hear it—I went for Mr. Topper, his landlord, who bailed him out in my presence—our faces were more like sweeps than anything else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know Church-passage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have worked there about a fortnight—the shop is close to Rotherhithe church-yard—I heard of no disturbance that night, and saw none—no one went out of the public-house; we never left one another's company—I had never been there before—there is some one from the Ship here, who saw us there—I went to the station, considering they had got an innocent man, but they would not admit me—I went to Greenwich to hear the charge, but they would not admit me even there—I was the only one who went; I wanted to give evidence—it was Doyle who would not admit us to the station—I cannot swear to the constable who would not admit me to the police-court—it is a public court, but I am not accustomed to courts—I wanted to go in, and they said that there was no room—I saw <hi rend="italic">Doyle</hi> outside on Saturday, but not inside—I went inside the door, but when I went in to give my evidence along with my mate, they would not admit me; they said that the place was full—I went in at the close of the examination, but did not get a chance to hear or see anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that you were refused admittance; now you say that you went in at the close of the examination, which is true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wanted to go in with my mate, when he was called in, and the sergeant who was minding the door said that it was full, but I got in four or five minutes after he was convicted—I admit that I was in Court—I went in at the close of the hearing—I will not swear that I saw Doyle there, but I saw him outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker in the employ of Horton, Son and Kendrick, and live at 172, Long-lane, Bermondsey—the prisoner is a fellow workman of mine—on Friday, 17th December, I was at work at Rother<lb></lb>hithe dock—there were fifty-six of us—the prisoner Webb was one—he left home with me in the morning, and was at work with me till we left at 6 o'clock in the evening—five others left with me—the prisoner was one of them—we went to the Ship public-house, Rotherhithe, and had some beer—we stayed there till twenty minutes past 7 exactly, the six of us—Webb was one—he went into a urinal and Topfield followed him—Webb was taken about twenty yards from the urinal—I was half-a-dozen yards from him, almost alongside of him—I could not hear what was said by the man who took him—we went to the station, but they would not allow us in—we told them we wanted to go in to hear the charge that was to be laid against our fellow shipmate, but the sergeant on duty prevented us—Doyle is the man who took Webb—he shoved four of us at one time off the steps of the station—we asked him what he was taking Webb for, but he only replied, "Come with me, and you will know all about it"—when we went he would not let us go in.</p>

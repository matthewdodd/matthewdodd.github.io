The prisoner was eleven months in my service; I had a very high opinion of her. On the 7th of March I inquired for some articles which were missing - she said she would find them presently; a friend of mine went down to her, and brought me up some duplicates. I had been in prison for debt seven weeks, and left her to manage my concerns entirely - she had the keys of every thing. I am not a married man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Had she not to pro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060018"></xptr>vide herself and your son with victuals? A. Yes; she got a friend to keep an account of what she laid out.</p>

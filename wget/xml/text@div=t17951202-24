               <p>On the 30th of September last I went to the house of the prisoner, in <placeName id="t17951202-24-crimeloc126">Saffron-place, Saffron-hill</placeName>

               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, he gave information to Mr. Colquhoun, the very next morning, that there was nothing found at the prisoner's house; that he had been a bankrupt but once; that near 60l. a year was settled upon his wife previous to his bankruptcy, and that he delivered the trust deed to his creditors, in case he should be the survivor.</p>

               <p>I am an officer: I went with the last witness to the prisoner's house, on Friday the 16th of October; he was not at home; we went away and returned again; he was then at home; we asked him if those things were ready, he said, yes; and what followed I cannot directly say; but Mr. Rogers turned to me directly, under pretence of giving me his watch to pledge for three guineas; the officers were upon Saffron-hill; I brought them in, and he was apprehended; there was nothing found in the house.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that money, is it good or bad? - A. It is counterfeit; it is blackened, because otherwise there would be a very great white appear; there is a mixture used to take it off.</p>

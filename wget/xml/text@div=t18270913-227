            . I am a Bow-street officer. About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 12th of July, I was with McWilliams and Tyrrell, in Church-row, Bethnal-green; it was just then getting light. I saw Hawkins riding on a gelding, at the corner of Busby-street, which leads out of Church-row - I suspected all was not right, and ran after him; he was only walking - I pursued him up Busby-street, and when I came up with him, I asked him whose horse that was; he hesitated a minute or two, and then said, he was a drover, and was coming from Romford, that about a quarter of a mile below Bow-bridge, a man in a fustian coat hired him to ride the horse to Church-street, Bethnal-green, and he was to have 1s. - but he was then riding away from Church-street - Tyrrell had got up by this time; he took Hawkins; I lead the horse to the corner of Brick-lane; McWilliams went to the farther end of Church-street, near Shoreditch, where Hawkins said the man was to wait for him - he returned in about ten minutes, and said there was no one waiting; that nobody was there but the watchman - we then took Hawkins to Bethnal-green watch-house. Tyrrell and I took the horse away, and at the corner of Hare-street, Brick-lane, we saw Hitchcock coming along - this was about six hundred yards from where we met Hawkins; we took him, and Tyrrell found a quantity of oats in his pocket; he was walking toward Church-street - we took him to the watch-house - we asked him where he had been - he said in the brick fields all night; we said nothing to him before we searched him. We asked Hawkins, in his presence, if he was the man who gave him the horse; he said No; we locked them up. I shewed the same horse to Mr. Kain, who claimed it.</p>

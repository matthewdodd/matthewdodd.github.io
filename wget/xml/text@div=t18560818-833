                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 251). On 31st July, about 5 minutes before 4 o'clock in the morning, I was passing Messrs. Penn's factory, in Coburg-street, Greenwich—I was passing the prisoner's house, which is not far from the factory—I heard a noise in the yard—I looked through the gate, and saw the prisoner move some iron and put it in a shed—I went in search of the constable on the beat—I turned back to the prisoner's house, and saw him—I went again, and found the constable on the beat—I went back, and found the prisoner covering some iron in the yard—I passed through the house, and found the prisoner in the yard, with a piece of iron between his thighs—I went into the yard, and the prisoner let the iron fall, and he said, "Jennings, don't take me; I will not do it again"—I took him to the station, and left the other constable there—I came back again, and searched, and found between 10 and 12 cwt. of iron, partly in the shed, and partly in the yard—there is a heap of iron in Messrs. Penn's field, which is divided from the prisoner's yard by a fence—the iron is of the same description as that found at the prisoner's—I searched the prisoner's house, and found several pieces of timber.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 124). I was called by the last witness, and went with him to the prisoner's yard—I saw him removing some iron—the last witness took him, and I remained in the yard—I examined the fence between the prisoner's yard and Messrs. Penn's—there is a gateway there, but it was locked—I examined the iron, and I produce a piece—this piece was at the prisoner's, and this other was at Messrs. Penn's—they fit exacfly—it has been broken off.</p>

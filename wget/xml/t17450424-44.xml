             . I am a hatter by trade. I live in Creed-church lane . I have known the Prisoner about six years: he buys and sells old clothes. My men were drinking at the Taylors arms in Duke's place, and I went to call them.</p>
               <p>Mecum . That is a house which used to harbour all the thieves .</p>
               <p>Jackman . That is nothing to me, my character can be cleared.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Jackman. I believe about last May or June. Mecum was rapping it out prodigiously, and swearing in a most vile manner, that if he met with the person he was swearing about (who I did not know) he would shoot him and chop him to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that appear to be?</p>
               <p>Jackman. The Prisoner at the bar; and this was (as I heard afterwards) because the Prisoner had arrested his wife, or his supposed wife. I made answer, and said, Young man, I don't know you; but if this was a friend of mine, I would take care of you; for you should not say such vile words as these.</p>
               <p>Mecum. How came you here for a witness?</p>
               <p>Jackman. The Prisoner's spouse came to me, and desired me to come.</p>
               <p>Mecum. You would perjure yourself to swear against me, when you know nothing at all of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Jackman. He was servant to a gentleman I serve with hats, Mr. Levi in Lime-street .</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor: we first missed two shirts, about six weeks ago; after that a pair of stockings. We knowing nobody came into the place but him, we mistrusted him; so I laid a shirt to trap him, and we left him in the room by himself. After he was gone, we went into the room, and the shirt was gone; then my master went and took him up, and I was by when the shirt was taken out of his pocket. (Two shirts, two neckcloths, and three pair of stockings produced.) These are my master's property; one of these shirts was taken out of his pocket, the other things were found upon him; this was on the 15th of May.</p>

            . I am constable: I took the prisoner in custody at his master's house in Arundel-street, on the 15th of May; I found these things in the prisoner's master's house: the prisoner said they were his own property: they were in a handkerchief of his own: the shirts are marked with the initial letters of the prosecutor's name. I was before the justice when a shirt was pulled out of his pocket; he owned afterwards, that they were the prosecutor's property.</p>

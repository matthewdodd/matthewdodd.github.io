                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Grosvenor-street, West-square, Pimlico. I first saw the deceased on the 25th July—I found him labouring under an injury over the eye—I attened him three days—he came to me the fourth day, and said he was so well I need not see him again—the symptoms appeared not at all unfavourable—he had merely a black eye—on the 6th of August I saw him again—I found him up-stairs—he complained of a great head-ache—the blackness of the eye had gone off—I consider it was some injury of the nerve—I recommened him leeches and aperient medicine—I attended him till he went to the hospital on the 10th—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I never attended him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought there on Monday, and died early on Thursday morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found a very large abscess on the left side of the brain, which communicated with the left ear, through the membrane of the brain, through the bone which was dead—the abscess was quite in the centre of the brain, and that was the cause of his death, no doubt—it had been forming for some considerable time, more than a month—it was not recent—that could not have resulted from a blow in the eye on the 4th of July.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Mott, Salesman, Leadenhall-market, I received your letter on Saturday, ten bundles of double steel iron, eighteen inches wide, ten bundles of single from twelve to twenty wide, ten bundles of best plate iron, all different tiles; they will know at the yard.

               <p>P. S. Mr. Cross is in town, and will bring it down. You will buy it in Newgate-market. Please to send the hats back.</p>
               <p>He gave me a bill of exchange to pay for the iron, I produced it; I asked who he was, and where Mr. Mott lived, he said he himself was Mr. Mott, the poulterer, of Leadenhall-market, and that the acceptor was a respectable builder at Whaddon. On his saying he was Mr. Mott the poulterer, of Leadenhall-market, I then said</p>
               <p>"You supply some of my friends with poultry," naming Messrs. Randull and Souter; he said</p>

               <p>"yes, I have supplied them for years." On that I was perfectly satisfied of the bill being good, it being the bill of Mr. Mott, and let him have the iron to the amount of 20 l. or 30 l. this is the bill he gave me; (producing it, read.) He sent a cart down for the iron, I did not see it taken away. I saw it afterwards at an auction room, and knew it to be the same I sold him; I think it was moved from my warehouse on Monday, the 19th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180022"></xptr>or 20th. The prisoner said they were going to an inn to be sent down to Whaddon; I saw them at the auction-room on the following Thursday, I think. I have enquired, and find the prisoner's name is Mott, but not of Leadenhall-market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. He did not ask for the difference of the bill - A. I think the iron came to more than 50 l. but I do not know the amount of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said it was 20 l. or 30 l. - A. That is as near as I can guess, but I think it was more than 50 l. he said Dover was a friend of his, and he had an order from Mr. Dover to execute for the building for which Mr. Mott was to pay. I did not take the bill to Mr. Mott of Leadenhall-market. The prisoner particularly stated that he supplied the friends whose names I mentioned.</p>

               <p>"If there is any thing in the objection the prisoner shall have the benefit of it."</p>
               <p>MR. HOOD re-examined. The order he gave me was for more than 50 l. worth, but the cart would not take the whole away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was more than 50 l. worth set apart from your stock for him - A. I cannot say what was weighed off, I should have delivered the rest if called for, supposing it to be a genuine bill.</p>

            . I live at Whaddon in Buckinghamshire; I know the prisoner. I cannot say what he is. I never knew him to live in Leadenhall-market; the first of my knowing him was in May 1818, when I bought ten hogsheads of ale of him, the letter produced is not written by me, nor is the signature mine; the acceptance of the bill is not mine, I have no knowledge of it.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was the ale delivered to you - A. On the 3d of June, 1818, and since that I sold him a poney, I paid him a 20 l. bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man named Bailey - A. Perfectly well. - (looks at a letter.) - It is my writing. I am certain neither the bill or acceptance is my writing. I was a patient in St. Bartholomews-Hospital at the time the bill was issued. I was admitted in January, and left on the 3d of August.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you meet the prisoner in June - A. Perhaps seven or eight, we had some conversation; one

            , a farmer at Whaddon, requested me to send him down the price of Berwick pork; I asked the prisoner where it could be bought, he said in Thames-street, it was not to be paid for by a bill to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not tell Bailey you gave the prisoner this bill to get discounted for pork, but as he passed it for iron, he might take the consequence - A. No, I did not; I had no such conversation with him or Mr. Richardson. Bailey came to me and said, I am come concerning Mott, he is in the Compter about a bill, and if you do not go to him it will play hell with him. I said, I know nothing about the bill. I said I had paid one bill to him; Bailey said,</p>

               <p>"Oh! that is a bill accepted by Taylor." That is the only bill I ever gave him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have had dealings with him; do you know his hand writing - A. Yes, I believe the letter and bill to be his writing, but not the acceptance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sent Mr. Dover ten hogsheads of ale, which came to 60 l. I met him one day, and asked if he had any money, he said he had not, but if I came to a public-house he would give me his bill, and tell me where to get it done, which was at the pork-warehouse in St. John-street, instead of which I got it done at Hood's and that is the reason he denies his writing.</p>

            . I am a chair and cabinet-maker, I live in Old Moutague-street, Whitechapel; I received this letter from Mr. Dover - (looking at it.) - and sent the goods down to him which he ordered in it, and received the money. When Mott was taken up he sent for me, knowing I knew Dover. I went to Dover, and asked him to come forward concerning the bill of Motts', he said he had authorised the prisoner to part with that bill for pork, but not for iron. I have seen Dover write, I received two letters from him. I saw him afterwards, and he asked if I received the letters; I said I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the acceptance of that bill, and say if you believe it to be his writing - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you received more than two letters from him - A. No, it was more than two years ago, the last is dated 27th March, 1818. I have not seen him write since that.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the post-mark on that letter - A. I cannot discern it, it came by the post. I did not preserve them, but when Mott was apprehended, I looked among my papers and found them, I looked at them to refresh my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it Dover talked to you about them - A. About half or three-quarters of a year ago, when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180023"></xptr>wanted something for selling the goods, I allowed him 9 s. I think.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen these letters, but spoke from your memory of a year and three quarters ago, could you undertake to swear as to your belief of his hand writing - A. Yes; I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live - A. In Charles-street, Commercial-road, I left Old Montague-street last week. I mentioned Old Montague-street, because the letters were directed to me there. Dover said the bill he gave to Mott was to be laid out in pork and not in iron.</p>

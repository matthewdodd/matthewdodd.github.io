               <p>Q. What do you mean by the intrinsic value? A. To melt down; if it had been hung in our window for sale we should not have charged it above 7l. - there was no chain to it.</p>

            " - I never passed as his wife at my mother's lodging, nor any where; he knew me at my lodging, but I did not pass as his wife - I am an unfortunate woman; I do not know of his sleeping with a knife or dagger under his pillow; I heard some talk about his poisoning himself - I know he once took laudanum.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know it? A. The phial was found under the sofa pillow - I did not see it; the landlady went to the doctor's where he bought it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was that while you were acquainted with him? A. Yes; he was very unhappy for several days before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You never saw him take any? A. No; I saw the phial, and smelt it - it was landanum; he was very ill after it, and very stupid in his head; this was previous to Christmas, I believe.</p>

            . I live in Cromer-street, Gray's Inn-lane. In November last the prisoner came to lodge with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150009"></xptr>me - the witness. Brett, accompanied him as his wife; he left a week before Christmas - about a week before he left he was taken dangerously ill; I went up, and saw him very ill in bed, and a few minutes afterwards he put on his things, and went out into the street without his hat in a pouring rain - I remonstrated with him about it; his mother and sister came shortly after that - I went up to his room to let him know they were come; he was then very ill laying on the sofa, and the next time I went up he was vomiting: I found a phial on the sofa, it was empty - I took it over to a medical gentleman - it smelt of laudanum; he recovered by means of the vomiting - his conduct at my house was very wild at times, and seemed very strange.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. While he lived at Mrs. Watkins' I received a communication from him, and went to see him; I found him laying on the sofa very ill - a phial laid there, which I could tell had had laudanum in it by the smell; he vomited after that, and I thought appeared to have taken laudanum - I have seen a person under the influence of laudanum before; some months before this I found a dagger under his pillow - I have also found a carving knife under his pillow; he has been affected in his head from a child -I do not mean that his mind has been gone, but his head is diseased whenever he gets a cold; there is a sure inside his head - it was ulcerated within; it was never opened.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of communications you have had from medical persons as to his state, have you been obliged to watch him? A. Yes, I have watched him at times; I had an elder son, who is now dead - he was afflicted in his head just as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long is it since the dagger and carying knife were found under his pillow? was it several months before Christmas? A. I should think not more than a month before; I went into the country last May, and returned - he then lived with me again; I never knew Watkins - the prisoner lived with me for about a fortnight after I returned from the country.[Thursday, April 15.] <rs id="t18300415-4-verdict25" type="verdictDescription">

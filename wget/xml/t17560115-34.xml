               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Burr. Because he owned the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. In what words did he own it?</p>
               <p>Burr. He said the last thing he stole was the rug and bolster, and that he design'd to come next for the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he make this confession?</p>
               <p>Burr. This he made before Sir Samuel Gower; and said that he stole them at divers times, and that he sent them by a woman, who sold some of them for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own which way he got into your house?</p>
               <p>Burr. He said he came in backwards, as we were forwards, about six in the evening, at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door-fastened ?</p>
               <p>Burr. It was. There was a bolt upon it, which was bolted on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear the door was bolted before 6 o'clock that evening?</p>
               <p>Burr. I can, and will, swear it safely.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any of your goods again?</p>
               <p>Burr. Some of them are in court. We found some of them again by his direction. We have all but one sheet and bolster.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Worship-square, and am a coffee-roaster. The prisoner has been in my employ—on a Saturday morning in November, I placed myself on a stair-case, from whence I could have a view of my warehouse—I saw Reynolds take some coffee and hand it down a stair-case—I left the window, went to the back of the premises, and met the prisoner coming out of the yard—I asked him what he had got—he said nothing, but showed me a small paper, made up like a pack of cards—I said, "That will not do; what have you got in your hat?"—he took it off, and it had in it a small bag containing about 2 3/4 lbs. of raw coffee—he then said he brought it to be roasted—I said, "Why then take it away raw?"—he said no more—I then said to Reynolds, "Now my sus<lb></lb>picions are realized"—he said a man brought it to be roasted—I said, "As God is my Judge, I saw you take it out of this bag"—Reynolds then went away, and I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

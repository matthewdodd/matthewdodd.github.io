I am a chandler, and live in Gravel-lane—on Friday night, the 7th of May, I went to bed about ten o'clock, and the next morning, a little before four I got up—when I got to the bottom of the stairs I saw a light—I found a wooden pane removed—I went into that shop and saw nothing amiss—I returned into my room and all my money was gone, which was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packets of pence, half-pence, and farthings—I can swear to a portion of the money by the tying up and the paper—this is the parcel—the papers were old sugar bags, and they are wrapped up in a slovenly manner—I did it on Friday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Mr. Beardshaw called me a few minutes after four o'clock on Saturday morning, and gave me information—I examined the place—I am positive no woman could have got over the wall—it is a back yard where they got in from the adjoining yard—a boy could get in at the bole, but it was not big enough for any body else—when I was coining off duty at six I saw the prisoner coming out at the door of a coffee-shop which is about 200 yards from the prosecutor's house—a boy was with her—they seemed confused—the boy went one way, and the woman another—I asked the prisoner what she had in her basket she said she had nothing—I told her I thought she had—she said, "Yes, I have got some money in it; I am going to market with it"—I said, "Let me look at it; you are the very person I want "—she said, "That money I found in the Grove"—I took her to the station—I found nine packages of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers, and two broken ones which I produce.</p>

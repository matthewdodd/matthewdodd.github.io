I know the prisoner—on Saturday evening, 8th Nov. last, about half past 6 o'clock, I saw him near the shop of Mr. Fricker, a poultry salesman—I saw him take two grouse off a hook outside the shop, and place them on his arm—there was a large quantity of people round—he looked round and saw Mr. Fricker's man and foreman engaged, and then walked down the passage, and into the Poulterers' Arms—I went and told the foreman.</p>

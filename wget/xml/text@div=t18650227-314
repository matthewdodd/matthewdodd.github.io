                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, of 13, Regent-streel, Limehouse-causeway—on the evening of 3d February I went to bed about ten o'clock—the house was safe as usual—I did not myself see that the windows were down; I should have noticed if they had been open—there was no fastening to the windows; they were merely shut down—about eleven o'clock I was disturbed by the girl screaming out that there was some one in the house—I directly jumped out of bed and began to dress Myself and got a light, and presently the prisoner spoke and said, "All right, Mr. Sharpley, it is only me, I will explain it, have merely got in for a night's lodging"—I did not know him, it appears that he knew me: I know some member of his family—I opened my bedroom door and he was there—he had come down stairs—he began to explain himself—he said he thought it was an empty house, and he had got in at the staircase-window for the purpose of a night's lodging—he said he had shut the window after him, and it was shut—I found no property disturbed—the prisoner was quite sober—I did not notice whether the staircase-window was shut when I went to bed, it is a sash-window—the servant is not here.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody, charged with burglariously entering Mr. Sharpley's house—he said, "I went and knocked at the front door, as I found no answer I went over the back wall and got on the top of the barn, over the barn and to the back window, where I lifted the window and went in, as I saw there were no blinds up I thought it was an empty house"—he said, "Mr. Sharpley when the girl screamed did I run away, did I not say, 'Mr. Sharpley, it is all right, it is me,'"—I searched him at the station and found on him this knife.</p>

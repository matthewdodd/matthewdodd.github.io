             sworn. - I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner on the 26th of January last, in Goodman's-yard, with two more men, he had a cask on his shoulder; I heard one say," Go in there," meaning to Mr. Levi's: the prisoner went up the step, I followed him, and asked him what he had there? he said, he did not know? I asked him how he came by it? he said, a man was to give him half a crown for carrying it; I asked him if he should know the man? he said, no; then I took him and the cask to the office; I saw Mr. Hodges's name on the cask; I went to him, and asked him if he had lost a cask, he said, he had, and came to the office, and swore to his property.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hodges.) Can you say when you had last seen it, before you saw it at the office? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180006"></xptr>No; the cask is sent with the liquor, and then is returned; I cannot say any more, my servants are not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was hired as a porter to carry it to Mr. Levi's, who would not take it in; I said, I would not take it away, but he said, I should, when that man took me; I have no witnesses. <rs id="t18020918-6-verdict26" type="verdictDescription">

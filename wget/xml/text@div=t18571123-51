                  </hi>. I reside at Pankstone, near Poole, in Dorsetshire. I have a son named William Jolliffe Slade, in London—on 30th Oct.

                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post Office. My duty is principally in the money order department—on Monday, 2nd Nov., I was called into the office—I found Embleton at the granting window—I was desired by Mr. Spencer to take him round to the comptroller's office—I did so, and received this letter and order from Mr. Spencer—the Comptroller said to Embledon, "This is a forgery;" and he was asked where he got the order from—he said, "I received it from a person of the name of J. Slade, or commonly called <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Slade, on Saturday night, about 8 o'clock, and I was to receive half a crown for my trouble"—he said he was to take it back to Slade, at No. 13, Brydges Street, Covent Garden, that Slade lived there—I asked him what trade Mr. Slade was—he stated that he was a pen maker, and that he himself sold pens about—I asked him how long he had known him—he said he had known him a long time, he knew him when he lived at Chelsea; he then said, "I have been at the office before, with the order, and signed it 'J. Slade,' and it was refused in consequence of its wanting another Christian name;" he said, "I went back to Brydges Street, and from there to Broad Street, Bloomsbury, where I saw Slade; I told Slade I could not obtain the order, in consequence of its wanting another Christian name;" and he said, "'Why did you not tell me you had another Christian name, as I only knew you by the name of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Slade?'"—I then took him to the Bow Street station, and left him there—as I was going out of the station, I said, "I suppose I shall have no difficulty in finding Mr. Slade at No. 13, Brydges Street?"—he</p>

               <p>said, "Not 13, 11; and if you do not find Slade there, ask for Bagley"—I went to No. 11; I found no such person as Slade; I then inquired for Bagley—I went up stairs into an upper room, and saw Bagley sitting there in his Post Office dress—I said, "Is your name Bagley?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he knew a person of the name of Slade—he said he had heard of the name—he said he had seen such a person—I asked if he knew where he lived—he said, "No"—I then said, "You sent a person of the name of Embleton to obtain a Post Office order for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said, "Yes, I did"—I asked where he got that order from—he said, "I was on my delivery on Saturday morning, in Broad Street; a person tapped me on the shoulder, produced the order, and asked me where it was made payable; I looked at the order, and told him it was payable at the General Post Office; he asked me to get the order cashed for him, and he would give me half a crown; I said, 'I cannot go myself, but I will get a person to go for you;' he then gave me the order and the letter, first tearing off one half of it; he said the money was to be brought to him (Slade), at No. 56, Broad Street, St. Giles's, at 11 o'clock on Monday morning; he said it was the house next to the workhouse"—I found it to be a public house—he said that Embleton brought him the order back on the Monday, saying that he could not get payment for it—he said, "I then took and signed the order, as it is now produced, 'Wm. J. Slade,' and gave Embleton the order and letter back"—before I left the station Embleton said, "I took the order back to Slade, and told him that I could not receive the payment of it, in consequence of it wanting another Christian name, and Slade replied, 'Why did you not look at the letter?'" and he (Embleton) replied, "I was not going to look into other people's letters."</p>

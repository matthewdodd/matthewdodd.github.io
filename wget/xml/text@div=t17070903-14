The Evidence depos'd, That the Prosecutor hearing a Noise about Mr. Barry's House between 12 and 2 in the Morning, arose, with his Wife and Man, and went down Stairs, and found a Window broken open, went to it, and discovered 2 Men without, about 5 Yards from the Window; one of whom was the Prisoner. The Evidence farther deposed, The the Prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17070903003"></xptr>willing to take the Thieves, went with his Wife and the Deceas'd up-stairs for Arms; that the Deceas'd stept back to go into the Kitchen for a Spit, but was met by the Prisoner, who drove the Deceas'd into a Pantry, and gave him a Stabb in his Breast, of which he dy'd twelve Hours after. There were divers concurring Circumstances; as first, that when the Deceas'd and Prisoner were scuffling together, the other Thief shot at the Prisoner, to disingage him from the Deceas'd; but the Shot happen'd to take the Prisoner's Leg, which prov'd to be wounded when he was taken. Another Circumstance was, a Button found in the Pantry, and prov'd to be lost from the Prosecutor's Coat; a Bloody Sword was found under an Hay Cock, with a Receipt to the Prosecutor, for Money paid. The Prisoner saying little in his Defence, and the Facts being clearly prov'd upon him, the Jury found him <rs id="t17070903-14-verdict74" type="verdictDescription">

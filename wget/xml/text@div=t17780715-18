               <p>The prisoner came to my house for a clean shirt, rather before eleven than after. on last Friday. I live in Queen's-head-Court in the Strand, opposite the Adelphi; he came rather before eleven than after; he stayed in our house playing with my little girl till half past twelve; I believe, he did not go away till near one; he had on a nankeen waistcoat and breeches.</p>
               <p>Is that a nankeen waistcoat that he has on now? - No, these are not the clothes he had on then that I am positive of; the waistcoat and breeches were new nankeen. He was at my house again about six and stayed there till eight; he came again that night and stayed at our house with my little girl and me till twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>What was he doing at your house all this time? - He drank tea, and played about with my little girl and went into my yard.</p>
               <p>He came to your house before eleven and stayed till twelve at night? - No, he went away little before one in the forenoon, and came back about six and drank tea with me.</p>
               <p>Which was the truth; did he go away at six or return at six? - Returned at six and drank tea with me; that was the real truth.</p>
               <p>He went away before one? - Rather before one; I cannot say how many minutes before one; that was at noon; if he had done any mischief, it was before he came to our house.</p>

               <p>What did he stay at your house from six till twelve? - Yes, he went to the fore-door backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>That is not leaving the house? - He did not leave the house from six till twelve.</p>
               <p>What did you mean just now when you talked of eight o'clock? - He went and sat down at the fore-door with my little girl; I went backwards and forwards about my business; and he came backwards and forwards from a little before eleven till one; he never was out of my room, which is an under apartment.</p>
               <p>The whole employment he had there was playing with your little girl? - No, it was not; I had several books which were in the window, which he took about and read; he went into the yard and took up the ax and cut some wood.</p>
               <p>Jury. How old is your little girl? - Five years old the 2d of last June</p>
               <p>Jury. And did she sit up till twelve o'clock? - No; she lies in the same room.</p>
               <p>Court. With whom? - With me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150028"></xptr>Did you lie in the same room where the prisoner was? - No, I have a bed that turns up; I did not let it down; I put her in a little bed by the side.</p>
               <p>What time do you put your child to bed? - Sometimes by eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Are you married or single? - Married.</p>
               <p>Where was your husband? - Upon watch.</p>
               <p>What became of him in the morning? - He carries coals about; he is not at home from eight in the morning sometimes.</p>
               <p>Was he at home any of the time that day? - Yes, at home to his dinner.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner dine with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he was not there at any time that your husband was? - I cannot recollect, whether he was or no.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The ladies - I saw Mrs. Maxwell and the postillion at Sir John Fielding's, would you have me say what they said?</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, by all means. - Mrs. Maxwell did not then swear positively, not so point blank as she has done; to say I am certain, I am sure he is the man; but you are certainly the man to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>What did Miss Master's say? - There was no second lady there at the time I was there; I mean the Wednesday's examination, that was the first.</p>
               <p>Was the post-boy there? - There was a postillion there; he is now disguised he was then in a postillion's dress; I believe he is the man, the first account he gave was in my hearing; and he picked him out I believe from eight or nine men; and when he came before Sir

             the second day, he knew nothing at all of the man.</p>
               <p>Carpenter. There were nine men put into a back room; I was one of them myself, the postillion was put into the room; he looked round; he then turned his eyes to the prisoner; he touched him and said that is the man.</p>
               <p>Groves. That is the fact; when Sir John questioned the postillion which he then did, and frequently reminded him of the nature of an oath; he then lowered a peg, and said he believed the clothes were the clothes the man was in that robbed the ladies.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you merely there as a spectator? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you no business there? - None at all; at the first time when they picked him out I was there as a spectator; the second time I was there upon business.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you subpenaed here? - I came this moment into court; I knew nothing at all of it, and if I had thought I should have been called upon, I should have kept out of court; because I knew very well I could say nothing to serve the man.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner and the public are entitled to your testimony, if you can say any thing upon the subject. - It is a disagreeable business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, the advertisement in the Daily Advertiser the day after I was examined at the Justice's, says, that the ladies could not swear to me. I beg your lordship will see the advertisement.</p>
               <p>[ An officer brought the news paper.]</p>
               <p>Court. Will you point out the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot see without a glass. I can read only A and B and so; but I often look into books.</p>
               <p>Court. It is an anonymous account of what passed at Justice Fielding's office.</p>
               <p>Court to Carpenter. You said you found out several places where he had hired horses? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find out the horse he had that day? - No, Fisher remained to look at the horses.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he ever pawn the coat and waistcoat he has now on with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - On the 27th of June he pawned a coat for two shillings; but I cannot say whether that is it or not; we have had that coat in pledge before.</p>
               <p>Did he pawn any thing on Friday last? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I fetch out this coat on Tuesday? - On Tuesday last; he serched a coat out for two shillings.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is this the coat? - I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why you lent the money upon it? - I cannot say now; last Tuesday he pledged a coat and nankeen waistcoat and breeches for 16 s. and took a coat out; I never remember his having any other coat but this, and that we have now; he had a coat out for two shillings at the time he pledged them.</p>
               <p>Did he ever pledge more than one green coat with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other coat that I have is a different coloured green coat; the ladies did not look at my eyes when they were robbed; here is a surgeon in court, he may see how bad my eyes are.</p>
               <p>Mr. KITCHEN sworn.</p>
               <p>Were you before the justice? - Yes, there was another coat produced which he had at that time; and this was brought then by somebody.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Maxwell. The other coat is a green coat, but it is more upon the brown, with brass buttons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kitchen. This coat was brought; the ladies were of opinion that the coat he then had on was the coat he had on when he robbed them; he said he was not the person, and would prove that coat was then in pawn; and that he wore this coat that day; that he had fetched it out of pawn, and pledged the other coat; as that coat fetched more money.</p>
               <p>Did he say when he pledged it? - I think not on Friday, I am certain to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady said she was robbed in this coat; I have proved this coat to be in pledge at the time; the ladies did not swear to me the first day; I believe Sir John's people persuaded them to it.</p>

            . Did you ever see the prisoner in more green coats than one? - I cannot say I ever saw him have any thing but that green coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have another.</p>
               <p>Young. Yes; he has another; but it is not so dark as that.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. When Fisher gave his evidence first of all, he rather faultered, whether he was the man; but I believe he did afterwards faintly say that he was the man; I wish to ask him again; whether he is or not certain that the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Court to Fisher. Have you any doubt whether the prisoner is the man that robbed the ladies? - None.</p>

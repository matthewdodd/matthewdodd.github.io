             JONES. I married the prisoner at St. Pancras' new church, on the 28th of February, 1831 - we lived together some time - I had two children by him - I married him by the name of William Lucas - he behaved very well for a short time - I found out, about three months ago, that he was married.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). About ten years ago, I married my first wife, and, after her confinement, it was mutually agreed that we should go to service, and each of us succeeded in getting a situation - my wife had not been in her place long ere she purloined some of her employer's property, and was sentenced to seven years' transportation; and after remaining four years in Newgate was acquitted - I had placed my child under the parental care of my mother, prior to my wife's conviction - after her discharge from prison, I used my utmost endeavours to find her place of residence, but without effect, and continued without any knowledge of her till the 13th of the present month, having previously married the second wife, which was in a great measure pressed by herself, and having previously apprised her that I had one child.</p>

On the twenty-first of October, as I was very busy in the shop waiting on two ladies, there was a cry of stop thief, my young woman ran out to see what was the matter, I thought some of the neighbours had been robbed; she told me a piece of cloth had been taken from our window. The prisoner never was in the shop; the windows are open, there were twenty-two piles of cloths lay in the window; it was about nine o'clock at night. The cloth was brought to the shop afterwards.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner take the cloth out of Mr. Macdonald's window; I am sure he is the man; I pursued him; he was taken in a few, minutes in White Hart-yard; the linen fell from him as I was running after him, it fell on the groud in Russel-court; I was so near him that I did not see it fall, but I had like to have stumbled over it.</p>
               <p>Was it wrapped up when he took it? - Yes; there were eighteen or twenty pieces in the window. I believe, I did not stop to take the cloth up, but pursued the prisoner. I saw the cloth in motion on the ground.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. It is a good way from Russel Court to White Hart Yard, where you took the man? - Yes; a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of him in the pursuit? - He might be out of sight, but I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Macdonald. On the twenty-first of October in the morning, I laid twenty-two pieces of cloth in the window; at night there was one missing, I saw it dropp'd in the court by a person in green cloaths; the prisoner had green cloaths on; I only saw the back of him after the cry of stop thief. I did not know it was taken away till I heard. I am sure it is my mistres's cloth by the mark on it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence denied the charge, and called several witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

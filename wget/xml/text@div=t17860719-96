               <p>Mr. Attorney General opened the case as follows.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment against the prisoner at the bar, founded on an act of Parliament made in the 10th of the late King, by which it is made a capital felony for any persons to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190146"></xptr> the number of three or more, armed with fire-arms or other offensive weapons, to seize and carry away uncustomed goods; there is likewise another clause that makes it the same offence to be assembled in order to assist in carrying such goods away; and the only question I shall have to lay before you is, whether you are satisfied that the prisoner is one of the persons that was so assembled: It may be proper, though certainly it is not necessary that I should state to you the policy and intent with which this act was made and continued; it was made at a time when (as I am afraid the case is at present) the revenue of this country could not be collected without danger to the officers, which made it almost impossible to collect such revenue; and the smugglers at that time (as I am sorry to say they have continued to this) not contented to carry on their trade with the evasion of the law, did then and still do endeavour to effect that evasion with violence, which the prudence and circumspection of the officers make it impossible to effect any other way. Gentlemen, the evidence will not leave any room to doubt of the prisoner's guilt: It seems that on the 21st of April was a twelvemonth, (and the reason of this prosecution not having been commenced sooner arises from the absconding of the prisoner) this prisoner, together with several other persons, much more than the number of three, and whose names will be mentioned to you by the waterman who ferryed them over to the Plymouth side of the river, between twelve and one in the night came over to Plymouth side, from a place I think called Corsham, each of them with bludgeons in their hands, which will be described, and concerning which there will be no doubt at all of their being offensive weapons, for some of them had irons on their ends, but all of them loops at their ends, by which a man could hold them in his hand in order the more effectually to strike, the end of them being extremely heavy. Gentlemen, the officers on their duty that night were in expectation of their coming, and they were watching for them; about one o'clock they saw twelve or fourteen of the smugglers coming in a boat belonging to one

            , a waterman; each of them had tubs flung with cords in his hand, which they call an anchor; they proceeded to Plymouth dock, except the waterman, who had no hand in the business but that of bringing them over, they had each of them a bludgeon; the officers let them go a little way, and then immediately appeared and endeavoured to rescue these casks, and accordingly they did get four of these casks into their custody, upon this the smugglers rallied, and they attacked the officers, and from their number, which was much greater than that of the officers, they very soon overcame them; they knocked down old Kingsforth, and beat him in so horrid a manner, as really I could hardly have believed that men in their desperate situation could have been guilty of; they first of all broke his leg, when they had done that one only of the officers remained to carry him away, the others were so terrified; he carried him to the public house, and laid him down at the door, and then they fell upon him again, and beat him till he was rendered such a spectacle as hardly ever was seen; and I am informed at this moment he is totally incapacitated from doing and business, and his life for some time was despaired of Gentlemen, in this scuffle the other man Taylor had his leg broke, and the other escaped. The only question that you will have to try is, whether this man was one of the number: in order to prove that, I shall call in all these officers, or many of them, who will give you a general account of the manner in which these men came over; old Kingsforth and another cannot speak to the identity of this man, but there are two other witnesses that speak positively to him;

             the waterman will prove to you, that this man was one of those that came over that night, that he was one of those that had the casks after they were rescued from the smugglers, and that he afterwards came over on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190147"></xptr> What were they beating Kingsforth with? - With sticks.</p>
               <p>What sort of sticks? - Very large sticks, bludgeons we call them.</p>
               <p>What was his stick? - A bludgeon; they call them bats in their place; they are generally used by those people that carry these liquors.</p>
               <p>You say you are sure you met Gray; which way was he going, towards the smugglers or from them? - They had beat me off the cags; and I met him going to join them; I did not see him strike with his bludgeon.</p>
               <p>Was he using it as a walking stick when you met him? - No, not walking with it, he was swinging it in his hand; I did not see him do any thing with it; he joined the other party.</p>
               <p>What were they doing when he joined them? - They were beating Kingsforth; I saw Gray and Andrews about five the next morning going over the water together.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner doing any thing when Kingsforth called out his leg was broken? - No, it was before he called out that his leg was broke that I saw him; they were so thick that I could not possibly see every one that struck him.</p>
               <p>What dress was this man in? - A short jacket; I saw him in the morning going over the water with Andrews.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing? - Andrews abused me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. Did they not say it was a common ferry boat? what did you do when Kingsforth called out that he had broke his leg? - We went back to help him to a public house, the smugglers took their cags and carried them away to Mutton Coe; they carried them off, and then they returned again afterwards, and came out, and said they would murder some of us.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - Up at the corner of Hutchins's house, the bottom of Liberty-street.</p>
               <p>Did you see Gray at that time? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>You say that he had a jacket on? - Yes, a short jacket.</p>
               <p>What might be the colour of it? - It might be a little greyish, by the looks of it, I cannot be particular; I only looked in his face and passed by him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this Gray before? - Yes, Sir, many times before; I knew him very well by his face.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what this cask was that was taken? - I do not know, I did not taste it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In what situation did you first see the prisoner at the bar, what was going forward then; did you see him come from the boat? - No, Sir; the first that I saw was when he went to join the people; he seemed to come from the street.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it light then? - It was not quite dark, it was moon light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You rather choose a dark night in order to detect these people; you could see very plainly all that was going forward? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see this man do any thing at all, neither carry a cag, nor do any thing to annoy any body? - No; I do not know whether the prisoner might or might not have a cag.</p>
               <p>But when you saw him he had none? - No.</p>
               <p>The others at that time had? - He had a knotty stick in his hand, they call them all bludgeons, there are all sorts of them, some knotty and some smooth.</p>
               <p>You say that they had some of these bludgeons as long as two feet and a half? - Yes; they are not fit for walking sticks.</p>
               <p>You have known this man a long time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was a common porter about Plymouth-dock? - I did not know him at that time.</p>

               <p>When you went to assist Kingsforth, he said his leg was broke; did the prisoner stay to assist you? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wilson. Was the prisoner's stick smaller than the rest? - No, I do not know it was; some might be a little smaller; the cags were by them when I saw them beating Kingsforth.</p>

            , the prisoner, is the person I mean.</p>
               <p>What did they bring with them? - They brought cags, and put them into the boat, they all brought cags, but one had no cags.</p>
               <p>Which was that man? - I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>When they got on board your vessel with the cags where did you go? - We went to Mutton Coe, near Plymouth-dock; when we came there we took the cags out of the boat, and carried them on our shoulders; they had a stick a piece.</p>
               <p>What kind of stick? - A stick about three feet in length, to the best that I can tell; some call them bats, and some call them bludgeons.</p>
               <p>Are they walking sticks? - No; they are not for walking, they are too large, they are to protect themselves; as much as I can learn, if any body comes to molest them, with these things they defend themselves.</p>
               <p>How do they carry these sticks, you say they are pretty thick? - Carry them! Sir; in their hands.</p>
               <p>What became of these men when they got on shore? - They put the cags on their backs, and were proceeding to the dock.</p>
               <p>What happened? - Kingdom said to me, you may as well go with us, and I did.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them? - He was.</p>
               <p>When they went up had they a cag? - Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Had he one of the bats as you call them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In your way to Plymouth-dock what happened? - In the space of a few minutes the Custom-house officers came running after us, and I immediately stopped, and the Custom-house officers looked after me to see if they knew me, and I saw the officers come up to the smugglers; to these men I have been naming.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them at the time they came up? - He was in the party when they came up; then I saw a great bustle among them, and some went up Liberty-street, and some went up James-street, and some round a single house which stood by itself.</p>
               <p>What did they do? - Some of the officers, Mr. Kingsforth in particular, went round there; I did not go round after them, but they began beating him, and he cried out very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190149"></xptr>What did they do to him? - They beat him very much; I cannot say whether they broke his leg at that time, because I was not round the house to see; after that they took their cags, and away they went round Mutton Coe; after that I saw two come up round this house, where Mr. Kingsforth was beat; I went up James-street, there were two men, I imagined they were two of the smugglers; they came round, then they came down James-street a second time.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of the men? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There must be three persons besides the man? - There were eight or nine of them came directly after them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship knows two former witnesses have said that there were but two; the Attorney General, with his usual candour and good sense said he had no evidence of the second beating.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What the eight came down? - The two were down before the eight; I imagine they were joined, I was not a very great way from them.</p>
               <p>What were the words mentioned? - Just as Mr. Taylor was a little way from Mr. Kingsforth, says they we will murder some of you yet; says Kingsforth my leg is broke.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who said so? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. They went away, and fairly left the place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You do not know whether the prisoner composed one of that company? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot go into it because they fairly left the place, and returned again; did you see the prisoner any more that night? - No; I saw him the next morning about five; I came down to look for my boat, and it was taken away, and one of our watermen was there, his name is

               <p>You keep a boat of your own? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Ferry over backward and forward? - Any where, where a person chooses to hire me.</p>
               <p>Have you got your boat? - No, not at this present time; I was obliged to sell her after I came home to support myself; while I was abroad my brother-in-law had her and worked her; she was not seized.</p>

               <p>You have but one arm, so I suppose you did not carry a cag that night? - No, nor any thing else.</p>
               <p>One man came into the boat without a cag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he go out without one? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was not Gray that man that came in without a cag? - He certainly must come in without a cag, because they were put into the boat before he came in; the cags are put upon the beach before they are put into the boat; I cannot say Gray came without; I cannot say which it was.</p>
               <p>When you came out of the boat one of these men said to you, Tom, you may as well come up along with us? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any other passengers in the boat except these that you have named? - Not that I recollect, not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Cannot you get no further than that now? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>So you walked up innocently enough, you carried no cag and did no harm in walking up? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Now when you came up, you saw the Custom-house officer running after you? - I stopped, and he looked at me to see whether he knew me, and then soon after this affray began.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, master Myles, from the time that you so stopped on the revenue-officers making their appearance, did you see any thing of

             that night? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you saw no more of him till he and Andrews came down to the ferry next morning, that was about five, Andrews was drunk? - He was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>He was a merry Andrew for that day in short, when Andrews was abusing the man, the prisoner said, you fool, you had better be quiet? - He did not say you fool, he said, you had better be quiet; I saw no more of the prisoner from that time till he went to Guernsey.</p>
               <p>How came it that you who was walking so innocently should find it necessary to stay a whole month at Guernsey? - Because they said I should be taken up; because they could not pitch upon any body else as an evidence; if they pitched upon me I must be an evidence.</p>
               <p>Either you must prove as an evidence or be hanged yourself? - Yes, or else leave my country; I had a letter from my wife, and she said, I was as safe at home as at Guernsey.</p>
               <p>When you came home, what was the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190151"></xptr> thing you did, did you come to Plymouth? - I came to Cawston first; I went to

               <p>Perhaps they took you up? - No.</p>
               <p>When was it you went to any body concerned for the crown? - I went to nobody, I was subpoened; I was not asked any thing about it before I was subpoened; I never told any body my story before I was subpoened, to the best of my remembrance; I think not.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mrs. Davey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She keeps the Rising Sun, in James-street? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did Kingsforth cry? - He cried very much.</p>
               <p>Did he cry out fire, thieves, or murder, or what? - He said to the rest, stop them, stop them, that was all I heard said; I cannot tell who were the persons that were beating Mr. Kingsforth; I was on the other side of the house.</p>
               <p>But from the time that you stopped when the revenue officers came, you never saw this man at all after that night? - I did not; I cannot tell how many went up James street; the officers pursued after those that turned round the corner, round the single house; some of them went up James-street immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. At the distance you stood could you distinguish whether Gray was one of them that was beating Kingsforth, upon your oath, if Gray had been beating him should not you have known him? - If I had seen him; I was not near enough to know whether Gray beat him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there light enough for you to have seen Gray if he had been there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was you near enough to know any body? - No.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Solicitor General.)</p>
               <p>I was with my father April was a twelvemonth, at Mutton Coe.</p>
               <p>What passed there? - The first thing that happened we saw the boat about half after one going over for some liquor; we expected it about two to come back with the liquor; and as we were laying wait for the liquor, as we suspected, they came with the cags on their backs; and we pursued after them, and took some cags away from them.</p>
               <p>Do you know what these cags contained? - One contained Geneva.</p>
               <p>Foreign or home? - Foreign.</p>
               <p>What number of persons might they be that you were pursuing? - I suspect them to be fourteen or fifteen; I cannot say justly.</p>
               <p>What passed when you came up with them? - I was not the first that came up with them.</p>
               <p>What did you see when you did come up with them? - I saw three cags that were saved, and the officers and I pursued after more; and my father cried out his leg was broke, and he cried for me to come to him; but two of our party went to my father's assistance before I could come; I had one cag of Geneva in my hand.</p>
               <p>What became of those cags that were so seized? - They were rescued from us all but this.</p>
               <p>What became of that one? - They took it away by force afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had these people any thing in their hands but those cags? - They had bludgeons in their hands.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to describe them? - Between two and three feet, unlawful weapons which they carry instead of fire arms.</p>
               <p>Were you present before your father cried out his leg was broke? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>What passed between your party and the smugglers? - I cannot say; I went round the house; and my father cried out; I did not see what passed.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190152"></xptr>Did you yourself taste the contents of the cask that you speak of? - I staved the cask and the liquor flew all about; I tasted it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You came up before your father had been beat, before his leg was broke? - I was up before his leg was broke.</p>

               <p>Did you see that man there at all? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney General. It is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It comes out of the man's pocket, and I am telling my Lord what it is; to be sure it cannot be read without the Attorney General was to consent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. I must complain a little, and I do complain of attempts being made that ought not to be made; the idea of desiring the Attorney General to consent: the Attorney General could not consent, and the Judge would tell the Attorney General he ought not to consent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I told the Judge what it was, and I shall do so in prosecutions for five hundred years, should I continue in practice so long, risquing all the indignations of all the Attorney Generals in the world; it was the fault of the prisoner that he took it out of his pocket, not mine.</p>
               <p>Mrs. DAVY sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the public house, called the Rising Sun, in James-street, Plymouth-dock; I did in April, 1785.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the morning of the affray between the revenue officer Mr. Kingsforth and some smugglers? - I do; and Mr. Kingsforth was hurt.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner that morning? - I do.</p>
               <p>What time did he come to your house? - As nigh as I can guess, about one in the morning.</p>
               <p>At that time when he came into your house, was there any noise or any disturbance or affray in the street? - No, Sir, not till a great while after he came in; I got up to let him in; he had been in bed a quarter of an hour before I heard the noise, then I heard the outcry of the officer.</p>
               <p>Did he go out upon that occasion to join in the affray? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of that? - I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>How long did it continue afterwards? - A great while afterwards; he sat down till day break, till my husband got up; he sat in the tap room all the while; then my husband opened the door just at gun-fire, and then the prisoner went away; he went strait down to Mr. Hutchins's, the Fortune of War, the ferry place; he must necessarily go past that house; he had a blue jacket and a round hat; I am sure he came in before the affray was, a quarter of an hour before it began.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Who came with him? - Another person, I do not know his name; that was the same man that went away with him in the morning.</p>
               <p>How came they to come to your house? - They knocked at the door; I went to the window, they said they wanted my husband; I went down to let them in; they did not tell me where they had been, nor what they came for; whether that man went over the water with him I cannot say; he went out with him; there was no disturbance at the Fortune of War that night before; they had been in some time; it was a quarter of an hour after that I heard a noise.</p>
               <p>What was the cry you heard? - I heard a great cry, and I heard murder cried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How happened your husband did not get up to let him in? - He was very much in liquor; I have known him three or four years, he is a very quiet harmless man.</p>

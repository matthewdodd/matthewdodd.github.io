                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Neale, and live at No. 44, Palmer-street, Shadwell. The prisoner lodged there with her mother and stepfather—on Friday, the 22nd of March, about a quarter past one o'clock in the afternoon, I had occasion to go into the back yard, and on opening the back door, I saw a large quantity of blood and water mixed together all about the yard—near the privy door I noticed a great quantity of blood—I then went into my room, and, on returning directly afterwards, the prisoner opened the privy door, and said, "Mrs. Neale, I have been washing some stained clothes up stairs, and I shall take and clean the yard directly"—she appeared to me all manner of colours, and very ill—she came over to the water-butt, took the pail in her hand, and put two cans of water into it—I said to her, "Julia, have you miscarried?"—she said, "No, Mrs. Neale, it * * * * "—I then went into my own room, and she went up stairs—I then went out into the yard again, went into the privy, and remarked great quantity of blood on the seat, and on the floor in front of the seat—I then called my sister and sister-in-law, And went with them into the privy with a candle—I looked down the privy, and saw the baby lying flat on its back on the top of the soil, alive—I heard it cry—the privy is very deep—my sister fetched Mrs. Fury, and she went for Mr. Cruse—I saw him come—he fetched a ladder, took off the seat of the privy and the floor, went down, and brought the baby up alive—I saw it when it was brought out—it was a female child—I heard it cry a little when Mrs. Fury brought it into my room—it was washed—(I had observed the prisoner to be very large indeed before that time)—about an hour after I went up into prisoner's room—I went to her bedside, and said, "Julia, have you got anything to put on your baby?"—she said, "No, Mrs. Neale, not a bit"—she appeared very ill indeed—Mr. Taynton saw the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Fury, and live at No. 29, Palmer-Street. I have known the prisoner by sight about seven months—I had noticed that she appeared to be very large—on the 22nd of March I was fetched by Mrs. Neale and her sister—I noticed a deal of blood by the yard door, and likewise in the yard, and I was very much alarmed—I afterwards went to the privy, looked down, and saw the child lying there—it was crying—it was a very weak, feeble cry—Mr. Cruse afterwards came, and, in my pre<lb></lb>sence, took the child out—it was a female child—I took it into Mrs. Neale's room, and washed it—it lived, I should say, about three quarters of an hour after it was brought in—I afterwards went up stairs to the prisoner, and asked her if the baby was not born at the foot of her bed—she said, "No, in the privy"—I asked her why she did not call for the assistance of some female—she said she did not like to do so, she thought the baby was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 7. Bedford—place, Commercial—road East. On Friday, the 22nd of March, a little after one o'clock, I was passing through Palmer—street—I saw a crowd, and went into this house, and into the room on the ground floor—I there saw a female infant—I found it covered with the soil of the privy—there was some on the face, about the mouth, and more particularly about the body—the umbilical cord was torn about three inches from the belly—that would not have been the case if there had been proper medical attendance when it was born—I ordered it to be put into a warm bath—I was then called away to the prisoner—I found her sitting in a chair behind the door, with a good deal of blood on the floor—I ordered her to be placed upon the bed, and removed the after burden; therefore I can speak with cer<lb></lb>tainty as to her having been recently delivered—she was then so very weak and low that I was obliged to administer brandy and water to her—the child was brought up to me there—it then appeared in the act of dying—it was crying—Mr. Ross, another surgeon, then came into the room, and attended to the child in my presence—means were taken, as far as possible, to preserve it—it died, I should say, a quarter of an hour or twenty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184405060052"></xptr>
               <p>minutes after it was brought up to me into the room—it was a full-grown child—from the evidence I heard before the Coroner, and from observations I have made, I should infer the birth had taken place in the privy, from not having seen any blood between the bed—room and the yard—if it had been born in the bedroom, and she had walked away with it to the privy, I think there would have been a track of blood—I should have expected that, and, in all probability, something would have been found in which the child had been carried from the room to the privy—I examined the child all over—I saw no violence about it—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on opening the brain, I found the vessels distended with blood; also, the substance of the brain itself—the stomach contained about half a wine-glass full of the soil of the privy—the heart and the large vessels were more than usually distended with blood—those were all the appearances I observed—I have heard the evidence to-day, and from that, and from my observation of the body, I am of opinion that death was caused by immersion in the soil: I think so, I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the soil in the stomach would be accounted for by the body falling on the soil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would, or, possibly, in getting it out, the mouth might be presented to the surface of the soil—if she had been delivered in the privy I should expect to find blood on the seat and floor—I did not see the privy—I have heard the witnesses give their account of the state of it, which would correspond with such an event having recently taken place—I have had some experience in labours—I have not found that with a first child a female has a notion that she has occasion to go to stool; that is the case in labours generally, not more especially in a first labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the immediate cause of the death of the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot positively say; I should say from the usual way in which death oc<lb></lb>curs from drowning, from the blood not being properly changed; that would be from the want of access of air to the lungs and the veinous blood circu<lb></lb>lating through the brain—the child lived for twenty minutes after I first saw it—it is frequently found that reaction does take place, and persons rally, and afterwards die, in cases of drowning, or suffocation in any way—the fulness of blood in the brain and heart are symptoms that usually accompany cases of suffocation—my opinion is that that was the cause of death, but I cannot say with any certainty that it was so.</p>

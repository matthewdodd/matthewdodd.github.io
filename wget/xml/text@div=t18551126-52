                  </hi>. I am a draper, of No. 187, Oxford-street. I have a partner—on Wednesday evening, 7th Nov., we had a gray cloth cloak hanging inside the lobby of the door on a brass wire frame—I went out of the shop about a quarter to 8 o'clock, and saw the two prisoners crouched down talking together under the window close to the cloak—the younger prisoner was touching it, and the elder was covering her—I went back into the shop, and immediately afterwards my attention was attracted by the rattling of the wire frame against the inside of the window—I went to the door, and as I was going down the shop I saw the elder prisoner pass rapidly away—I missed the cloak, and saw the younger prisoner standing close to the door—she said, "There goes the woman that has taken your cloak"—I looked in the direction she pointed but could not see her—I said to the young one, "I know you are with her;" and took her into custody—she said that there was nobody with her—she was crying—the cloak is worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the window is about a foot and a quarter from the ground—I only just saw them for a moment, and then went back into the shop—I did not know Walker before—I saw her next at Marl borough-street on the Monday week following ten days afterwards—this was on Wednesday—she was then pointed out to me as the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Scales.</hi> I was remanded for a week, and was then discharged. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She was discharged because we could not take the other prisoner. I went to the address the child gave, No. 18, Clement's-lane, Strand, and found them all living in one room, but we had not gone there during the week that the child was in custody—when we had got the woman we took the child again at another place, over in Lambeth—she was taken before Mr. Hard<lb></lb>wicke the first time, and the second time before Mr. Bingham, and without further evidence was committed.</p>

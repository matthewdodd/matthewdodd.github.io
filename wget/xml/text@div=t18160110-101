The man from behind ran at the same time with me. I called stop thief; but the man who ran with me said nothing, from which I apprehended that he was an accomplice. He overtook me, and ran a head of me; I lost sight of them at the bottom of the hill. Three days after that, the chain and seal attached to it were brought to me by a young man.

            . I was at Mr. Nettleship's, the publican, on the 2nd of January, between eleven and one in the day; during the time I was there, the prisoner came in, and offered a gold chain and seal for sale; there might be from eight to a dozen persons in the tap-room, and each of them took it into their hands; some of them said they did not think it was gold. He said, he would go with any one to any jeweller's shop to enquire whether it was gold or not. I immediately said, I would go with him myself; I went with him; we went to Mr.Ballautyne's; we asked him was it gold, and he said it was. I went back with the prisoner to the place we came from, and he asked sixteen shillings for them. After speaking a few words, he said he had bought them of a sailor for twelve shillings about five or ten minutes before. He said if I had a mind to buy them, I should have them for thirteen shillings, and a glass of something to drink. I bought them, and in consequence of something I heard, I went to Mr. Vesale on Thursday morning, with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. He said he merely wanted to turn a shilling.</p>

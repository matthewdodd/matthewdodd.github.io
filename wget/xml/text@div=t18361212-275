                  </hi>. I am the niece of Thomas Wilson—he keeps the Hand and Shears, in King-street, Cloth-fair. On the 24th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and another young man came to the bar—they had two glasses of gin and spruce, which the prisoner asked for—the price was threepence—he offered me a half-sove<lb></lb>reign—I took it into the parlour to my aunt, and brought out two half-crowns and the rest in small change—I laid down the money on the end of the coun<lb></lb>ter, and I saw the prisoner take up one half-crown and put it into his pocket,</p>

               <p>and put a bad one in its place; I saw it was bad—as soon as he laid it on the counter the other man said to the prisoner, "I have got half-pence, enough to pay for it"—the prisoner said, "Perhaps you will oblige me by giving me the half-sovereign, and taking the change"—I said I would if he would give me the good half-crown—he said he had not changed it—he began saying he had not got it—I went round the counter to prevent his going out, and the officer was sent for—I am sure that half-crown did not come from me—I watched the particular half-crown—I took it off the counter, and kept it in my hand till I marked it, and gave it to the officer.</p>

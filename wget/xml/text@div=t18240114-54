            , of Cranbourne-street. On the 29th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a pelisse; she selected one, which came to 36 s. She was some time looking it out, and after choosing one, tendered me a 5 l. note. I asked her how she came by it, as I thought it strange, from her appearance, that I should take a 5 l. note of her. She said a gentleman had given it to her. I asked her whether she was certain of it, and if she could swear that a gentleman gave it her - she said a gentleman in Holborn gave it to her. I then took it, and went down from the shew-room into the shop, and gave the note to Mr. Smith. He went over to Mr. Perkins, a linen-draper, with it - returned and told me something, and gave her 3 l. 4 s. in change. I asked her where she lived, and what was her name - she said,</p>

I did not mark it before I gave it to Smith. I told an officer about it; and, on the 5th of December, Herring and I went to No. 6, Hartshorn-court, Golden-lane, and she was coming out at the door. Herring said,</p>
               <p>"Is that Maria?" She said,</p>
               <p>"Yes; but you have the advantage of me." He took her back, and, I believe, asked if she knew me - she said No, at first, but afterwards said she perfectly well recollected giving me a 5 l. note - nothing had been said about a 5 l. note before. She said she had asked me to come and see her, and that I did, according to my promise. I had not been to see her, nor had I been to her lodging before.</p>

On a Saturday night, in November, I think, on the 19th, but it is on the back of the note, the prisoner came, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, for a bushel of coals, a quarter of a hundred weight of potatoes, four bundles of wood, and a bunch of greens, which came to 4 s. She gave me a 5 l. note. I said I did not think I could change it. She said, could I get change - I said I would try, and went to Kelly, my next door neighbour, and got it; but before that I asked her name - she said her name was Brown. When she ordered the coals, she said they were to go to No. 2, Spring-street. My husband asked if it was Upper or Lower - she said, Lower. I went to Kelly's and got change. Mrs. Kelly wrote the name and address on the note in my presence. She ordered the things to be sent in a quarter of an hour - my husband took them, and brought them back again.</p>

In the way to the office, she had hold of my arm, and asked me several times what she was taken up for. I did not answer her, and just as I came through Smithfield, she asked me again. I asked if she had had any 5 l. notes lately - she replied,</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I passed a 5 l. note for a pelisse, in Cranbourne-alley, to that man," pointing to Sampson, and said she gave 36 s. for it, and had invited Sampson to come and see her. I asked how she came by the note; she said, if she must tell the truth, she had picked up a gentleman in Holborn, who was very much in liquor, and had robbed him of it, and she had no doubt, if that was bad, all the notes were bad, that the gentleman had a large roll of notes, and she took one out of the middle of it. When she got to the office she stated the same to the Magistrates. She was charged, at the second examination, with uttering a note to Pite; what she said was not taken down; she denied all knowledge of it, and said she never had a 5 l. note in her possession in her life, but the one she passed in Cranbourne-street, and denied having been at Pites, or that they had ever seen her there in their lives.

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes, and have been so for upwards of twenty-five years (examining the notes): that uttered to Pite is forged in every respect, and is signed</p>

               <p>"T. Holland," there is a clerk of his name, who signed 1 l. and 2 l. notes, but no others; it is not his writing; that uttered to Clark is also forged in every respect, and is from the same plate, and is signed</p>
               <p>"W. R. West," he is a signer of 5 l. notes, but it is not his signature. They have no water mark.</p>

               <p>W. R. WEST. I sign 5 l. notes occasionally, the one produced is not signed by me. I was not at the Bank on the 20th of August, 1821, when it is dated.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I own giving Sampson a note, not knowing it to be bad; but as to these two young women, they have sworn false. I never was in their shop, and never saw them till they came to the office.</p>

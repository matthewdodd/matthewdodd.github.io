                  </hi>. I am a ship-chandler, and live at Rotherhithe. I have known the prisoner two or three years—he was a ship's-carpenter when I first knew him—he was without a ship sometimes, was recommended to me, and was in my employ—he has brought me advance notes to be cashed—on the 23rd of Dec. he brought me two notes, an advance-note and a monthly note—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Advance note. London, Dec. 23, 1843. £10. Sir, Three days after the steam-boat <hi rend="italic">Argonaut</hi> has sailed from Plymouth, please to pay to William Hart man, or bearer hereof, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, provided the said William Hartman has sailed in the said steam-ship, being part of his wages in ad<lb></lb>vance for an intended voyage to Odessa, as per agreement with your obe<lb></lb>dient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">APERSTED</hi>, Master. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS FARMER</hi>. To be paid, No. 18, Sidney-place, Commercial-road East." Endorsed, "J. W. HARTMAN."—"Dec. 23, 1843, London. £5 per month. One month after date, please to pay to William Hartman, or bearer hereof, the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, in part of bit wages as carpenter on board the Argonaut steam-boat, now bound on a voyage to Odessa. Payable for three months, and continue the payment of the said sum monthly until the completion of the aforesaid voyage, unless the contrary shall appear. <hi rend="smallCaps">APERSTED</hi>, Master." Witness. He stated he was engaged in the capacity of ship's carpenter by Captain Farmer; that it was a steam vessel going to Odessa, and had been purchased by the Russian Government—he said he bad been two voyages before with Captain Farmer—he asked me to advance 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on the notes—I advanced him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; advance-note—he was in my debt for various things—he left the monthly note also with me—he requested me to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per month to maintain his two children—I was to receive the money on his account, and pay over 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; per month to his children, and the balance was to be settled when he came home—I saw him write his name on the notes at the time I advanced him the money—he put" <hi rend="largeCaps">J. W</hi>. Hartman," and I called to his attention that in the body of the note it was "William Hartman"—he said John William Hartman was his right name, and that was always the way he signed it—he said he met with Captain Farmer at his house, or counting-house, in White Hart-court—I went there in the course of the week, and found that he was not engaged in any such ship, nor was any such ship going out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He did not give me any money on the note; he gave it me on some goods which I had at the East India Dock, and here is bis handwriting to prove it—(<hi rend="italic">producing a paper</hi>)—he went with me to Black wall to see them, and paid the expenses. I told the person to let him have the goods, and he took me home and gave me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them. Witness. This is my handwriting—I did not advance him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the goods—the paper is, "Please deliver to Mr. George Bainbridge, or bearer, all the things belonging to me, landed from the----, by paying the charges. <hi rend="smallCaps">J.

               <p>me to take care of those goods for him till his return—there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; charged on them, which he had not the means of paying—it had nothing whatever to do with my advance, indeed I never had the paper in my pos<lb></lb>session—he took it with him—it was on the faith of the notes that I advanced the money—I never got the goods into my possession, nor ever saw them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I came from Rotterdam the Sunday before Christmas; on the Friday before Christmas I went to the East India Dock, to see if I could get a ship; I met a mate, who was a Russian, who asked if I was going out to Russia again; I said if I could get a chance; he said there was a steamer in the dock which was bought by the Russian government, and Captain Farmer was going to take her out; he said if I came on Saturday I should go as carpenter; I went, and saw a gentleman on board, who said he was the captain, and he gave me the two notes; I took them to Mr. Bain-bridge; he would give me no money on them till he had seen Captain Farmer, and he gave me the money on my goods; I have never seen them since; when I came to see about it, I found I had been made a fool of, that there was no such Captain Farmer; I have cashed about fifty notes with Mr. Bainbridge, and he charged me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, and three parts in clothes; if he did not fetch the goods it was his own fault; I gave him charge of them, and he said he would take them for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and settle when I came home; there were more than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper skuttles, shawls, and other things; I have not returned the money to him yet; he was never at home when I called, and I was taken afterwards; Mr. Bainbridge did not see the goods; he saw the sacks they were in; there was a looking-glass among them, which was covered over; he told the lady there the goods belonged to him, and I said, "If that gentleman comes, the goods are for him;" there was a gentleman in the office at the time.</p>

I am a clerk to the Lords of the Com<lb></lb>mittee of the Council on Education—I produce a letter, dated 8th Septem<lb></lb>ber, 1858, from the Education Department of the Privy Council—it purports to be signed by Joseph Wood, Incumbent of Clayton-le-Moors, and is directed to the Secretary of the Committee of Council on Education—it appears to have come by post—there was a very lengthy correspondence between our office and Mr. Wood, and I know from that correspondence that that is the handwriting of Mr. Wood—I never saw him write; we have written to him and have got letters in return, and they are all in the same handwriting; <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Taylor, Justice of the Peace, W. F. Calvert, Thomas Calvert, A. Heywood, Joseph Beck, Arthur Appleby—he is Mr. Appleby's son, and is in the corn business—he was not a trustee—I know Benjamin Har<lb></lb>greaves and John Mercer, Justice of the Peace—he is a man of good posi<lb></lb>tion, a highly respectable man—he would not say the prisoner had a good character if he did not think so—I know Robert Clayton Mercer, Thomas Townshend, Robert Clayton, John Cronsdale Kenyon, Owen Spencer Kenyon, Mark Johnson, Matthew Green, Richard Ellison, William Monk, James Smith, and Abraham Derswell—I know them to be highly respect<lb></lb>able men—I know R.

                  </hi>. I am now a member of the firm of Bolton &amp; Co., Victoria Mill, Blackburn—in the month of June, 1859, I was one of the cashiers at the Blackburn Old Bank—I know the prisoner—I don't think he had an account at the bank at that time—I have here a bill for 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the Paymaster-General, which was placed in the Suspense Account, at the bank, in the name of Wood, on 27th June, 1859—on the 29th September, 1859, I cashed this cheque for 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which bears the signature "Joseph Wood"—I paid it in ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, ten 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and remainder in sovereigns—that appears on the cheque, in my handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't tell whether he had any account there before or not—I can't say that he was the man who came and got the money—I should not be authorised to pay it to anyone except the drawer, or someone authorised by him.</p>

               <p>I was coming to London, on Saturday morning, a little before eight, and by Jewry-street I saw the prisoner, I was coming to town with my master's cart and horse, and the prisoner was coming along, he was walking along with Mr. Belch's cart and horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know Mr. Belch's cart and horse? - Yes, he was on the wrong side of the way, and he gave the rein a bit of a touch, to let me come on the right side of the way.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Mr. Belch a neighbour of yours? - He is of the same business, I have no doubt of the horse and cart, I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>If he did see me with it, why did not he stop me with it? - They lend it to retail poulterers some times, to carry home goods in, I thought that might be the case.</p>

               <p>I was going to my work, and I saw a man standing by a flat, at a place called Hand Alley, Gravel Lane, in about twelve yards, I saw the prisoner put an apron, with some geese in it, and one dropped out, it was another man that stood by the flat, and the prisoner was within twelve yards; I went past to see if I could get any help to attack them both.</p>
               <p>Court. What made you think of attacking them both? - I am constable there, I thought it was not a proper place, as there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260088"></xptr> is no poulterer near, I came back again, I looked in the hamper, there was nothing but straw, then they were both gone; I met the prisoner, I took him and shewed him the flat, I suspected they were stolen, I took him and the flat to the compter; my Lord Mayor said it should be advertised on the Monday: I left word at some of the poulterers, and Mr. Belch heard of it.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Belch deposes to the flat having I. B. on it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Why if that is visible it need not have been advertised? - There is I. B. on it, there were sixteen fat geese in it, my son brought me my cart and horse, he found it in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I was at an acquaintance's house from seven to eight, I was coming down Half-moon-alley, and one of these gentlemen met me and stopped me, he said I had ducks, I had a brown coat and a brown apron on.</p>
               <p>Court to Horne. Which way was you coming to town? - Up towards Leaden-hall-market from Mile-end, I saw him by Jewry-street.</p>
               <p>Is that the way from Lime-street to Gravel-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you met the cart, was that flat in the cart? - Yes.</p>

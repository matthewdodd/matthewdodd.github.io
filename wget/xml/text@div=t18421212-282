                  </hi>. I have been out of business since I came from Scotland, which was at the end of June last—I am now living in Bridge-road, Lambeth—I lived for some time with my cousin, William Heron, in Brunswick-street, Dover-road, In July I received 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was a subject of conversation at my cousin's—I first saw the prisoner there on the 29th of July—at that time I intended going out to Texas—I had a long conversation with the prisoner about that, and told him that I intended to go there—he told me that he knew a great deal about the country; that he could have been appointed Consul to it some years ago, but he was acquainted with the consul—he said if I would call on him he would give me a great deal of information about it, and would introduce me to the Texan Consul—he gave me his card of ad<lb></lb>dress, and I called upon him on the Monday afterwards, at an office in Broad-street—that was in pursuance of the address on the card—we talked abort Texas again—he said he would take me to the Texan Consul's, in Fen-church-street; but when we got there, I found it was a land-agent's office—I went with him. to some wise merchants' and other houses of business, that he said he had to call upon—as we were walking along, he said he had come from Leith in May last, with the intention of emigrating to Melbourne, Port Philip, and that he had been making arrangements with a number of mer<lb></lb>chants, friends that he had here, and other parties, to go there—he spoke to me about a Mr. James Smith, who, he said, was going to be his partner, but that he had been putting off and delaying his time for three weeks, and he offered that I should stand in Smith's place, and be his partner—(I know</p>

               <p>Smith, he is not a friend of my cousin's, but I have teen him there)—he said he had got letters from Lord Stanley, giving him the appointment of Government Emigration Agent at Melbourne, Port Philip, with a salary of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and if I accepted his proposal of partnership, and advanced him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a bonus, I should have a third share with him of the emigration agentship, and of the other business which he would have in that colony—I said I would speak to my friends on the subject—he said, if I entertained the proposal, I was not to consult with any one, and that I was quite competent to judge of it for myself—and then he specifically said that I was not to consult with my cousin or Mr. William Smith—I said I should wish to write to Scotland, to consult some of my friends there—he said he had already lost too much time with Mr. Smith; that he had several valuable consignments depending on his going off shortly, and that therefore he could not allow me to write to Scot<lb></lb>land, as I must give him my answer is two days—I then said that I would think of it, and would see him, at any rate, at the end of the two days—he then took me down to his lodging, in the Mile End-road, and read me several letters from the Hon. Mr. Murray, Queen's Consul at Melbourne, with whom he said he was very intimate, and who wished him to enter into partnership with him there—I staid at his lodging till about eight o'clock—I was there for about three or four hours—I had a little wine—I was to see him again in two days, and give him my answer—on the 4th of August I called at the office in Broad-street, and saw him—it is Mr. M'Queen's office—the prisoner used to get his letters left there, as Mr. M'Queen was in Scotland, and the prisoner had the use of hit room—I told him that I had been too unwell to give his pro<lb></lb>posal due consideration, and therefore I could not decide yet—he said it would be folly for roe to think of going anywhere else than to Melbourne, where I had such good prospects before me; that he had this appointment from Lord Stanley, of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and that I, having one-third a-year, should have my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. repaid in the first year, besides the profits of the business—he said I must either decide then or give it up altogether; and on this assurance I accepted it.</p>

Overton and Hughes that night, to get it en<lb></lb>grossed, as he must have the business settled immediately, and he took it away with him—on the morning of the 9th, a messenger came to me, and in</p>

               <p>consequence of what he said, I went to Broad-street, where I was to meet the prisoner—he was not there—I was to go on to the attorneys, Messrs. Overton and Hughes, No. 25, Old Jewry, and I found him there—also Mr. Hughes and Mr. Ramsay, a wine-broker, who was the messenger the prisoner had sent to me—Mr. Hughes read over to me the deed produced—the prisoner stated that I objected to that part which I have mentioned—I should have objected, but he stated it for me—Mr. Hughes asked him if he had made any consignments to Melbourne—he said he had, and he said it was all right then—the prisoner and I then signed it—Mr. Hughes asked if I had given the money to Mr. Adamson—I said, no—he said I should have done so—I had not got it with me—I said I did not understand that I was to pay it that day—I then walked out with the prisoner, and we went on to the London and Westminster Bank, in Threadneedle-street—I asked the prisoner why we were going there, and he said, to have my money, the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him my money was not there, it was at the Bloomsbury Branch—that was my 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had got out of Chancery—my deposit receipt for that money was at my lodging—the prisoner said as he had given a receipt for it, he must have the money paid now—I said I was not aware the money was to have been paid that day, that I was too ill to go there about it—he. then hired a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we drove first to my lodging, and got the receipt, and then to the Bloomsbury Branch, and drew out my 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we then went to the London and Westminster Bank, in Threadneedle-street, where the money was paid in—I gave the prisoner a bank-note for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid it into the London and Westminster Bank—he had no account there, but he opened an account with that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw him pay the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I gave him into the London and West<lb></lb>minster Bank—I also opened a separate account with my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I gave him I had got from the Bloomsbury Branch—I accepted it at a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and paid it to him as such.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you have paid him that bank-note unless you had believed that he had got this appointment from Lord Stanley, of Government Emigration Agent, at Port Philip, and that it was worth 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should not—I then went to the London Docks with the prisoner to look at some wines which he said he intended purchasing—I was not very well, and went home—he said he would call on me in two days at my lodging, and show me his letters of appointment—he did not call on me, and I wrote to him—I did not see him again Until the 24th, when I called at Mr. M'Queen's office, is Broad-street, where his letters were addressed—I took down two letters which I found there, addressed to him—one was from Lord Stanley—it was marked "Stanley" in the corner—I called at his lodging, and gave those letters to him—I asked why he had never called—he said he had been much engaged in his own private business—I asked if he had done anything in our business, and he had done nothing—I asked what was in this letter from Lord Stanley—he said there seemed to be a mistake in it, as Lord Stanley stated then that there was no vacancy, but he knew there was a vacancy, and that he should yet get the situation—that was the first time I beard that he had not got it—nothing more transpired about the matter on that occasion—my sus<lb></lb>picions were aroused by his telling me there was no vacancy, and I commu<lb></lb>nicated to my cousin, William Heron, what had happened—I called on the prisoner again on the 31st of Aug.—I told him I had received such informa<lb></lb>tion as led me to believe I had been deceived, and I wished from him to know the truth of it—he said that anything that had been said against him was false, that he had left Scotland, and paid all his debts, and every thing else—he said at that time that he had no appointment—I said I had been led into this by his stating to me that he had the appointment, and that he was</p>

               <p>to leave in three weeks, and now that I saw he had no prospect of leaving at all, I wished my money back, as he had neither consignments, or done any<lb></lb>thing—he stated to me that he had no consignments, and that he had no ap<lb></lb>pointment, that he was only going about it then, making a plea that I had been ill—he would not return me my money—he subsequently offered to give me a bill of 1002. at six months, and have the agreement cancelled—I was in communication with my friends at that time, and declined.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner's representation to you this, that he had obtained letters from Lord Stanley, the Colonial Secretary, to the Governor of Port Philip, to give him the appointment of emigration agent there, a situation of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the expression I used before Mr. Alderman Gibbs was, "Securing him a situation as emigration agent for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—the first statement he made was at my cousin's, where he stated that he had an appointment from Lord Stanley—it was on the 24th that he told me he had got letters from Lord Stanley to the governor to give him the situation—that was not the statement he made to me at first—he said that he had letters of appointment, not that he had letters from Lord Stanley, directing or request<lb></lb>ing the governor to give him the appointment—I have never made any state<lb></lb>ment different from that which I am now making—during my walk with him, after he had been at my cousin's, he told me that he had been a wine-mer<lb></lb>chant and agent at Leith, and Government emigration agent to the Australian colonies—that was before I parted with my money—I do not know that he has been an agent for the Australian colonies, except from his own words—I have not inquired at Leith as to bow that is—I have not sent to make any inquiries about his being an emigration agent—I sent to make inquiries about the way he left Leith, about his taking some money from there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on the same occasion of his telling you that he had been Govern<lb></lb>ment emigration agent for the Australian colonies, at Leith, did he not tell you that he had got letters from Lord Stanley to the Governor of Port Philip to appoint him emigration agent there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he had letters front Lord Stanley appointing him emigration agent there; letters of appointment to the Governor of Port Philip, not letters to appoint him; the appointment is made here—he said that the letters appointed him to the situation; that he had the appointment; that they were letters which gave him the appointment, not to appoint him—I will swear that he represented to me that he had the appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not tell you that he considered it quite as good as an appoint<lb></lb>ment, and that it was the same thing as an appointment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he said that on the 24th, when he said there was no vacancy, he said the letters were as good as an appointment—I called with him at three or four wine-merchants', and different places—he appeared to be known there—he did not tell me that the appointment was in the gift of the governor—he told me that he was appointed here, that he had letters of appointment addressed to the governor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The present emigration agent at Port Philip has a salary of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I do not know his name—there is no vacancy—no vacancy has been reported to the Colonial Secretary since Lord Stanley has been in office—I have the letter of Mr. Forbes inclosing the prisoner's letter—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was dated the 15th of August,</hi> 1842, <hi rend="italic">to Col. Wilbraham, recommending the prisoner as a fit person for emigration agent at Port Philip, having formerly filled a similar situation at Leith with credit</hi>)—a letter was written from the office to the prisoner, in answer to Mr. Forbes's application, and forwarded to him on the 22nd of August.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How do you know it was forwarded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was entered in our books—I did not put the letter into the post, nor did I direct the letter—this is the copy—(<hi rend="italic">This was from Col. Wilbraham, dated the 22nd of August,</hi> 1842, <hi rend="italic">informing the prisoner that no official intimation had been received of any vacancy, and that there were several candidates for such appointments upon Lord Stanley's list.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has there been any other correspondence or commu<lb></lb>nication with the prisoner on the subject of that situation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD STANLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May I ask whether the pri<lb></lb>soner's name is inserted in your list of candidates? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conclude, of course, that it is, but that list is kept by my private secretary—upon an application being made, he notes it, and the person by whom it is made; and when the office is vacant I look through the list of candidates, and select accordingly—I conclude that no other person besides Sir George Clerk and Mr. Forbes applied on the prisoner's behalf—as the letters are put together, and there are no more forthcoming.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's cousin, and am a commercial agent, living in Branston-street, Commercial-road. On the 26th of July I was at the house of Mr. William Smith, in the Minories, and was then intro<lb></lb>duced to the prisoner for the first time—nothing particular occurred on that occasion—I saw him again, on the 29th, at my own house—my cousin was</p>

               <p>there part of the time—I introduced the prisoner to him—on that occasion the prisoner stated the whole of his prospects, and among others, that he had the appointment of emigration agent at Port Phillip secured to him by letters from Lord Stanley, and that he was about to join in partnership with Mr. James Smith—my cousin spoke of his intention of going to Texas—the prisoner offered his services to give him all the information regarding Texas—my cousin mentioned his having just received 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I mentioned it—that was all that transpired then—on the 31st of August my cousin communicated to me what he had done.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 202). On Sunday evening, 28th November, about twenty minutes past 7, I was on duty in the Hackney-road, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner with a bundle on his back—I asked him what he had there—he said that the things belonged to him—I asked him to show them to me—he said that he would do nothing of the kind, but if I would take him to the station he would give me satisfaction—I told him that there was no occasion to go there if he would tell me or show me what the goods were—he said that he would not, and walked with me some way to the station; he then dropped the bundle and ran off—I went after him, but could not catch him—I saw him on the Tuesday week afterwards at Worship-street police-court, and identified him—I picked up the bundle; it contained two sheets, three counterpanes, one jacket, two bonnets, and one cape—Mrs. Bowers saw them at the station about a quarter of an hour after I had stopped the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Bowers, of 11, Counter-street, Hackney-road. On Sunday, 28th November, I was at tea in the back-room on the ground floor with my husband and family—I had left the front room about twenty minutes or a quarter to 6; the window was then shut, but not fastened—I returned at twenty minutes after 7, and found the window open and the curtains torn down—I missed from the bed the articles which the policeman has shown me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I was at the station the policeman said to the inspector, "Is he anything like the lad that got away from the constable?"—the inspector said, "No, he is not stout enough"—he is not here—I do not know whether Reed was present, but afterwards he came and looked at me, and winked his eye to another policeman.</p>

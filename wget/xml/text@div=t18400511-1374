                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Foster. On the night of the 23rd of April, about one o'clock, I was in Swan-street, Bethnal-green—I had this shawl on my back, which I had borrowed of Daniel Collins—I had been in search of my husband, and was returning home—the prisoner came behind me, and snatched the shawl off my shoulder, and ran down Swan-court—I ran after him, and scuffled with him for about two minutes—he then got from me, and ran up Swan-street, and on to Slater-street, where he was taken by the officer—the officer brought me the shawl the next morning—I know it is the same—I never lost sight of him.</p>

I was on duty in Brick-lane, and heard a woman cry "Police"—I ran up Slater-street, and met the prisoner running—I crossed the road to him, and he said, "There is a woman accuses me of stealing a shawl, and I was going for a policeman to satisfy her that it is not me"—MRS. Foster was running up, and some per<lb></lb>sons</p>

She then cried out Murder! in the room - she had locked the room door, and in a few minutes the other prisoners forced the door open; as soon as Howard got into the room, he struck me a blow on my mouth, which loosened one of my teeth. I fell on my knees from the blow, and Miller struck me on the head - I fell, it cut my hat. Howard put one of his hands into my breeches pocket, then Miller and

I ran up with the watchman, and gave them all in charge; they took a handkerchief from my neck and one from my pocket - they took them by force - I am sure it was all the prisoners; Smith and Campbell were more active than the woman who took me in.</p>

On the 14th of November, about one o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Chandos-street, St. Martin's-lane, and heard a rattle spring at the corner of Vine-street. I went into Vine-street. I heard the cry of Murder! I got close to the door, and called to them to open it; there was no answer. I forced it open and got inside. The prosecutor came up with his lip cut, and said he had been struck, knocked down, and robbed of some money and his handkerchief off his neck and another handkerchief. I asked him where they were? he said they were gone up stairs. We put a watchman at the door. I went up stairs with the prosecutor and another watchman, and found all the prisoners up stairs in the two pair of stairs room, except Barker, who was at the top of the stairs. The prosecutor pointed the two men out, and said the women had assisted in robbing him. He said Howard first struck him, and Miller next.</p>

               <p>MILLER'S Defence. I lodged at this house. On Saturday night, the 13th of October, I received my wages, and was with my companions till near twelve o'clock; I got intoxicated, went home, and went to bed that instant - I never saw the prosecutor. I was roused out of my bed by hearing the noise. I never saw the other man till I got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>HOWARD'S Defence. I had received 25 s., and had a pint of beer. About a quarter after twelve o'clock I heard the cry down the street, and went into the house to see what was the matter. Some women were quarrelling on the stairs, covered with water - I told them not to pull each other about. While I was talking to them. the prosecutor came up with the watchman and gave us in charge - he gave the girls in charge for being disorderly.</p>
               <p>BARKER'S Defence. I was with some young women till half-past twelve o'clock at night up stairs. I live at No. 3; this is No. 5. Smith had been quarrelling with Campbell, and said she would have her spite of her. She forced the door open and struck her on the breast, and called watch. The watchman came up, and sent for the prosecutor, who said the men had robbed him of 18 s. and a handkerchief. He went to the watch-house and charged the men only with the robbery. No others<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010053"></xptr>were mentioned, for he said he had been in company with Platt. On Monday he told the Magistrate I took him into the house.</p>
               <p>CAMPBELL'S Defence. I never saw the prosecutor there till he came into the room with the watchman.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I was going along Vine-street for a pot of beer; the man called after me. I said I was going for some beer. He followed me into the public-house, and drank the beer. I went to the door with him; he offered me 2 s. I said that was not sufficient. He said he had no more. He went into the parlour, and asked me to stop with him a few minutes for 2 s. 6 d., which I agreed to. I left him in a few minutes. I never saw him again till he came up with the watchman about an hour after. The watchman seeing me in a row said,</p>
               <p>"Go and fetch the baker; I dare say these are the men who have robbed him." We were taken to the watch-house. The constable of the night said,</p>
               <p>"Let the women go;" the watchman said,</p>
               <p>"No, I give them in charge for making a noise in the house." heard nothing about a handkerchief. It is an open house.</p>

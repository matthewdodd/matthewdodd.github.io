I have a room over the stable, which has occasionally been occupied by myself and my servant. I keep my horse in the stable. I had let part of the house; but kept the stable in my own possession, and the room over it, and had a bed there, and slept there at times. I left town some time in June, intending to return, and use the room as usual. I returned the latter end of June or July - I had left Powell, my house-keeper, in care of the room, to sleep there or in the house, which she liked. I had a bureau in the room, in which I left my gold watch and chain, and another gold chain separated from the watch, a gold and pearl brooch, a musical snuff-box, a silver snuff-box, a silver tea-pot, and considerable other property. When I came to town, I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had seen them safe five or six days before I left town. I was absent a fortnight. The bureau was locked. In consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner in Broad-street, on the 7th or 8th of July. I saw him searched. The constable shewed me two duplicates, which I returned him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are the stables immediately behind the house - A. Yes, and connected with it, and in the same parish. The gold watch cost twenty-eight guineas.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dry, a pawnbroker, in St. Martin's-lane. On the 21st of June, the prisoner pawned a musical snuff-box, for 1 l. - I am certain of him. Next day he pawned a gold watch, with chain, seal, and key, for 14 l.; he said he brought them from Captain Boyce, 12, Edgware-road. Turner came to redeem the gold watch about a week after. On the 3d of July, a brooch was pawned for 12 s., by a young man, who said he came from Turner. (A duplicate found on the prisoner for a brooch, was here produced). This was what I gave the person - it is in my hand writing.</p>

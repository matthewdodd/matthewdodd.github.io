With that I went up to the Red House, and there I saw that gentleman (Essex). I showed him the watch. He said 'I've not got the money.' He took me to see his wife. She asked me what I wanted for it, and asked me how I came by it. I told her what I have told you, that I found it. She said she did not care about buying it, for she did not believe I had come by it honestly. I told her I had found it down there, and she said she had not got the money.

                  </hi>. I am carman at, 5, Great Trinity-lane—I lodge with my father in King's-head-yard—I know the prisoner and his wife—I believe the prisoner is a seaman, in the habit of occasionally leaving home—his wife lived at 31, Barnham-street, about half-a-mile from King's<lb></lb>head-yard—I had been lodging at the prisoner's house for about six months—I was not lodging there at the time this transaction occurred; I had left about a fortnight, and had gone to live with my father—on Friday night, 3d June, soon after 12, I saw the prisoner's wife standing at her door—I went into the house, and remained there about half-an-hour—I did not go to bed with her—I was in the top part of the house—she was not with me—I did not hear the prisoner come home; when I first heard him he was coming up-stairs; he was having some words with his wife—I heard him threatening her—when he came up stairs I took up my trousers and went into the other room to put them on—I did not think he would come into the room where the bed was—he saw me, and said, "You b——wretch, you have been keeping company with my wife while I have been at sea"; I said I had not—he went down stairs, and I followed him directly; he went into the parlour to his wife, got hold of the poker, and said, "Where is he?</p>

               <p>I will knock his head off"—he came out with the poker, and I went out at the street door, and away I came to my own place, and went to bed—the prisoner's wife did not come after me—I was disturbed about twenty minutes past 8 in the morning, and I found the prisoner standing there and two or three more—after he had shot me I was stunned and bleeding from the left ear—the prisoner said, "George, don't you think you deserve all you got? and if you survive this you shall have another."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Roberts, of King's Head-yard—we live in the same house with George Knight and his father—on a Satur<lb></lb>day morning, early in last month, the prisoner came to the house at twenty minutes or half-past 8, while my husband and I were sitting at breakfast—he entered the room, and exclaimed, "Is Mr. Knight within?"I said, "No, sir, he is not, he has gone out" He said, "I mean Mr. Knight" I said, "Do you mean young Mr. Knight?"that called my attention to him, and I saw that it was Mr. Hubbard, who George had formerly lived with. I denied his being at home—he said, "His younger brother has just told me that he is at home". I said, "Wait a minute, I will go and see if he is in bed" I went up, and saw George Knight lying in bed—the prisoner followed me, and exclaimed, "Is that him?"I said, "I do not know, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186407110082"></xptr>
               <p>think it is" He rushed in, seized the bedclothes, took a pistol from his side, held it up, and said, "Now I am going to be hung". I said, "Ob George, pray for your soul! Pray don't!"The prisoner instantly put the pistol in a slanting direction, pulled the trigger, and fired it—George Knight's face was partly naked, and partly covered over with the clothes—the pistol was pointed at his head I anticipate—I do not think the muzzle of the pistol was more than the length of a person's hand from his head—I left the room immediately, threw the window open, and gave the alarm of "murder"—I saw blood from the left side of Knight's head, both before and after I left the room—I found two bullets in the pillow, one in the floor, and eight shots when I cleaned the room.</p>

On 4th June I was called at half-past 8 in the morning, and the prisoner was given into my custody—the prosecutor was lying in bed bleeding from the left ear—the prisoner gave me this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has a rifled barrel. I told him the charge as the prosecutor lay in bed, and he said, "George, if you survive this, I will serve you the same again". I found this slug in the pillow, and some small shot; the sheet and the bed and bedclothes were riddled by the shot; I also found a mark in the pillow where the slug had been—I found on the prisoner three bullets, some powder, two percussion caps, and a small piece of iron, supposed to be used as a ramrod—the bullets found on him will go into the pistol very easily, but the one found by Mrs. Roberts will not—this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was undone by the magistrate—I have compared it with a piece shown me by Mrs. Roberts, and they correspond.</p>

I am a surgeon of 3, Trinity-square—on 4th June, I was called to the King's Head, and found George Knight standing in the room partly dressed and bleeding from the left ear; there were three distinct wounds, one in the cartilage which was very slight, two appeared to be made with small shot, and one with a larger missile, it was an abrasure of a a quarter of an inch in extent; the others were clear cuts, and did not go through the ear—the marks were such as might be caused by shot discharged from a pistol—if any of them had penetrated the skull, I should say they must have proved fatal.</p>

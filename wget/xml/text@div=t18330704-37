             - they are no relations of mine whatever; I knew the prisoner before - I saw the prisoner first on this evening in the Lower-road, Islington, before I got to Newington; I was in company with the ladies at that time - he did not speak to us the first time I saw him; I saw him afterwards in the road near the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040049"></xptr>Ball's-pond-road - he was then standing at the bottom of Green-man's-passage - he walked towards me and the ladies - we were on the left-hand side of the road; he kept on the right-hand side - we kept walking on the left side and he on the opposite; he walked up till he got, I should think, rather behind us - he then ran across the road towards us, and he struck Miss Harriet Clark (who was walking on my right-hand side) a blow - I turned round to look at him, and felt Miss Clark pressed close against my side, I then saw something bright flash in the air, and I saw the prisoner with his arms extended striking at Miss Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw something flash in the air, had any one hold of that bright thing? A. The prisoner; and when I saw him striking Miss Clark, I rushed at him (I saw him striking her, I then rushed at him), and don't know whether I struck him or laid hold of his collar.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you struck him, or laid hold of his collar, had he desisted his attack upon Miss Clark? A. I cannot say, for I laid hold of him directly - I got between the two ladies; he had a knife in his hand then - it was a large dinner knife - I cannot say that he struck Miss Clark with the knife - I saw him striking at her, but don't know whether he struck her with the knife or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing when you flew upon him, and took him by the collar, or struck him? A. I think he was standing close to her; we were all close together - I flew at him from seeing him strike Miss Clark; while I had hold of his collar he struck me twice on the head with this knife - I did not see whether there was any blood on Miss Clark at that time; I had seen something bright in his hand before, which I now conjecture to have been a knife - he had not said a word to Miss Clark - he struck me on the forehead with the knife - it was done with the open blade of the knife - it went through my hat into my head (producing the hat) - it cut my forehead - it went into the skull I believe; I was attended by a surgeon - the first blow cut my hat through, and he repeated the blow, and struck me nearly on the same place, and the knife broke at the second blow, that blow also cut my hat, both blows took effect on my forehead, that blow also cut through the flesh, and the knife broke, and part of it he kept in his hand, and part flew on the pavement; I had my hand on the prisoner's collar at this time - the blows confused me - I cannot say whether I had hold of him or not - I was attempting to lay hold of him; the remainder of the broken knife continued in the prisoner's hand; we were both struggling very violently, and he attempted to cut me with it - he struck me on the collar of my coat several times; I cannot say what part he intended the blow for, but that took effect on my coat - I succeeded in throwing him down, and fell on him; he threw me off, and then got up and ran away; I pursued him, and eventually gave him in the custody of the police - I never had any quarrel with the prisoner at any time - I think he would not have struck me, if I had not rushed on him to defend Miss Clark.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He did not attempt to touch you, till you made a rush on him? A. I don't think he had; I don't think he would have attempted to hurt me, if I had not rushed forward to defend Miss Clark - I never had any quarrel with him - the rush I made at him was a very violent one; I was agitated at seeing the young lady in this way.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not undertake to swear, whether, at the the time you made the rush, he might not at that time have desisted on any aggression on Miss Clark? A. He might have done so - my face was exposed - I had my hat on; I had another wound in my head, but I think that was got in turning me round on the ground.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he his face towards Miss Clark at the time you flew at him? A. I think he had; I flew at him the moment I could; he had not thrown away the instrument at the time - he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your inducement to rush forwards? A. To protect Miss Clark from being assaulted by him again.</p>
               <p>HARRIETT CLARK. Mr. Clark was walking with me on the 6th of June? I had first seen the prisoner that night in the Lower-road, Islington - I live in Ball's-pond-road; I was with Mr. Clark when I first saw the prisoner; I have known the prisoner for two years; I did not speak to him when I first saw him in the Lower-road, - I was not near him, I saw him at a distance; I walked on with Mr. Clark to the road he has described; I saw the prisoner there; he was before us about twenty yards, on the opposite side of the way - it is quite a narrow road - I saw him standing still at first; I then saw him walking towards us at the end of this narrow passage on Ball's-pond-road; I then looked a contrary way from him - I was still with Mr. Clark and my sister; I turned my head away from the prisoner; I did not see anything more of him; I felt a blow on my head - I was close to Mr. Clark at the time, walking with my arm in his, and my sister - he only gave me one blow on the head; it was on my right ear - I did not see anything in his hand; I did not see him when I received the blow - I turned round on receiving the blow, and saw him standing behind me - I did not see anything in his hand - I received one or two other blows but I was so confused I could not tell where at the time - Mr. Clark got away from me after I had received these two or three blows; Mr. Clark then rushed upon him violently, being in a passion, seeing the treatment I received - I did not see any thing in the prisoner's hand at any time - my ear was only bruised with the blow; I should say it was given with the prisoner's fist - I soon perceived that I had a cut on my shoulder - that was before Mr. Clark interfered - after Mr. Clark rushed on the prisoner, a scuffle ensued, and I saw them on the ground, but I was so much terrified I did not see anything more then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you state you had received whatever injury you received at all, before the interference of Mr. Clark? A. Yes; I saw the prisoner at the time Mr. Clark made the rush at him, but the evening was dark; he was at that time standing quiet - the bruise on my ear was likely to be inflicted with his hand; the wound on my shoulder was very slight indeed; it could not be inflicted with any very great violence; I had on a thin dress, and a very thin shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the prisoner appeared very much excited? A. I don't know; I was very much confused indeed - I have known him two years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is he? A. He has been brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040050"></xptr>up to the sea - I had had no quarrel with him, rather an unpleasantness, but not a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for his striking you in this way from anything which had passed between you? A. He had wished to pay his addresses to me and I objected.</p>

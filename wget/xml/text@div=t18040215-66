            , and two more, came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150050"></xptr>into our house, and called for a quartern and a half of gin; I served it them; they asked for a little raspberry in it; we had a cask of peppermint standing behind them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the peppermint? - A. In the bar; one of those three took it away; I only know Butler; I do not know the others; they were in company together; Butler went out at one door, and the other men went out at the other; I asked who was to pay for the gin; the other men said, Butler was gone to fetch a penny; he immediately brought in sixpence, and I gave him three half-pence, and the other men went away; I immediately took the candle, and said, Lord, those three men have took my peppermint away; I went to the door, and saw Butler at the door; I asked him, where the other men were; I called him, and said, I must keep you while I find the other men; and brought him in doors; I sent immediately for an officer, who took him to Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your cask again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were these three men in company? were they in company together? - A. Yes; they all drank together.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a little keg? - A. It was about six gallons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How many persons were there in the tap-room? - A. There was not any one after I had lost it; it was there when those men came in, but it was not there when they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw two or three men come in together; it was there when they came in, and when they went out it was gone; which door did they go out at? - A. I do believe that Butler went out at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your house a public-house? - A. It is; we have a tap-room there; the peppermint was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not any other person there, besides these men? - A. There was nobody there but two or three women.</p>
               <p>Q. A woman could smuggle any thing under her petticoats, as well as a man under his small clothes? - A. The three men stood before it so that nobody could get at it but them.</p>

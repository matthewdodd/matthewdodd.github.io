                  </hi>. I am a boot maker, of Panton-street, Haymarket. On 18th March, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Fleet-street; there was a crowd, two men were fighting; while I was looking on I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner, French, pass by my right side—I had a watch in my right pocket—French went to the men and parted them, and I was going away, when I missed my watch, which was safe five minutes before—this cord, and the bow of the watch were left—I followed French, he had not gone far down the street—he turned his head behind him, and observed me—I was about as far from him as I am from his Lordship, and he passed something to a friend who was with him, one of the men who had been fighting—I took hold of French, and he said directly, "I have not got your watch, there is the man with your watch, running up that street," pointing up Shoe-lane, where I saw Jones running as hard as he could—I had not mentioned any watch—I kept hold of French, and gave him into custody—a cry of "Stop thief!" was raised, and I afterwards saw my watch in the hands of the policeman.</p>

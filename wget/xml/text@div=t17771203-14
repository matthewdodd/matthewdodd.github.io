I got assistance The prisoner heard us, and jumped off the building. I pursued him and took him before he got an hundred yards. He struggled with me for about two minutes. He

I went to the stable, and found the lead ripped, and lying on the stable. We took him to the watch-house, where we found some tinder and matches, and a slint and steel wrapped up in a paper.</p>

I was going home to my quarters at near eleven o'clock. As I came past Hyde-Park Corner, this man came up and collared me; I thought he was going to rob me, so I drew my knife, and said I would rip him up, which I could easily have done, as he was alone. He let me go, and after that he called out, Stop thief, and I was taken.</p>

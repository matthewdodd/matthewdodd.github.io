On the 7th of March the prisoner came into my house with another man, they had two pots of porter, in the afternoon they went away; he came again in the evening, after dark, in company with a soldier, and was drinking with him in the room; he went out of the house at eight o'clock, and wished me good night; I followed him out, my girl had told me that he was a thief; I thought he was gone away. A little while after my wife was taking the children to bed, she came down and said I had been robbed: somebody went up stairs and brought down this lead, it was on the stair-case in this apron.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you go to live after the four nights - A. She charged me half-a-crown a night for the four nights. I met Slattery; I told him that I was paying so much; he said it was too dear; there was a room to be let in Church-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. And Slattery engaged to lodge with you - A. Yes, as soon as I got a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. At Mrs. Singleton's, was it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And to that room you moved from Mr. Leary's - A. Yes, sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary after you got to your apartment come to visit you - A. No, not till the Saturday before this unhappy transaction; he came about eleven o'clock into my room on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Leary or his wife any means of knowing whether you or your husband had money before Saturday - A. She knew that I had money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary know that your husband had money - A. No, not till I told him; that was on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Leary when you told him that - A. On the Saturday night when he came to me, and it was late. I asked him what made him come out at that late hour of night; he said that he had come to let Clifford know that he had work for him on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Leary on the Sunday - A. Clifford went on the Sunday morning to look after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had told Clifford what Leary had told you, had you - A. Yes. I could not find my way to Leary's room; I begged Slattery to shew me. Clifford had told me that he should go. Slattery went to Leary's room. It was half after seven when I went out of my own home. When I came to Leary's place, I found no one but Leary's wife. I asked her where Clifford was; she said he was out. While I was there Leary returned; I asked him where Clifford was; Leary said he will be here in a few minutes, and when he came I asked him if it was not time to go home; he told me as soon as he could buy a hat he would go home: he went out to buy the hat; I went along with him. Slattery and Leary and his wife were left in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person's name that you bought the hat of, Mr. Barnet - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you when Clifford bought the hat but Clifford - A. No, there was not. This is the hat; I know the hat by the lining and the band that is on it. My little girl bought the band, and put it on the hat; he changed a one pound note, and gave four shillings for the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. When he took his money out to pay for the hat did you see what money he had - A. He counted the notes; I saw what money he had; he had six one pound notes before he bought the hat; he paid for the hat with a one pound note; he had then five one pound notes and a five pound note, two guineas in gold, and sixteen shillings that he got in change for the hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Leary was never with you at the hatter's shop - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Having bought the hat did you return to Leary's - A. We did, for Slattery to go home with us. Clifford had the hat he had purchased in his hand. I put off the old hat, and put the new purchased hat on. Leary said, Clifford, remember I have invited you to dinner to-day. Leary then said to me, do you know this man is going home to Ireland at night; I said, no, I never heard any thing of it; he then said, for your life do not tell him that I told you any such thing. Leary said he is to go. This passed in Leary's room. I asked Clifford if it was true. Clifford said, no, who told you of it. I would not tell him. I took it in my mind that he was going; I said I will not give you your riding coat; do, said he, laughing; he said, I will give you my silk handkerchief for a token. We came home then and had our breakfast in our room. Slattery returned with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Leary in the room all the time that you and your husband had the conversation - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary hear it - A. I don't know. I think he could not but hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel between you and your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150006"></xptr>husband in Leary's room - A. Not one word but what I am telling you.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home did Clifford stay at home with you - A. Yes, he was in and out until I had my dinner in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. He was never long from you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you your dinner in the afternoon - A. I had it between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the time that you usually dine - A. No, I was employed in getting some furniture up to my beds, that made me longer.</p>
               <p>Q. At five o'clock you dined - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came first to your house, Leary or your friend Champion - A. Leary and his wife came first; they came between four and five to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect them - A. No; Leary's wife said if I was uneasy about my furniture she would take it, and give me my money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary and his wife come by your asking - A. They came, but I never spoke a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were surprised at seeing them - A. Yes; I could not take a bit of my dinner at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Why - A. The wife was quite drunk, and Leary was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you eat your dinner - A. She alarmed me by being so very drunk, and by using bad language, cursing and swearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either Leary or his wife say what they came for - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband eat any dinner - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he eat much or little - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you do not know whether he ate or not - A. I do not know, sir; I saw him take something.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice what your husband had - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me all that Leary said or did when they came - A. I was sending out for half a gallon of beer, Leary said, make it up a gallon, and I will pay for the other half, and the gallon was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary drink of the beer - A. He drank some; I cannot tell how much; he partook of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband drink freely of it - A. Yes, he drank.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Leary and his wife stay with you - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Champion come in while he was there - A. Yes, they were going away as Mrs. Champion came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Champion is a relation of yours - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Slattery there too - A. Yes, he was</p>
               <p>Q. When Leary and his wife were going away what time was it - A. I think about eight o'clock: Leary called Clifford out, and he went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. It was by Leary's desire that he went out - A. - A. Yes, he called him out; Mrs. Champion and I were talking together when Leary called him out; I did not hear what was said. After Leary and his wife had departed Mrs. Champion asked me to go and see her son; I made answer that I could not, I was not so well as I could wish. I remained at home in my apartment until after eight o'clock. Before I went out to look after Clifford I went to the corner of the street that I lived in; I did not go any farther at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him there - A. No, I did not. I came back and told the children that I could not find him. I sat in the window a bit; I went off to Leary's room. I went off alone to go to Leary's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with him before you got to Leary's room - A. No.</p>


               <p>Q. When you got to Leary's room whom did you find - A. I found both Leary and his wife standing at their own street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what time might it be when you got to Leary's house, and found them standing at the street door - A. It was after nine o'clock; it was day-light then.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Leary and his wife - A. Nothing, but the wife was quite drunk. I asked them about Clifford; she made answer that he was up in the room; I asked her who was along with him; she said, no one; he was quite tipsey: she went and brought him down; I did not choose to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go up stairs yourself - A. I wanted to get back to my children; I did not go up stairs for fear of being kept.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Clifford drunk, as Mrs. Leary told you - A. He was tipsy. When I had got Clifford I asked him to come home; he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he set out to go home with you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Leary's - A. Clifford and I came together, Leary followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you when you came away that he should go home with you - A. No, he did not; I had but just got out of the court where he lived when he followed us; he said that he was come to get Clifford work against the morning; he took him into a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house was it - A. A public-house at the corner of the lane where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Leary took him in; your husband did not propose going then - A. No, it was Leary. I spoke against Leary taking him in.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought he had liquor enough - A. Yes; Leary said he would only let him take one glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary drink - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the liquor - A. Leary paid for the glass of gin; we all came out of this gin-shop together, and then we turned into another public-house and had one pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of that other public-house - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed going to have the beer - A. I cannot recollect about that; Leary turned in first, because we did not know anything about the public-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drank the beer - A. I took a drop of the beer, they took the rest. I paid for the beer to prevent Clifford drawing anything out, because he was so tipsey.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you when you had the beer - A. Then we were coming on.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150007"></xptr>Q. Did you sit down in that public-house - A. I did not, but they did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not sit - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any stick or any thing hard at your breast - A. No, I never had anything.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any hammer in your bosom - A. No, sir, I had not. I asked Clifford to come home; Leary said to me, you seem to be uneasy; my hand and my word to you I will have this man in work against Monday morning then they were going on quick.</p>
               <p>Q. They got a little bit before you - A. Yes; I begged of them to wait, not to leave me by myself; Leary said, I am going to take this man to my master's house to settle with him against the morning. I said it was a late hour to go to a gentleman's house, and especially of a Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it at this time - A. It was after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the watch gone ten - A. I don't know. I think it was about ten, or between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not very certain about the time - A. No. Leary said, walk easy, and don't distress yourself, and we will be up in your room and have a gallon of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that - A. I don't know. I thought he meant to get him in work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suffer them to go on first - A. I said no more. They left me to go home at my own pace.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any where in your way proposed going round by any square; which way were you going by at this time - A. A place they called Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Holborn by this time, did not you - A. No, I did not, only as they called it. They went before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they there parted with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Leary parted with you, had you asked him to go a different way to that you were going - - A. I never spoke a word to him than what I am telling you.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite a stranger to London - A. Yes After Leary left me I came straight as far as St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home did you find any body there - A. The children and Slattery. I got a candle at the chandler's shop; I slit it, and brought it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the name of the man that kept the chandler's shop where you got the candle Macklarin - A Yes. I looked up at the window and saw there was no light; I returned back and got a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you now any knowledge of the time when you came - A. No further than as I was taking my pipe it struck twelve o'clock. I was a good while getting home. It struck twelve soon after I got home, and neither Clifford or Leary had come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Slattery come home - A. He was in bed; his bed was in my room that I and my children slept in. I sat and smoked my pipe, and then I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep - A. No, I did not; I did not rest much. I got up at two o'clock; I was awake; I heard the clock striking two; I was quite uneasy in my mind. I sat in the window until it was between three and four. I was uneasy not having him at home, and thinking that he was gone off to Ireland. I thought he might have done so, and between three and four o'clock I went to Leary's room.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did Leary occupy - A. An up stair room. I found the street door open; they are stone steps to go up from the street. I went to Leary's room door; I found the key outside of the door. I unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the key of Leary's door before that morning - A. No, I never noticed it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the key in the door what did you do - A. I unlocked the door; the wife asked me if that was Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. Leary's name is Jem - A. I suppose it is. I said, it is me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Leary or not - A. She was in bed. I stood at the door; I asked her where was her husband; that was, Jem Leary.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there and did not find Leary - A. No. I went away when she told me what she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room and put any thing out of your hand - A. I did not go into the room at all. I stood at the door, with the door in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you found that Leary was not there - A. I came home again to my own place, and went to Mrs. Champion.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she live near Leary - A. No, she lives in a place called Drury-lane. I enquired my way to Mrs. Champion's.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what time in the morning it was when you got to Mrs. Champion's - A. I cannot. I told her what had passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay with Mrs. Champion, or what did you do - A. I went home to my lodging; she went to my brother first and told him what had happened; after that she came to me in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it when she got to you - A. I think it was between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the people up, and about their business - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time heard what had happened to Clifford - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Singleton before you heard what had happened to Clifford - A. The woman at the door told me what had happened to Clifford; they said there was a man hurted last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Mrs. Champion proposed to go along with you - A. She proposed my going with her to my own brother; my brother said he would interfere to get me pass, as I thought of following Clifford that I might save what little money I had to help me on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day on Monday was it when you heard about Clifford being murdered - A. Between eight and nine, as I told you.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mrs. Singleton was by when the woman told you of it - A. She was in her own room. I then went out with Mrs. Champion, and a good many more women to see the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the body when you saw it - A. At Mr. Price's public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150008"></xptr>Q. Was it Clifford's body you saw there - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it when you saw it - A. Yes, sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time of Leary and Clifford parting hih you in Holborn, he told you he was going with wim to his master, did you ever see Clifford afterward until you saw him a corpse - A. Never, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home between eight and nine, you found Slattery in bed, did you - A. When I came home at night Slattery was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you told me that Mrs. Leary did know that you had some money - A. Yes, sir, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know that Leary knew Clifford had any money - A. No further than as I tell you, Leary asked me, as I told you before, and I was so foolish as to tell him; this was on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on Sunday was it that he came to your room, he and his wife - A. At my dinner time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what did he ask you, and what did you say - A. He asked me whether it was he or I that kept the money; I said I had a trifle of my own, and he had his own; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to carry what money you had about you, or did you leave it at home - A. I had it about me at the time that this body laid dead; I had no place to leave it at home; it was sewed in the waist of my petticoat. When I found his body was a corpse I ripped it out of my petticoat to give the men something to drink that brought the body home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever denied that you had money - A. I have; because the place was so wicked; I did not wish to own it. I then gave it to Mr. Lawrence, not to conceal it, but for safety.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been delivered since you have been in prison of a child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Mrs. Burke attend to me a little. You came to London quite a stranger, Mrs. Leary let you have a lodging for four days - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that you had never seen them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no reason to believe that Clifford ever saw them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Leary live - A. In Fleet-lane, near Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Q. He never called upon you from the time that you left him until the Saturday - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never mentioned before that time of your husband having any money; on the Sunday morning nothing passed about the money until he and his wife came in the afternoon - A. No more than what I am telling you; the woman was drunk, and the man was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been with Leary four days you met Slattery - A. Yes, he was an old acquaintance, he came from the same neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. He found you out this lodging, he knew what money your husband had - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it never communicated to him that your husband had money - A. No, it never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in London before you came with Clifford - A. Yes, I came when I was a child.</p>
               <p>Q. How old were you when you left London - A. I do not know; my brother knows.</p>
               <p>Q. Were did you live then - A. With my brother, in Parker's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live there then - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Two years - A. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not at least twelve years when you left London - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you now - A. I suppose I am three or four and thirty years of age; I have been married twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. You were married to Mr. Burke - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been as little as six months in London - A. Yes. I cannot give a particular account.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been there a year or two with your brother - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean for the jury to believe that you were so ignorant of London that you did not know the place called Holborn - A. I did not know where Holborn was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you capable of running about the streets - A. I suppose I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at least a girl of seven or eight years old - A. I was that at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps ten or twelve - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on errands - A. Yes, I used to go in and out</p>
               <p>Q. How came it when you came to London that you did not go to your brother - A. Because it was very early in the morning when the children got out of the waggon; the children were fatigued; I went to my brother the next day; he came to see me at Leary's; he proposed to get me another lodging. Slattery took me a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that the money that you had you obtained from selling a little property of yours - A. Yes. Clifford obtained his money from his hard work.</p>
               <p>Q. That is true - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same account how he got his money - A. Yes, he sold cattle, and got money. I sold a little house, and some land; it was near Clare, in the County of Tipperary.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you sold it before you came to England - A. About three months.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it produce - A. Some of it was corn; it was sold for thirty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the thirty pound - A. I had it. I was obliged to part with fifteen pound to pay some debts.</p>
               <p>Q. The thirty pound, what was it paid to you in - A. Notes of the Bank of Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. What notes did you give to Mr. Lawrence, English or Irish Bank notes - A. English; I changed them Irish Bank bank notes for English notes in Cork. Clifford knew that I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that the money that Clifford had was part of the produce of this house and land, and of a horse - A. I don't think I have.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have said so it is not true then - A. No part of the produce of that house ever was Clifford's; I sold the horse for nine guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had thirty-nine pounds - A. I was obliged to pay the debts; I sold the horse, and Clifford had none of the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150009"></xptr>Q. You said Clifford was your husband, did you ever disclose the contrary until it afterwards came from Ireland - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations did you undergo before the magistrate, before you told the magistrate that Clifford was not your husband - A. I don't know, I did not tell the first examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the second - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason that made you tell it you knew that they had got intelligence from Ireland that you was not married, and then you told them - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Clifford and you while in London lived very happy together, you had no words with one-another at any time, that is as true as the rest that you are telling - A. I am telling the truth; we had no words at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never heard Clifford threaten to go away to Ireland, and leave you - A. He said very often he wished to be in his own country; he did not disagree with me at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday morning you breakfasted at home, and Slattery with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Slattery went with you to Leary's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Slattery staid behind when you went with your husband to buy the hat, did not he - A. He staid in the room with Leary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time observe any hammer in Leary's room - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Clifford and you bought the hat together - A. Yes; Leary was not there.</p>

               <p>Q. Slattery was not there - A. No. We went back to Leary's room, and Slattery came home with us, and we breakfasted together.</p>
               <p>Q. Slattery dined with you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he drink any of this gallon of beer - A. He was there at the time the beer was drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home at night, you say you found Slattery in bed; you heard the clock strike twelve when you were taking you pipe - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You continued very uneasy, was Slattery asleep then - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Slattery was in bed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not speak to him one word, good or bad - A. I cannot recollect; I spoke to the children.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up at two o'clock did you speak to Slattery - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Leary's room - A. Yes, and when I left Leary's room I went to Mrs. Champion, I spoke to her husband, the husband was up, but she was not up; Mrs. Champion dressed herself, she wanted me to breakfast with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her and spoke to her at that time in the morning that you came from Leary's; when you went home was Slattery in bed then - A. No, he was got up and gone to work.</p>
               <p>Q. But how are you sure that he was in bed when you was at home at two o'clock in the morning - A. Because his coat was on the table; it was at four o'clock when I went out to Leary; he was in bed then. I did not speak a word. It was from my uneasiness that I was going to Leary.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give Mr. Lawrence your money, or any body else until after the murder; who is Mr. Lawrence - A. I don't know; he keeps a chandler's shopover right where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell him when you gave him that money - A. I did not tell him any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you tell the magistrate that you had any money - A. The first time; I told him I had a trifle, but I did not tell him what it was, nor to what amount.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up at three o'clock and went to Leary's you knew your way well enough - A. I did not, I enquired.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask Slattery to go with you - A. No, because I knew he was going to work.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure you did not go into Leary's room at all - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You say you got thirty pound by selling your property in Ireland, was the price of the horse part of that thirty-pound - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole sum that you got was thirty pound and nine guineas - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what age you were of when you were here with your brother - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go much about - A. I don't know no more about it then a baby.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you speak English when you were here - A. I believe I was learned; I don't recollect any thing about it at all.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information did you go to where the body was - A. Yes; Mrs. Clifford came to the public-house while I was there; I think I was there about an hour before she came. I went to Leary's lodgings; he was not at home; the door was locked; Thisselton was with me; we broke it open; I and Thisselton searched his lodgings; while I was searching the box Thisselton picked up this hammer under some coals; just by the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in that apartment - A. There were some clothes, but we had not time to look at them. Thisselton and I came back to the magistrate; we then went to where Leary was at work; Thisselton and I found him, there were two or three men at work; Leary had got a hod upon his shoulder. I said to Leary, where is your master; he said it is not my master you want, it is me: I said it was. We apprehended him; he said let me speak to my master; I said yes, certainly, where is he; we went into a place about twenty yards; his master met us; he said to his master I am going with these gentlemen to Hatton Garden; he came along with us directly: Thisselton laid hold of his arm, I walked behind him; we took him to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you found the hammer among the coals; was there anything about it that excited your attention - A. Nothing more than the hat I saw at the public-house; I thought it was done with that hammer; there is nothing about the hammer particular. It was very rusty. I could not tell whether there was any blood upon it or no. The other hammer Thisselton produces. I know no more.</p>
               <p>Mr Adolphus. What time in the morning was this - A. I did not go to the public-house until half after twelve, and from there I went to Leary's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Leary at his usual work in his usual place - A. Yes</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the murder of Clifford being discovered did you go to apprehend Leary - A. I did, in Windmill-court, Giltspur-street; that was where he was at work; he had got a hold on his shoulder. I asked him for his master: some one said, he is backwards. He was coming down with the hod; he said, it is not the master you want, it is me. Mr. Helston, the prisoner's master, asked what was the matter; we told him there had been a murder. Leary did not hear that. I said I thought Leary could give some information about it. Crossing Giltspur-street, Leary said he had heard of the poor man; I asked him, how? he said, never mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his working dress at this time - A. He was. I found this shoemaker's hammer under some coals in Leary's room. This shoemaker's hammer found in a corner by the fire-place, under some coals. I put my stick in and found the hammer, and this hammer I found Mrs. Clifford's apartment in Fitzroy-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a man of the name of M'Carthy coming to Leary when he was in confinement - A. I do. I understood that Leary wished to see M'Carthy. I had just locked him up in a private place, and coming from there one of my brother officers said that Leary wished to see M'Carthy. M'Carthy was there. I said I had no objection of his seeing Leary if he would speak English. When M'Carthy first went into Leary, Leary said, what do you think of this job of mine; M'Carthy said, it is a bad case, and I think the evidence that has been brought against you, will be sufficient to hang you. He urged him, if he was guilty to acknowledge it, to clear the rest of his countrymen that were in the country. Leary said, if he could get a person to prove that he was at home and in bed at ten o'clock on the night of the murder, it would be all right. They were the very words as well as I can remember. M'Carthy replied, suppose you could get a person to do that, where were you between the time that you parted with Mrs. Clifford and ten o'clock. Leary answered, that is where I should be lost. M'Carthy said he thought nothing would get the prisoner through it. Leary said, there is nothing but one thing that is, to fix it on some one else. M'Carthy said, if that is what you sent to me for I will leave you to your fate, and you may be hanged like a dog, and none of your countryman shall come forward to give you a shilling. I unlocked the door then, and M'Carthy came out. No more passed. That conversation was on Thursday, what I call the first examination. I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. The second hammer you found at Mr. Burke's lodging - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That hammer has a wooden handle, if that was put in a woman's stays it would form a thing like a busk - A. I cannot form any idea of that.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of this interview with M'Carthy there had been interviews with the magistrate; on Thursday Mrs. Burke was examined in his presence - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that was the first of what he had heard what she could allege against him, she then stated pretty much the same circumstances that she stated to day - A. She did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when this interview was with Leary and with M'Carthy - A. In the passage, close to the door. There is a grating over the door; we can hear what is said if they speak in a common tone of voice.</p>
               <p>Q. You had taken him into the strong room, had not you - A. Yes, I had, in the strong room in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. You opened the door and put M'Carthy in - A. That is the fact. I do not know whether I did not speak to M'Carthy while I was unlocking the door that he must speak in English.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary hear it - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Mrs. Burke give any account of her not being Mrs. Clifford - A. I was not present when that disclosure was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you heard this conversation - A. Wood, another officer. I do not know whether he heard it or not; it was Wood that told me that Leary wished to see M'Carthy.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him at the lock-up-room at Hatton Garden office - A. I do; he sent for me; I saw the prisoner there; I and the prisoner were alone together. When I went in I asked him what he wanted with me; he asked me what I thought of him. I told him that I thought him in an aukward situation, and that I thought him guilty of the murder; he said he felt himself very uneasy at my having thought so, I being one of his nearest friends. He said he was innocent of the man's murder; he knew nothing of it. I said, if that be the case, what time in the morning did you go to your work, and who had seen you. He said, a person of the name of

            , and fifty others saw him go to work. I then said, why does not White come here and prove that on your part, and suppose he had come and proved that, how can you account for going to bed at ten o'clock, as you say you have done. There, said he, is where I am lost; if any body could be got to prove that, I should be free, said he. I told him that I considered him guilty of the murder, and not to suffer two of his countrymen, after whom there was a pursuit, to participate in his guilt. I told him he would be hanged; he said, I am sure I shall. I said, you have no means of getting over it. Leary said, none but the one. What is that, said I. Leary said, to fix it upon some one else. I said, upon whom do you mean to fix it, who is implicated. I think, said he, when I sat in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150011"></xptr>the Union Arms public-house I felt in her right hand pocket a hammer. Here ended the conversation. I believe I told him that he was the man that committed the murder, and that he should have no friendship from me. As near as I can recollect these were the words. Then I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever with him alone ever since - A. Never. I would not go to him. I disclosed this conversation to the officers, and told them to mention it to the magistrate if they thought it material.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. When you went to him you had made up your mind that he was the guilty man - A. Yes. He said, I know I shall be hanged, and the moment I am hanged may I go into Hell if I am guilty of the man's murder.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not ask you to do any such thing as to get a person to prove that he had seen him go to bed - A. Just as I have stated to you.</p>
               <p>Q. You went further into the difficulty; he stated the circumstance that he felt a hammer in the woman's pocket - A. Yes. Now I recollect the phrase that he used, that if somebody could be procured to prove that he had seen him go to bed; there is where I am lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you at any time while Leary was in your care, any conversation with him - A. Yes; the first conversation the expression was, faith, I will tell you the truth. This conversation was taken in writing. I said nothing to him about confessing. This declaration was taken in writing the same morning. He said he did not commit the murder himself, but he was there present at the time of the murder. He told me that Mrs. Burke had committed the deed. I asked him what distance he was off Mrs. Burke when the murder was committed; he told me he might be three yards distant. I then asked him respecting his dress; I do not remember his answer. I asked him if there was any blood on any part of his clothes; he said there might be some on his shoes; the deceased bled fresh; it spurted from him; he might have got blood though a yard or two distant. I then asked him what the implement was that the murder was committed, whether it was the shoemaker's hammer; his answer was, no, he did not think it was; he believed not. I then asked him where the implement was concealed, where it was to be found; he told me I should find it at his master's, and gave me the direction where his master lived. Mr. Helston delivered it up to me. Leary told me the hammer had been in use one week since the murder.</p>
               <p>Q. You got the hammer of his master - A. I did. I asked him respecting of the knife; he denied any knowledge of the knife on the Monday and the Tuesday, but on the Wednesday he said that he had an old knife at home, and described it to me; he told me that it was a broken pointed knife, and the top part of the handle was broken off. This is the knife; Lee gave it to Mr. Price, and Mr. Price to Higginbotham. I shewed the knife to Leary, and asked him if that was the knife that he had described to me; he said it was. Leary added, that Mrs. Burke might have taken it from Clifford, and Clifford had taken it from his apartment, and put it into his pocket. I asked him how he knew that was the hammer; he said he saw Mrs. Clifford lift up the hammer with both her hands; he was within a yard or two of her. He always denied having any hand in the murder, only that he was present.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer in Cock-lane. The prisoner was in my employ at the time he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me if you know that large hammer - A. A. Yes, that is a tool belonging to me; I saw it on the Saturday before Leary was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. That hammer was it, where we are told the prisoner was apprehended - A. Yes. I believe all the men used it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you generally find tools for your men, or do they find tools for themselves - A. The labourers generally find tools for themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you saw that hammer on your premises on the Saturday preceding the time that Leary was apprehended - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What has been the character of Leary while in your employment - A. I had a good character with him: he was a quiet, sober, industrious man. He has worked for me a twelvemonth.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any body coming to you on a Sunday in June to buy a hat of you - A. Yes, Mr. Clifford; he came by himself to buy a hat; I sold him this hat for four shillings; he was receiving the change of a one pound note when the woman came in; I asked her what she wanted. I did not know she belonged to him. When the deceased took the money out to pay for the hat he turned himself round; he would not let me see what he had. The deceased said the woman that came in belonged to him; she took hold of him; he ran into the parlour, as if frightened at her. They seemed as if they had been quarrelling before they came in. It was about noon when he came in, I am quite certain.</p>

I went to the lodging at seven o'clock on the Sunday afternoon; just as I got to the room door Clifford came out, and Leary and Mrs. Leary walked out after him; Mrs. Clifford stopped in the room along with me, and Slattery was in the room; I and Slattery went to a court in the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Clifford again that night - A. I asked Mrs. Clifford to come along with me; she declined; she said she was too dirty to come out.

I went with Mrs. Clifford to No. 4, in Church-street; she told me then that Clifford was gone to Ireland, and therefore she wanted to go too.

             and his wife. I walked with both until we came to Ely-place, and then we walked faster. It was Clifford's intention to get his clothes out before his wife came home. When we got to Holborn Bars Mrs. Clifford was about thirty yards behind; there we met Slattery. Slattery came and said, Ned, you have disappointed us very much this afternoon; I am very much obliged to you for the civility. I then left them altogether. In my way back, at Shoe-lane, I met Clifford's wife, and passed her without speaking to her. That is the substance of the first confession. After this a message came from Leary to Mr. Adkins the governor, stating that what he said on the 28th of July was false. Then I took this in writing from Leary's mouth, dated the 1st of August; he then said he would give a true account. I reduced it to writing. This is the same. It was signed first by Mr. Adkins, and then by Leary. I saw Leary sign it, and then Mr. Adkins.</p>

             came to my lodgings; he told me that he wanted to get away on Sunday night if he could; he said, I will lay myself down here and go to sleep. I put him three chairs together; he laid down there for two or three hours. I put my great coat over him. He then requested me to go with him to his house and ask his wife for the clothes that she had got. A little after eight he went away; I did not go with him. After he went away his wife came after him. I think it must be between eight and nine. When Clifford came back, Slattery and his wife were there. He said he would go back to Ireland. His wife took hold of him; they quarrelled together. He said, it was of no use, he would go back to Ireland. He then offered her a silk handkerchief that he said he gave nine shillings for, if she would give him the great coat. He opened the window and attempted to throw himself out. She laid hold of him and prevented him going out; he said he was determined to go to Ireland; she said she was determined to go after him. My wife opened the door; he went down stairs; Mrs. Clifford pulled off his hat. Between two and three in the afternoon I and my wife went to their lodging with intention to buy the bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150013"></xptr>bed and what things they had got. They were getting the dinner ready. She asked Slattery to fetch half a gallon of beer. She gave him the money, and before he went out I said I thought he had better bring a gallon, and I would pay for half a gallon. I did pay for half a gallon, all we were in the room. They all dined together except Clifford; they all seemed agreeable together. I did not say a word about buying the bed. Clifford kept by the door, holding a shoemaker's hammer in his hand. When I and my wife went out of the room we met Mr. Harrington and his wife; we agreed to go to Mr. Griffiths's house in Church-street; Clifford came after us and partook of the beer. My wife was tipsey; she wanted to go home. As we were coming along Clifford complained that he was hungry; I said, if he would go along with me I would give him something to eat; accordingly he did. I gave him some bread, meat, and cabbage. As near as I can say this was about nine o'clock. While he was there Mrs. Clifford came; they began quarrelling. Clifford and his wife and me went out; we went to the Union Arms, Union-court; I had a glass of gin, Clifford had one, Mrs. Clifford had none. Coming along I accidentally hit my elbow against her side: I felt something hard, like a stick. She complained of being ill; she did not wish to go up Holborn, as the people would push against her. She asked Clifford to come this way through Gray's-inn, as then they would have an opportunity of going through the squares. I said, I wish you good night, madam; she said, no, go a little further with me, if I am taken ill this man knows nothing, he will be of no use to me. As we got towards the brick fields he said he would be gone in the night, he would not stop by any means. They began quarrelling again; she took the hammer from her breast and struck him down; she then struck him two or three times very hard. I moved a little nearer to him, and saw the blood flow from him. I made my way across the fields as well as I could. I went home about eleven o'clock; my wife was fast asleep in bed. I undressed and went to bed. About three o'clock Mary Clifford came and said, are you at home, Leary. She did not come into the room, but put this hammer into the room. She went down stairs without speaking one word. When I got up I found the hammer by the door, which made me suspect that she had put it there. I got up about half after five. I went to my work, and took this hammer with me. I came back to breakfast about eight o'clock my wife said

               <p>Q. Did you ever go with her to Leary - A. I did; on Sunday morning when her husband was gone out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being turned out of the room on the Saturday, and sleeping on the stairs - A. No, I do not. About eight o'clock on Sunday morning we went to Leary's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that when you went to buy the hat - A. I was not present when they purchased the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you heard him say before that Sunday morning that he would leave her and go to Ireland - A. Yes, more than once.</p>
               <p>Q. Used not they to quarrel - A. No; he said the place would not agree with him, and she at eight o'clock on Sunday morning asked him if he was going to leave her and go to Ireland; after that he went out and bought the hat, and we went home together and got our breakfast; this was about nine o'clock. I helped her to put up the beds, and Clifford remained in the room until about five o'clock. When Leary and his wife came in Leary ate some dinner. Leary told Clifford he would get Clifford a job of work at his master's; they went out; I never saw Leary afterwards until I saw him the next day at Hatton Garden office. Mrs. Clifford remained in the room; Mrs. Champion came next, I went out with her; I came home about nine o'clock, there was nobody at home but the children.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept in the same room with Mrs. Clifford - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her up in the night - A. I did not; I do not know that I was awake all night; I knew nothing that passed, nor of the murder until I heard of it at one o'clock; the next day I got up at six o'clock and went to work in Camden Town; I breakfasted in Camden Town; I heard nothing of the murder until I returned home to dinner in Clifford's room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. I hope you will grant me the indulgence of having my defence read, and if there appears any guilt before you that I was the hand that murdered Clifford I will not ask my hte at you hand; but if my story be true, and if I prove some part by the evidence of proper persons who may be believed, then I shall look for a verdict of an acquittal. I am very low in spirits, not having the same kind of living that I used to have. Some gentlemen have come forward and have employed the learned lawyer in my behalf, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150014"></xptr>I had no money. I do not doubt that if I have a patient hearing I shall disprove the unconnected evidence against me. Clifford came to me to know what he was to do, the same as another of my countrymen did, and because I can write, (my father was a schoolmaster they call me) Mr. Leary. Gentlemen, I did not kill the man, nor did I lend my assistance, nor thought of the affair until it was actually done; we never had a quarrel or ever fell out. If I was a thief, but I am not, I might easily have robbed him without murdering him; this never entered my head; I never would suffer men to overreach one-another at pay-table; my master knows I never was found committing such tricks as journeymen bricklayers are used to commit; I have told the masters about them, and they have been discharged, although they have been good workmen. Gentlemen, I am not a thief, nor ever did I covet other mens property, or liked to see one man overreach another; if a reason is assigned why I am accused of this horrid deed it must arise from something higher; although I am very poor I am as sensible as some that are better off. The statement published by the keeper of the House of Correction you are well acquainted with, as it has been stated in the public-newspapers, and other paragraphs, stating further proofs as they said Leary's of guilt. I trust this honourable court will not believe that I am guilty of this murder from the depositions that have been inserted in the newspapers; they call the papers that I signed at the House of Correction a confession. On the night of this lamented murder I was tipsy; the women were all tipsy, and if I have mistaken one house for another it will not be thought I am guilty of this crime, or knew of it before it took place. I will now return to the newspapers, I am ill used by them, they have raised a strong perjudice against me; they have offered false assertions for facts, told the public that the examinations tended to prove Leary's guilt, when truely they did not tend to any such thing; for God's sake gentlemen do not take in your minds these newspaper reports; his lordship I hope will tell you that the only way you can give the proper verdict is to take into your consideration only what has occured in court to day, that is the only way you can give the proper verdict on my case; there have been verdicts passed on prisoners by the evidence of police officers, which verdicts have been lamented afterwards; you see I speak of the danger of deciding from circumstantial evidence, on account of Holloway, Haggerty, and others. Gentlemen, there have been shewn to you three hammers, a knife, and my great coat; the large hammer is the property of my master, and was brought from the building where it was used on the building by all the men; I being the oldest man in the employ it was carried home by me; I knew Mrs. Helston was ill, I did not like to disturb her, so I carried it to my own home, I had often taken home tools before. I am told it was the small hammer that killed the man, but I am fearful it was the large one; as to the other hammer being covered with coals, I had not coals enough to cover it; I never had it in my hand. At the third examination several witnesses were bought up to prove that this knife was mine, but failed; I think Clifford put it in his pocket after supper; we had but three knives, one I had, the other my wife had, and Clifford had this. My coat was said to be bloody, and then it was said to be scowered; this was disproved by Martin during the examination; Cook and Thisselton harangued at me, and said they should have other evidence to prove my guilt, that I should be hanged, that I was done, and many other such expressions, it certainly induced me to say to them you want my life, take it; this was natural, for it is better to die at once than live under such.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

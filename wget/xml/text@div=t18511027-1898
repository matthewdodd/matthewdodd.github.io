                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of Manchester. On the morning of 18th Sept., between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was with a friend near Fetter-lane, we met the prisoner and another woman—my friend and the other woman left me at the corner of Fetter-lane—I went up Fetter-lane to go home, and the prisoner walked by my side—when I had gone about fifty yards up Fetter-lane, I felt a jerk at my guard, and my watch was gone—my watch had before been as it is now, with the guard round my neck, and this little chain hanging out—the prisoner then ran off at great speed—I had seen a policeman pass just before—I went after him, gave him information, went afterwards to the station, and saw the prisoner there, and my watch—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>Manchester—he was then staying in Newgate-street—we had been to a friend's house—I am not ashamed to tell where that was, they are highly respectable—we had been to two or three friends, but I do not wish to say where—the friend J was with in Fleet-street is a physician, in Manchester. (<hi rend="italic">The witness declined to answer any questions as to who, what, or where his friends were</hi>)—we had been to several places of amusement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had you been to?—where come from last, at 3 o'clock in the morning? The prisoner says you could not pay her any money, and gave her the watch; I want to know the probability of that from the previous part of your conduct that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We had come from Evans's, in Covent<lb></lb>garden; we had been there about two hours—I believe we had been to the theatre before that—I think it was the Lyceum; it was the Lyceum—one of the two women we met in Fleet-street went off with my friend, she took him—I do not think be liked to go—I think he went against his will—I was going home to Gough-square, and up Fetter-lane was the nearest way—the prisoner followed me up the lane—I swear I was unwilling for her to follow me—I am thirty-five years old—there was nothing going on between us—she jostled against me—I was joking, but there was nothing improper in the jokes—I cannot exactly recollect what they were; they have gone out of my memory; they were nothing but words—there may have been the joke of putting my arm round her waist—I believe I did—I object to answer whether I put my arm anywhere else—she did not give me time to give her anything—I do not recollect that she asked me for anything—I did not tell her I had got no money—it happened near a school, in Fetter-lane—it was not up a dark passage or court—she did not say that I was going on in that way that it was only decent to have a room-nothing was said about a room—she did not invite me anywhere—we were not together a minute and a half.</p>

On this morning, about 4 o'clock, I was on duty at the bottom of Fetter-lane, and saw the prisoner and prose<lb></lb>cutor standing at the corner of St. Dunstan's school, in Fetter-lane—I left them there, and went on my beat—before I got round my beat, I was met by the prosecutor, who told me of the loss of his watch, and described the female to me—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I found the prisoner by Temple-bar, and took her to the station.</p>

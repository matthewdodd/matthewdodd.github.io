On the 11th of December, I happened to be coming by Mrs. Bullwinkle's shop, about seven in the evening; I saw the prisoner and another boy lurking about the shop window of Mrs. Bullwinkle. I saw the other boy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130034"></xptr>put the prisoner up to the square of glass that is made to open in Mrs. Bullwinkle's window. This square of glass was made to open and shut. In consequence of that some person came down and moved them. I was on the opposite side of the way. They were alarmed, and went away, and when they came back again the other boy opened the window, and took the cheese out, and gave it to the prisoner. I seized the prisoner, and took the cheese. The other boy ran away. I took the cheese into Mrs. Bullwinkle's shop, and delivered it to her son.</p>

               <p>JOHN BLACKETT. I am at home with my mother on Sundays. On Sunday night the 9th of June, I left my watch on the table at eleven o'clock, and on the Monday morning I missed it - I inquired of my father, he said he did not know where it was - any body could see it on the table where I left it.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On Monday afternoon the 10th of June, between three and four o'clock the prisoner came to our shop, and asked for half a pint of porter - she said she had no money, but offered my wife two seals and a key - she disputed taking them - I heard it and came down - I said, "What is all this dispute about half a pint of porter" - I then heard what it was - the prisoner had then laid down this watch, and my wife took it up, and gave it to me - I said I thought it had not been got in an honest way, and unless the prisoner could give a good account of it, I should detain it - she then produced a penny, and demanded the watch - I fetched the officer, and gave charge of her - my house is within five minutes walk of the prosecutors.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner in a long written address stated that she came from Deptford to Whitechapel, to seek her husband, who had not returned home - that she was going down Petticoat-lane, and met a woman who asked her to pledge the watch, and promised her a shilling for doing so - that feeling herself faint, she went in for half a pint of beer, for which she offered a penny piece, which they refused, as being an Irish<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040064"></xptr>penny, that she showed them the watch, which they snatched out of her hand, and gave her into custody.</p>

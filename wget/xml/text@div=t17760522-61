               <p>I received from the defendant a note drawn in the same manner for 25 l. which note I passed off, and that note was paid; afterwards the defendant brought me this note, and when I looked at the note, he said it is upon the same person as the last note; it is drawn upon a good person, and that you know. I said if it is drawn upon Mr. Pollard, who is in partnership with the house in Bartholomew-lane; but this is not Bartholomew-lane, it is Basinghall-street. Copperthwaite said, It is that Mr. Pollard, and though the house is in Bartholomew-lane, he lives in Basinghall-street, and you know that to be as good a house as any in London. I delivered him the goods he wanted: four gallons of brandy shrub, seventeen bottles, five gallons of rum, five gallons of brandy, and two casks.</p>

             for 23 l. When Mr. Broughton came in with the bill, he and I were at Old Will's Coffee-house together, we talked the matter over in our conversation; he promised that he would take half cash, in the course of a week or ten days, if I would give him the remainder. I sent him up 22 l. to Mr. Leveridge, he was to go to pay a note; he did not come upon the Saturday night, and then the advertisement came in. When he found I could not get the money, he said he would prevent my joining the regiment, as he knew I was an officer in the militia.</p>

            : On the 10th of August, about seven in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked for a watch in the window of the value of 3l. 13s.; I told him there was not one marked at that price; he went out, and pointed to one marked three guineas; he came in and looked at it; he said, he did not think it was a good one, and desired to see another; he went out, and pointed to one marked 3l. 10s.; he told me he would give me three guineas for it; I told him, as watches were not very saleable, he should have it; he then desired to look at another; he said, he did not know which he should have; he then took both watches in his hand, and ran out into the street; I went out and screamed; he was soon brought back; he went down upon his knees, gave me the watches, and said, for God's sake do not hurt me, the watches are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been concerned in business together? - A. About ten years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.What had this good lady said to him, to induce him to make that intreaty of her to forgive him? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say, give me the watches, and I will not prosecute you? - A. No; she did not say any thing of that kind.</p>

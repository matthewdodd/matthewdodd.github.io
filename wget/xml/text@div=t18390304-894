About eight o'clock, on the 1st of March, I was in King William-street—a person asked if I had lost my handkerchief—I felt, and said I had—he produced this handkerchief to me, which I recognized at mine—I had had it in my pocket the same evening—the person brought the prisoner with him.</p>

I am a baker, and live in Upper Thames-street I was in King William-street a few minutes after eight o'clock, on the opposite side to the prosecutor—I noticed the prisoner and another lad following the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner take up the prosecutor's pocket with his right hand, and take his handkerchief out with his left—he was crossing the road, folding it up—I crossed and met him—I took hold of his collar, and he dropped the handkerchief—I took it up—I sent a lad to tell the prosecutor—I gave the prisoner into custody—I have no doubt of his being the person.</p>

About four years ago was the commencement of the prisoner's irregularity - he would lie in bed from morning till noon, and from noon till night- just get up to have his meals, and he began to treat his parents very badly - he would come down in the middle of the week, and not know what day it was - his parents were obliged to apply to the parish authorities to take him into the lunatic ward, and he was there till he was set at large - since then, his conduct has been very bad - he would take the cat and throw it at the children; and dirt about the house- he has come to me and said, "What at work at this time of the week?" - I said, "Yes" - "Why," he would say, "it is Sunday."</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How has he been for the last three months? A. They said he was better, and he had liberty to go into the yard - he then came home, and I found him in victuals and drink, but he absconded from me - my life is at stake if he is not confined.</p>

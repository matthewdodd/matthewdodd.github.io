I live at 9, Catherine Street, Islington—on 2nd June, just after twelve at night, I was near the Metropolitan railway station, and noticed three men and a woman near the kerb—two of the men had light overcoats on—they hustled me—I pushed them off, buttoned my coat, and went on—they came after me, and said, "What did you hit me for?"—another said, "What did you hit the man for?"—I turned and faced them, and was struck in the mouth, which made my lips bleed; and directly afterwards I was struck in the eye by another man—I had two or three blows more in the face, and my watch was snatched and taken away, with</p>

I am a tailor, of 13 1/2, Shoe Lane, City—I was going home, and saw the prosecutor followed by three men—they struck him two or three times about the face, and said, "What did you insult us for?"—two of them had light coats, and the tallest of the three made a snatch at the watch; and the instant he took it, he took off his coat and handed it to the woman, saying, "Take my coat"—he threw it into her arms, and went off towards Holborn Hill—I followed them a good distance—they turned round to come back again, and I ran for a constable—he came and stopped Valentine with the coat—I recognised her immediately—I am unable to speak to the others.</p>

About half-past twelve on Saturday night, I saw a man by the side of the female prisoner—he pulled off this coat and gave it to her, saying, "Take this," and went away directly—she rolled it round her arm—I kept behind her and made a communication to another constable—I am certain the prisoner is the man who took the coat off—Valentine was taken—I attended the police-court while she was under examination.</p>

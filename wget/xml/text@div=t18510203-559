On 22nd Jan. the prisoner came and dined, between one and two o'clock—he ordered a <hi rend="italic">nip</hi> of Burton ale; that is half a pint—he afterwards ordered another—I got in conversation with him, and he invited me to have a glass of ale with him—he made inquiries after a gentleman who was frequently in the habit of coming there—at that moment the gentleman he had inquired about came in, but the prisoner did not speak to him—I then left the coffee-room and went into the kitchen to wash my hands—the prisoner left within two minutes of my leaving the room—I did not see him, but I saw</p>

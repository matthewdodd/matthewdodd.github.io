                  </hi>. I reside at Whittlesea, in Cambridggeshire, and am a solictor—my London agents are Messrs. Nethersole and Speechly—for the last two years I have been working a brickyard, which has been managed by my foreman—about the 13th November I received a letter, in consequence of which I came to the Charing Cross Hotel—on the 26tb November this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to me there by the porter—I had previously received one like it in the letter—when the porter gave me the card I saw the defendant—he said, "Mr. Bradshaw"—I asked him if he had seen the bricks—I bad sent him some samples—he said he had only seen two of each sort, but they were both alike, and there was no pretence for making a difference in the price—we afterwards fixed upon a price, which was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per thousand, and he was to pay<lb></lb>the carriage—he said he was a man of business, and it was his practice to pay on the first of each month for goods delivered, and he asked me whe<lb></lb>ther he should send me a cheque on the 1st of December for the few bricks I was going to let him have—I said, "As the amount would be so small, it had better stand over till the next month"—I then told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250041"></xptr>
               <p>him I should require references—he said, "Of course; I shall be able to give you very satisfactory ones, one of them a gentleman with whom I have done a large amount of business, and who was carrying on a brickyard under circumstances similar to your own, and whom I have paid many hundreds of pounds"—I told him I was a solicitor—after that interview bricks were sent to the defendant almost daily, amounting in all to 110,000—that was from the 28th November till the 12th December—after I received the letter dated 10th December I wrote to Mr. Charles Boss, of 119, Englefield Road, and also to Mr. John Layland, of 14, De Beauvoir Road, Kingsland—in the course of post I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Ross in reply—I did not get a reply from Mr. Lay<lb></lb>land—I received a contract note from the prisoner in a letter dated the 26th November—it was in duplicate—I signed them both, and sent one back to the prisoner, at 1, Regent's Canal Basin, Limehouse—I had sent the prisoner 104,000 bricks before he sent me the references, and after<lb></lb>wards I sent him 6000 more—what induced me to part with the bricks was, that I believed the prisoner to be a respectable man, carrying on a legitimate business as described, and in the manner named in his cards, and at the addresses in the lithographed circulars—after I received the answer from Ross I caused further inquiries to be made, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of those inquiries I did not supply the prisoner with any more goods—an appointment was made to meet the prisoner at the office of my London agents on the Saturday before Christmas Day—he attended, and another appointment was made for the following Monday, which he did not attend—between the Saturday and Monday I had caused farther in<lb></lb>quiries to be made—I did not see anything more of the prisoner until he was in custody—I have received no money from him in respect of the bricks—I have never seen Charles Ross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the interview at the Charing Cross Hotel, where do you say the prisoner said he was carrying on his business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> During the conversation he said he had just driven up from his place of business at Stepney, and he wished he could let me see it—his card says that his place of business is "1, Regent's Canal Basin, near Stepney Railway"—there was not much dispute about the price—he first offered me one price and then another—I asked him what quantity he wanted, and he said he could get rid of any amount as commission agent—I won't swear that he did not offer to pay me for any bricks that had been sent up—I won't swear either way—I spoke first about references—he did not say anything about Five Bells Wharf then, but he did at the interview at Messrs. Nethersole and Speechly's office—I have no doubt that Five Bells Wharf being on his card had something to do with my sending him goods—I have not made inquiries about Ross and Layland personally—I have been to, 1, Regent's Canal Basin, but not to Five Bells Wharf—I am not aware that it is the custom of people who have goods landed at a certain wharf to put the name of that wharf on their card—I should not do such a thing myself—I think I wrote to Mr. Ross on the 11th December, and I received this letter in reply:—"Sir,—Your letter is to hand, and I do not hesitate to say that I should not be afraid to trust the firm you mention for the amount you name. I have done a considerable trade with them, and have always found them prompt." I believed the prisoner was a commission agent for every description of goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the prisoner's service—before that I was in the service of Messrs. Williams, in the Kent Road, for some time—after I left Williams I was out of employment about a fortnight, and then I went into the prisoner's service as clerk—I believe that was about three months before Christmas, and I continued in his service until the first week in the new year—I attended at the office, 1, Regent's Canal Basin—I was there almost every day—the prisoner came there, sometimes every other day, and sometimes every day—Mr. Puttock entered his service after I did—I introduced him to the prisoner—his duties were out-door—I know nothing of Mr. Charles Ross, and have never seen him—the prisoner told me he did business with Ross, and he gave me his name to give as reference, and his address was 119, Englefield Road, Essex Road—he told me he had bought bricks and timber of him—I understood him to say he was a commission agent—I have seen nothing of a man named Layland, but the prisoner also described him to me as a commission agent, and that I was to give him as a reference—I know a person of the name of Lowe, as the prisoner's father-in-law—I have never seen him at the office, but I have very often at the prisoner's house—during the time I was at Regent's Canal Basin no goods came there, but some bricks went through the docks—a few samples of bricks, iron, and different things used to come;—also samples of glue, sandpaper, and geese—five geese came at Christmas—there were some chains from Mr. Edges, <hi rend="italic">but no</hi> tiles, slates, sash-weights, grease, stair-rods, or jewellery—I kept a petty cash-book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it dates from the 26th of November, 1866, down to 9th January, 1867—there were other payments made besides those put down here—this book is only for small office expenses—I made no entries at all of other payments—I took the receipts to the prisoner—I cannot say how much I paid—I remember paying one account, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think that was for barge dues—I did not pay anything for goods, as I had nothing to do with that—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all in my hand<lb></lb>writing—I wrote them by the prisoner's directions—the majority of the letters in this letter-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are also in my handwriting—they are press copies of original letters written by me—this contract was written by me—I sent the original to Mr. Peed, by direction of the prisoner—this list of "matters in hand" is not in my handwriting, but Mr. Puttock's—I supplied the materials from which it was written on the 17th December—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in my handwriting—I could not swear to the prisoner's writing—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is written on the same paper as the others, and it has the lithographed heading—I cannot say whether it is in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">A letter, dated the 15th November, from the prisoner to the prosecutor, was read; also one dated the 19th; also one of the 29th, a portion of which was as follows:</hi>—"On Mr. Bradshaw's return from Manchester he will take the first opportunity of replying to the other portion of your letter.)" The other portion of your letter" alluded to there, was as to references—I did not know that the prisoner was in Manchester—I had not seen him for two days. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of the 10th December from the prisoner to the prosecutor, was read, in which the names of Charles Ross, of 119, Englefield Road, and John Layland, of 14, De Beauvoir Road were given as references, with whom the prisoner stated he did a large amount of business. Several other letters were read, among them a letter to Messrs. Edge and Co., in which the names of Charles Ross and John Layland were given as references.</hi>) Messrs. Edge and Co. are the people from whom we had the chain—I do not know whether that was ever paid for. (<hi rend="italic">Two other</hi>

Andrews and Taylor, and the other to George Penn, in which the names of Ross and Lay<lb></lb>land were given as references, were read.</hi>) This is, I believe, the original list of "matters in hand"—it is a list of correspondence standing over—we went through the letter-book, and all correspondence that was open we put down—where contracts were open or negotiations were going on they were not in reference to any sale of goods by the prisoner to any one—I do not think there is any reference in the letter-book to any sale of goods by the prisoner—there were no ledgers or day-books kept at Regent's Canal Basin—no books at all, excepting the letter-book and a small book I entered invoices in—I have not got that—I have not seen it since I left.</p>

Q.</hi> Did the prisoner carry on at this place the business of a trader and wharfinger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—he bought other things besides bricks—it is the custom for persons to have more than one wharf, and to land their goods at different wharves—I know nothing about Five Bells Wharf, but I heard from the prisoner that he had bricks landed there—I have seen the address "Five Bells Wharf" on the prisoner's invoices—I and Mr. Puttock did not transact the whole of the business, the prisoner did a great deal of it himself—he kept his own books at his private house—I have seen him writing there—I have seen him making entries in books—several samples came to the office—it is not customary for the goods to come there—they generally pass through the wharf—we only received the samples and invoices—they were the invoices that I used to enter in the book—I remember a letter coming from Mr. Peed, insisting upon the prisoner taking the whole of the bricks, according to contract—I do not know what date it was—I had nothing to do with payments for goods—I do not know whether the prisoner paid away hundreds or millions—the prisoner lived in Pigott Street, Limehouse—I was not his confidential clerk.</p>

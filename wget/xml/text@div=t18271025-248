            . I am a watchman. I heard the rattle, ran up, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner on the bridge, in the Kingsland-road; the prisoner was almost stripped - they were searching her; he said he had lost a sovereign and half a crown, and he thought the man who ran away had got it; he was sober.</p>

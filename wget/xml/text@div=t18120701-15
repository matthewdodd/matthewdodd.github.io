On the 8th of June, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, in Oxford-road, as I was returning from my duty; on my going Dean-street I saw several people passing Dean-street; and when I got into <placeName id="t18120701-15-crimeloc97">Oxford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18120701-15-crimeloc97" type="placeName" value="Oxford-street"></interp>

I did not know that I had been robbed at that time. I turned round, and saw Lloyd, the officer, and the prisoner in a scuffle, and the prisoner had got the pocket-book just between his knees. He dropped the pocket-book from between his legs down to his heels. A young man there, a stranger to me, picked it up. I claimed it as my pocket-book, and he delivered it to me. Lloyd took the prisoner into a shoe-maker's shop. He said he was an officer. I told him it was my pocket-book. I delivered the pocket-book to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man - A. Yes. I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>- LLOYD. I am an officer. On Monday, the 8th of June, between one and two o'clock, I was passing along Oxford-street, I saw a crowd collected together. I went up to see what was the occasion of the mob. I saw a man in a naval uniform taking a chair from a chair-maker's shop. He set down on the chair and brandished a large stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk - A. Apparently: but it was done for the purpose of picking pockets, I have no doubt. I then looked round the ring to see if I could see any suspicious characters. I saw the prisoner in company with two persons; one I knew to be a reputed thief. I watched them. I saw the prisoner at the bar, together with the others, feel the outside of several peoples pockets: at last the prosecutor came into the crowd. Their attention seemed to be turned to him. The prisoner put his finger to one of his associates. They then followed the prosecutor into the crowd. I closely followed them. I saw the prisoner take up the flap of his coat, and put it over one of his hands. He tried with his hand under the flap of his coat once or twice, and could not get the pocket-book out. He made two attempts before he did get it: at the third attempt he did get it. He moved it from his left hand into his right. His great coat being buttoned I did not see it was a pocket-book that he had got. I then immediately seized him in the crowd, pinioned his arm in that manner that he could not give it to his accomplices. He struggled to get from me. He got his hand, and dropped the book down between his legs. A young man, a stranger, picked it up. The prosecutor exclaimed, I have lost my pocket-book: that is my property. I then took the prisoner into a shoe-maker's shop, and the prosecutor delivered the book up to me. I have had it ever since. I never lost sight of the prisoner from the time that he had the pocket-book until that pocket-book was given to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, the 8th of June, as I was passing along Oxford-street, I observed two sailors much intoxicated, surrounded by a number of people. Curiosity induced me to go along with the rest; among whom there was a gentleman who had lost his pocket-book. A gentleman, seeing a crowd he inquired the cause. He was informed a man was taken with a pocket-book. He had no more suspicion of me than any other person. I was taken to Marlborough-street. I can only attest, before your lordship, I am entirely innocent. I never was before a court of Justice in my life before. I am a stranger in London, and not succeeding in business in the country, I came to London, where it did not answer my expectation. I had firmly made up my mind to enter into His Majesty's service. I rely upon the candour of an impartial jury.</p>

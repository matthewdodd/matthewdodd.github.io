I was sent for to Mr. Thorn's residence at Great Ealing, on the 26th of Dec.—I went into his kitchen, and saw the prisoner—Mr. Thorn charged him with stealing a shirt of his—he directly said, "You will find a linen shirt in my box, but it is mine, my brother gave it me"—I asked for the key of his box—he gave it me—I asked him to go and show me his box, that there might be no mistake—I opened it, and found this shirt in it—the mark has been cut out, and there are holes where the mark has been.</p>

I took the prisoner from the sta<lb></lb>tion to the office—as we went he said the servant who had lived at Mr. Thorn's, had had two shirts of his to wash, and she had spoiled them by suffering them to lie in the water too long; and the shirt he was charged with stealing, he did nut steal, but the maid stole it, and put it between the bed and the mattress, and told him he was to have that shirt in exchange for the two she had spoiled—he said he was sorry he did not tell the officer the truth in the morning.</p>

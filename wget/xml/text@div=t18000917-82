             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a watchman of St. Clement Danes: On the morning of the 30th of July, I had just done crying the hour of three; it was just break of day; coming out of Bear-yard I heard a noise like a shutter or a door moving; I stepped forward and saw three men standing with their backs against a public-house shutter, the sign of the Lamb; I stepped towards them, and as they saw me coming towards them they walked on; I followed them, and found a shutter that I had seen last at one o'clock, broke open; I had tried it with my hand, and found it safe; I then left the shutter as it was, and pursued them; I called out, stop these three men with great coats on! and I sprung my rattle; they turned round the corner of Vere-Street, towards either Princes-Street or Wild-Street, and I lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner at the watch-house, was he dressed like one of the three men? - A. Yes; but I cannot swear to his being the man.</p>

               <p>Q.Was that Ragan? - A. Yes; one of them said, I think it was the prisoner, I am not sure, but one of them said, d-n his eyes, we will do this fellow; and the prisoner then immediately fired at me, and I received the contents in my neck; I have got here part of the shot that was in the handkerchief round my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he when he fired? - A. At the distance of six or eight yards; he immediately made his escape up Wild-Street towards Queen-Street; I pursued him as near as I possibly could, kept the rattle springing, and crying stop thief; I never lost sight of him till he was taken; I threw a stick at him, which made him stumble, but he did not fall, he recovered himself; two watchmen, and part of the hand of the Duke of York were at the corner; when he came very near them he took a turn, and squatted down underneath a shutter; he was doing so when the two watchmen came up; I told them to take care, for he had a pistol; upon taking him up the pistols lay underneath him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him after he had fired the pistol at you? - A. No, I never had.</p>

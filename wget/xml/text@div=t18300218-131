            , JUN. I am fourteen years old, and am the prosecutor's son. I locked the poultry up between five and six o'clock at night - there were thirteen fowls and three geese; I found the place broken open between six and seven next morning; the prisoner is a stranger; I saw the poultry at the watch-house three days after, all dead - I used to feed them, and knew them - the pick-axe did not belong to us; the door appeared to have been broken open with it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Paddington. About seven o'clock on Friday morning I was called up by the night-patrol, who said he had discovered a quantity of fowls under the hay-stack in a meadow close to my garden; he asked if he might stand in my stable to watch who came for them, and pointed to the prisoner, who, he said, was waiting about, and had passed him two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180061"></xptr>times near the spot - I gave him leave, and asked him to give me a description of the prisoner - I went out to look for him, and directly I got outside my garden-gate, the prisoner stood about a hundred yards off; he made off to the back of some buildings; I lost him, and found him concealed behind a wash-house; I went and asked him what he did there; he said he came to case himself; I said that would not do, he was my prisoner - he said, "I know you, and you know me" - I said, "That don't matter, you must go with me" - he said he would not - I collared him; he got from me two or three times, and made across to some new buildings, and then back to the meadows; we had several struggles; he wrestled my staff out of my hand; at last White came up and secured him - he said, "What do you want of me?" I said, "You know better than I do" - after he was in custody I and Chapman went and fetched the fowls to the watch-house, and counted them in his presence; there were thirteen fowls and three geese; we took his shoes off, brought them to the hay-stack, and the print of the shoes in the snow, both going to and coming from the stack, corresponded with his shoes; it was very severe weather; the shoes are nailed, and correspond with the nail-holes in every respect - we took him about half-past seven o'clock - I first saw him soon after seven - there is a path across the meadow - I took him into the meadow, which he had run into; I found the impression of every nail in the snow.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at the office, that I was only twenty yards from the hay-stack when you took me? A. I said a hundred yards: you were behind the washhouse, not in front - when I first saw you, you were about a hundred yards from the stack.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 22nd of January the serjeant came to me, and asked if all was right - I said I had not been to the hay-stack yet; I went there and found two geese and two fowls under some loose hay - I called the serjeant, and we found the whole quantity - I did not see the prisoner till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see two men stand talking at the watch-house, about half-past seven o'clock, as you went out? A. No; I went over the wooden bridge to Black Lion-lane, across the field to the footpath - I did not see you behind me.</p>

            . I am the night-patrol. On Friday morning, a few minutes before seven o'clock, I saw the patrol - I went to the stack and found the poultry, a basket, and a pickaxe in the basket; some of them were in a basket, and some loose; I watched to see who would come for them, and in a quarter of an hour the prisoner passed me, while I stood by the watch-box, about forty yards from the haystack - I looked after him, saw him return, and described him to Freeman; he would have liberated him. if it had not been for me; he was scuffling with him - we took him to the watch-house, and took off his shoes - I went to the haystack, and compared them with the foot-marks; the snow had rather drifted near the stack, and we could not match them there, but as far as the snow remained in the way to the stack, I found marks of the shoes, and the prints of the nails corresponded exactly - I saw nobody else lurking about; he was detained till we found the prosecutor, who swore to the poultry.</p>
               <p>GOULD KNIGHT. I am a Police-constable. I had the prisoner in my custody for stealing a fowl on the 1st of January, and know this pick-axe was in his possession then, for I took it from him about two o'clock in the morning; it was in my possession for a week, and then returned to his wife at the door of my house in East-street, Manchester-square; she lived in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove with the prisoner - I am quite sure it is the same axe; it is a peculiar kind of one; I know it by letters on it, and the basket very much corresponds with one he had, but has been fresh bound since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My wife sold the axe; it was not in my possession; it is not likely I should go by the witness, when I saw him turn up the road, and go right to where the property was concealed - I went right up Black Lion-lane; it was eight o'clock.</p>

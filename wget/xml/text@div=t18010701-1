               <p>Q. How did you lose it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the day did you take any notice of it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it in the fair? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed your watch after you left home? - A. Yes; I missed it about five o'clock in the afternoon, in the fair; Mr. Gearish, the witness, told me to mind my watch; I put my hand to my sob, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it go from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suppose your watch was missing, before Mr. Gearish spoke to you? - A. No; there was a great crowed about.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you hustled or shoved about? - A. Yes; there was a great deal of bustling, crowding, and pushing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner before Mr. Gearish spoke? - A. I think I saw him about five minutes before, about one hundred yards from the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at the time Gearish spoke to you, see the prisoner? - A. No; I saw my watch about ten minutes afterwards in Mr. Gearish's hand; the prisoner was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. About five in the afternoon, at these fort of fairs, there is a very great crowd? - A. I cannot say, I never was there before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether your watch was taken from you, or you lost it, you cannot say? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. There was, in point of fact, a great crowd? - A. There was.</p>
               <p>- GEARISH sworn. - On Monday, the 11th of May, I was walking with Laport in Hendon fair, about five o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the chain of his watch hanging out, I desired him to take care of his watch, there was a very great crowd pushing about; in about five minutes after he said to me, Gearish, I have lost my watch; I had observed the prisoner standing for five minutes next to Mr. Laport.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him next to Mr. Laport at the time you bid him take care of his watch? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you observe him stand next to Mr. Laport? - A. Till within two minutes of his missing his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear to be pushing? - A. I saw nothing particular at all; he was standing looking as well as we were; Mr. Laport and I then went among the mob, about one hundred yards, and I saw the prisoner with a stick in his hand, clearing the road for the girls to run for the smickets; I went up to him, and said, sir, you have got my friend's watch; he said, no, I have not, I am not the kind of person you take me to be; I said, I am positive you have the watch, you are the only person that was standing next to my friend when he missed his watch; I ordered a man of the name of Wicks, who ought to have been here, to collar him; he laid hold of one side, and I the other, and a man of the name of Bumby, a countryman, searched his pocket, and in his right hand coat pocket the watch was found; he forced himself to try to get away from us; I have had the watch ever since. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Laport. This is the watch that I lost; it is worth three guineas; it cost me about six guineas without the seal; I swapped it away for another in the Minories; I cannot say exactly what it cost me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Is Bumby here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Wicks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A fruit salesman, in Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never been in any unfortunate predicament yourself - you never have had the misfortune to be charged with any thing? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Dawkins? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Wicks or Bumby? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. They were bound over, were they not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Laport.) Q. How do you know that is your watch? - A. I know it by the seal, and there is the name of Lawrence, and the letters C. P. upon the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to the fair to see the country diversions; I was walking in the fair, and was accosted by Gearish, who said, I had got his friend's watch; I told him I was not a man of that description; a great mob came round, three or four hundred, I dare say, and a person outside of the crowd held up the watch; I am innocent of the charge, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010004"></xptr>Mr. Gurney. (To Gearish.) Q. Have you ever said that the prisoner was not the man that stole the watch? - A. I never have, because I am very certain I saw the watch taken out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not shewn it publicly at Carpenter's coffee-house? - A. Not out of my own hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take the watch out of the hand of a countryman outside the mob? - A. I did not; I saw Bumby take it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is a person who saw it taken from a countryman outside the mob.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go any where with her. - A. No, she followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get your watch. - A. She lowered the flap of my breeches to take out the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. A chain or a string to your watch. - A. A chain.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the man stab you with. - A. With a knife at the end of a stick; I kept fast hold of the prisoner, and took her to the watchhouse; the man went away after he got the watch, I never saw him afterwards; I never saw the man before he came up to me, and asked me what business I had with the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober. - A. Yes; I believe she was.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a stab was it. - A. Just by the hip.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not been any where with this woman. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did she walk with you. - A. Right across Bridge street; when she took my watch, I said to her you have got my watch, you shall not go till you give me my watch; then she gave the man the watch.</p>

            . I am a constable; the prosecutor brought this woman into the watchhouse, about two o'clock in the morning; he charged her with robbing him of his watch; I searched her, and found nothing on her; nor did he at the time mention any thing about the stab at the watchhouse, although he was about twenty minutes in the watch-house; he told me that he saw the watch go from her to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing about the stab. - A. On Monday he told me of it, and shewed it me; it was not deep, it was upon the hip bone, about the eighth of an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man sober. - A. He was rather the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. It was two o'clock instead of half past twelve. - A. I did not know it, he told me before I had made a mistake of the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home at one o'clock in the morning, I live over the water; I was crossing from Union street, I saw that man and two men with him; he wished me good night; he laid hold of me and gave me three halfpence to take a liberty with me; then he said I had taken his watch. I am innocent of it, he was very much in liquor.</p>

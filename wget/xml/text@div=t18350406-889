                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Mrs. Elizabeth Southon's, in the parish of Hillingdon. On Thursday, the 19th of March, I went out about a quarter before nine o'clock, and left-Vincent in the house, and Mrs. Southon—there were some lodgers up stairs—I returned at eleven o'clock, and let myself in at the front door, of which I have a key—I went through the back kitchen and observed the window-shutter was taken down, and a pane of glass taken out of the window—I never saw that so before—there is a small bolt to the shutter—the pane of glass which was taken out was about two feet from the bolt—when the window is thrown open, the shutter can be taken down—I went to the back door—that was put too, but not bolted—I went up stairs to a room which Griffin lodged in—he was out—I found some things lying about his room—there was a book and some wearing apparel lying on the floor—I went to the Eight Bells, and called him—he came back with me directly—it was then about ten min<lb></lb>nutes after eleven o'clock—we both went up to his room, and then I ex<lb></lb>amined my room—I had lost a coat and waistcoat—the prisoner is the son of Mrs. Southon, but did not live in the house—he had been there several times, but did not sleep there while I was there—I saw my things next day, about one o'clock, in possession of Fair, the horse-patrol—my coat and waistcoat had been in a box in my room.</p>

I listened still, and heard her speech getting very weak; I did not go at first, because there were often such cries; I thought he was beating her, or pulling her hair; then I went up into the room, and she was crying, Ned, my life! my life, Ned! and so on: on my opening the door, she was on the furthermost side of the room; he was between me and the door; she was standing, leaning back, with her hands by her side, against the wall; he was standing staring in her face, close enough; he had something in his right hand, which I could not tell what it was; he had a candle in his left hand, and he was stabbing her in my sight, all the while before me, and also before I got into the room; I saw him stabbing her; and he said to me, what brought you here, you whore? I will serve you the same; when I saw the man stabbing the woman I got as soon as I could on the landing-place; I bawled out, murder! the woman is done for; then I called out, Mrs. Thorpe! Mrs. Thorpe! the woman is done for now: Mrs. Thorpe lived in the floor facing me: she sent me to the shop to get a man to go up; I could not get ever a man there; then I went to look for the patrol, and when I came back I found Mrs. Thorpe and the patrol at the door; I was not absent half an hour: we went up stairs in the prisoner's room, and found her on the flat of her back, on the floor; we all went into the room: the prisoner was standing on the landing place, in custody of a constable: I supported the deceased's head; I saw her guts out of one side: the poor woman said nothing to me, only to undo her stays and things, for she was swelling up so much, she said, and to send for the doctor, and the gentleman, the clergyman, that she should confess to him: as the prisoner was taking to the justice, he said to the deceased,</p>
               <p>"Peggy, was it not the scissars that did it, that were hanging to your side when I wanted to get the money out of your pocket?" and she made him no answer; and he said,</p>

               <p>Who did she mean by her husband? - The prisoner. She died on the Monday morning; the wound she had received was the cause of her death.</p>

               <p>GUILTY, on the coroner's inquisition.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice ASHURST.</p>
               <p>Proclamation being made, the Recorder passed sentence as follows:</p>
               <p>Prisoner at the bar. You have been convicted after the patient hearing of a discreet jury, to whom you could make no objection, of the very heinous crime of murder; that you may make the best use of the short space of time that is allotted to murderers to remain among us, I announce to you the dreadful information, that the court are perfectly satisfied with the verdict of the jury, by which you are doomed to almost immediate death: bad as the crime of murder is in every case, your crime is highly aggravated by the consideration, that you by cohabiting with this woman had taken her under your pecullar protection; the blow given by you to this woman is not only unlawful as a member of civil society, but it was disgraceful to you as a man; it was an attack made by the strong on the weak; it was an attack made by a man with a deadly weapon in his hand, on a poor defenceless woman; it was attended with a Brutal ferocity, and accompanied with expressions that would disgrace the most ignorant and the most inhuman savage; such as I shall not repeat, because they are too shocking for the hearing of such an audience: this, prisoner, was a conduct which nothing could justify or even mitigate, but a direct and violent attack on your own existence: your mind must have been callous to the feelings of humanity, and to the well-being of others. Let me most seriously now recommended to you, to pay some attention to your own welfare, and to your present situation, and to make the best use of your time; cut off from all hope in this world, if possible, to make your peace with God hereafter: and I, prisoner, pray to the Almighty God, that the execution which you are now about in a most publick manner to suffer, may become a serious example to deter others in future, who may be disposed to commit such violent outrages, against, and in defiance of, the laws of God and man, and to the injury of society. Nothing remains for me but that I pass upon you the sentence of the law; which sentence is, That you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence on Monday next to a place of execution, there to be <rs id="t17901208-1-punish5" type="punishmentDescription">

                  </hi> I live in Ashby-street, King's-cross—I am an unfortunate girl. On 1st April, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in the New-road with Jane Randall, who lives with me—the prisoner, who is also an unfortunate girl, came up and said to Randall, "You b—y little cow, I have got you now, and I will put the key in your head"—I pushed her away and said, "No, you <hi rend="italic">won't</hi>," and she directly struck me on the head with a street-door key—it was not a very large one; it cut my head, and it bled very much—Randall screamed "Police!" and the prisoner directly struck her on the head—I did not feel any inconvenience till the next Friday night, when erysipelas came on—I went to the hospital—I am getting on very well now—I feel it painful now and then.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at the University Hospital. The prosecutrix came there on Monday, 10th April—I examined her head, and found, on the front of the scalp, a wound about three quarters of an inch long—it was imperfectly healed, surrounded by erysipelas—a door key would be very likely to cause such a wound—I should suppose it had been a confused wound—the wound was not dangerous to life, but the erysipelas might have been—it might probably have happened by a fall—the skin was broken, and the scalp torn.</p>

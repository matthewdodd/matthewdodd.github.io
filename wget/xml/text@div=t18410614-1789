                  </hi>. I am a linendraper in Blackfriars-road—the prisoner was in my employ. On the 30th of May, before church<lb></lb>time, he was in the act of going down stairs—I called him into my parlour, and said, "How do you spend your Sundays?"—he said sometimes he went to church—I then asked him what he had got in his pocket, having missed goods—he told me "Nothing"—I told him to take out what he had—he took out different papers, and said, "That is all"—I then told him to take out what else he had got, and after some time he took out these gloves—I asked how he came by them—he said he did not know how they came into his pocket—I took him down into the shop, and the paper was open that these gloves came from—I said they were my property, and I would send for a policeman—while the servant was gone for a policeman, he said, if I forgave him this time he would never do it again—I said I had been robbed so many times, I would make an example of him—he afterward said he intended to pay for them before he left the house—my servant have not the power to help themselves—this pair of gloves had been tied up on Saturday night.</p>

               <p>he tried to escape—I pushed him into the shop, but never struck him—the gloves he had did not fit him—they arc for a larger person—I found this squirt, these pills, and these pieces of rag in his pocket.</p>

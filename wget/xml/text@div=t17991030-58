               <p>Q. What did Monk say she was worth? - A. He said, he thought she was worth about 4l. she was very poor; then he asked me where the man was; I told him in the tap-room; then Mr. Monk asked him if he could bring any body to witness who he was; he said he could not then; Mr. Monk sent for an officer and he was taken into custody; he said he had brought her from his brother's a horse-dealer; that his brother had sent him up to sell it; but I cannot recollect where he said he came from; the Police-officer found out the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy the horse? - A. Mr. Monk, and all the boilers, allow me one shilling a piece for every horse that I get them; I bought it for Mr. Monk.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street: On the 22d of October, I met Palmer in Whitechapel; he asked me to go with him to the Star and Garter public-house, to take charge of a man on suspicion of having stolen a horse; when I went into the public-house, he was sitting in the box; I asked him who that horse belonged to that was tied opposite the door; he said it belonged to him; I asked him where he had it from; he said, he had it from his brother; I asked him where his brother lived, and he said in Hoddesdon; I asked him what his brother's name was; he said, his name was White, that he dealt in horses; I searched him, and found some horse's hair in his pocket, which corresponded with the hair upon the horse's tail; I asked him how he came to cut the hair off the horse's tail; he said, he had a right to do as he pleased; I found a turnpike ticket in his hat, which belonged to Stamford-hill turnpike; I told my brother officer, I suspected it had come off the Forest; I went next day, and met a man in the forest; I described the mare to him, and he told me he knew the mare; I found Hills, and shewed him the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hills). Was the mare that Nowlan shewed you, the same mare that you lost? - A. Yes; she had lost part of the hair off her tail.</p>
               <p>Q. What is she worth? - A. Six pounds; she is found, as far as I know, wind and limb.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she had a foal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. Only one; she had a wen upon the side of her belly, which I cut off by tying a horse-hair round it, and there is the mark of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had the mare of my brother, at Hoddesdon.</p>

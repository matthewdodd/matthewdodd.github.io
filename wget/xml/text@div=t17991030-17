             sworn. - I am a watchman; I have often seen the prisoner, I was on duty on the 14th of this month, in Broad-street; I heard a cry of "stop that woman!" I stopped her and called her by her name; says I, Mrs. Wilson, that cry is after you; No, says she, it is not; says I, you must stop till the man comes up; and then he gave charge of her for robbing him of two half-crowns; as I was going to the watch-house with her, she slipped two half-crowns into my hand. I have had them ever since.(Produces them.) The beadle marked them that night; he told the constable of the night he could swear to one of them; it had a cross on the head side.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This half-crown I can swear to; I was as sober as I am at present; I had been sitting up with an acquaintance that was sick.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brown.) Did the prosecutor appear to be sober at the time? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He asked me to take him home with me; I went with him to the wine-vaults in Drury-lane; he made very free with me, outside the door, and he gave me these two half-crowns for making free with me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brown.) Did she say any thing of this kind at the time she was taken to the watch-house? - A. No, she did not; she said they were her own half-crowns.</p>

On the 22d of January the beds were to be made up after the vacation, and I found 7 blankets less than there ought to have been; she was the only servant in the house at the time; I spoke to her about it; she denied all knowledge of the robbery. In consequence of what I afterwards heard, I went to a pawnbroker's in the neighbourhood, but did not find my property there; on the Thursday, I got another account, and told the prisoner she must leave, but I would not turn her out on the Saturday night, but let her stay till Monday - the new servant found a quantity of duplicates in a napkin, which I looked over; the prisoner was out at the time; I did not see any more of her till she was brought by an officer; this was on the day after the duplicates were found; I told her I was not satisfied with her conduct, and had got an officer to search her, and that she had better give the duplicates up; she said she had none, except some out of date; the duplicates found by my new servant were not locked up; I took a copy of them, and told the new servant to put them in the same place - this mark on the table cloth was made by me.</p>

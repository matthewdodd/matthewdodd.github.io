                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Charles James Mat<lb></lb>thews—I have a house at Notting Hill, Kensington—I had it last year, before I went to America—the prisoner was in my-service from the feb<lb></lb>ruary previous—she was a person in whom I placed very great confidence—when I left, it was arranged that my house should be let furnished, if a tenant could be found—Mr. Hay, the auctioneer, was employed to let it—I left the house in charge of the prisoner—the linen was not to be let with the house—it was locked up in one of the attics, except a portion, which was for the prisoner's use—I took the key of the attic with me—I return<lb></lb>ed in December, and went to my house—I missed some trivial things be<lb></lb>longing to the kitchen—and one drawer, in which some goods were, had been opened—in a few days, I missed some more things—I made inquiry about them, and frequently in the presence of the prisoner—she gave me no in<lb></lb>formation about them whatever—among other things, I missed six pairs of sheets, five table-cloths, a shawl, a kettle, a lamp, a cake-mould, a basket, a, bag, a pair of sheets, a curtain, a towel, an inkstand, and six yards of shawl-bordering—they were worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of my ser<lb></lb>vants left me after I returned, and before the prisoner was taken—suspi<lb></lb>cion at last fell on the prisoner, and Mr. Matthews sent for Shackle—(<hi rend="italic">ex<lb></lb>amining some articles</hi>)—this is my table-cloth—my table-cloths are marked? but the mark has been taken out of this, and the place has been darned over—here are some remains of the red mark in it how—here is a fac-simile of it—here is a pair of sheets of mine—my mark is on one of them—this bag, curtain, towel, kettle, and this shawl are mine—also this lamp and ink<lb></lb>stand.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the prisoner a widow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She informed me she was so, and had two children—I had a good character of her—these articles were mine before I married Mr. Matthews—I saw them safe in my house on the day previous to my departure from England</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080158"></xptr>
               <p>—I am quite sure I saw this shawl—and these sheets were there, because my number was right—I made a list the day before I went—I went at six o'clock in the morning, and went to Bristol direct—Mr. Hay came to take an inventory of the goods in the house, with the exception of the linen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say there were a few articles about, good for nothing, that the prisoner might have? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> caps and shoes—this table-cloth is not an old one—it has not been much used—it had not been used as a duster or cover—I made a point of counting my linen once a week—I had a person living in my house of the name of Swaine—I charged her with taking some embroidered work and pocket-handkerchiefs, but no caps—I charged the prisoner with giving some ribbons to Swaine—she said they were lying about the house, and she supposed she must have taken them—I did not charge her with stealing them—this kettle stood on the table, with a lamp under it—I had seen it in my house in Notting Hill—when I left England I gave the prisoner a written character—I afterwards saw it in the kitchen, in 'the presence of Mr. Shackle—I said it was of no value to her then, and it was thrown into the fire—I do not think I stated in that how long the prisoner had lived with me, but I am not quite certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to the prisoner, "You have lived with me five months, but a five months' character will be of no use to you; I shall say you lived with me fifteen or eighteen months?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir, decidedly not—I am almost certain I did not state any time in the written character, and I am certain I did not state that time—I wrote as to her honesty, which was quite sufficient, I thought—I was informed that the lodgings at which these things were found belonged to a sister of the prisoner, named Taylor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You considered her to bear a good character when you left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I gave her the character the day before I left—I thought whoever took the house might employ her—when Shackle came the prisoner gave me her key—I opened the tea-chest, and there was the character—I threw it into the fire—I do not think the prisoner made any observation on that—I left her 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay my tradesmen, and she disposed of that correctly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Bow-street On Wednesday, the 6th of March, I went to the prosecutor's house at Notting Hill. I saw the prisoner, and told her Mr. Matthews had been robbed of a great number of things, and told her what they were, having a list of them—I asked if she knew any thing about them—she said, no, she did not—I asked if she had any objection to my searching her boxes—she said, no, she had not—(I then requested Mr. and Mrs. Matthews to accompany me with her up stairs, and they did)—I saw the tea-chest opened, and the character was in it—Mrs. Matthews said, "This is the character I gave you—it can be of no use to you now"—the prisoner said, "No," and it was thrown on the kitchen fire immediately—she told me where her children were, and I went with her to No. 5, Church-lane, to the first floor, searched two rooms, and found the articles produced—I showed Mrs. Matthews the marks on them—I said, "Are these your things?"—she said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "They are not yours"—I found these sheets there, made</p>

               <p>into a bed—a quantity of wool was sewn in between them—I showed them to Mrs. Matthews, article by article, and she identified them—the prisoner said, "They are not yours,"—I then told her that as Mrs. Matthews would swear to the things, I must take her to Bow-street—after she was re<lb></lb>manded I saw her in the cell—she then said she had taken the things a week before in mistake—that she and her children had been stopping in Mrs. Matthews's house, and she had taken them away in a hurry, in mistake, and she was sorry for it—when I had read the list over to her at Mrs. Matthews's, she said she knew nothing of them—that list included the table-cloth, the sheets, the towels, and a great number of other things, and she said she knew nothing about any of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Mr. Matthews's parlour—it was after I found the things produced that the prisoner said she had taken them by mistake—she did not appear agitated and frightened when I spoke to her—I found the things at the lodgings, of her sister, Mrs. Taylor—the prisoner said she had exerted herself a good deal to get things ready, and these things were taken in the hurry.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Catherine Parry and Sons. We are tallow-chandlers in Fleur-de-lis-court, Spitalfields—Harwood was our errand-boy for about three months—on Friday morning, the 11th of January, our man found a sack in the cellar, which he brought up to me—it had the appearance of having had tallow in it—I desired him to put it where he found it—about five o'clock, Harwood left to go to tea—I followed, with our man—he went into the shop of the prisoner March, in Lamb-street—it is an oil-shop—I went in, and saw Harwood and March there, and the bag which I had seen before, was on the weighing-machine—Har<lb></lb>wood was taking the money off the counter as I went in, and March was behind the counter—the bag contained thirty-six pounds of Russia tallow—I asked Harwood what he did there—he said he came to buy soap and soda—I pointed to the bag—he then immediately began to cry, and begged I would forgive him, as his father had died that morning, and he did it to buy a coffin—I told March I was surprised he should buy tallow of such a boy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040203"></xptr>
               <p>as that—he made me no answer—he was serving a customer at the time—he asked me to walk into his parlour—I did so, and he told me he bought it in consequence of the boy representing that his father was a pastry-cook, and this was his perquisite, that he said it was dripping, and he bought it for dripping—I said I thought that was impossible, for I remembered him coming to our shop to buy candles, and putting them to his nose to try the quality—I thought he could not make that mistake—I left the shop, and gave Harwood into custody—I went again and saw March—I asked him how much he had of it—he shewed me two casks which had been in his possession—I asked if that was the whole he had got—he said he believed that was the whole—I said he must know if he had any more—he said, no, he believed he had not—Harwood was not there then—Mrs. March came, and asked me to look over the place—I went into the passage, and found another cask—I said "You forgot this"—he said "Yes, I had forgotten that"—I asked him what he had given the boy for it—he said 21/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, as dripping—I said that was a very inferior price, as we were giving, for common kitchen-stuff, 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt—I told him it cost us 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt., which would be about 61/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—I then took March into custody—there was about 21/2 cwt. altogether in the three casks—I believe it to be my tallow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil-man, and live in Chiswell-street. I have known March seventeen or eighteen years—he has borne a most excellent character—the shop in Lamb-street was taken by his son about three months ago to carry on the business of an Italian warehouseman which his employers are—the prisoner was only there to take care of the goods for his son—I valued the stock when the shop was taken—I do not think the prisoner knew the name of one article in the shop—he came and asked me several times to tell him what different things were—the shop was advertised to be let shortly after, and the prisoner continued to have charge of it, till a tenant was found—I deal in kitchen-stuff and dripping—it is sold at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb. in retail shops—not one person in twenty out of the trade would know the difference between dripping and Russia tallow—children gene<lb></lb>rally bring such things.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">MILLER</hi>. I am an oil-man. I occupied the shop before it was let to the prisoner's son—the prisoner expressed his utter ignorance of the quality and name of most of the things—I was often called in to tell the name of things, and I expressed my opinion that he was very unfit to remain there—I deal in kitchen-stuff and tallow—there is a great deal of difference in kitchen-stuff in a melted state—a man might mistake tallow for it.</p>

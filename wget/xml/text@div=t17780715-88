               <p>I am book-keeper at the White-Horse Inn, Cripplegate. A large quantity of plate was delivered at the inn by Cooper, to be sent into Yorkshire. I have a room in the inn yard where I sleep; there is a room parted off that room which is a kitchen, where I keep and dress my victuals; I board myself; the ostler sleeps in an apartment over me; the warehouse into which I put the plate is on the ground floor; it was locked with two locks; I left it safe and secure when I went to bed, and there was a dog left loose in the yard that night: I did not hear the dog in the night. The ostler called me about five in the morning and said, the warehouse was broke open; I went to the warehouse and found it had been broke open with chissels; the staple was wrenched, the bar was bent double, and the padlock lay on the ground, and there was a great deal of plate gone; we found three of the pacquets broke open. A bricklayer came in the morning and informed us, that there was a great quantity of plate at the watch-house.</p>

On the 4th of June in the night, just as I had been my rounds and returned into the watch-house at about two o'clock, a watchman came and said, he had for some time seen some suspicious people looking very hard at him. I went up Paul's-alley, which leads from Red-Cross-street to Aldersgate-street; I met two men in the alley; I took no notice of them, but went through the alley through Hare-court, into Aldersgate-street; I saw nothing amiss; I waited in Paul's-alley, and in about ten minutes Philips came to me; soon after we saw

The watchman would have ran at him when he was at a distance, but I took him by the arm and pulled him back, that the man might come nearer to us; when he came within about five yards of the watchman, I made a blow at him with the staff; but seeing the staff, he fell down before the staff touched him; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150068"></xptr> watchman fell upon him and we secured him.

There were a dozen plates in a bag which had a parting between every one; I suppose the bag belonged to the family; there were four silver butter-boats and covers, and I think a cream cover was found in his pockets when he was searched in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. On the 4th of June a little before two in the morning, I saw two men come down Paul's-alley, which is facing my stand; one of them went down one side of the way; the other, the other; and I saw two men go up, and a man and a woman backwards and forwards; I thought by the manner of their going on, they were about something that was bad; I went up to the watch-house and spoke to Mr. Negus and Mr. Shephard; Mr. Negus and Mr. Shephard came down to see if any thing wrong was going forward; Mr. Negus and I went up into the alley; while he and I were talking together, up came Davis; I saw him very bulky in his pockets, and he had something under his arm; I asked him what he had got there; he gave me some brumpt answer; I insisted upon knowing; I seized him by the collar, and lifted up my staff in case he should resist; he did not do that; whether he tumbled back or I pushed him back I cannot say, but he tumbled down and I upon of him; Mr. Negus immediately assisted me; we pulled him up; there was a dozen plates in a pair of breeches fell down upon the ground when he fell down; the rest of the things were in his pocket; they were in a little boy's breeches; we took him to the watch-house; there were four butter-boats and the covers, and there was one tureen cover if not two when he was secured; Mr. Negus and I came out again to lay in wait, if we could light of any more of them; I went up into the alley, Mr. Negus stayed in the street; he said if any body came up, I was to attack them in the front and he would follow them and keep them up behind; soon after, two men Holt and

I was pretty sure he was one, so I seized him by the collar; he dropped a large parcel of plate out of his hand, done up in a green cloth like a bundle; and Mr. Negus seized

               <p>And you could see at that time clearly that it was bulky? - Yes, by the light of the lamps.</p>

               <p>Whether it was not so much day light that all the lanterns were out? - I put my lantern out at the watch-house and left it there because I would not be discovered by them to be a watchman.</p>

               <p>DAVIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been at Barnet the day before with a pair of horses for a gentleman; as I was returning home with a Barnet chaise about two in the morning I saw a man coming along. Old-street; I stooped down just as I came up to him, the man did not see me at first; it was about fifty yards from the watch box, then he looked round and saw me and ran away immediately, I picked up the breeches; there were two or three covers in it, and the green parcel of plate by it.</p>

             at Cripplegate; he asked me if I would have any thing to drink; we went to an opening at the bottom of White Cross street, where a number of drays stand; he picked up this bundle of plate and put it into his pocket; Phillips swears as false as the child that is unborn; I had no bundle when he stopped me; I had not a six-pence nor I believe a shilling in my pocket, no knife nor any thing; I believe these things were taken from Carleton when they stopped me; but I was not in company with him at that time.</p>

               <p>We were in company and picked up the plate together; I picked up the two candlesticks in this wide place, and the pistol lay by it; some man I suppose left them there.</p>

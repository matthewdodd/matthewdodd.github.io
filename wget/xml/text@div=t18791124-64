                  </hi>. I am servant to William Hill, a fancy dealer, of 37, New Out, Lambeth—on Friday evening, 17th October, the prisoner came in for a set of studs, price 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me a florin, which looked more like lead than silver—I sent the boy who minds the doer for change, and the prisoner took it from his hand and said that he would get change—he went out, taking the florin with him, and did not return that night—he left the studs—he came again on 28th October, about 0.0 p.m., for a glass, price 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I knew him again directly—he put a florin on the counter—my master's daughter went to fetch her father, who came in while I was putting the florin in the trier, and took it and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

I am 11 years old, and mind Mr. Hill's shop-door—on Friday, 17th October, Crask gave me a florin to get change; but the prisoner took it out of my hand, and I said "I will go and get change"—he went out, and I watched him; I don't think he mentioned the tobacconist's—he turned round when he got to the next shop, and I saw no more of him—the florin was of a dullish colour.</p>

I keep the shop at 37, New Out—on 28th October, about 5.45, my daughter came to me, and I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner put a florin down on the glass case—Crask took it up; I took it from her, and found it was bad—I said to the prisoner "You are the chap I have been looking for; now I have got you—he said "What does it mean, what is the matter?"—I gave him in custody, with the florin—I have seen him in the shop before, and had given Crask direc<lb></lb>tions if he came again.</p>

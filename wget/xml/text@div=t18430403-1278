                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in Parson's-street, Stepney—between six and seven o'clock on the evening of the 1st of March the pri<lb></lb>soner came for a three-halfpenny cheroot—he paid me a Queen's coin shilling—I put it in the till, and thought it was good, being the Queen's coin—about an hour after, the prisoner came in again for another three-halfpenny cheroot, and said the d----d girls had snatched the other out of his mouth—he gave me another shilling—I noticed it was of the Queen's reign—I put that in the till where I had put the other—no one had been to the till be<lb></lb>tween the time I put the first in and the second—soon after the prisoner came in the last time I went to the till to look at what money I had—I found one or two half-crowns, a George the Fourth shilling, and two shillings of the Queen's reign which I had taken of the prisoner—about four o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 5th of March, the prisoner came again and paid me another Queen's coin shilling—I looked at it and found it was bad—I told him to, and that he had uttered two bad shillings on the Wednesday before—he said he might have passed one upon me, not knowing it—I wrapped the two shillings up in a piece of paper, and gave them, with the third shil<lb></lb>ling, to the inspector at the station, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

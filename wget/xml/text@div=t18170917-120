            . My husband is a porter at the Swan inn. I was going up Holborn-place between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, on Monday, the 15th of September, towards Gardiner's house, and saw the prisoner come out of his door with a large bundle under his arm; I saw Bottomley in the court, and shewed the prisoner to him, and said he had come out of Gardiner's house, he said there was nobody at home there, and ran after him immediately - I never lost sight of him until he was taken, and am certain he is the man-it was between two and three o'clock.</p>

            . I am a porter at the top of the court. Mrs. Adams came up and asked me if I had seen the man go by with the bundle, I said, No; and she said there is the man on the other side of the way, with the bundle, come out of Gardiner's house. I followed him, he went along Shoe-lane, until he got into Chancery-lane, to the corner of White's-alley; he stopped there, a woman came up to him, and they walked on together - I kept behind them; when they got to No. 66, Chancery-lane, he put the bundle down and sat up on it, wiping his face-the woman sat by his side for about ten minutes; he told her to mind the bundle while he called a coach, I heard him plainly - He left the bundle; I collared him, and told him to take it back to where he brought it from, as I knew it was stolen. I looked into the bundle it contained the clothes tied up in a sheet; I told him I should keep him until an officer came - I could not find one. The gentleman at No. 66, took the bundle in; I took him to the Compter; when I got there they told me to get an officer to give him in charge, they kept him there the while; the officer searched him, but found nothing on him. We went back to Gardiner's house, and found the one pair of stairs room door open, and two of the drawer locks in a chest broken off, and one of the sheets gone off the bed. I fetched Gardiner, and told him the bundle was at No. 66, Chancery-lane; I took him there, it was delivered into my hands, and he claimed the property.</p>

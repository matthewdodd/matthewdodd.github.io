                  </hi>. I have heard the evidence of the officer I had engaged a carriaage from keppel-mews that day to go to guildhall, and the prisoner accompanied it-another drove, and the prisoner assisted as footman-being in distress for a servant, as my footman had gone to see the show, the prisoner offered his services, and having a livery coat, I engaged him to act as footman—I was attended by my lady to guildhall—at the time I left my own house, she observed that she had dropped her bracelet—I think the prisoner must have heard it—he was near enough—I said, "It must be between here and the huse"—Mrs. Adams said, "I have no doubt left it in the room, we are rather late. and we will drive on" I was sent for to the justice-room, at Guildhall, and it was produced to me (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know this to be hers—I did not return in the same carriage, for while it was gone to fish street hill, Mr. Ward took compas<lb></lb>sion on us, and drove us home.</p>

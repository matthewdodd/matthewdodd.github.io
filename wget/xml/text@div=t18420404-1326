I am in partnership with William Bradbury, as printers, in Whitefriars—ours is the only house in London that prints "Chambers's Edinburgh Journal"—the prisoner Andrews was our apprentice, and acted as a machine-man—there are six machines in the machine-room—Andrews worked at the machine we call No. 2—there are two machines close together on the right immediately you go in at the door—when the copies of the journal are taken from the machine, they are laid down quite flat on a board by the side, on one another—they are then counted up in hundreds, and folded over once, then taken up into the ware-house to be dried, and afterwards distributed to the trade—copies are never sent out to the trade in a wet state and folded but once—they are simply folded so for the purpose of counting in hundreds—Andrews by being in the machine-room, would have the opportunity of possessing himself of a hundred numbers of wet sheets folded once—I am not aware at which ma<lb></lb>chine No. 528 of the journal was printed—a person named Hall worked</p>

I am seventeen years old, and have been in the establishment about three years—I live at No. 10, Zoar-street, Southwark—Andrews was in a differ<lb></lb>ent department—on Wednesday evening, the 9th of March, about half-put seven o'clock, I was going home in company with Robert M'Cauley, another apprentice, and in Fig Tree-court, Temple, I saw Andrews, about the centre of the court, with a round parcel under his arm, rolled up and wrapped round with an old brown paper wrapper, like this now pro<lb></lb>duced—one end of it was open behind, so that I could discern that it con<lb></lb>tained paper—I believe along the Temple would be the nearest way to Holy<lb></lb>well-street from Whitefriars.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Holywell-street, Strand, for the sale of weekly publications. On Friday evening, the 4th of March, the prisoner Carter came and asked me if I dealt in "Chambers's Journal"—I told him no, nothing of any consequence, I had been for the last three years conducting the business for my brother, but our business was large, and I did not enter into any other publications—he said if I did, he could supply me very largely at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I asked if they were the right copies—he said, "Yes," and went over and fetched one—I knew that the regular price was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he brought one over to me, which he left—I said I could not say any thing to it, I would look it over, as that was not the proper price, and the publishing day of that week was over—I told him I would make inquiry among the trade, but be would understand that was not the proper price—he said his reason for offering it was, he had dealings with a printer, that he took a certain quantity, and if he did not sell them he took them again, and that their dealings together were only in money—he said it would not be worth his while to take them unless I could promise to take 100 dozen or more—next morning, Saturday, the 5th of March, he came to me again—I told him I would make inquiry among the trade during the week—on Wednesday, the 9th, he again came over during the day—I told him that I had made inquiry among the trade, and that they would take them, provided the goods were right—I told him I supposed I might depend upon him that they were right, and I was to have the quantity named, which was 100 dozen—he said, "Yes"—he said I could have them on Wednesday if I pleased—I said Thursday morning was the publishing morning—he said I could have them on Wednesday night if I chose—about half-past ten o'clock that night he came, and brought with him these 100 copies of "Chamber's Journal" now produced—I asked him if that was all—he said, "All, to-night"—I told him I thought it was a pity, if that was all, to have mentioned it to me, because that was not sufficient to supply one publisher—he said I could have more to-morrow—he did not say how many—no arrangement was made about paying for the 100 dozen on Wednesday—I said, "You can leave them, had I better pay for them now or when you bring the remainder of the quantity stated?"—he said, "Very well, I will leave them"—after he was gone I examined the 100 copies—they were wet, and folded once, just as they come from the printers—they were not folded as I had seen them in the trade—I left them as they were till the morning—the publishers sent, and I refused to sell them—I went to a publisher in the street, made inquiry, and a com<lb></lb>munication was consequently made to the prosecutors—on the following morning, the witness Humphreys came to me, and I delivered to him about a dozen of the copies Carter had left with me—about one o'clock the same day (Thursday) Carter came to me again, and said, "How about Jose ' Chambers?"—I said, "I have done nothing with them, they lay here as you left them, but as you have not brought any more, I shall not think of doing any thing with them"—he said, "The party is at my house now, I will make inquiry when you can have any more"—he went away, returned in about a minute, and said I could have another hundred in the evening, that he thought that was all I could have that week, but I could</p>

In consequence of directions I received from Mr. Evans, I went to Mrs. M'Arthur's in Holy well-street, on Thursday, the 10th of March, somewhere between twelve and one o'clock in the morning—she showed me a parcel of the journal, No. 528—they were quite wet, apparently as if just from the machine, and were rolled up in this sheet of paper, which is one of the set-off sheets—that is, a sheet which has been through the machine several times—we never allow those sheets to go off the premises in a whole state, we always tear them up or destroy them—they are never sold—I have the custody of all the stock of this publication—it is one for which there is a considerable demand—before the weekly numbers go to the trade, they must pass through my hands—on Wednesday, the 9th of March, a portion of No. 528 had gone through my hands in sheets, to Messrs., Orr the publishers, and 8500 copies to Mr. Bone, the folder, for the purpose of being delivered by him to Mcssrs. Orr, the publishers,</p>

               <p>wrappers are not common pieces of brown paper—they are peculiar wrap<lb></lb>pers, which come from Scotland with the paper—there is no mark on them, but we only have that sort of paper in the house, which comes from Scotland—I cannot say whether other places have wrappers like them.</p>

On the Thursday evening I went to Carter's house, in Holy well-street—I was in plain clothes—I have heard the account given by Beard of what passed between myself and Carter in the shop—it is quite correct—I received from Mrs. M'Arthur the four parcels I have produced—they were unfolded, just as they are now.</p>

               <p>young man was in the shop, Andrews came in; he was only in the shop a few minutes, but before he left he did speak to him, and I thought by that he might know him; if it had not been for what Mrs. M'Arthur said to me, I should have had nothing to do with the journals; it was through her advice that I had anything at all to do with them.</p>

I am a rope merchant, and live at Pensbry, in the Walworth-road—on 20th December last, I was going to lunch at my son's brewery in Whit ecbapel—it is my custom to go there almost every day, and I generally pass up Little Alie-street—that is the direct road—I generally wear my coat as it is now, unbuttoned—I have an over-coat—I had a watch with a gold chain across mywaistcoat which could be seen, on 20th December—I generally wear it in that way—the chain was visible—it was u near a quarter to 1 as could be—the prisoner Williams came in front of me, took my watch out of my pocket, caught the chain, and broke it—I caught the chain in my left hand, and this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was left behind in my hand, and the watch and the other part of the chain were taken—Williams did not say anything to me before he did this—as soon as he had got away I called "Police!" and "Stop thief!" and then some one tried to put their legs between mine and trip me up—I could not see who that per-son was—Graham then came up and hit me on the ear and I was knocked or kicked down—they then ran away—I have not the slightest doubt as to the identity of Williams and Graham—it was a bright clear day—the value of the watch and chain was about twenty guineas.</p>

I am twelve years old, and live at 31, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel—about a quarter to 1 on 20th December I was in Little Alie-street, and saw the prisoner Williams running down the street with a watch-chain hanging over his thumb—I knew him before—he used to be on the hot stones outside a sugar house in Lambeth-street—I have seen him there—I saw the prisoner Kinkin—he was about six yards before Williams, and he ran his hardest—I had seen Kinkin's face before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the H division of police—I know the last witness, and know his father to be a respectable man—I was at the police-station on Thursday, 17th January, when the prisoner Kinkin was brought in—on the same day Captain Harrison, the assistant commissioner of police, came in and spoke to the prisoner—after he was gone Kinkin said, "He is very much like the old gentleman that was robbed; I thought he would have picked me out"—nothing was said before that about Mr. Bushell being robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not Capital Harrison a much larger man altogether than Mr. Bushell; could you mistake one for the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is something like him at first sight—he is ladler and stouter—he has grey hair similar to Mr. Bushell.</p>

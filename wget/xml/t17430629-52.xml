               <p>S. J. Moses. These People are entire Strangers to me, I have known the Woman (Joseph,) some Time, she used to bring Usquebaugh and strong Liquors to my House, and my Wife has sometimes bought of her; she said her Husband was a Distiller: One Day I was in my Compting-House, doing Business with my Clerk, and saw her with my Wife, said she, here's a Bit of Chints she has to sell. I was not for her buying it, because I thought it was rotten; my Wife said she would put a Linning to it, and it would serve for the Nursery, and she gave her 9 s. for it. She said her Husband was dead, and she was going to sell off all her Things; that Quilt stands me in 30 s. and I can buy a new one cheaper; that Man in the Blue Coat said, he wanted to say something to my Wife in private, he went to Alderman Heathcote for a Warrant, and he knowing me to be a Man of Credit, he would not allow it, (grant it.) I said to the Man, Sir, you are a Stranger to me, if you will give me the Charge I have been at, you shall have it.</p>

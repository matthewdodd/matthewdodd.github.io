               <p>A. Gowen. No, for I saw nobody to Subsist me. But there was another Man stood by the Prisoner when he robbed me; and he said to the Prisoner: If you do not give her the Money again, we are undone, for she knows ye.</p>

             came to me crying, and said, her Friend had given her a small parcel of Mony, and a Man had taken it from her, but she knew where he lived. I bid her go and see if he would not return it; and she went, but came back again, and said, he bid her be gone about her business. So at last he was carried before a Justice, and while we were at the Justice's House, but before we went into the Room where the Justice was, I heard her say to the Prisoner, Are not you the Man that took my Money? And he answered, Yes, I am, and I own it was a great Fault. My Husband and this Man heard the same. Then when we went in before the Justice, she charged him with robbing her, but he denied it.</p>

               <p>M. Frost. Why at first we all went in, and she said to the Justice this is the Man, and then the Prisoner took her aside, and said, For God's Sake my Dear make it up. And she said, are not you the Man that took my Mony? And he answered, Yes, and I am sorry for it. And I begged of her for Christ's Sake not to swear it upon the poor Man, if she was not very sure that he was the Person.</p>
               <p>- It seems she was very willing to have made it up before, therefore how came it about that she did not agree to it when he offer'd it?</p>
               <p>M. Frost. Why the Justice called out and said, What? Are you going to compound Felony in my Presence? And so they went in again the second time, and it was then that I went away.</p>
               <p>- Do you consider that you are upon your Oath, and that the Man's Life is at Stake?</p>

               <p>Juryman. What's her Character?</p>
               <p>W. Frost. I have heard she has been in Bridewell, and she goes for a loose Woman, that's all. As the Prisoner was going to the Gate-house, he took me aside, and said, I will make you satisfaction if you will get her to go into the Country, and not prosecute, for it would not vex me, but that she is such a Vagabond.</p>

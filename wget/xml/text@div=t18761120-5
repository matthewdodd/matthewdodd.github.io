                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector</hi>). On 25th October, about 5 p.m., I was on duty with Urban in St. Martin's Lane, and saw the prisoner, who I knew before, walking very fast to the corner of St. Martin's Lane, where he spoke to a man, and they went into a public-house, the Essex Arms, I believe—I told Urban to go in—he went in and almost immediately came to the door and beckoned me in—I went in and saw the prisoner and another man standing with two glasses of liquor and some change on the counter—I took hold of the prisoner and pushed him to one end of the bar, and Urban pushed the other man to the other end, and the prisoner dropped this packet from his left hand; it fell about a foot from the counter; Urban picked it up; it contained ten counterfeit coins wrapped up separately—I said "This is what this man dropped "—the prisoner said "I never had it"—he resisted being searched, but I found on him a lion shilling gilded, a good shilling, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a brush wrapped in a black bag, which is used for colouring coins to make them look dirty—the other man was not known, and was net charged—the prisoner said in the cell at Bow Street "I will entirely wash my hands of this; if I get out of this mess, I will never touch any of the stuff again."

I was struggling with you when Urban picked up the coins—I have since found out that the other man has been an utterer of count erfeit coin; that you met him there and gave him drink, and that you went there to sell counterfeit coin to a man and woman—I saw you throw the packet down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I went with Shore to the Essex Arms, Long Acre, and saw the prisoner and another man in conversation at the bar in a very low tone—I called for something to drink, and saw four females going out—the prisoner had something in his left hand—Shore took hold of him, told him we were two officers and took him to the end of the bar—as I was searching the other man I saw something between me and Shore, 2 or 3 feet from me—I picked it up and said "What is this "—Shore said "My man has just dropped that, I thought you had picked it up before "—the other man could not have thrown it down, because I held his arms.</p>

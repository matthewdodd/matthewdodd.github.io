               <p>Q. Had you lead taken from house and when - A. On the 5th of June, about half past five in the afternoon. I saw it safe in the morning about seven o'clock; in the afternoon I was looking out of the chamber window, I saw the prisoner coming out of the door with a large bulk in the tail of her gown, of the left side; I went down as quick as possible; I had a large salt fish in the washhouse; I perceived the fish was gone; I followed the prisoner, she was about twenty yards off, turning an alley, she was shifting the property from the left arm to the right; I called out to the prisoner, good woman come back, you have got that which does not belong to you; in shuffling to get away from me she dropped the property at the corner of Wheeler street; I caught her, I brought the prisoner back; I applied the lead she had dropped to the washhouse; it fitted exactly the place, and the part it was missing from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your fish - A. Yes; I brought her and the property all back; I delivered her to Mr. Hart the watchhouse keeper; this is the lead and the cock I took from her, it was fastened to the wall, she had twisted it off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor, I did not know any thing about it till I was in the watchhouse; I beg his pardon.</p>

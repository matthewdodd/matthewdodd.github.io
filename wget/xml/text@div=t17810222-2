Upon the 12th of October last, about eight at night I was going from London to Hendon in a one-horse chaise; when I was about a quarter of a mile beyond the church, in a place called <placeName id="t17810222-2-crimeloc7">Haw-lane</placeName>

Then the tall one, who is the prisoner Lamb, came on the other side of the chaise, and said, if I made any noise he would shoot me.</p>
               <p>Are you positive to Lamb? - Yes; it was a very light night, the moon shone on his face, his hat was flapped, but his face was plain to be seen, except his eyes, which were a little concealed by the flapping of his hat. He demanded my money. I gave it to Lamb; then he said, your watch! upon which I gave him my watch, it was a silver one. I usually travelled with pistols, but had not my pistols at that time. I saw a pistol in Lamb's hand. They were with me about two minutes. I cannot swear to Harcup's face, his back being towards me; he held his pistol with his left hand, in a particular way, under his hand, to conceal, as I apprehend, the loss of one of his thumbs. The prisoner was taken last Saturday. When I came to Tothill-fields, where the prisoners were confined, I immediately knew Lamb.</p>
               <p>Lamb. How came you not to challenge me the moment you saw me in Tothill-fields prison? - I said nothing to Lamb when I first saw him in Tothill-fields; I went there again an hour after.</p>

               <p>I live at Kilburn-well. On Sunday evening the 4th of February, I saw the face of a man on the outside of my window, looking in at my house, this was about ten minutes before seven o'clock in the evening. I went out at the door, upon which the person who had looked in at my rap-room, jumped off the bench upon which he had stood to look in at the window. I asked his business? He ran away. I pursued him and overtook him; in running about an hundred and twenty yards after this man, I passed the two prisoners sat the bar. I cried to them, stop him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220009"></xptr> stop him! but they gave me no assistance. One said, that was not the man I wanted, but it was a man in a light coat. I took the man I had pursued, one Webber; the other two prisoners then came up to his assistance. I insisted they should go along with him. They all pretended not to know each other. My hostler and a soldier came up to my assistance, and we secured them. Harcup behaved in a reprobate manner; he attempted to strike me. I gave them into custody. We then went up the road to see what we could find in the road. We found a pistol loaded. Upon examining the place near where Webber was taken, and where the two prisoners stood at the time Webber passed by them, we found two large sticks; one had the appearance of a bludgeon.</p>

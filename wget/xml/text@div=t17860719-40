               <p>What will be the consequence if you swear falsly? - I shall go to hell.</p>
               <p>Do you know you shall be punished too for perjury by the law? - Yes. My master sent me out about five in the afternoon, and I saw the halfpence put in the basket; I was to carry them to Wild-street, Lincoln-inn-fields; I was going along, and I got into Broker's-row, and the prisoner and another man were sitting in two chairs; I was tired, and I asked the prisoner and the other man to help me down with the basket which they did, and they were saying, what a heavy load it was for me, that my master ought to be ashamed, there was above an hundred weight; and they asked Mr. Child to feel if it was not very heavy, and he said, it was not above two quarters, it was not too much for me; says one of the men, where do you live? I said, just by Tottenham-court-road, and the prisoner said, he lived next door to my master, and it was a very great load, and they came down behind me and before, and they followed me down some street, and they wanted me to go to some court and pitch my basket, I said, no, I am almost at the place; then somebody called after me stop, I put down my basket, and I found seven shillings and sixpence in half-pence were gone, and the man that run away he chucked down one of the bundles of halfpence at me; that was in Wild-street I heard the cry of stop thief; the other man had got the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. What was the reason that the prisoner did not run away? - He walked straight along.</p>
               <p>Did not he reel? - No, I did not see him in liquor; I went before the magistrate, and a watch was found upon him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner and another man which he was in company with sat at my door, the boy came past, and they both attempted to take some halfpence out of his basket, but I did not see them take any.</p>
               <p>How did they attempt? - By reaching over his head; I did not see the prisoner take any at all; I saw him reach over the basket several times; when the other man flung down the halfpence, I secured the prisoner; the other man had all the half-pence that were in the basket.</p>

               <p>Was this man terrible drunk at the time? - He might be a little in liquor , but I could not perceive much of it; he did not make any motion to run away.</p>

               <p>Have not you at any time said this, that if the man had not been extremely abusive to you, you would never have thought of carrying him before a magistrate? - I have not; I said before the magistrate, that both the men attempted the basket.</p>

               <p>As much as his companions are? - Full as much, the business of a sawyer is very laborious; they most of them drink a great deal, they cannot support themselves rightly without it, I believe they make a practice of getting drunk.</p>

I live at 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, John Street, St. Sepulchre's, and occupy the ground floor, and other portion—the prisoner occupies a room at the top of the house—about 8 o'clock, on the morning of 13th May, I heard a cry of "Fire"—I assisted in handing water to put the fire out—about two hours afterwards I went upstairs, and saw pieces of a table and a bench charred, and some shaving stuffed underneath the floor, where a board had been removed—there was no fire in the fire-place, and the grate was empty—I was in bed with my wife, in the house, at the time of the fire—I have a document here, which was handed to me by some of the prisoner's relations, stating that she has been confined in Colney Hatch; I fully believe it—she believes that there is a galvanic battery passing from one house to the other; and that there is a female detective living in the house on the left, and some other enemies in the house on the right, who have a galvanic influence over her.</p>

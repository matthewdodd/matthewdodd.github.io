On the 14th of October, I went out, and bought the blade of an axe at Mr. Bristow's; I did not get drunk, but coming home from sea I had drunk two glasses after I bought the axe; I could not tell the name of the street, and I asked a man to see me home; the prisoner fell in with the man, and they both saw me home; I got to my door, and the blade of the axe fell from my arm; the prisoner took it up, and I thought she would be honest, and bring it home; I did not know her before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 14th of October, I had been for a pail of water; I met the prosecutor; he was drunk, and the man who was leading him said "Will you have the goodness to hold this axe for me;" he then asked me to go with them, as he could not hold the prosecutor up with one arm; I put away my pail, and went - I stood at the foot of the stairs - I said to the young man "Are you coming?" he made no answer; I then went up, and said"Come, I wish you would come" - he came down, and we went down the street together; he said "I wish I knew where to leave this axe" - I took it to these two shops, and they would not take it in, because it was without a handle - I took it back, and gave it to the young man.</p>
               <p>JANE SCOTT re-examined. Q. Did you see the axe fall from your father's arm? A. Yes, and the prisoner took it up.</p>

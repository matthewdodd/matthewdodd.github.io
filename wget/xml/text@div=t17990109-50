               <p>Q. When you went up stairs, did you leave the warehouse safe? - A. Yes, I locked it up myself; the pannel had the appearance of having been broke in; there was a mark of an instrument against the board.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have been got out by means of a hook, or any thing of that kind? - A. It certainly could; there was another piece dragged to the mouth of the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this cloth? - A. Ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The door of your warehouse, and the door from his house, are different doors? - A. No, there is but one door.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mawley) Was it dark when you came home? - A. Yes, it was so dark, that though I could see a person, I could not know them by their face; I found the street door shut; I went up to tea, where I found Mr. Eastbourne; in a short time he bid me go and shut up; I took the keys of the warehouse, and found the doors fast; I then took the keys out of the pins by which the shutters are fastened; I then took the shutters out, and was going to put them up, when I saw the corner of a piece of cloth, which is now in Court, at a hole in the window, the fellow piece to the one that was stole, and I called Mr. Eastbourne.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It was not dark when you came home? - A. It was dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not so dark but you could see a man's face? - A. Not to know the man.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH INWARDS sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton-garden office: On Tuesday, the 18th of December, myself and two more officers went to Mrs. Turner's, No. 23, in Fleet-lane, to the prisoner's lodgings; we went up into the first floor front room, where we found the prisoner in bed; we went in and shut the door; I told him we wanted him, he must go with us; then I searched about the room, and found a number of articles that we took away, amongst the rest was this piece of cloth, we found it in the drawers, this was in a drawer that was not locked, some of the drawers were locked, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to know that they were his lodgings, besides finding him there in bed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Now do you not know, on the contrary, that she is a woman of the town, with whom any man may have a lodging if he pleases? - A. I have heard say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it? - A. I have very little doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore any man who was imprudent enough to go and get a lodging with her, might have been found there? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you find a number of Mrs. Turner's clothes there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mrs. Turner ordered before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, and she came there, and the next day she was to have come when he was to be examined.</p>
               <p>Q. She came to the office, but not liking the smell of it, she gave you what we call leg bail? - A. I believe it was so.</p>

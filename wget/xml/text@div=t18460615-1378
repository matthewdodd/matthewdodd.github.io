                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a plumber, painter, and glazier, in Church-street, Camberwell, for Elizabeth Howard, my mother. I am not in partnership with her—the prisoner was in her employ, and had, access to the drawers—on the 4th of June I found a bunch of keys were left in the key-hole of the drawer in the back part of the shop where the prisoner worked—they ought not to have been there—I opened the drawers, and found some colours—I then put them back locked the drawers, and put the keys into my desk—I waited fcr the prisoner coming from his dinner at two o'clock—I then took the keys out of my desk, went to the prisoner, and said, "Philip, are these your keys?"—he said, "Yes they are"—I said, "Just open the drawer"—he did so—I took the colours, laid them before him, and asked him whose they were—he said, "They are mine"—I asked who gave them to him—he made no reply—my brother brought the colour drawer, which they are usually kept in, to. the back part of the shop to compare them with those in the prisoner's drawer—I found them exactly to correspond—I found a piece which exactly fits the fracture—that was one piece of chrome yellow—it fitted where it had been broken off—here is the piece that was broken off—after a little time I said, "Philip, I do not like these things—it is these petty things I cannot bear—I have missed several things out of the shop—it appears to me that it is something like you have done it"—he said, "Well Sir, if you think that, I had better look up my tools and go—we had a good deal of conversation about this and other matters—I then went to the front of the shop where my brother stood, and after that I went outside the shop, and the prisoner came to me and said he was very sorry for what he had done, and hoped I would overlook it, and allow him to remain—I told him if he would promise me to make amends for it I would overlook it, and he remained in my mother's service.</p>

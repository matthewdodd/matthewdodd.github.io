            . I am a stationer, and live in Trump-street, King-street. On the the 7th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, Owdlgate came and bought half a quire of foolscap paper, which came to 8d. He gave me a half-crown; I gave him change - and afterwards doubted about its being good. On the 1st of March Smith came and bought a sheet of brown paper, and tendered me a shilling, which I suspected, but was not certain about it. I kept it separated from any other, and gave him 11 1/2 d.; and in about an hour Owdlgate came for a penny-worth of whitey-brown paper, and paid me a shilling, which appeared very much like the other; and at eight o'clock Smith came for another sheet of brown paper, saying that the other was not sufficient; he gave me a sixpence; I took the shears and cut it - it appeared to be made of base metal. I told him he had passed bad money, and so had the old man from whom he came; he said he had not. I asked where he lived - he said at No. 7, King-street. I questioned him, and then he said his father lived in the neighbourhood of Wellclose-square, and was a shew-maker, and that he had been to Evans's in Long-lane for some pictures for his father. As he would not give his father's name I sent for a constable and detained him. He denied that his father was near the house; and, in consequence of what my boy said, I went out and saw Owdlgate about two hundred yards off. I told him he had passed bad money at my house that day - he denied it. I said,</p>
               <p>"There is a boy at my shop belonging to you" - he said he never had a boy. We took him to the shop. He said he was a shew-maker, and had been to Evans's in Long-lane for some pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. The man said so - A. Yes; the boy had said so before; the officer said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know this boy?" he said he did not, but soon after, he said he believed he recollected him, and afterwards, that they lived in the same house, he was searched, and a bad sixpence fell from his clothes on the floor; he had two good sixpences in his fob, and a basket with some pictures, some brown and whitey-brown paper in it. Smith acknowledged at the Compter, that the two good sixpences which I had given to him and Owdlgate in change, were paid to Evaos for the pictures, and that he was in the habit of passing bad money for this man, who gave him 2 d. or 3 d. for himself; that he had been employed by him about a week. I produced the money I received from them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce two shillings and two sixpences; I received one sixpence from the prosecutor, and the other the man dropped from his waistcoat pocket and tried to put his foot on it. I found two good sixpences in his fob, and found the pictures and paper in his basket; the paper which was bought at Bruce's, and two shillings-worth of copper; when I took Smith, I asked him if the man had a basket, he said he had; I said then I had passed him in the street; I sent Bruce to look at him; he gave me a signal and I took him, and asked if any body was waiting for him, he said not, and denied knowing the boy, but afterwards said that they lived in the same house near Wellclose-square; the boy gave the account Mr. Bruce has stated.</p>

               <p>JOHN MORGAN. I am an inspector of Islington watch. On the evening of the 16th of December, I was going along Hopping-lane, Islington, and stopped a young man with a bundle - I said to him, "What have you got?" we came to the lamp to look at it; he turned and said, "Here is a young man knows me," pointing to the prisoner; I seized them both - we scuffled and fell, and the other got away; he left his hat, and this counterpane was in the parcel which he left - the prisoner claims the handkerchief as his, in which this counterpane was tied - the prisoner had some other articles about him.</p>

            . I am servant to Augustus Lernoult Whitmore; he lives in Kentish-town - this counterpane is his property; it was washed on the 14th of December, and was left wet on the 16th - it was safe about six o'clock in the evening, and we missed it between six and seven; nothing else was missing - it had been out in the garden.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had never seen this counterpane; it was in the other bundle - the man got away who I suppose had done the robbery; I had brought some shirts from Finchley, which a young man said he found in a ditch - I had them about me; I was at Finchley from three o'clock to six.</p>

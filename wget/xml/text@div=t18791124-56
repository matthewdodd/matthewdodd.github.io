I produce two certificates, accurate copies of the registers—the first is dated 26th December, 1855, and is the certificate of marriage of Isaiah Brightling, bachelor and plumber, to Ann Lang, spinster, at the parish church of Battersea—J have com<lb></lb>pared it with the register—this other, dated 25th December, 1876, certifies that Ezra Messingberd, widower, was married to Ann Lang, spinster, at the parish church of St. Simon, Chelsea—on 18th October I went to Chelsea and saw the prisoner—I said "I have to take you into custody for bigamy"—she said "What?"—I said "I am informed that you have married the second husband"—she said "What, a plumber?"—I said "I did not say a plumber, I said a second husband; that constitutes bigamy, and you will have to go to the station with me"—at the station I detained her while I fetched the first husband, in company with the second, and the first husband identified her as his wife—I received the second certificate from the prisoner</p>

               <p>—it was given to her in my presence by Mrs. Brewster—the prisoner was living with Messingberd at 39, First Street, when I apprehended her—Brightling lives at the mission rooms, Marlborough Square, Chelsea, about five minutes' walk from First Street—I know he has been living there 11 or 12 years.</p>

I am wife of Benjamin Slack, 3, Angel Place, High Street, Borough, and am sister to Isaiah Brightling—I was not present at his marriage—I have seen the prisoner before—she is my brother Isaiah Brightling's wife, and I knew them as living together on man and wife for many years—they were so living together in 1861 and 1862, the year of the exhibition, when I went to see my brother—they had always lived together to my knowledge since their marriage—they lived in Smith Street, Chelsea—I do not know the year they ceased to live together, but I know my brother went to this situation at the London City Mission, and has held it ever since—he has slept there many years—he is alive—he is servant to Mr. Curtis, the city missionary—he has continued to live at Chelsea up to this moment.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, First Street, Chelsea—on Christmas Day, 1876, I went through the form of marriage with the prisoner at St. Simon's Church, Chelsea—I knew her as Lang, and did not know abe was a married woman—I had known her personally about 15 years front the first, but did not even know her name; I had only seen her—I did not know Isaiah Brightling, but I know him—I was engaged to the prisoner four or five months before Christmas, 1876, but I never know Isaiah Brightling till this case came on—I saw him and passed him on several occasions when the prisoner was with me during our courtship, and on one. occasion when I took her to a teetotal lodge he was the doorkeeper, and we both gave the password to. him at the door—she herself gave the pass<lb></lb>word to him, the same as I did—they were Good Templars—I cannot say on how many occasions I met him, but she did not tell me he was her husband.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first found out in June last that they were married—I did not give information till I went to the Magistrate on 16th october because I did not wish to punish her—I have no animosity against her—I have not punished her—she never went to the hospital on my Account, and I never assaulted her—when cross-examined before the Magistrate I will not swear whether I said that "I married the prisoner the following</p>

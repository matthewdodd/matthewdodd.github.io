I live at North Feltham, close to the powder milk, next door to Aldridge, the deceased—I know the prisoner—about 1 o'clock on 19th December I was walking towards my house with him and the two Fennells—Aldridge came trotting along behind with his donkey cart—directly he got within a yard or two of us he went to get out of his cart with a brush in his hand, and he fell, being beery, and the wheel went over his arm—I picked him up, and he went up to Reeves saying "One to one," and struck him on the head with the brush—Reeves took it from him and struck him back with it on the side of the head, and threw it over his shoulder away from him, and on they went a—fighting, and I walked away and called his wife out and stopped the donkey.</p>

I have known the prisoner ever since he was born—he has always been quiet and peaceable—he works with us at Lee's nursery—he lives at home with his mother, about 200 yards from Aldridge—we were all going home to our dinner—Aldridge was standing up in the cart till he fell out; he was too beery to stand up I think—he had one foot on the shaft; he caught his leg in the rein and fell out, either on the side of his head or his shoulder; he was getting out in a temper—I believe the wheel went over his left arm—none of us had said anything to him—the prisoner's hat was cut and his forehead with the blow Aldridge gave him—Aldridge was about 30 years of age, short, and a good deal bigger-built man than the prisoner—I have often seen him drunk; he was once charged with an assault on a woman and bound over to keep the peace—I saw the prisoner and Aldridge again in the afternoon, they met and Aldridge said something to the prisoner, but I went on and did not hear what passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased, William Henry Aldridge, and live at Feltham—on 19th September, about 1 o'clock, I was indoors—I heard some men pass the gate, and I looked out to see what was the cause of so much talk; I saw my husband's donkey cart pass the gate with no one in it—I looked down the Feltham Road and saw my husband lying on the ground and the prisoner bending over him beating him withhis clenched fist—I went as fast as I could and separated them—when my husband attempted to get up Reeves knocked him down in the ditch; that occurred three times; I helped him up, and Reeves then left us and went towards home—my husband did not strike Reeves at all while I was there—when we were going home Reeves turned round to come and fight him again, and took off his coat and gave it to Knight to hold—I persuaded my husband to go back and then Reeves went away—we went home; I unharnessed the donkey and my husband took it into the stable and put some soot in the shed; he seemed sober, he talked to me sensibly—his nose and mouth were very much swollen; I assisted him to undress and wash—about half or three-quarters of an hour afterward he went out again to find his hand brush, and I afterwards saw Reeves pass the gate in the same direction—I went out and looked down the road and 1 saw my husband coming back, and Reeves struck him and knocked him down—I went and got between them and separated them—my husband did not get up again; Reeves beat him about the head and face while he was lying on the ground—Reeves gave me a blow and knocked me down—my husband attempted to get up but did not succeed in doing so; when he got</p>

If there is anything I hope we shall be able to put it right"—Reeves replied "You b——b——I will let you know what is the matter," and he struck him, and the second blow knocked him down—I did not see Andrews strike or attempt to strike Reeves—I did not stop; when I left Aldridge was on the ground and Reeves stood there; it was the work of a second.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner—on Thursday afternoon, 19th December, I was called to attend the deceased at his own house; he was on the bed quite unconscious, suffering from all the symptoms of compression of the brain; there was a swelling of his upper lip and a small quantity of blood coming from his nose—his eyes were perfectly fixed, immovable to touch or light—I saw no marks about the hand or face, I examined him all over and could discover no marks—I was with him about three hours—I expected him almost to have died within a short time—he remained unconscious until the Saturday morning, he then became conscious to a certain extent and improved in condition, and was able to take nourishment; he continued in much the same state until the following Friday morning, when I was called up at half-past 4; he was then unconscious and breathing very hard, and he died at half-past 7—I made a post<lb></lb>mortem examination twelve hours after death—on opening the head between the skull cap and the outer membrane of the brain, I found a considerable quantity of effused blood—he died from secondary effusion consequent on the rupture of a small artery; repeated blows would cause such a state—all the other organs were perfectly healthy.</p>

My wife lost a pair of Dresden ruffles, and a piece of lace, which caused inquiry to be made among the servants: she that same day, the 20th of October, took her things away. I asked my wife if she had discharged her nurse, she said no. I sent my servant after her, but in the mean time she came back; I said to her, nurse, I do not think you have used me well, you have been informed these things are lost; you might, to clear your character, have desired your mistress to have looked over your things.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been gone?</p>
               <p>Stewart. I believe she was not gone above 20 minutes, or half an hour; she said she knew nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110041"></xptr> of the ruffles; I said, I beg you will let me know where you have carried your things; she said she had been to the baker's; I knew that was a falsity, for I had sent there. Then she said she had been to her lodgings, I knew that to be false also; she would not tell me where she had carried her parcel. I went to a brother at the next door to have advice; in the interim she came down stairs, and went out. My wife followed her. I thought she was going to the place where the things were. She walked about the street. My wife met a person whom she knew; she desired him to come and tell me that the nurse was only dodging her to tire her out, and desired I would come to Virginia-street. I went, but could not find her. She at last carried my wife to where the things were left. My wife sent for me to the bottom of Nightingale-lane; there were the nurse and my wife; the things were opened; there were a cambrick handkerchief, a piece of lace, a napkin, an apron, four pair of stockings; the stockings I can swear to. We did not find the ruffles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stewart confirmed the account given by her husband, and deposed to the things to be her husband's property.</p>

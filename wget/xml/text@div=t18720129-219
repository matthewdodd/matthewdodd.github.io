                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Ulrich, and live at Old Charlton—the prisoner has been in our service six months, during that time I missed a large quantity of house linen—in the early part of this month I had occasion to dismiss her for impertinence—I told her as I had lost so much, I must look in her box before she left—she would not allow me to do so—I said I should not allow her box to go until I had looked in it—the said "I must send for a policeman then," which I did, and when he was coming, she said "He could not look into her box without a search warrant" when the policeman came, she opened her box, and in it I found these two towels, a petticoat, brush and comb, a child's dress, some embroidery, a piece of muslin, a child's pinafore, and other things—they are <hi rend="italic">my</hi> property—she said that the things had got into her box in moving—she afterwards said she did not know how they got there—we had changed houses some time before, but I had the comb in use about a fortnight before—some duplicates were also found in her box—I went to a pawnbroker's, and there saw a shirt belonging to my brother.</p>

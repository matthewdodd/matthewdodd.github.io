               <p>RICHARD MORTIMER sworn. - I live at Kentish Town; I can only swear to the property.</p>
               <p>ANDREW TAYLOR sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street: On the 30th of January I was on the Hampstead-road, I met the prisoner at the bar between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, about thirty yards on this side of Tottenham-court-gate, he had got a bundle; I asked him what he had got there; he said it was his own property; I asked him what it was; he said it was iron; I asked him where he got it; he told me he had found it; I asked him where, and he said, under a hayrick, as he was cutting hay; I think he said in Mr. Mortimer's ground, but I am not sure whether he mentioned Mr. Mortimer or not; I was going to take him to public-house; he said, for God's sake, Mr. Taylor, don't hurt me; he knew me, but I did not know him; he said, you know me very well, I live in Kentish-town; I cannot hurt you, says I. If it is your own property, I must see what it is; I looked at it, and found it to be some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180021"></xptr>old rusty iron bars, and some new iron, for something in the farmering line, that I believe had never been used; he said he knocked his knife against them as he was cutting the hay; I asked him who he worked for, and he told me Mr. Mortimer; I went and acquainted Mr. Mortimer, and he came to Bow-street and claimed the iron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.He told you it was iron? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES GREGORY sworn. - I was with Taylor; I know no more of it than Taylor has said.(The iron was produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Where did you keep the iron? - A. In a place adjoining the kitchen; I had seen it about a fortnight before; he has worked for me from a year to a year and a half, or two years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. By what mark do you swear to that iron? - A. Here is a harrow tire, which is made out of an old tire, and here are the nail holes, they are made remarkably stout and out of size.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRADY sworn. - I am a blacksmith, at Camden-town, I made these harrow teeth, they have not been used, they were made out of some old strakes, I never saw such before nor since, I can swear positively to them, I never made such things before in my life, nor any body else, I verify believe.</p>

I live at 121, Southwark Bridge Road—on 4th May, about 12.30, I was outside the One Bell, Rotherhithe, talking to a friend, who I met by chance—three men came out of the public-house—they fol<lb></lb>lowed me out—one of them knocked me on the ear, and sent me spinning, and I was brutally kicked on the head and my right loin—I am suffering from my left breast at the present time—when I cough something catches me—I cannot say what was done to me when I was down, except that I was kicked on the nose—I know I staggered and fell—I cannot say who struck me, because they came up behind me out of the public-house—I had had no quarrel, with any of them or given them any provocation—the only thing I imagine this to be about is that one day while I was on duty down there I stopped a wagon that was loaded with grain, and found in it five sacks of maize, two bushels, and a nose-bag full—whether the prisoners were con<lb></lb>cerned in it I do not know.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, and live at 6, Forsyth Street, Rotherhithe—about 1 o'clock, on Sunday morning, 4th May, I was standing about five yards from the Bell—I saw the three prisoners and the prosecutor—I saw Overton strike Bacon on the ground, and kick him with his feet—it was rather a dark night, but there was a lamp burning at the Bell public-house, sufficiently near for me to see.</p>

I keep a public-house, at Rotherhithe—on the morning of the 4th May last Bacon was in my house, about 12.40—he was perfectly sober; the prisoners were there also drinking—they and the prosecutor left my house, about one time—I called "Time," and they went out—there were five men in one compartment, and a female and another man in another.</p>

On the night in question, as I was passing the Bell a woman asked me if I would treat her, and I told her that I had no money—whilst I was there, three men came out of the house and began chaffing her—then a biggish man came out—he comes up and said "If no one else won't take her part, I will"—I stood on one side then—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> off his coat, and gave it to some man; I could not swear who it was now—he knocked the littlemost one of the three down, and when he got up he knocked him down again—the big man and the little man afterwards went down together, and after that the big man lay there—I said to him "Why don't you leave the job off, you have had enough of it now?—he said "I have been kicked"—I says "I can swear nobody kicked you"—some one else then came up.</p>

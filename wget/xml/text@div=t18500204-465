                  </hi>. I live in Sloane-place, Chelsea, and am a greengrocer, On 18th June I was in Kensington-gardens—I saw the prisoner and Thomas Hodgson outside the garden—I noticed a bag there—the prisoner asked two little boys whether the bag belonged to them—they said, "No"—he then asked a man, and he said, "No"—Hodgson stated in the prisoner's hearing that there was a coat and waistcoat in the bag; they ran away with it—Hodgson ran first, the prisoner ran after him, and joined him.</p>

On 18th June, I went to Kensing<lb></lb>ton-gardens to play—I had a bag containing a coat and waistcoat, a cornet, a knife, a comb, and some other things—I was orderly that day, and had to carry the music stool in—my bag was put down by the rails of the gate, and a person should have seen that my bag was brought in, but it was neglect on his part, and when I came back my bag was gone—it might have been about twenty minutes before I missed it.</p>

On 26th Jan., I apprehended the prisoner as he was coming out of Windsor gaol—I had taken his companion Hodgson in the summer—he was tried here, and was transported for seven years (he had been convicted twice before)—I charged the prisoner with being concerned with Hodgson in stealing this bag—he said he hid in a field while Hodgson went and sold the things; and when he asked him for some of the money, he threatened to punch his bead for him; and after Hodgson was apprehended, he did not know what to do, and he went to Windsor and com<lb></lb>mitted a robbery, and was tried at Windsor, and had three months.</p>

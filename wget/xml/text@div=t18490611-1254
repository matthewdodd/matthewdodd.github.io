                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Morrison—the prisoner was in their service, and slept in the next bed to me—in consequence of having missed money, I marked some money on Thursday, 18th May, I put it into my waistcoat-pocket, which I laid on the end of the bed when I went to bed that night—there was a half-crown, three shillings, and a fourpenny-piece—I got up next morning about seven o'clock, I examined my waistcoat, and the money was safe—I went down stairs and left the prisoner in bed—I went up again about eight, the prisoner was then gone from the room, I examined my waistcoat, and missed my money—I informed Mr. Slater, and he summoned as many of the young men who slept in that room as they could call together—the prisoner was one—Mr. Slater mentioned the fact of the money being lost, and requested them to assist in the matter, by each showing what money he had got—the prisoner produced what he had got, and in his pockets was the money belonging to me—this is it—it was in consequence of what Mr. Slater said that I marked this money—it was not marked in his presence—he did not see it till the prisoner produced it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the house of Messrs. Morrison and Co. In consequence of information I directed the prosecutor to mark some money, and on the morning of 19th of May he came to me, and I sent for the young men who slept in that room—the prisoner came immediately amongst the rest—I informed them that several of the young men had lost money, and one in particular had had his pocket picked that morning, and I begged they would show what money they had—the prisoner instantly took his money out—I took the money and laid it on the table—I found this marked money amongst it—I had no other motive for fixing on him than the fact of his sleeping in the same compartment with the prosecutor.</p>

I live at 10, Drury-court, in the same house as the Reeves's—my husband is a stage carpenter at Govent-garden theatre—on Fridays the 15th of this month, I was at home about 9 o'clock—I came down about three or four minutes to 9 to go and get some milk, and the deceased child ran out to me and said, "Mrs. James, shall I go and get your milk?"—I said, "No Polly, I am halfway down the stairs, and I will go and get it myself dear"—I did not see her again after that—sometime after that I heard that poor boy (the prisoner) calling to her—he was in the passage at the foot of the stairs—he called, "Polly, Polly"—she replied in a rough way that she had in speakings "What is it you want Dick?"—he said, "Polly, bring me the key of the back place—she spoke again, "I do not know where it is Dick—he said, "It is on the table against the window, "perhaps a minute elapsed before she answered again—she then said, "All right Dick," and I heard her go down stairs, and I never beard any more of her un till she was put into my arms—it was about twenty-five minutes past 9 when I heard her go down stairs—a lad named Lynes afterwards came to the house—I went with him to the cellar—I saw the trap-door of the cellar opened—that was about five or ten minutes after 2, as nigh as possible—it is in a back place where they generally worked, in the same yard where the back place is, where they generally worked at the basket-making.</p>

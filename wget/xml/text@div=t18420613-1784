                  </hi>. I am a policeman, and live at No. 5, Redcross-street, Hackney-road; the prisoner is my son; he lived with me at this time, My daughter came and called me up on Sunday night, and I missed a knife, a razor, and some bread and meat from the cupboard—there was a four-pound loaf and a two penny loaf, both whole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On Saturday my father gave me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two slices of bread and meat, and wanted me to go to Portsmouth—I said it was not enough, it would not buy a night's lodging; and then he took me up and said I had run away—he took me to the Rendezvous, and a gentleman there gave him a letter to take to Mr. Broughton the Magistrate. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No gentleman gave me a letter—I went to the Rendezvous to see whether they would take him on board the tender, and they would have nothing to do with him—Mr. Broughton desired me to ask whether he could be put into the Isle of Wight school.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nearly fifteen years old—the prisoner is my brother—he used to live at home with us—he had been away to sea, and came back in March—he has been living with my father since he has been home—I remember Sunday, the 6th of June—my mother went out, and my father went to bed before tea, as he has to be out at night—about five minutes after seven the prisoner was in the garden with me—I was talking to a little girl next door—I had the baby in my arms at the time—he was walking up, and down the yard—he wanted me to go to the bottom of the garden, and I would not, because he wanted to go out—I was up at the top of the garden—he went into the back room, and took the meat and two loaves—I did not see him take it, but there was no one else in the house—I heard the street-door open, and directly ran into my father's room, and awoke him up—I went to the cupboard, and missed some beef and bread—me and my brother are friends when he is at home—there are four of us—the knife was in the cupboard, and the razor on the top of it, in the same place where the bread and beef were—my brother was to have gone to Portsmouth on the Wednesday before, when my father came home, when he got his pay—my mother said she would not give him any more money, because be ran away and spent it—my father gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Wednesday—he ran away this Sunday night without my father's knowledge or leave.</p>

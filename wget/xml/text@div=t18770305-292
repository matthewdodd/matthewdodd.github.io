                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live at Thoyden Road, Bow—on Monday evening, 29th January, I was in company with the prisoner Cole, his two brothers William and Henry, the deceased William Whale, Edwards, and Hares—we were all together in the running-ground of the Teddington Arms public-house—there had been a match—we were all pretty sociable together there between 5 and 6 o'clock—we went from there to the Earl of Devon, and there met a man named Fluence—there was a little dispute there between him and Whale about a shilling—John Cole said to Whale "It was you that got me three months for knocking a man about some time back"—Whale said "You have a good chance with me, I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to have a fight with me," and they went out to have a fight—I stopped inside—Whale was a biggish young man, about 5 feet 6 inches, very stout and very powerful, about twenty-three years old—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187703050041"></xptr>
               <p>were not more than a minute before they came back—they were parted—a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that was with us began singing a song; they had got friendly again—John Cole sat on a form crying with passion—we left the Earl of Devon about 8.30, and went to the Moor's Arms—Whale was rather fresh; he knew what he was doing; they were all about alike—Stunt was with us all the while—we were <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> at the Moor's Arms—a dispute arose between Whale and Fluence about Fluence's wife—Whale happened to touch her, and Fluence said "Don't touch her Bill, that is ray wife, what I bought and paid for; if you do I will put a bit of steel into you"—I did not see anything in his hand then—he picked up a quart pot, and Whale tried to get hold of one also—he said "I can get a quart pot as well as you"—the barmaid swept them all off the bar—a constable then came and turned us all out—we then went to the Cotton Arms about 9.45—Fluence began rowing with Whale again about his wife, and said he would put a bit of steel into him if he pulled out a knife—at the Moor's Arms I had taken Whale's part, and said he was in the right, Whale asked me if I had a knife; I said I did not carry one—he then went to Hares and said "Lend me a knife, <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>"—Hares said "What do you want it for?—he said "To cut my nails"—John Cole came up to Whale and said "You are a nice fighting man to want to use knives"—Whale said "I should think so when he wants to use one to me"—then John Cole challenged him to fight, and then a scuffle began between them—I believe Whale was not a prize-fighter, he used to use sparring-rooms—a few blows passed, and the landlord ejected them all—I went out with the rest, and when I got outside I saw John Cole and Whale fighting—blows were being struck by one another—William and Henry Cole took their brother's part; they stepped in between him and Whale—I did not hear them say anything—they were all fighting together then, three upon one—Gregory, who is called <hi rend="italic">Buster</hi>, and who had been with us all the time, said "I can't see three upon one," and he took part in the fight in favour of Whale, and Stunt took Cole's part—they were all fighting together—I then saw Whale in the road sparring with one man by himself, I don't know who it was, and two or three were fighting together by the side of the public-house; <hi rend="italic">Buster</hi> was one of them—it was not dark, there was light from the public-house—I was holding Whale's coat and hat, and I kept pretty close to him—I then saw John Cole come up with a brick and hit Whale in the head with it—he threw it at him—he was about 5 or 6 yards from him—he came pretty close to him, about as far as I am from the Judge—the brick must have struck him on the eye, and he fell—me and Edwards picked him up and carried him to the wall, and put him on his legs, and held him there—he never spoke—blood was running down his face; it was covered with blood—I did not see where the brick came from—there are buildings going on opposite the public-house—it is a good wide road—Whale was insensible, he could not stand—while we had him up against the wall Stunt came up with a brick in his hand and said "Where is he 1 he has hit me, he shall never hit nobody eke. Stand out of the way or else I will <hi rend="italic">bash</hi> you"—Edward said "Don't hit him no more, I think he is dead now; if you want to hit any<lb></lb>body hit me. You shan't hit him no more"—Stunt said "Stand out of the way <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi>, or else you will get it"—with that we both stood away, and Whale fell to the ground, and while he was on the ground Stunt kicked him in the head, I can't say in what part—they then all left us, and we took Whale in a cab to the hospital.</p>

Stunt had been with us the whole afternoon, the same as the rest—he tried to prevent Whale and John Cole fighting at first—outside the Cotton Arms I did not see him till he took part in the fight—I did not see him try to prevent anyone fighting; if I said so just now I made a mistake; I did not hear William or Henry Cole say to Whale "You are too much for him, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—I don't remember saying so before the Magistrate—I did not see them try to hold John Cole back from figh<lb></lb>ting—I was intimate with them all; I was more with Whale than with the others—I believe he was very good with his fists—<hi rend="italic">Buster</hi> is a pretty decent hand with his fists, he attends sparrings as well as Whale; I don't know that any of the others do—I did not see whether Stunt had got a cut under his eye when he came up to Whale, it was rather dark on that side, we were a long way from the public-house—we were dragging him away to the other side—I did not hear him say "The cowardly fellow has hit me foul when I was not looking"—he said "Where is the big coward that hit me, he shall never hit nobody else"—what he said was "He has hit me"—I don't think he said "The big coward"—I don't know whether he did or not, he" might—I don't know how Whale got separated from the rest—I took no part in the fighting—I did not see Cole retreating, and Whale following him up—I think I was the soberest of the party, I was quite sober, and I think Stunt was about the same as I was, about twelve of us had been drinking together all the afternoon—I am not a very great drinker, I only drank now and then, it was only beer, I did not have any spirits—I joined them about 5 o'clock, and from 5 to 10 o'clock we were in public-houses.</p>

               <p>la and Friswell and Hares helped me get him round the corner, and Stunt came rushing up like a madman with a brick in his hand—he said "Where is the big coward"—I said "Here he is"—he said "Stand on one side <hi rend="italic">Ton</hi>, I will <hi rend="italic">bash you</hi> with it"—I said "I think he has had enough, I won't land on one side"—me and Friswell begged and prayed of him not to touch him no more, he was bleeding from his right eye; with that, looking lifer myself a little I turned on one side and Whale fell, and when he fell Stout kicked him in the head; I did not see in what part I went and got a cob and we took him to the hospital.</p>

I am a M.R.C.S., and senior house-surgeon at the London Hospital—Whale was brought there on Monday evening of 29th January—he was unconscious—he had a very severe blow over the right eye, and was bleeding from the left nostril—he also had an abrasion behind the left ear, and abrasions on the face—he became conscious next morning, and remained so till Wednesday, he then became unconscious and died on Friday morning at 2 o'clock—by order of the coroner I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he had inflammation of the covering of the brain, and of the brain substance itself, and fracture of the base of the brain, extending right across the base of the skull to the opposite orbit; that was on the same side as the bruise over the eye—the blow, from its external appearance, seemed severe enough to cause the fracture of the orbit—it was a fractare</p>

               <p>of the petrous portion of the temporal bone—the inflammation was more intense at those points, but there was inflammation in all parts of the brain—matter had formed between the membranes of the brain, and between the brain and its covering; more on the left side—there were two separate formations of matter—a blow might cause the injury behind the left ear—the heart was slightly enlarged, and the kidneys slightly contracted, the rest of the organs were healthy—the blow that might hare caused the injury behind the left ear might also have caused the fracture of the tem<lb></lb>poral orbit—I have no judgment about whether it was so caused or no—the cause of death was the inflammation of the covering of the brain—I am not able to say whether that was caused by the blow behind the ear, or whether by the injury over the eye—it was caused by one or the other or both—if one blow was given I should say a kick would intensify the inflan<lb></lb>nation; either of the injuries was sufficient to cause death; if one injury was inflicted a second would accelerate death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. There was no incised wound over the right eve—he was brought in for concussion—I saw no appearance of concussion on the brain; concussion is a symptom, insensibility is a conse<lb></lb>qence of concussion; a heavy blow or fall would produce concussion—there was no wound at the back of the head—I should hardly think that the abrasions on the face were such as would be caused by blows received in a fight—they were mere scratches—the abrasion behind the left ear was about half an inch long; it was a very slight abrasion—I am not prepared to say it might not be caused by a sudden blow from a stone; but I can't say positively, it is an unusual thing from a blow behind the ear to get a fracture of the opposite orbit—it is possible—I cant say—from the external appearance it did not look like it—it showed no marks of severe violence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. The contused wound over the eye might have been caused by a blow of the fist, including the fracture—the blow and abrasion at the back of the ear might have been caused by a kick—the blow over the eye might have been caused by a brick thrown at him—I cannot form any judgment as to what the cause was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant KB</hi> 1). On the evening of 29th January I met Stunt in Baker Street, Stepney—he bid me good evening—he had got a black eye, I believe it was his right eye—I knew him before I said "Halloo, how did you get that black eye?"—he said "I have bean over Bow Common with several others at a trotting match, when we came out several of them commenced quarrelling, Whale said to me 'You are the b——that took Henry Cole's part, are you not?' and struck me in the eye and knocked me down, I got up, we had a fight together, and I gave Mm a good thrashing, and I believe he is taken to the London hospital"—I made answer "I have no doubt he deserved it"—I saw him again on the morning of the 11th of February in Commercial Road—I then told him I should have to take him into custody for assaulting William Whale on the night of the 29th—he said "I will go anywhere with you, Mr. Harvey"—I cautioned him that any statement he made I might use against him in evidence at his trial, and he repeated the same statement.</p>

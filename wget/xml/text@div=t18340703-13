            , my clerk - I have not received 5l. 1s. 9d. on account of Cockburn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Have you any partner? A. I have not - I have a collecting clerk whose duty it is to receive money for me - I hired the prisoner as porter - it was in his employment to receive money where it was offered to him - he was not ordered to receive this money to my knowledge - it was his duty to pay it over to the clerk.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DUNCUM. I am clerk to Mr. Besemere. It was the prisoner's duty to pay over to me any money which he received - on the 26th of June, I asked him if Mr. or 
               <persName id="t18340703-13-person196">Mrs. Gibbon</persName>
             had paid him any money on taking a parcel to their house - he said, "No; they did not pay me, as there was some demur respecting discount" - I said, "How is it you gave a receipt and took the right discount?" - he said,"I dare say if I go up there I shall be able to make it right" - I said, "Mr. Gibbon says, as he has a receipt from you, he will not pay it again - you say it is not paid - I must mention that to Mr. Besemere, and we shall both have to go up there" - on my leaving the warehouse to tell Mr. Besemere, he called me back and acknowledged having received it, and bought some clothes with it, and he tendered me some money on account of it - I do not know how much it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say it was not the full amount? A. I cannot - this occurred on Saturday, and my attention was drawn to it on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. On previous occasions had not as much time elapsed between his receiving and paying it? A. No - I always considered he paid it the moment he brought it back - he might have come home after eleven o'clock, after I retired to rest, and given me the money next morning - he offered to pay me the money in less than five minutes of his denying having received it - I cannot be mistaken with regard to the circumstance - he said there was some demur about discount, and on that account they did not pay him.</p>

            , at No. 19, Coventry-street, Haymarket. I had bought some shirts of the prosecutor on the 20th of June - they were sent up on the 21st, and I paid the prisoner - I have the receipt - it was not stamped - I saw him write it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that the only paper relating to the transaction which you have? A. There was another bill which was added to it - an amount of goods bought on the 26th of May - I had had a transaction with him a month before, and that was not paid for - this payment is for the whole amount.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman did not pay me the money - I received it from Mrs. Gibbons. Witness. Mrs. Gibbons gave me the cash out of her box, and I paid it to you.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had no intention of keeping the money - he asked if I had it - I just concealed it for a moment, because there were so many people about, but as soon as I saw him alone I acknowledged it, and offered him the whole amount.</p>

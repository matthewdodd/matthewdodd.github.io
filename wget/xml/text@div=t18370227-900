On the 23rd of February I was on duty in Westminster-bridge-road, and was called into the prosecutor's shop to take Langham for selling a silver spoon—on my way to the station-house he said he was not so guilty as his mate, Richard Clark; that he and his mate had been robbing their employer for some time, and they had taken that day eighteen pounds of lead, and sold it to a woman named Hunt, in Granby-street—I went to the house of Evans, who goes by the name of Hunt, and I asked her for the lead she had bought that day of a boy—she produced this—I took her to the house, and she identified Clark as the boy the bought it of—Langham then said she had got half a hundred-weight of lead at her house, and I went and found seventeen pounds pounds of new lead under the counter—she was then ordered to appear at—Union-hall, and the Magistrate committed her for trial—she was asked if she had any new lead at her house, and she said she had not.</p>

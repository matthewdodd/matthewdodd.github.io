                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Scott—in August, I was living at 10, Enoch-court, Whitechapel—part of the court is in Aldgate—I knew the prisoner and his wife; they resided at No. 7, at the top of the court, in the front room—they have lived there between four and five months to the best of my knowledge—I did not know them before they came there—the prisoner has four children—I did not know what he was—I was in the court on the evening of 23rd Aug., between 6 and 7 o'clock, and saw the prisoner come home; he was very tipsy indeed. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on behalf of the prisoner, contended that by</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">opening of the case the transaction was shown to confine itself to the day upon which the deceased lost her life; and objected to evidence being given of circumstances which occurred twelve or twenty-four hours previously, unless they could be shown to have some bearing on the actual killing. The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">did not think it possible to exclude what passed the night before</hi>). The prisoner was very tipsy—I saw his wife at that time up at Mrs. Lancaster's, who lives on the second floor of the, same house—I saw her in the court that evening; the latest hour was half past 9 o'clock—after the prisoner came into the court, I went up to the gate, and the prisoner's little girl brought him some beer—I saw the prisoner at his window about 10 o'clock that evening, Tuesday—he was alone, only the children with him—on the following day, Wednesday, I saw him come into the court at exactly a quarter past 1 o'clock in the afternoon; he was sober—he said nothing to me as he came through the court—I said to him, "There you are," and he pointed his finger to me and said, "Hush!" and then went into his own house—I do not know where his wife was at that time—about a quarter to 3 o'clock, I was going to his room; he and his wife were there, and I beard her say that if she was what be represented her to be she never would have been his wife—that was the first thing I heard said—the prisoner said, "Never mind, never mind, it <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> occur again," in a very low tone of voice—I then went downstairs,</p>

               <p>and just as I got into the court I heard a noise proceeding from his room—I heard a cry of "Murder!" proceeding from his room—I could recognize the voice that screamed, it was Mrs. Mobbs's, and I called to him from the passage of No. 7, to let her out of the room—Mrs. Jones, who lives there went up stairs and knocked at his door, and at that time I heard a box <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> across the room—I was at that time in the passage—after that I heard the child cry out "Mother, mother!"—I then saw the deceased coming down stairs with the blood flowing from her neck (Mrs. Jones had come down before that)—the deceased was covered with blood, and when she came into the court we perceived that her throat was cut; she was not able to speak; her hair was all banging about her—she was assisted by some of the neighbours and carried out of the court—that was the last I saw of her—I saw the prisoner carried out of his house about an hour afterwards, with his throat bandaged—while I lived in the court, I observed that they lived unhappily together—I remember seeing the prisoner and his wife together on 13th Aug., and saw him do something to her.</p>

                  </hi>, I am the wife of John Lancaster, a carman. He works in the docks now; we lived in the same house as the prisoner and his late wife, and occupied the second floor front room, which is immediately over the room occupied by the prisoner and his wife; there is only one room on each floor—I have known them living under me since the Saturday before Easter Sunday; I lived there before that—there were four children, which the prisoner had by a former wife—I have been told that the deceased had no</p>

               <p>should not murder her—he then got up from the chair, and dragged her out of the room by her clothes, out into the court, and dashed her up against the gates where they live—there is a little garden before each house; she stood there, he dragged her to the street door, and she said she would not go up stairs unless I went with her—I went up stairs into their room, and stayed about ten minutes—only a few words passed between them while I was there—I do not recollect what she said, but I recollect him saying she was with a policeman all night; she said she was not, that she was in my place—I said nothing about that to the prisoner, I made my way and came down stairs——about ten minutes after I came down I heard her screaming—(this was before 6 o'clock in the morning)—I heard her say if he did not leave her alone she would jump out of the window—she opened the window—I did not hear her say anything to him when the window was open, but she said to me, "Was not I in your place, my dear, all night?" and I said, "Yes," and she said to him, "Now are you satisfied?"—he made no answer that I heard.</p>

Help!" in a much fainter voice—I knocked very violently, and with shaking the handle I found the door was not locked—it opened a little, and I said, "You wretch, you, let the woman out, and <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> you murder her"—there was something against the door which prevented my opening it wider—the screams then entirely ceased, and I heard no more till I heard a rustling in the room, and my neighbours called to me—it was somebody moving chairs, or something of that kind—I cannot say whether the noise was near the door—some person then opened</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 577). On Wednesday afternoon, 24th Aug., I was called to No. 4, Enoch-court—I went up to the first floor, and found the prisoner there, held up on a chair by two parties—he told me to tell George, the cellarman at Mr. Walter Hall's, the wine merchant, at Water-lane, to deliver the things all right—a surgeon was sent for, and I assisted in taking the prisoner to the London Hospital—I should say he was sober at the time I went—after his throat was sewn up at the hospital, and he was got to bed, he said his wife had been out all the night before, and he saw her along with a policeman, one of the Metropolitan policemen, and she was out the best part of the night before that—he said no more then—on the 27th he said he should not have done it if she bad not taken the white handled knife and said she would stab him; that he took the knife from her and cut her throat, gave her two cuts, and then put the knife down, took up his child, who was in the room, and kissed it, and then took up the brown handled knife and cut his own throat—I produce the two knives—they were handed to me by my brother officer—I was examined by the Coroner on 1st Sept., the Thursday week following—I had four communications made to me by the prisoner, three before, and one after my examination before the Coroner—I have named two—they were on 29th, 27th, and 24th Aug.—I did not make any note of them—on the 24th he said, at the hospital, that his wife was out all the night before with a policeman, and part of the night before she was out—I had asked him no question whatever—I was by the side of the bed, standing up—I bad said nothing to him; he used those words, and that was all that passed—I remained with him in the hospital every day—he spoke again on Saturday, the 27th—I never asked him a question—he said he should not have done it, only his wife took the white handled knife, and said she would stab him, and he took it away from her, and cut her throat, giving her two cuts; that he laid the knife down, took up his child and kissed it, and then took up the brown handled knife and cut his own throat—that was all that passed then—on the Monday following, the 29th, he said to me, "Oh! <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, I wish I could die! for they are only making me better to hang me"—that was all that was said before the inquest—after the inquest, on 4th Sept., he said he sharpened the brown handled knife on the whetstone, which was on the table, before he cut his own throat—he addressed me by my Christian name—I have known him a long while—I was examined by the Coroner on Thursday, 1st Sept., after the prisoner had told</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at the London Hospital. The body of the deceased was brought there on 24th Aug., covered with blood, her clothes were saturated with blood; there was a wound across the front of the throat about six inches long, and on the face and neck there were ten other smaller wounds; there were also wounds on the fingers of both hands—the wound in the throat divided three of the jugular veins, but not the arteries; that caused her death—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the following day; the organs of life were healthy—I examined a wound across the front of the prisoner's throat, it was between five and six inches long—it opened the wind pipe in two places, and divided one of the principal arteries, it was a dangerous wound—I did not think he would live an hour when he came in—the wounds on the woman and on the man were such as might have been inflicted by these knives.</p>

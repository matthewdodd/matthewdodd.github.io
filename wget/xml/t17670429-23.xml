I was out of town, and came home the 18th of March; then my shopman told me, I had a female thief in my house. I charged a constable with her, and took her before the Alderman, and before I came back my chamber-maid had been to a person she had been informed of, and brought home some of the things; I have got all again but a sugar-castor and tea-pot. They are my property, and have my mark upon them. The prisoner has lived with me but about six weeks.</p>

            . I was a labourer to Mr. Joseph. The prisoner sent me with a letter and pewter teapot to a cousin she had at Wapping, on a Sunday night; I delivered them to the person. The next Sunday she sent for me to give me a little soup, and then sent me again with another parcel. I had a thought there was something in the paper more than common; I opened it, and in it were two children's boats, two milk-pots, and a sugar-castor; there were two letters on the pots, R for Henry and H for Joseph.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop there? - A. I did then, a milliner's and haberdasher's; when I returned I went into the shop, and put my cloak off, and threw it carelessly in the window; I had altered the cloak two or three days before; it was made of black silk; there were two buttons and loops behind, with a small hood, and a piece of blue ribbon tacked behind to tie it; I threw it down carelessly, and went into a room beyond the shop to tea; the room don't join to the shop; it is a good way behind the shop; about half an hour after, I came into the shop to serve a customer; I found my cloak and every thing safe; then I went and finished my tea; I came in again a little after six, or between six and seven, meaning to fold my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110029"></xptr>cloak up and put it away; I found the cloak gone and the window broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the manner of breaking the window? - A. It was the bottom pane, and it was at the corner of the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of the hole? - A. A very small part was broke; I don't believe there was room for a person to put his arm through; I missed a piece of muslin that lay by the glass, and a child's cap, that was all I missed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see them again? - A. That was on Monday the 5th of December; the officer of the Police-office, Worship-street, came to me the Wednesday week after, that was nine or ten days, and I saw the cloak, but the muslin I cannot swear to.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Police-officer belonging to Worship-street: On Friday, the 9th of December, I was at the apprehending of the prisoners, at Mrs. Waring's house.</p>
               <p>Q. All of them? - A. Yes; she lives at No. 70 Charlotte-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did you apprehend them? - A. In the afternoon; it was past four o'clock; there were three apprehended first, Williams, Milton (the chimney-sweeper), and Green; Waring not being at home then, I apprehended him the same night at the same house, his mother's; when I apprehended the three first, I waited some time before I told them my business; they were in the back place; I called them into the house, and stopped for Warring coming in; I asked the mother where he was; she said, gone to Bethnal-green; we took them to the office, and went back and waited till Waring came in, and took him to the office.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable belonging to the Worship-street Office; I was at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110030"></xptr>the office on Saturday, the 10th, and took this piece of muslin from Mrs. Waring, the mother; it was round her as a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A. No; I then went to the prosecutrix's house, and desired her to attend the office.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brooks). How was the cloak brought to you; was it wrapped up in any thing? - A. Yes; this newspaper.</p>
               <p>Q. (To. Mrs. Printon). Look at the cloak? - A. It answers the description of the cloak I lost; I have little doubt of it being the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find those things on the cloak that you put on it a few days before? - A. Yes; exactly as I did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have all or most cloaks those things you had put to it? - A. No, very few.</p>
               <p>Q. It has precisely the appearance of your cloak? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe it to be your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any entry delivered to Mr. Gouldstone? - A. There is, of three kilderkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing, in point of fact, of this day in particular; were you in the counting-house that evening? - A. I have not a recollection that I was; we have a store-house clerk that keeps a check account against it when the dray is loaded; he and the check-clerk count it over; and then in the evening, he is to give an account of what he has done with it; he returned at night, and has charged the beer to the different people, as is here mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, in your pocket, any receipt, purporting to have been given to Mr. Corbet for beer? - A. I have, (produces it.) It is the hand-writing of

            ; it appears from the book, no beer was delivered to Mr. Corbet; and that there were three casks of beer delivered to Mr. Gouldstone.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does the beer he was supposed to have received that morning, agree with the account he gave in the evening? - A. It does, exactly; he accounts for all the beer he received in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return any beer that day? - A. If I look in the book I can tell; he returned one kilderkin, and seven sirkins, which he deducts from the quantity which he took out in the morning, which leaves the balance exactly right.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When did this man leave your service? - A. At Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. These books are continually under your inspection? - A. They are, when I think proper to look into them.</p>
               <p>Q. And always under the inspection of your clerks? - A. It is his business to enter the beer into that book; and then it goes into the hands of the posting-clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with this entry at all before he left your service? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difference now depending between you and this man; any charge of wages on his part? - A. He has sent me a bill for wages, of 12l. 3s. 101/2d. I have a set off for that of 34l. odd.</p>
               <p>Q. This demand he made before you brought this charge against him? - A. He wrote his bill out and sent it by his wife; I have never spoke to him at all upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon the oath you have taken, whether he did not make this demand against you, before you made the accusation against him? - A. He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you took him up? - A. Perhaps a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send more than once? - A. I never saw any body from him but once; his wife called once, and said she wished I would pay her husband's wages; and I have seen neither him nor her since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been told, by your servants, that this man has been sending for his wages? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170082"></xptr>Q. Have not you reason to know that he has sent more than once? - A. If he has, Mr. Bittlestone will give you an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, as a man of credit, don't you how that he has sent more than once? - A. Upon my oath, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you reason to believe, from your servants, that he has sent more than once? - A. I will not charge my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Try your recollection again? - A. I cannot say stronger than I have said.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, has it not been told you by your servants, that he has sent repeatedly for his wages? - A. If he has, I have no knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not more than a week before you took him up, that he sent in this account? - A. I have seen the prisoner several times since he left my service, in his last place, and he never mentioned a word to me about his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose employ was he when you took him up? - A. In Messrs. Sharpe's employ.</p>
               <p>Q. The way, in which the account is made out, is, that he and the store-clerk together, make out the quantity of beer received for him to carry out? - A. They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you have not known frequent mistakes to happen about the quantities sent out, or the quantities received back? - A. Certainly; it is a very possible case to make a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen? - A. If it does happen, we don't hear of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask again, does it not frequently happen in your brewhouse? - A. It has happened several times with Butler.</p>
               <p>Q. This account, checked by your own clerk, tallies, does it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then your own clerk; whom you trust, has vouched, that the quantity brought back, and the quantity delivered, make up the quantity sent out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If there is any mistake in the account, you will make him answerable for it? - A. If they mistake, we certainly do.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the constant practice, if a man's account is not correct, to make him pay the difference? - A. The only incorrection possible is, the man is to enter a less quantity than that he carries.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this, whether if you find any mistakes in the delivery, and less is delivered than set down, is it not the constant practice to charge it against the man, and either make him pay for it in money, or deduct it from the wages due to him? - A. If we conceive it to be really a mistake, and not downright negligence, we don't.</p>
               <p>Q. If you consider it as negligence and carelessness, you do make it matter of account between you? - A. Certainly so.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you now consider this man as liable to pay you so much money? - A. No; I don't consider him as liable to pay any thing upon the face of his own account, taking it for granted his account is right.</p>
               <p>Q. But if you find afterwards the account is not right, do you not constantly charge the man with the difference? - A. I never charged him with the difference of any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, when you find the party's account not right, is it not the constant course of your house to put so much against him, and if the account is not right, do you not charge it against him? - A. I have already said, I never made him pay the difference of an 8s. in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the practice to make other persons pay it? - A. I have considered it as a right, but I never exercised that right; I have not a recollection that I ever did; I am sure I have not in Butler.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, when you have found the account of others wrong, made them pay the difference, where there is an actual difference, whether you impute it to blunder or design, do you not make the party pay the difference? - A. I don't recollect hardly an instance.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us the few instances that you recollect? - A. Then I say, I don't recollect an instance.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say then, you did not recollect hardly an instance? - A. Surely, if you had not stopped me just when you did, I should certainly have said, I had not a recollection of an instance.</p>
               <p>Court. It is perfectly clear, and thus far you have got it, that when a man takes out beer and does not account for it, he must be answerable for that beer; but, says he, though the right is in me, I don't recollect an instance where we have exercised that right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys Q. You say you have a set off of 35l.? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is not this very beer included in that set off? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing but this beer, I suppose? - A. No, certainly not; there are other things besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing but the beer, included in your indictment? - A. No; 22l. of it is for receipts that we have against him, which he has received and not accounted for.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether the beer you charge this man with selling, and not accounting for, you have made him debtor for? - A. We charge him with it as our clerk, in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say there is a balance of an account; do you, in that balance due to you, include the beer which you now accuse him of having stolen as your property? - A. Certainly not; if it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170083"></xptr>is so, it is a perfect mistake, it is in my partner Bittleston's hand-writing, I will run through it, and see.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray do be so good? - A. I see my partner has put the name of Corbet down.</p>
               <p>You see how incautious you are, you swore just now, it was not included in the set off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is that book? - A. It is a book of mistakes and blunders that have come against this man, and which has been wrote down here as memorandums, as they have occurred at the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether you have in the balance of the account made, as a charge against him, this beer, as delivered to Mr. Corbet? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that set off include this beer which you say never was sold to Corbet, and you make him debtor for that beer? - A. He is made debtor in this book for the beer.</p>
               <p>Q.Which book is written by your partner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you make him debtor for? - A. Twenty-two pounds seven shillings and six-pence, receipts coming against him, and the amount of this book is 11l. 19s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have charged him as your debtor with 11l. 19s. including the beer delivered to Corbet.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Gurney, Mr. Kirkman has now put a compleat end to the cause, because he first of all states the practice of the trade, which is a very proper one; there is an account taken in the morning of all the beer that he receives; in the evening. he is to account to whom he has sold the beer, and he is likewise to return the receipts when he does not bring the money; and it has been asked upon cross-examination, whether in case of accidents or mistakes, he does not account for it; he does not charge him with it, he says, he is liable, but he does not recollect an instance of it; but it appears, that, for this very beer he himself has done that which has made a debt of it, for, says he, we have charged this account with the identical beer he has sold to Corbet, and therefore we have made him our debtor, and therefore the law says, you shall not afterwards charge him with felony, you having made him your debtor.</p>

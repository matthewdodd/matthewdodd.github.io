                  </hi>. I live at Iver Heath, near Uxbridge—on Saturday, 3rd October, a few minutes before 2 o'clock, I was in the Dolphin public-house with the two prisoners—they left about five minutes before I did—when I came out, I proceeded on my way home—I stood talking to a man for a few minutes—when I got to the canal bridge, I met the two prisoners—Hughes said he would <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on me, when I was in the public-house, because I would not treat them—Hughes said, "Here is the one, we will let him know the reason why he did not treat us"—Hughes hit me on the face and mouth, and on the temple, with his fist; it knocked me down on the ground—Murray put his hand in my left-hand coat pocket, and took all the money I had; that was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they then jumped up and ran away—I got up, and went home as hard as I could—I went to Uxbridge next morning, and gave information—the prisoners were taken into custody on Monday—I am sure they are the two who struck me—they had been in the Castle, at Uxbridge, with me the same evening; I treated them there—I changed a half-sovereign there.</p>

               <p>me—I told the constable that I would not charge anyone till I had spoken to my master; and after that I told the constable they were the two men—that was on the Monday night—I gave the prisoners into custody, and then said I could identify them.</p>

The prosecutor came to the station on Sunday morning, and made a statement to me—his eye was black, and his lip swollen up—in consequence of that description, I appre<lb></lb>hended the prisoners on the Monday morning—the prosecutor saw them on Sunday, and said he could not identify them—he said he was afraid of his master dismissing him for being out so late at night—he saw the pri<lb></lb>soners when they were in custody, and said they were the men—on the Sunday I asked Birch if he could identify Hughes, and he said, "I cannot; I don't think I can"—he also said he could not identify Murray.</p>

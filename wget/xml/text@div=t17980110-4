               <p>JAMES BERRY, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I live on Sunbury-common, near East Bedfont: I did not know that I had lost any sheep till I had an application on the 7th of December from the constable of Staines; I sent my servant with the officer to Staines to look at the sheep; I was present when my stock was examined the next morning, about eight o'clock, when we missed two ewe sheep; the officer of Staines brought back the two sheep that I had lost about eleven o'clock the same morning.</p>
               <p>Q.Were those your sheep that were so brought back? - A.They were; the prisoner at the bar has been employed by me for some time, but not at the time of the robbery; he was a shepherd employed by my farmer, and looked after them when they were sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Who marked your sheep? - A. The prisoner marked them, and sheared them; the mark is a B surrounded by a ring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner was not a servant of your household? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you know of any other sheep with the same mark upon the common? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know a little about age, perhaps-what age were these? - A. What we call two years sheep.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How many sheep were there when you first counted them? - A. Twenty-three.</p>
               <p>Q.How many were there afterwards? - A. Twenty-one.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a butcher at Egham: The prisoner came, on Sunday the 3d of December, to the Nag's-head, at Egham, in company with his son, and sent for me from the King's-head, I was at a vestry; I went to him, his son was fuddled, and very rude, and I could not have any conversation with him; then he himself appeared to be very sober, I told him to come out of doors, I would have nothing to do with his son he was so rude; he accordingly came out, and told me he could help me to some mutton; I asked him whose they were, or what they were; he made me no answer to that, but said, he could help me to some at half its value; he then said, would I have them dead or alive; I told him I had rather have them alive, and then I could kill them myself; he said the sheep belonged to a gentleman, that they were turned out upon the common without counting, and he could help me to some at any time; he asked me how many I would have; I said two; he said, I might as well have three, and he would get them up on the Wednesday following;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100007"></xptr>I asked him at what time; and he said, at nine o'clock, at his house in Bedfont-lane, that was all that passed on the Sunday; accordingly I went on the Wednesday to the prisoner's house, having first gone to Sir

No, not near the value of them; I then got into the cart, and drove away; when I had got to the turnpike, I stopped my horse, got out of the cart, and returned back to his house; I met him at the corner of the house, put a pistol to his breast, and told him he was my prisoner, he must go along with me; by that time the constable, Bridger, came up, and we took him, and put him into the cart along with the sheep, and drove to Staines; on Thursday, the 7th, we took him to Sir

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How far is Egham from Sunbury-common? - A. As nigh as I can guess, about five miles.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the prisoner's house from Sunbury-common? - A. About a mile and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. He sent for you from the vestry, on the Sunday, and told you, without any hesitation, making no secret of it, that he could get you sheep at any time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And it was not till Wednesday that he was to get them up? - A. It was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by getting them up, getting them off the common? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say as you had just come out of the church, that you had goodness and charity enough to say to him, why, no, don't you go and rob your neighbour? - A. No, I did not think any thing about it at that moment.</p>
               <p>Q.You had just come from church, had not you? - A. No; I was at the public-house, I had not been at church that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think it a bad thing then, that he should steal his neighbour's sheep? - A. I thought it was a bad thing, and I thought it right to detect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him not to go on in that way, that it was bringing himself, body and soul, to destruction? - A. I did not think of giving him a caution at that time, because he had told me he had had some before.</p>

            ) I see stealing the wool; on Friday, the 25th of August, about the hour of twelve o'clock, as near as I can tell, I was at Mr. Dolland's, and was standing against the window, washing my hands, and I saw this man going along, and he stopped nearly opposite to the school; I see him get up to the top of the wheel of the cart, and list up the middlemost bag in the cart, the cart was loaded with bags, there were three bags laid across the body of the cart; he listed up the middlemost of the three, so that he got into the cart, and let the bag rest on his shoulder; after that I see his hand move, as if he was drawing something out of the bag, I could distinguish he was taking something, but could not tell what; I kept my eye on him, and it seemed as if he was stowing it away to somewhere else in the cart, and then he seemed as if he was fastening the bag up again; I did not see him take the wool out of the cart till afterwards, he put the bag down in its place again, and got off the cart; I put my coat on, and ran down stairs immediately, and followed the cart immediately, till it got nearly between Queen's-court and Queen's Arms tavern, there he stopped his cart again; I stepped off the pavement, and went against the iron rails of the church, to see what he was going to do, and he got up on the top of the wheel, and he turned about, as if he was looking at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170216"></xptr>me, and I thought that he saw me, and I turned my head away, and pulled out my watch, as though to see what it was o'clock, and I see him take the basket out of the cart, and bang it underneath the axle-tree of his cart; it is the basket they carry their hay in; after he had done that he went on, and I followed him down into Fleet-market, down at the Arrow public house, there he stopped, and called for a pint of beer, when he called for the pint of beer he drank once out of it, and this other man, that is standing there, he beckoned to him, and he came to him, Watley beckoned to Hill, they drank together, and tasked together for about the space of three minutes, after they had talked together a space of time, Hill went up as if he was going up towards Fleet-street way, and Watley went on with his cart, there was a cart at the Angel door, and there Watley stopped, and took the basket that was at his own cart, and put it to the cart that stood at the Angel door.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Watley at the time that Hill went towards Fleet-street? - He was going on towards Snow-hill; I took the number of that cart at the Angel, 25290, Thomas Potter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then discover, or have you discovered since, who was the driver of that cart at the Angel door? - We had not discovered then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any driver by it at that time? - Not any.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between twelve and one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after this? - After I see him put the basket up into that cart, I followed Watley down to the Swan inn, where this wool was going to be unloaded; as soon as ever he had got into that inn, he set his cart there, and went away and left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the basket after he put it to the cart at the Angel door? - I do not, I still kept following Watley, and left the basket to take its chance.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he left his cart? - He left his horse, cart and bags, and all in the Swan inn, and went out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which way Watley went towards? - Fleet-market way, towards where he had left the basket; after I got into the inn, I asked the bookkeeper -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I will not hear that.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you stay to watch Watley where he left the cart, or give information to the inn? - I gave information to Mr. Palmer, the book-keeper, I went and asked him if he could tell me was the wool belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he the book-keeper of the inn? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. He got up on the bags and looked at them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct him to the middlemost bag? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the middlemost bag when Palmer took it, and did you observe any opening of the bag? - It appeared to me that there had been wool taken out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to have been done? - It appeared to have been opened at one side, by the string being cut where it had been sewed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the contents of the bag was? - Yes, spanish wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to have been opened and sewed up again? - It was a string run from one end of the bag to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to you that the bag had been opened? - It appeared to me that the string had been cut, and drawed out so that it could be put in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been drawn up again? - Yes, but still there was the appearance of its having been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Palmer weigh the bag in your prefence? - Yes; I went with the person that went with the weight of the bag,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170217"></xptr>and by their books it appeared it was deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brookes is a wool broker, is not he? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Hill afterwards, or Watley? - Watley came back again and was taxed about this wool, and denied it; I gave charge of him myself; Mr. Palmer taxed him about it; he said he knew nothing at all about it; he said I was a false man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with Mr. Dolland still? - Yes, I have been there these two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing afterwards of the basket or Hill? - I never see any thing of the basket after I see him put it on the cart. Mr. Palmer and I went to look after it, but the basket was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go? - To the Angel door; the cart was standing there, but the basket was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Potter about the number of the cart? - I gave information to Mr. Brookes, I did not go to see after Mr. Potter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Lynch, you live with Mr. Dolland? - I work for him in his own house; I have worked so for upwards of these two years.</p>

            Nothing else struck you at all? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it was pretty odd that a man should get up in a cart in St. Paul's Church yard? - Whether it was odd or no he certainly did, that there side is not so public as the other side is.</p>
               <p>Q. The carriages go all round by the school? - But I don't think that there was a carriage come by.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that you did not take notice where there were any carriages came by? - They might, but I did not fix my eye on them. I fixed my eye on this man, that was my object.</p>
               <p>Q. This took up a consideraole time; you followed him down to the Arrow public-house; you must have passed a great number of persons in that space? - I kept close by the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you stuck to that like a leech, but you must have passed a great number of persons? - Without a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you see this business carrying forward, a man robbing his master, you did not mention it to any body in the course of that space? - No; I never stopped to speak to any body; I never mentioned it to any body till I got down to the inn, and then I mentioned it to the book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Watley came back to the inn, you tell us, and there he was apprehended? - Yes, he came back again after he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. And then was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was taxed with it, and denied it? - That was very impudent, after you had seen him do all this in open day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Come let us have a word with you. The first time you see the prisoner Hill was coming out of the public-house? - The first time I see Hill he was talking to Watley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not coming out of the public-house as Watley was going in? - Watley never went into the public-house; he stood at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Watley so far as you conceive, apprehend your design of following him? - I rather think he did when he see me in Fleet-market, by before seeing me against the rails in the church yard.</p>

            Have you the note that he delivered? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver it to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So then he brought the wool to his master Brookes's direction, and when you charged him with the robbery he denied having any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he came back to the Swan Inn, where he was taken? - He went out first and had his dinner, and came back again before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wool weighed in the presence of Watley? - No; I think it was in his absence he went to dinner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles to Lynch. Was the bag weighed in the presence of Watley? - Yes, he saw the bag weighed.</p>
               <p>Jury. If Mr. Palmer missed any, why did the prisoner go away before his cart was unloaded? - That I cannot say, the carman left the cart and returned again after a time.</p>
               <p>Jury to Martin. Was the prisoner present when the wool was weighed? - I don't recollect that he was.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Brookes, the wool broker. I attended on the part of the buyer and seller to see the wool weighed, at a warehouse in French Horn yard, Crutched Friars.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these ten bags delivered to Watley to carry in the cart? - I see two or three in his cart, and I gave orders of them bags to be put in his cart, and to be forwarded to the inn to go into the country. I have not seen the bag since I weighed it in the scale at the warehouse. I took the weights at the time, and see the weights in the scale. I received the mark of the bag of Mr. Palmer from the inn, No. 15, S. C. Jones, and I find a deficiency of nine pounds. The weight that I took in the warehouse is one hundred three quarters and sixteen pounds; the weight I received from the inn was one hundred three quarters and seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of nine pounds of Spanish wool? - It is worth three shillings and eight pence a pound.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it the basket? - Probably it may.</p>
               <p>Court to Palmer. Is that the basket you received from Skeates, the last witness? - I delivered it to a porter in the yard to go to Mr. Brookes, and Mr. Brookes paid him for his trouble; he is not here; he is out of place now.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it like the basket? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is like every other basket of the same sort I suppose? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bond. I believe that to be one of my baskets; it is marked S. B.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your baskets marked S. B.? - Yes; but there is another person marks his baskets S.B.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Wader brought home a basket? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you have missed such a basket? - I do not.</p>

The prisoner was in my service; having several times missed money, I was induced to mark what I left in the till on the night of the 21st of December. At about twenty minutes after eight the next morning, I told one of my daughters to bring me up the till, and then I missed the money in question; at about eleven o'clock in the morning, I went to Bow-street, and got an officer, and stated to him the circumstances. He came down to my house, and ordered her into the dining-room. He told her to produce her money, which she did, to the amount of thirteen or fourteen shillings, and among it was the identical money I had missed from the till. She said, that a gentleman had given it to her in Figtree-court, in the Temple. The officer took her to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>ARCHIBALD RUTHWIN. I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. The account the last witness has given is true. The prisoner told me that an old man who used the house, had told her to do it, and to give him part, for that the servant who had the place before her had done it, and she could not be found out. She had given the old man sixpence that morning, and sixpence the morning before.</p>

He saw me lock up my trunk at night, with the articles stated in the indictment in it, and four 1 l. notes - I put the key in my pocket. Next morning, about half-past five o'clock, I went out with him and the landlady - he went back, and said he would get his breakfast; I got back between eight and nine o'clock, found my trunk open, and missed all this property, with a letter directed to me - they were all wrapped up together; I saw the prisoner at the house about twelve o'clock, and gave him in charge on the Monday following. The constable searched him, and found my letter on him, also some pieces of black ribbon, which I knew to be mine.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at Hackney - I keep the house. I found the medal in the prisoner's bed, between the two sheets, on the Thursday after the Saturday that the prosecutrix had been robbed; my little boy, who is six years of age, slept with him. My mother lives in the house - she is seventy-five years of age; nobody else lives there. The prisoner went out with us, returned back, and overtook us again in a short time. It appeared imposible to me that he could then have broken the box open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening of the 1st of October, I met a man, who had formerly kept company with the prosecutrix. I said a little against her; she heard of it, and said she would be revenged on me. I went out with them, left them, and overtook them again immediately. I met a fellow-workman, and went to work with him. I went home to breakfast, and the landlady's mother said she believed the prosecutrix's box had been broken open,</p>

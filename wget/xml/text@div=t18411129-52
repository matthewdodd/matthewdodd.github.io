                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 182.) I saw the prisoner in the Harrow-road, about half-past twelve o'clock, on the 1st of November, in company with two others—I watched them, and saw them look into several boot-shop windows—there are three boot-shops just going into the Har<lb></lb>row-road—I had seen them some time before; in fact, I had been watch<lb></lb>ing them for a month, ever since I was on the beat—I saw the prisoner go into the shop of Mr. Garrett, a baker, and bring out four half-quartern loaves—he joined the others, and went towards the Irongate-wharf—I met them again—they saw me, and ran as fast as they could—I ran through a public-house, met them, and stopped the prisoner with the loaves—he was in the act of giving them to one of the others—I took him back to the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I worked for Mr. Joseph Garrett, the baker, and live at No. 43, Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. This bread is Mr. Garrett's—I know it by the stamp on the top—it was missed, and found again in about half an hour.</p>

               <p>he said it was not it, and when the policeman took him to the station, he was talking to the boy—the inspector afterwards asked him again, and he said, Yes, he said he knew it by a hole being bored on the top.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not at first say I did not know the bread—I said it was ours—I said I should know it by the mark—it had two holes in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The man that works at the bake house said at the office that he would not swear to the bread on any account, and when the police<lb></lb>man took me back to the shop, the woman there said she did not know whether the bread was hers or not.</p>

The man said he would not swear to any bread, but I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and take it—the wo<lb></lb>man at the shop said she was not aware how much bread there was in the shop—Mr. Garrett was out at the time—there was no other baker's shop about there—there are two chandlers' shops who sell bread, but not near the spot—I cannot be mistaken in what I saw—I had been watching the prisoner for half an hour previous.</p>

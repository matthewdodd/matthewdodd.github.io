            . I am a constable of St. James, Westminster. On the 15th of May, the night his Majesty went to <placeName id="t18220703-3-crimeloc10">Drury-lane Theatre</placeName>

               <p>"D - n you, keep your hand out of my pocket;" this was two hours before the present transaction. About twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock, I saw him again, I had been watching him; I observed him standing three or four yards on the left hand side of a gentleman, who had a watch in his pocket; I saw the seal and ribbon, and the prisoner was looking at it - when the trumpet sounded, and the King coming out of the house, the prisoner shifted to the right of the gentleman, and as the carriage drew near, the prisoner clapped his hands just against the gentleman's ears, and hissed; he then threw his arms round the gentleman who was huzzaing, and made a pull at the watch, but did not succeed in getting it - the carriage came nearly up; he made a second attempt, but did not succeed; then the carriage came close up, and the gentleman took his hat off and held it up huzzaing, and then he succeeded in getting it out - I was about a quarter of a yard from the the prisoner; I said to the gentleman,</p>
               <p>"You are robbed, follow me," he said</p>
               <p>"No, my guard chain has saved it" - I secured the prisoner, he made great resistance, and said he was the King's servant. I took him towards Street's public-house, in Bow-street, a mob followed us; I put him in the house, and called out for the gentleman who lost his watch; nobody answered. He got the watch out of the pocket, but never separated it from the person.</p>

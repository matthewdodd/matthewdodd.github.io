On 28th August, I was on duty in the Strand, at an hour and a half past midnight, and saw Wright—there was a tipsy man in front of him, staggering—McCann followed sixty or eighty yards off; I followed them—McCann walked up to the gentleman, over<lb></lb>took him, and knocked him into the roadway, at the corner of Buckingham Street, by striking him with his fist—Wright then kicked him, and McCann stooped down on him—I seized Wright, and handed him to another police<lb></lb>man, and then seized McCann—it was so momentary that there was not time to get away—a number of prostitutes came round the gentleman, and he went away—I do not think I should know him again—there had been no <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I searched Wright at the station, and found this purse, with a half<lb></lb>penny in it—he threw away this dice box in the Strand—I found on McCann, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 71/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the gentleman was on his side, and M Cann stooped down to where his pockets would be.</p>

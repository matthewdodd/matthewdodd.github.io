               <p>Court. Did they demand your money? - No Sir, they turned me round on my face, tore my apron, and picked my pockets of sixpence, half a crown, and some halfpence, and a knife; I am sure I had that money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive them riffling your pocket? - I am sure it was one of the men; I laid as still as possible, for fear they would quite kill me.</p>
               <p>How soon after was this man apprehended? - The next Monday, this was Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Where were you taken to that night? - I was taken to some publick house, I cannot say what; I live at No. 28, in Skinner-street. I bled all night; I applied to the dispensary in Primrose-street, and was cured. On Thursday after the robbery, I gave information to Mr. Wilmot's office, and came on Monday to look at the prisoner at the bar, I knew him directly, he knew me; I had seen several before, but they were not the men; I was sent for several times before; I should know the prisoner from a thousand: the first thing I accused him with was, that he had not the same waistcoat on last Tuesday night which he then had, he said he had not: I told him he had the same coat on, he said he had, which was a light drab coloured coat; I charged him with cutting and wounding me, he said I was mistaken; he said he was with his mother and sister that night, at a publick house in petticoat lane, from six o'clock till ten.</p>

               <p>Did you charge him with robbing you too? - I did, I told him I was robbed by one or the other; I told him he was the man that cut me, which as there is a living God he was; he was ordered again for examination on Wednesday, then he brought several gentlemen to prove that he was at a publick house, the St. Luke's Head, raffling for pigeons that night; I think the house was the St. Luke's Head, the corner of Bunhill-row; that being the case, the Justice told them, if they were to swear that he was on the other side of the water, he should commit him.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of night was it? - It rained very hard about a quarter past eight, but at the time I was robbed, the moon and stars shone exceedingly bright; the moon shone right in his face, and the stars shone very bright.</p>
               <p>How long might you have an opportunity of observing the prisoner before he came up? - About half a minute; I supposed him to be a friend, I saw him as plain as I can see you this moment; I knew him again by his fluttering, which is very remarkable, and I had spoke of his stuttering to several people before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he speak that night? - He spoke in such imprecations, such wicked oaths, that I could not, in the face of God, and you Gentlemen, repeat them; they beat me like a stock-fish.</p>
               <p>Court. Then upon the whole are you sure that this is the man? - As sure as I am a living man; there was nothing found upon h im.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. It was half past ten when you was used in this manner? - No, half after nine.</p>
               <p>You say it rained a good deal previous to this attack upon you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose the moon had been out before you was attacked? - I cannot say to a few minutes, but it was out then; I was robbed at the bottom of Stamford-hill.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Whitecross-street? - I never measured the ground; it may be a mile and a half, or it may be two miles.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a great deal more than that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it beyond the turnpike to Tottenham? - It was just below the Birdcage on Stamford-hill.</p>
               <p>Jury. Then it is about two miles and a quarter, or two miles and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the person that took you up? - I do not know who they are.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you bring the landlord of the house? - I do not know what house it was.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160063"></xptr>Was you sober at the time? - As sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The knife that was taken from the prisoner was not your knife? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any thing taken from the prisoner that was yours? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court. How come you to remember it was on that night? - I had been to pay a little money down, and I had the receipt in my pocket, and I called there as I came back.</p>

               <p>Was he in your company? - He was in the opposite box to me; but he must come past me if he went out.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I have known him about a year.</p>
               <p>What is he? - I really do not know, I only saw him there; I have heard he was a a plaisterer.</p>

               <p>To prisoner. Is it true that you said before the Justice, that you spent that evening with your mother and your sister? -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is all a falsity, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. It is very odd that you cannot recollect the house you was taken to the night you was robbed? - I cannot tell, I never was that road.</p>
               <p>Did you go home by yourself? - I went home with several, but who I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire to know any of the people that had been so kind to you? - I did the next day.</p>
               <p>If you were able to go home, you were able to ask questions; whereabouts was it that you was taken to? - It was the first publick-house in Newington I think, but I would not take my oath of it; the gentleman was glad to get home, I suppose he was afraid of being in danger himself.</p>
               <p>Court. After these people had come to the Justice's on the Wednesday, did you express after that any doubts about the man, or any concern about him? - No, I said, if it be so, I should be glad you should be acquitted, I said, if I thought I had swore wrong I would down on my knees and beg God and you pardon.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect whether he said where his mother's house was? - He told me it was some where near Old-street, but as to the name of the place he did not say.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing of having been in any company at a house the corner of Whitecross-street? - Whether he said so on the Monday when he was first taken, I do not recollect, any more than that he was at his mother's house, I then spoke to the prosecutor, and desired him to be very particular, and if he had any doubts on his mind that he would give up the prosecution, as the prisoner told me he lay at his mother's house; the prosecutor said, I wish I had doubts, but I have no doubts.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Green, a carpenter; I live at 5, Waterloo-place, Deptford. On Monday, 29th Dec., I left Barking, between 2 and 3 o'clock—I stopped on the road, at a person's house, in North-street—they asked me to have a glass of wine—I accepted it—I had but one glass from the time I left Barking—I reached Whitechapel-road, I think, between 8 and 9—it is seven miles from Barring to Whiteehapel Church—when I reached Whitechapel-road, near the workhouse, the prisoner spoke to me; he said, "Old lady, you seem very tired"—I said, "Yes, I am"—I cannot say whether it was 8 o'clock, or a little more; it could not be so late as 9; I had not noticed the clock at all—the prisoner asked if I had come far that day—I said, "From Barking"—he said, did I live in town—I said, no, I lived at Deptford—he said, "You are not going home to-night?"—I said, "No; I am going to my sister-in-law's, who lives in Barbican; I am going to sleep there to-night, and go home to-morrow"—he said, "If you will come along with me, I will show you the nearest way to it"—I thanked him, and, he seeming a working-looking man, I thought I would go along with him—he said, "I think you are a country-woman of mine"—I understood him to be an Irishman—I said, "Perhaps I am"—he walked on, and I said, "I am rather too tired to keep up with you"—he said, "I will wait for you;" and he walked rather slowly—I had bad feet; I could not walk so fast as he—when we got to Spitalfields Church, he seized me with his left hand, and struck me with his right hand, and knocked out my teeth in the front—he took away my shawl, and searched my pocket, and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was wrapped in a bit of brown paper—he took that away, and hit me again, turned to the left of the Church, and ran off—the second blow knocked me down on the pavement—I cried out, "Murder" and "Robbery!"—a woman picked me up, and a policeman came and took me to the station-house, all over blood—I then made a complaint, and gave a description of what sort of man he was—I did not go to Barbican that night; I was ashamed to go to my sister's—I went back to where the woman gave me the glass of wine—she sheltered me for that night; I sat in a chair—I came up to town again on business about a fortnight afterwards—I was in the neighbourhood of Bishopsgate-street, and I met the prisoner between two other Irishmen—he turned his head on one side—I went on the other side, to see if I could see any policeman—the prisoner went into a building there—I came up on the Monday afterwards, and made an arrangement with a policeman to meet me the next day, about 1 o'clock, next door but one to the building where the prisoner was, at a public-house—the next day I was there about half-past 12—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020052"></xptr>
               <p>—he came to the bar, and asked for a pot of beer—the landlady would not trust him—he said to one of his fellow-work men, "She did right not to trust me; I never meant to pay her; I might not be here at night"—I spoke to the policeman, and he came and took him—I had an opportunity of seeing his person on 29th Dec. so as to know that it was him; I remarked his fea<lb></lb>tures so well, and talked with him so much—I noticed his whiskers—he wore the same dress that he wears now—I had only one glass of wine after I left Barking.</p>

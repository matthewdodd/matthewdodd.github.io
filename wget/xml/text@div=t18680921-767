                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smith, a coffee house keeper, at 69, Haggerstone Road—on 4th September the prisoner came about 7.45, for half a pint of coffee and two slices of bread and butter—he gave me a florin and I spoke to my husband—he said it was bad, and he told the pri<lb></lb>soner he must give him another—he said he had no more about him—I saw him fidgeting about when my husband was speaking to him—on the Monday following we received some information and my brother-in-law searched the place where the prisoner had been sitting on the Friday, and found two florins wrapped up in a piece of newspaper—I gave the first florin he uttered to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. On 4th September, a little before 8 in the morning, the prisoner was in my coffee house—my wife came to me and gave me a counterfeit florin—I tried it and went to the prisoner and told him it was bad—I asked who he was, and he said he was a butcher and worked for a person named Gater, in Brick Lane—I called a constable and gave him into custody—a few days after a communication was made to me and I searched the box where the prisoner had been sitting—I found nothing at first, and then William Wilkins searched and I saw him find two bad florins behind the settle, wrapped up in a piece of newspaper, exactly in the same place where the prisoner had been sitting—I gave these to the constable.</p>

I live at 32, Leath Street Kingsland Road, and am the brother-in-law of the prosecutor—on Monday, 6th September, I helped to search one of the boxes—I found a piece of paper pushed down very tightly, and I could not pull it down, Mr. Smith helped me get it out; it contained these two bad florins—I gave them to the constable—it was the prisoner's father who came and gave the information.</p>

My mistress went to ask the price of it. Directly as she past me, the prisoner Thomas came and ran his head against my body. The small one is Thomas; and at that moment I felt my watch drawn from me. It was a sort of tortoise-shell case, and had Britannia and a ship in pins upon it. When I felt that, I saw

             throw his hand behind him, and there were two others in black coats came up at the same time. They came up close behind him, close to him. I never saw my watch after that. There was no body near Thomas when I felt my watch go from me. I then seized Thomas. I said, you are the person who has robbed me of my watch. In the space of about half a minute he held up his hands, and said, see here, I have not got any watch. I told him that he should go to the watch-house, and then the other two went away. Then the tallest of the two, who is now the other prisoner, came up again, and said, I am sure he is a respectable young man; he would not rob you of your watch. I had Thomas taken to the watch-house; and when he got there, he was well known. John was taken on the Tuesday following. At that time, Saturday he was not taken; but I described his person. He went away before the officer came up; but he was apprehended in consequence of my description. My watch was never discovered from that time to this.</p>

               <p>SARAH HILL. I am with my husband. On the 1st of June, I was at Whitechapel market; I went up to ask the price of a bit of beef. I turned round to ask my husband if he would have it; and I thought

             was talking to my husband; that is the tallest of the two. I thought he was talking to him. He was looking at him full in the face, and I looked at him for half a minute, and found they were not speaking, and with that I went up to him. It was at the side of the shop. There were two large lamps outside. I could distinguish his dress, and every thing, and he came before the Lord Mayor in the clothes; that man was John. I have not the least doubt about his being the person. I went up to my husband in the presence of the two prisoners, and asked him whether he had lost any thing. He said, yes; this lad had drawn my watch. He then had hold of the least prisoner, Thomas. Then the eldest got hold of me, and said; do you think a decent lad like him, could rob your husband of his watch; a decent lad like him. He is like a trad-sman's son. He was dressed as he is now, only he had a short white apron, and he looked like a working lad in a tradesman's shop. My husband told him to keep off; for if he did not, he should charge somebody with him. He said that to the tall one. Then Mr. Le Fevre came up and took the little one, and the big one turned up Whitechapel. My husband asked the lad where John lived; the little one did not speak, and my husband and Le Fevre took him to the watch-house; we were in the lower part of Whitechapel. I have no doubt whatever of them, by the lamps.</p>

             there. Joshua, the last witness joined our company. I saw John, about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before ten that night, and I remained there until about half after eleven. To my knowledge John never quitted the house during that time.</p>

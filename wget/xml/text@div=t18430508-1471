                  </hi>. I am an engraver and stationer, and carry on busi<lb></lb>ness at No. 115, Fleet-street. On Wednesday, the 8th of February, Smith made a communication to me as to somebody calling—next day the prisoner called—he did not say who or what he was—he asked me if I could execute a document exactly like this—this is the paper he produced—(<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> "A")—I told him I could—he asked how much it would be, I said I thought about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that waa for the engraving, including 1,000 impressions—he said he thought that was a great deal of money—I said there was a water-mark in it, which was not in my department, that I should have to get it done, and I did not exactly know what they might charge for it—(there is a water-mark in the centre)—I think I then told him if he would leave it till, the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080058"></xptr>
               <p>next day I would tell him exactly what I could do it for—he agreed to that, and left the shop, leaving the paper with me—after he was gone I examined the paper more minutely—I observed in the centre of it the initials "C. P." with the words "credito publico," and that was also in another part of the paper, like a water-mark, round the stamp—in consequence of discovering those words, I consulted Mr. Withers, a friend of mine, who is a cashier in the London and Westminster Bank—in consequence of what passed I went that same afternoon to St. Mary Axe, and saw Mr. Vanzalla, the Consul-General of Portugal—Mr. Vanzalla told me something, and gave me some instructions—next day the prisoner came again—I told him I had looked at it, and there was not so much work as I had thought, and I could do them, the first thousand for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a thousand afterwards, as he said he should want a great quantity—he said that was nearer the price—before he came that day I had seen Mr. Bush, of the firm of Bush and Mullins, solicitors for the prosecution—the prisoner took the paper away with him, and said I should see him in a day or two perhaps—in all my subsequent interviews with the prisoner I acted under the advice of Mr. Bush—I knew what I was about—I saw the prisoner again on Monday, the 13th of February—he brought the same paper marked "A"—he said that I should execute the order, and to let him have them as soon as possible, 1,000 first, but it was not to be stinted to that—I said it was usual for strangers to leave their address or a deposit—I think he said, "Quite right"—he gave no address, but he put a half-sovereign down on the counter, and said, "Will that do?"—I said, "Yes"—he then left—in consequence of the paper not being in my line I went to Mr. Saunders, a well-known paper-manufacturer, on the next day, the 11th—I left the paper marked "A" with Mr. Saunders, pointing out the water-mark—I saw the prisoner two or three times after that, up to the 25th of February, when he called—he merely came to inquire if the paper was ready—I told him I had got the paper in hand—on the 25th I had some paper from Mr. Saunders—I showed the prisoner one of those pieces of paper with the water-mark—I have not got the one that I showed him, but I have a similar piece, from the same mould—it is marked "B."—there are the figures "1000" in a circular wreath—he objected to the way in which the leaves were done—he compared it with the original—he pointed out to me what alteration it required—I said I thought it might be done—he shortly left, promising to call again—he called again on Monday, the 27th of Feb.—I had been engaged on the plate during that time—I showed him the plate which I bad been at work on—this is the plate—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was not quite finished—I told the prisoner so—I had not taken any proof from it at that time—I think the pri<lb></lb>soner complained about my being so long about it, but he did not complain about the plate—I promised to let him have a proof on the following day—he came again on the Wednesday—I then showed him a proof similar to one which I produce, marked "C"—that was the state of the plate on that day—on seeing that, he pointed out some alterations which he wished to be made in the engraving of the plate—he called on several occasions, and watched the progress of the plate, and the alterations I was making—he pointed out what he found fault with in the proofs that I produced to him—he was present on several occasions when I altered the plate itself—he stood over me while I did it—I recollect his doing so on the 29th of March—the alterations I then made are marked here on this proof, in pencil—he pen<lb></lb>cilled them, and I took my graver and altered the plate whilst he stood by—I think the alterations he then required was the white part of the "C" to be thinner—it is in the flourish over the "C"—that is what I call part of the</p>

               <p>"C"—it is not united with; the "C"—it is the "C'upon which the word "credito" is—the flourish comes over the "P," and then touches the "C"—there is another mark at the bottom of the "C," which be also pencillef—the "P" and "C" are both altered—the mark at the bottom of the "C" was to make it thinner, not to show so much white—he stood over me whilst I made those alterations with my gravet—on Saturday, the 18th of March, he called and asked for a proof—he said be wished to send it off by the post that even<lb></lb>ing—I gave him one, and he took it away with him—he said he wished to go to Paris, and that I was putting him to a deal of expense by stopping in Lon<lb></lb>don—on the 25th of March he came again, and had two more proofs—I think he said he was going to send them by the post—on that day there was some alteration made on this piece of paper, marked "F," by his direction—I do not know whether he was present on that day when I made this alteration—I made the alteration he requested—on the 28th he called again—I showed him a proof—I produce one marked "G"—he marked certain alter<lb></lb>ations on that, to be done by me—he then said that would do—I think those alterations were made whilst he staid—those on the 28th I know were—he called on Wednesday morning, the 29th, and suggested alterations, which I have named—I was then at work on the proofs, and showed them to him—he waited while I was doing them, and saw them after the alterations were made—he then said that would do—he said he should want 2000 on the fol<lb></lb>lowing Saturday, and more next week—he came on Saturday, the 1st of April, and wished four early in the morning—I gave him four—they were quite perfect engravings from the plate, and the dies, water-mark, and all—I told him I was sorry I could not let him have the 2000, and said I most let him have as many as I could by five that afternoon—he said he would call at three to see how I was getting on—he called afterwards, and took 1000 with him on that day—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account on that occasion—I proceeded to make out a receipt, and asked him what name I was to draw it in—he said, "Mello"—he was looking over the desk, and seeing me write it, told me how to spell it—he said, "M-e-1-l-o"—this is the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he left me about four—that was the last time 1 saw him before he was in custody before the Justice—he spoke in English on all these occasions—on one occasion he left with me this paper, marked "D"—it is part of a bill—the original paper, marked "A," had been lying about the work-board—I wanted a more perfect specimen to work from, and he left me this to enable me to copy the stamp the better—Smith produced to me the paper marked "E"—I have three dies here—one is the die of the "1000," the water-mark in the middle of the paper—one has got "C. P.," with a little border round it, and the other has "C. P," raised lip with "Credito publico," that was for the striking up—they work together.</p>

I do not know what you are going to do with them when you get them"—my engraving is done at the back part of the shop, quite away from the front shop—persons at the counter would not see what was going on in the back room, where I was engraving—when I made the alterations in his presence, I was at a bench that I work at, at the very end of the shop.</p>

Three let<lb></lb>ters were produced to me by Forrester, of which this is one—I produced them before the Lord Mayor on the prisoner's examination, and in his presence, about a fortnight or three weeks before he was finally committed, and nearly a fortnight after he was taken—they were sealed—in the presence and hearing of the prisoner and his solicitor, I applied to the Lord Mayor to open them, as a Magistrate—the prisoner and his solicitor objected to their being opened, as I understood from their conduct—I applied to the Lord Mayor to open them, and objections were made on the part of the prisoner, principally, I should say, by his solicitor, who is here—his Lordship refused to open them—I then stated I should apply to the Secretary of State in the proper manner, which I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Consul-general in England to the Portuguese Government—my counting-house is at No. 15, St. Mary Axe. I am acquainted with the mode of drawing Portuguese Government bills—they are drawn upon a Financial agency in this country, by the Minister of Finance—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one of the impressions</hi>)—this is the form in which a bill is drawn by the Portuguese Government upon the Financial agency in this country—(<hi rend="italic">looking at paper "A"</hi>)—this is a genuine Portuguese Government bill on the Financial agency here—it is an original bill, already paid—they are partly engraved and partly written—this bill is drawn by the present Minister of Finance at Portugal, whose name is Do Tojal—I have seen his handwriting very often—I did not see him write this—I believe it to be his, or it would not have been paid—I should say he is a person who has authority from the government to draw bills—the engraved part of this bill marked "A," is like the other, which I have in my hand, marked "J. B."—I should suppose "A" to be a genuine bill—it is not filled up—this, marked "J. B.," is a copy of it, as far as the engraving goes—it appears to be an imitation—it is like it in the water-mark, stamp, and the letters "P. C."—the words, "Credito Publico," in those letters, means "public credit"—that is the form in which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080062"></xptr>
               <p>Government bills are generally drawn—I know the form in which private bills are drawn in Portugal—private individuals have their own forms, which they have stamped at the board of public credit, exactly as they are stamped at the Excise-office here, that is when they take their own paper—the bills 80 drawn have not the "P. C," "Credito Publico," engraved upon them—I have never seen it on them—the paper which private individuals take to be stamped has the water-mark—I do not know that it is a water-mark, it has the stamp, the sum of money, 1000 reals, or 500 reals—I do not know whether it is done by water-mark or a stamp, but they have the impression of the value of the bill, if it is a 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bill or a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill, or something of that sort—the "1000" in the corner means 1000 reals—that is a mark of the government—private bills have that mark, and also the stamp in the middle, the "1000," or whatever it may be, with a wreath round it—that is the value of the stamp—this is a private bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this has "2000" stamped in the middle, and also at the side—that means 2000 reals—1000 reals is fifty-four pence by the present exchange—the form of a public and of a private bill is different, because a private bill has not the printed "C.P." at the top, with "Credito Publico" round it, and I believe in the stamp also it has not "Credito Publico"—I have generally seen bills like that—I have in my hand one of the blank forms, and a genuine bill filled up in writ<lb></lb>ing—if the blank form was filled up in writing like the genuine bill, I should take it to be a government bill—I do not myself know the distinction be<lb></lb>tween the one and the other—I saw Mr. Reynolds the first day or the day after he saw the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you gave authority for all that Mr. Reynolds did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I put him in communication with Mr. Bush—I was informed that Mr. Reynolds had been applied to to do something, and I told Mr. Bush to do what he thought proper with reference to it—I have been consul-general since 1830, I think—I was 'in Portugal about two years ago—I was born there—I should take the paper on which this blank form is engraved to be Government paper, because it is very equal to the original bill—the difference between this paper, and the paper of a private merchant is the "C. P." and "Credito Publico"—the introduction of those words is a criterion by which I form my judgment that this is a good paper, and none other—Government have drawn upon other paper, upon unstamped paper—private individuals draw upon paper of this kind, with "Credito Publico" on it—they buy bills from persons employed by Government, just like you buy in England of persons appointed to sell stamps—if the Portuguese Govern<lb></lb>ment had to draw on the Finance Agency here, they would draw on such a bill as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose that stamp to be in the hands of a private individual, could he not draw upon it a perfectly innocent bill, as between merchant and mer<lb></lb>chant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is always done—if a fraud was contemplated on the Govern<lb></lb>ment, by the filling up, it would be perfectly easy to insert in that portion of it the address of the Commissioner of Finance—the address to the Com<lb></lb>missioner would be writtee—it is a blank bill—this blank form is used both for the Government and for private individuals—it may be used either as a Government bill or a private bill—I cannot say whether the "Credito Publico" denotes that the tax for the stamp has been paid—if a person goes to a shop and buys this, of course be pays for the stamp—it is the form of the Portuguese stamps, bills and stamps—the Board of Public Credit issue these exactly like the Stamp Office issue theirs, part in blank—the stamp "Credito Publico," shows that the amount mentioned in the water-mark has been paid for the stamp—that is all it denotes—the plate from which the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080063"></xptr>
               <p>2000 private bill was taken, was engraved by order of the firm whose name appears on it—there is nothing to prevent the engraving of that portion of the stamp which I find on this bill, by any private merchant, who after paying the stamp on it, uses it as a private bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the stamp affixed after the bill is printed, or is it affixed before, and issued with a blank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the blank form goes to the Board of Public Credit, or Stamp Office, and there it is stamped—they do not stamp the "P. C." and "Credito Publico"—they stamp this in the middle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the letters "P. C," and "Credito Publico" are not stamped by that board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in one way—in the same way as the other, but not the printed, not the engraved "P. C."—the "P. C." and "Credito Publico," in the raised part is put on by the Board of Public Credit—the "P. C." and "Credito Publico," which are printed at the top, is not put on in private bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not where the party has a private plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nor any private bills—I have not seen otherwise—I have had a great many bills drawn upon me, and I have never seen that in any—I believe if you look at that private bill, you will not find "Credito Publico" in the round part, you will only find "C. P."—that is supposed to be the stamp put on the bills that they sell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A party preparing for drawing bills, would not put on this stamp himself, he would have it stamped by the Portuguese Government? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly like that—he would have a blank form, and have it stamped by the Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is it that the Portuguese Government, when a private bill is carried to them to be stamped, put on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You will see in that pri<lb></lb>vate bill what they put—they put this round mark with "C. P." in the middle—the 1000 reals in the water mark, or whatever the amount is, means the amount of the stamp—what they put on does not contain the words "Credito Publico" at all—I do not think they ever put the stamp with "Credito Publico" on a private bill—I think not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I should like very much to know whether you mean to swear to that fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as my knowledge goes, I do—I have never seen one—I should say that a private individual could go to a vendor of stamps in Portugal, and purchase a stamp for a private bill of Exchange, with all these stamps upon it—I should say he would get every thing upon it, that is on this—"C. P.," and "Credito Publico" in the water-mark, and "C. P.," and "Credito Publico," in the engraving, and also the number of reals—(<hi rend="italic">looking at paper</hi> "A")—a person might buy of a vendor of stamps in Por<lb></lb>tugal just such a blank form as this, for his own private use, to draw bills upon private individuals.</p>

               <p>I have been a servant, but am out of place now, the prisoner knew me; I saw the prisoner the first of April, in Drury-lane, I had not seen him this two years, but he came out of our country; he was standing in Drury-lane in the morning between six and seven, he asked me to drink, we had a pint of purl, he asked me to take a walk with him to Dean-street, Soho; he said, he had a very good horse there to sell, a hack; he said he had two, and he must sell one of them; I went with him, and asked him where the saddle was, he said it was a large saddle, I could not ride his saddle; and he would borrow a saddle of the landlord of the yard, so he got a saddle, and I rode him up Oxford-street and down Park-lane; and then he asked me if I would go with him to Hounslow, he knew a person that would buy him, provided I said, I had brought him out of the country.</p>
               <p>Where did he say he had brought him from? - He said, he had been down in

             a smuggling, and he brought him from there; then we went to Hammersmith, I said, I would return, I could sell him better in town; so I told him to meet me the next morning at the Craven's head, in Drury-lane, and I would settle with him for the horse; I did not set any particular time, I told him to meet me there; so I rode the horse back to Mr. Tattersal's, and I asked the hostler if there was any bills, of any horses that was stolen, he said, there were bills come out.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to ask if there was any bills out? - I had a suspicion that the horse was stole.</p>
               <p>How came you to suspect that? - From what the man said to me.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you, to give you that suspicion? - Because he would not get upon him himself, and by his wanting me to sell him for him; the book-keeper came and found the bill, and we found it was the same horse, then I rode the horse, and put him in a stable in Craven-street, and then I went to Bow-street, and told the officers to be ready against he came.</p>
               <p>How was the man taken? - When the man came into the house, I called him on one side, and I said, what a silly man you are to offer this horse to me, he is a stolen horse; I shewed him the bill; he lifted up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300067"></xptr> his hands and said, what a damn'd fool I am; then the man came in directly and took him.</p>
               <p>What did the man say when he was taken? - He did not say any thing, we took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the officer that took the man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where is the hostler of the Inn? - I did not know that he was wanted.</p>
               <p>Court. At present you are the person that produce this horse that was stolen, and the whole rests upon your single evidence; why did not you bring the officer to prove that you had made a discovery; the officer ought to have attended.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been to see my friends in Kent, and I lay at Gravesend all night, coming next morning over Blackheath, opposite Greenwich park, a man overtook me with two horses, riding one and walking another; I asked him to let me ride, he said he had got to go down to Greenwich or Deptford, and he advised me to take this horse up to London, and he would give me a shilling to bring him up, so I did; he desired me to bring him to the Bull's head, in Dean-street, Soho, and put him up there; and the next day I went up to see if the man was come, and nobody was come; upon that on the Tuesday morning I called up there again, I was going to Oxford-road; I thought I should be brought into trouble about this horse, and I thought of finding out the man that owned the horse, and that man went along with me, and the man rode him as far as Hammersmith; he asked me to let him ride; I never saw the horse again until I was taken into custody; I am a poor man, I could not get any money to subpoena witnesses; I must leave myself to the mercy of the Judge and Jury.</p>
               <p>Court to Savage. The horse you took the owner to see, was the same horse you received of the prisoner? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. If the prisoner had laid before you any case in opposition to this evidence which has been given against him, I should have thought the evidence on the part of the prosecution admitted of a considerable degree of doubt; for this reason it depends on Savage, who by his own account was the man, in whom the possession of the stolen horse was found; that being the case he was called upon to give some account, otherwise it would have been evidence against himself; therefore it seems to me, that Savage ought to have brought to support his testimony, those persons who could support it, by proving from his conduct, that though the horse was found on him, that circumstance had not excited any suspicion in them against himself, for when a person whom stolen property is found on, does not give a satisfactory account of it, but lays a charge against another, on whom the property is not found; the evidence of such a person, should be received with a great deal of caution; this evidence might have been supplied, either by the attendance of the officer at Bow-street, or else the hostler at the Inn; but neither of these are produced; but if the prisoner had set up any defence which deserved attention, I should have thought the charge against him, but slightly supported; but the prisoner's defence removes all doubt and difficulty, because it is admitted by him, that Savage really did get the horse from him; now that is the only fact, on which you might suspect Savage's testimony; and if that is once established that the prisoner had in possession the horse before it came into the possession of Savage; that removes all suspicion from Savage, and leaves his testimony as much unimpeached, as any other creditable witness speaking on his oath; now the prisoner says, a man coming up on the road gave him two horses, and told him where he should take them to, and gave him one shilling, and he brought the horses to the place; that is a very extraordinary circumstance, but passing over that, another part of his case is capable of proof, and he has brought no witnesses to prove it, for he might have proved that he brought two horses to Dean-street, instead of one, and the circumstances under which he brought them to Dean-street; but no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300068"></xptr> account appears of any other horses; you are therefore first to consider, what degree of belief you will give to Savage, confirmed in part by the admission of the prisoner; and next whether you think the admission of the prisoner unconfirmed by oath is entitled to credit.</p>

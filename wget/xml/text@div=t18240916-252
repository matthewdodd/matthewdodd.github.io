            . I am a builder, and live in Old Cavendish-street. I know the house inhabited by Mr. Steele - I had repaired it for Mr. Johnson, who sold it to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18240916-252-person2107">Steele</persName>
             about two years ago. The prisoner Bowler was at work for me, and had been so about three weeks as a bricklayer - I gave him no orders to do any work at Mr. Steele's. On the morning of the 20th of July I heard Mr. Steele's house had been robbed of some lead; Bowler was at that time at work for me at No. 14. Mr. Steele's is No. 17; there is a communication from one to the other over the roof - I said nothing to Bowler, but went up to the top of No. 14, and saw the lead had been stolen from No. 17; it had been cut, and partly torn from a dormer flap - it appeared to have been done with a trowel. I got an officer, and charged Bowler and Welch, his labourer, with having stolen it. Bowler called me aside - I told him it would be better for him to tell what he knew. In consequence of what he said we found the lead at the house of Quinland in the afternoon of that day, or the day following; Bowler was with us, and we told Quinland that we came for some lead which had been stolen; he keeps an old iron shop in Oxford-buildings, Oxford-street; we found a number of pieces of lead under the counter, and among others three pieces of about 48 lbs.; we asked Quinland where he got it; he said he bought it, and mentioned what he gave for it; we then took the lead to Mr. Steele's house, and it fitted the dormer exactly. I have not the least doubt but it had been stolen from there - the edges were quite fresh, and it must have been lately taken away.</p>

            . I am an officer - I apprehended Bowler between twelve and one o'clock; he denied the charge most positively - I afterwards went to Quinland - Bowler went before us, and went into the house; I said we had a search-warrant for some lead that had been sold to him by Bowler, pointing out Bowler; he said he had bought some lead, and pointed to where it was; there was a large quantity of lead; we selected the pieces which fitted the dormer - it fitted exactly, and appeared to me to be taken from it, the edges were quite fresh cut.</p>

            . I am an officer - I stood outside Quinland's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160094"></xptr>house with Bowler and Ballard - Quinland was told that we had come to look for some lead which had been sold by Bowler; he said he had it at the back of the counter. I saw the lead fitted, the edges appeared quite fresh. Quinland said he had bought one parcel, and his wife the other, and gave at the rate of 14 s. per cwt. I think he stated the date, but I do not recollect it. I asked if he had any book for lead he bought - he said No; he was taken to the office and admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Quinland put in a written defence, stating that he was a young beginner in business, and bought the lead openly, and gave it up without reserve, when it was asked for.</p>

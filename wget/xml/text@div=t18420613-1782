                  </hi>. I am a policeman, and live at No. 38, Gee-street, Goswell-street. On Monday morning, the 23rd of May, I saw my carpet safe in my bed-room—I do not know any thing of the prisoner—I went out of the room with my wife, without locking the door—when I returned in the evening, the carpet was gone—I afterwards saw it in the shop of a person named Price, in Golden-lane—I took the prisoner into custody—I told her I took her for stealing a carpet—she said she hoped I would not, for her son would make it all right with her; that a woman named Wright had given it her to sell—I told her if she knew any body that knew any thing of her, and I could find her, I would see about it—she said no one knew her but herself.</p>

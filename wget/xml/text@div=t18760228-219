I am a seaman, stopping at the Sailors' Home, Wells Street—on 26th February, about 1.40a.m., I was in the Commercial Road, and the prisoner Brown put his hand in my pocket; I pushed him away—I am a German—Smith then came and took me by the throat, and knocked me down on the stones—I missed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my pocket.</p>

On 26th February, I was on duty in the Commercial Road, and heard a cry of "Murder" and "Police"—I ran and saw the two prisoners running away—I followed them, and stopped Smith first, and then Brown—Smith broke away from me, and I detained Brown—I asked him what he was running for, he said "Nothing"—I took him to the bottom of the court where we met the prosecutor, who said "That man has robbed me."</p>

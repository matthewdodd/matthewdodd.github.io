On the 20th January, in the evening, I was informed that a piece of flannel was taken from the door. I pursued the prisoner, and found him in a bye street a short distance from our house. It must be at least a hundred yards to where I found him from our house. He was going on very slowly. I did not see him until I came close up to him. I went up to him, and seized him and collared him. He had the piece of flannel under his arm. I brought him back, and when I took him into the shop, I examined the flannel and knew it to be my employer's property. I knew it by my own marks upon it. (Property produced.) That is it. It cost 27s. and I have no doubt that it is my master's.</p>

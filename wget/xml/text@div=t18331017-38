             (police-constable N 77). I took the prisoner - he asked me before he went in to the magistrate, if it would not be better for him to tell the truth - I told him to do just as he pleased, but I did not want him to say anything - he then said, that when he put the boy to bed, his money tumbled out of his pocket under the bed, and he picked up a half-crown, a shilling, and two sixpences - I found this box of things on the prisoner.</p>

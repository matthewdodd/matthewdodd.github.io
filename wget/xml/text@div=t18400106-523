                  <hi rend="largeCaps">Mary Hart.</hi>I am single, and live in Brewer's-gardens, Leadenhall<lb></lb>street, in the parish of St. Catherine Cree—I keep the house—the prisoner occupied a room in my house for fourteen weeks. On the 24th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, between four and five o'clock in the morning, as I was in bed, I was alarmed by a neighbour—I came down, and found the street-door wide open—the prisoner used to lock it for me at night—I went up to her room and she was not there, and she bad not been in bed at all, for it was made then—when I came down again I found the first-floor room-door open—I had left that room locked the night before with a padlock—I found the padlock in the catch, and the door wide open—it was unlocked, and the key was in the padlock—I had put the key in my pocket, which I had put under my pillow—it had been taken from there—I missed all the property stated—the money had been in my pocket under my pillow, and the wearing apparel in the room, which was padlocked—I saw the prisoner next down at Lynn, in custody—I went before the Mayor there—I saw a great deal of my property there—they discharged her at Lynn—they would not allow me to go into the case there—I had not a farthing to bring her to London—I begged the Magistrate to give me my property back, and I would not wish to hurt her more than they thought proper—I did not get my property, they gave it up to her, but Wood, the superintendent, had a cloak, a bonnet, and a shawl, and those he sent to me a fortnight ago—she was taken up after I got to Lynn—I caused her to be taken up—I found in her possession four dresses, three shawls, several pairs of silk stockings, and two or three shifts, but I cannot say how many, be<lb></lb>cause they would not allow me to look into the bundle much—I charged her with stealing them—she owned they were all my property</p>

               <p>there—the Mayor said it was very wrong for me to go into such a case as that, unless we could have her brought up to be tried in Loudon—I saw her next in London—my boy saw her in Fleet-street last Friday, and caused her to be taken up.</p>

                  </hi>I am a City policeman. On the 3rd of January Mrs. Hart's son came to me, and I took the prisoner in Fleet-street—I took her to the station-house, but found nothing on her.</p>

                  </hi>From information I received on the 25th of October that a robbery had been committed in London, I apprehended the prisoner at Lynn on the 26th—Mrs. Hart was not there for nine or ten days after—I found on the prisoner a silk cloak, a black silk gown, and a silk bonnet—the other property I did not find—she was in custody some days, and then discharged by the Mayor—I do not know why—I hate the cloak, bonnet, and shawl here.</p>

Mrs. Hart was the first instigation of my ruin—she induced me to go to her house—I was never seduced till I was seduced in her house—she decoyed me away from home, and told me I should have a good place, but I found out what it was—I was seduced in her house, and ran away—I have always been in service till now, and have a six years' character at Edmonton.</p>

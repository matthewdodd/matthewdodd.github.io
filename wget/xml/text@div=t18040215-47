               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifford. Q. What time of the day was it? - A. About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect how you had been drinking that afternoon? - A. I met with an acquaintance, a painter and glazier, in an empty house; he was within the empty house, and tapped at the window to me; I went in, the prisoner was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you went into the house? - A. About one; I staid there about a quarter of an hour, and went to a public-house, and had something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. You, and the prisoner, and this other person? - A. Yes, the man is a master glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you had some purl and gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not purl and gin? - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much purl and gin did you drink that day? - A. I do not know how much we had.</p>
               <p>Q. From a quarter after one till four o'clock, you drank a great deal, and you were taken ill in the street as you were going home, you got so drunk? - A. No, I was not ill with drinking, I was ill before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. A fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought purl and gin would be a good remedy - do you mean to say you were sober when you went home? - A. I do not know that I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that when you got home, you were not satisfied with what you had at the public-house, you had more when you got home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect sending that woman to pawn the mug? - A. She took it clandestinely out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she never give you the ticket? - A. She said she left it with Mr. M'Larin.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you where it was? - A. Yes, she did; I went after her to the same house where she was with Mr. M'Larin, and told her she took the pot; she told me where she had pledged it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she pay you the money, the twenty shillings, that it was pledged for? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw her that evening - what is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150035"></xptr>reason that you did not go before a Magistrate before five weeks? - A. I did not know where to find her.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not call an officer that night? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Because she had told you where it was pledged, and gave you the money, that was the reason - do you know a person of the name of Days? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever attempt to seek for this woman for five weeks? - A. I did; I spoke to Mr. Slade, the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this glazier? - A. Yes, he lives in Little St. Martin's-lane; I went to him, and he said he knew nothing about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you when you went to Hicks's-hall to prefer this bill of indictment? - A. Nobody but the prisoner's husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner's husband give you any money? - A. No, I never received a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. You never received half-a-guinea, nor seven shillings, nor three shillings and sixpence, and never said, I'll take care when I have got this money, I'll humbug the Jury? - A. No, I never said such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the expences at Hicks's-hall, did not the woman's husband? - A. I do not know any thing about it, I never paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you happen to go with that woman's husband to Hicks's-hall? - A. He came up to me, and asked a favour.</p>
               <p>Q. And you granted a favour, if he would pay the expences at Hicks's-hall? - A. That woman's husband did not pay the expences.</p>

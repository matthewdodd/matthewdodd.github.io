            , (Police-serjeant A 11.) On the 23rd of February I was at No. 5, Mill-hill-mews; I heard some one going before me, and when I got to the bottom of the stairs I saw the prisoner go out at the front door; he first walked, and then ran on to Chatham-place, where I took him - he had dropped a pair of shoes in Henrietta-street, which I took up, and pursued; he then threw something away, which rattled; I went on, and took him to the station - in going along a boy brought me one stirrup, which he said he picked up at the place where I heard the prisoner drop something; I then went back, and found this other iron.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

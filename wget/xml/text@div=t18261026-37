            . On the 7th of December I was a payclerk in the Bank of England, and exchanged this 1000l. note (looking at it), for Messrs. Glyn and Co's. - I gave these notes in exchange (looking at them) - here is one of 300l., No. 693, dated the 22d of November, 1825, one of 200l., No. 3746, dated the 22d of November, 1825, and ten of 50l., dated the 12th of November, No. 633 to 644, inclusive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the entry of of this transaction in your own writing? A. Yes. I have not entered the number of the 1000l. note, nor made any mark on it - it has been in the library of the Bank ever since; I got it to day from the solicitor, and cannot say how it got out of the library.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you exchange any other 1000l. note that day for Messrs. Glyn? A. No; I am sure I delivered to their clerk the notes produced.</p>

            . I am now in the accountant's office of the Bank of England. In December last I was employed by Sir Richard Carr Glyn, Bart, who has other partners; they had an account then with Messrs. Sparrow and Co. bankers, at Newcastle-underline. On the 7th of December I took the 1000l. note produced, and received in exchange a 300l., a 200l., and ten 50l. notes (looking at them) - I recognize this one, No. 644 - it was the outer one, and I have written "Sparrow and Co., 1000l." on it; I know the 1000l. note, because I have written on the back of it the particulars of the notes I wanted for it; I put the notes on Mr. Drewett's desk - he is corresponding clerk at Messrs. Glyn's.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Glyns; Sparrow, and Co. corresponded with them in 1825, but have since failed. On the 7th of December I enclosed these notes in a letter - I have no doubt of this, No. 644, being one of them, as it has Sowell's writing on it, and Sparrow's name - I enclosed the notes in a letter with a bond and two bills of exchange in the ordinary course of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260035"></xptr>business - I should lay that letter aside to be sealed with wax, as it contained property, and have no doubt I did seal it - it was Raine's duty to take the letter to the post.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who did you receive the notes from? A. I took them off the desk of the corresponding clerk - a remittance sent to Sparrow at any time would have their name on it; but we did not, before, or subsequent to the date of that note, remit them so large a sum - I finish all the letters before I seal them; it might be unsealed a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes - I do not write the letters, only put the enclosures in them - I am very seldom called away.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Can you recollect whether there was any thing different in the appearance of the letter when you sealed it? A. I recollect unfolding the bond, and making it the envelop of the notes; I heard of the loss on Saturday, the 10th of December.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You cannot speak to what letters you receive? A. No; I put them into the hole; I always shake the bag, and take great care that I put them all in; I have forty or fifty letters daily.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Post-office. On the 7th of December I was at the Liverpool division of the Inland-office, where the Newcastle-under-line bag is made up; it was my duty to examine the bags before they go out to see they are properly sealed - that bag was sealed and tied in the usual manner before it was put into the sack, and given to the guard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What time is the bag made up? A. Ten minutes, or a quarter to eight o'clock - the letters are sorted at their different divisions - from twelve to sixteen clerks are employed in sorting letters, which go to that division - they are put into the office in a body, and distributed among different sorters, who place them at their different divisions - they are then collected by six or eight messengers, who carry them to their respective divisions - they are then placed before the clerk of the division, who marks the postage, which we call taxing - a second person then puts them into the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there are twenty or thirty persons, through whose hands a letter may pass? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am president of the Inland-office; the prisoner was a foreign letter-carrier. On the 7th of December, he was employed in the Inland-office as a facer and a collector of mis-sorted letters; his duty was to face them from five to six o'clock, then to collect the mis-sorted ones, till the business of the evening was over; he would go to all the divisions to collect them and bring them to a sorter to be re-sorted - there are a great many mis-sorted letters; mistakes very frequently arise between Newcastle-on-Tyne, and under-line; and such letters would come into his hands - he was the only collector that night.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL, proposed to call Daniel Callaghan. The prisoner's Counsel produced a record of that person's conviction of uttering a counterfeit shilling, on the 31st of December, 1807, and his having received sentence of six months imprisonment, and to find sureties for six months then to come. Messrs. ADOLPHUS, BRODRICK, and LAW then contended that Callaghan was an incompetent witness, the offence being one of those termed "Crimen falsi;" to which MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL and MR. BOLLAND replied. The Court stated, they could see no weight in the objection; but if, upon further consideration, they deemed it necessary, the question should be submitted to the twelve Judges.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Fleet-market. I have known the prisoner thirteen or fourteen years - I have known a person, named Welch, about twenty years - I am told be married Goodman's daughter - I have been in company with Welch, Goodman, and the prisoner together - I have been at Goodman's house with Welch, but not with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, some time ago, meeting the prisoner, and having some conversation with him? A. Yes; it was twelve or fourteen months ago - he then had a situation in the Post-office, as he told me, and I have seen him in his red coat - I saw him and Welch together above twelve months ago - we went and had two pints of stout at a public-house in Fleet-market - Welch told the prisoner he could do some good if he liked to look out, and if he got any thing, I knew where he (Welch) lived - Garlick said he would look out - he did not say for what - we parted; Welch had before then seen the prisoner with me, when he had his red coat on; the prisoner came to my stall in Fleet-market, one night about three months afterwards, and asked me to take a walk with him; we walked as far as St. John-street - he told me he had got something; I asked what it was; he said he did not know, but he believed about 400l. or 500l. - he did not then say where he got it; he asked where Welch lived, and I showed him; he lived in the City-road - he showed me something in a white paper, as we were going along, there was no seal or direction on it - we both went to Welch's house, and saw him - we went up-stairs - Garlick gave him this parcel wrapped up in paper, and there were some notes in it; Welch opened it, counted them, and made 1000l. - there were some 50l. notes - I did not look particularly at them; there were two or three other papers; Welch got hold of one and said, "Here is a bond, I will burn this;" Garlick burned it with the other papers - we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260036"></xptr>went from there to the Ivy public-house, Goswell-street, to call Goodman out of that house; we all three went close to the house, but I went in alone and asked for Goodman - I saw him, and told him Welch was waiting; he came out with me; I told Welch what had passed between me and Goodman; the prisoner was near - I cannot say whether he heard it - I took the notes from Welch to give to Goodman - Garlick was two or three yards off - Welch stood at the corner of the street, near the Ivy, close to me - Garlick was not many yards off - Welch came to me, and Garlick stood where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Garlick join in the conversation at all? A. After I had delivered the notes to Goodman, I did not speak to Garlick - I came back and told Welch what Goodman said he would give for the notes, and went back with a message, leaving the prisoner talking to Welch; I gave Goodman all that Welch gave me - Garlick said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he within hearing when you came back the second time? A. Yes, I think so; I spoke low - I do not know; he might hear me; he said nothing on the subject till the next night - he and I then went to Welch's house, to receive the money - I received 250 sovereigns from Welch, and Garlick 350 sovereigns; Welch kept the remainder for him and Goodman, as he said; 250 for himself and 150 for Goodman. Welch said nothing more - he did not say how the notes were changed - I did not see Goodman any more on this subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you at any subsequent time met Goodman and Garlick together? A. Never but once, which was by accident, at a public-house in the City-road - they have never been at my house together - I have frequently seen them together.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any thing to do with the prisoner since? A. Not in that line.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Dereham, in Norfolk.

(The cheque being read was on the East of England Bank, dated the 18th of February, at twenty—one days after date, payable to the order of James Gooch, Esq., without acceptance, signed by the agent and addressed to the London and Westminster bank in Throgmorton-street, and endorsed to T.

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I came to this country in the end of the year 1829, to practise my science on the stone—my practice was not very extensive in the beginning-subsequently it became so; but when I made my invention known to all the medical men of England, it became less exten<lb></lb>sive—the prisoner came into my employment, I believe in the beginning of 1830—he came at first to interpret-subsequently when I performed ope<lb></lb>rations, he was my assistant in those operations, and lastly he was my secretary, not myself being able to read or write English—his compensa<lb></lb>tion at first was five per cent, on the sums received, but when I came from Russia, at the end of August, 1837, he had a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—when I came back with 4400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said to the prisoner, "I am very happy that I bring some money for yourself"—my intention was to give him 200 louis as a recompence, in the same proportion as I gave him a commission—I gave him two or three sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think, on account of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I soon perceived, as the amount I brought with me was to be applied to carry out certain works I had to do, the proportion I allowed him was too large—I therefore said to him, "As there are not many patients now, I think it better I should allow you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year until we can make arrangements"—since that I have given him some amounts, as he asked me for them-10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—he thanked me for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Mr. Gooch, who has been examined, was a patient of mine, and was about six weeks or two months under my care—I had told Mr. Biggs I expected 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Gooch—Mr. Biggs told me I was to have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Gooch, but never told me I was to have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more out of friendship—I did not au<lb></lb>thorize Mr. Biggs to agree with Mr. Gooch for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner from Mr. Gooch at any time in February 1838—I never authorized him to write a letter to Mr. Gooch acknowledging the receipt of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or giving him directions respecting his cough and so on—he told me something in a letter which I unfortunately destroyed at Paris—Mr. Biggs did not tell me he had received the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but when I returned from Paris I asked him if he had received it—his answer was "Not yet, but I will go for it"—I asked him a second and third time the same question, and he always repeated, "I have not yet received it, but I will go for it"—atlast, the fourth or fifth time, I told him I would go there myself—I ordered my carriage—Mr. Biggs directed it somewhere in the city—I was with him in the carriage—when I stopped Mr. Biggs said to me, "Wait, I will go my<lb></lb>self"—out of delicacy I waited, and after about half-an-hour the prisone came and said to me, "The man who ought to pay me is not there, but the money will be sent to-morrow morning or this afternoon to your banker's"—I inquired two or three days afterwards, "Has the money been sent to the banker's?"—he answered, "Yes"—but when the prisoner ab<lb></lb>sconded</p>

               <p>I went to inquire my situation at my banker's, and to my great surprise the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had not been placed to my account—I returned from Paris on the 16th of July, and inquired of the prisoner respecting the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 17th of July, when he asked me for a cheque of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I gave him—I went to Paris on the 31st of March, 1838—I received no account from Mr. Biggs of this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., between the 13th of February and the 31st of March—he has never accounted for it from that day to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. Q. Are you aware that you indicted the prisoner on Saturday for having stolen money from you, being your servant or clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was asked on that occasion under what cir<lb></lb>cumstances, and with what remuneration the prisoner came into my service and continued in it, but it was asked in a manner so strange and altogether so foreign from asking questions by a gentleman, that I altogether lost my head, consequently I may have said that of which I had no consciousness, but what I say at present is correct—I could not on that occasion answer the questions put to me, because I was much more occupied with the inter<lb></lb>preter than with the questions, but if there is any doubt the books can be consulted, and traces of it found-all the questions put to me were received with the same confusion-what I then said was the fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if so, why did you not give the answer on Saturday you have given to-day, with reference to the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and the five per cent. com<lb></lb>mission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because to-day I am accustomed to the manners of the tri<lb></lb>bunal, and to the manners of the counsel, and am better able to answer the questions than I was on Saturday—I made the pecuniary arrangement with the prisoner in the interval between my return from Russia, at the end of August, and my departure for Paris on the 31st of March—I cannot determine the period more precisely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> State to the Court the sums of money the prisoner has paid for you from the month of August to April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a question which you know well I cannot answer—it is a <hi rend="italic">catch</hi>, and I will give you the reason-you know perfectly well that pre-occupied with my inventions, I bestowed on the prisoner the care of my accounts, and I am so unaccustomed to accounts that any question of that sort I cannot answer—the prisoner has not given me any account of this sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this cheque was paid while I was in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went to France, did you intend to go for three weeks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am never so precise as that—I do not recollect saying so before I left—I staid for three months—I cannot say whether the prisoner during part of that time had not the means of paying the obligations he incurred or not—he never communicated it to me—if he had debts, they were debts he ought not to have, and they arose because he had not paid them with the money I had previously given him for that purpose—I was not in difficulties while I was in France.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1835, 36, and 37, were your circumstances in an embarrassed con<lb></lb>dition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would not have been embarrassed had not various sums I had received been dissipated—the day before yesterday, under the influence of the prisoner, you represented me as a man who had always been needy—I am now going to give you a proof that you were deceived-here is a book, written by the prisoner, while in my service-between certain dates, I received from my patients who I attended, in the space of twenty-five months, 4, 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., according to the prisoner's account in the book kept by himself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During 1837, were you not constantly, in letters to the prisoner, calling for money, and desiring him to raise money by any means he could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—(<hi rend="italic">looking at tome letters</hi>)—all these are my hand-writing.</p>

I sent him from Paris—the amount of expenditure would be about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week while I was away—when I go away, he has only to pay the servants their board-wages; and when I stay away too long, their wages, and then the men who work, which amount to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

Mr. Biggs was my assistant in the performance of surgical operations.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a major in the Royal Artillery. I have known the prisoner about three years—I was introduced to him by Baron Heurteloup, having been desired to wait on the Baron, on the part of government, to inspect his inventions—I have had much confidential communication both with the Baron and Mr. Biggs-during the Baron's presence, a great deal of intercourse was necessarily with Mr. Biggs, on account of the language; and during the Baron's absence, which was during a very important part of my business, the whole affair rested with Mr. Biggs—I consider him to have done his duty with great seal, ability, and attention—he appeared devoted to the interests of the Baron, and to have, with regard to military affairs, to which only I speak, a very large discretion vested in him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Goswell-street-road. I have known the prisoner from the age of four or fire years to the present time, and he always maintained the most perfect character—he was introduced to the Baron by myself originally.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. Q. For what purpose did you introduce him to the Baron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Originally to be his interpreter, and generally to assist him-partly as assistant and partly as pupil—it was expected he would acquire a general knowledge of the profession, of which he knew nothing when he went to the Baron—there was no positive denned statement as to the nature of the place he was to fill, as far as I was acquainted—I always</p>

               <p>considered him as a pupil—I understood the Baron treated him very liberally in the way of money affairs—I understood that from Mr. Biggs himself, but no specific salary was appointed—he lived at the Baron's as his intimate friend, as far as I always found and believed—he had no means of advancing money to the Baron of himself—he had no funds that I know of to maintain the expenses—he was at school before I introduced him to the Baron—I heard from time to time that his friends had furnished money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, No. 104, Wardour-street. I have known the prisoner two or three years—he has conducted business for Baron Heurteloup, and I always considered him the principal instead of the assistant—he always paid me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brace-manufacturer—the prisoner worked in my warehouse. On the morning of last Monday week I sent for the policeman—he took him to the station, and searched him in my presence—he found a man's belt round his body—it is mine—the policeman asked him whose property it was—he said, "It is my master's"—I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's lodging, where I found four belts, some dress-suspenders, one or two pairs of garters, and these trowsers' straps—I have no doubt they are mine—I cannot positively swear to the other things, but I can to the trowsers' straps.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>,151). I searched the prisoner, I found this belt round his shirt—Mr. Jones had before asked him if he had got any of his property, and he said, "No"—the prisoner gave his address at the station—I went to the address at Kennington-cross, and found these other articles produced.</p>

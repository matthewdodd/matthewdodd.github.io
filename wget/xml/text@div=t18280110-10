On the day but one, before Christmas day, my father came home between twelve and one o'clock, with some soup, which was not to be cooked till Monday; my mother was tipsy, and my father told her she was tipsy; she b - gg - d his eyes, and said she was not; my father emptied the soup out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100009"></xptr>saucepan, and was washing the saucepan; my mother threw a fork at him, and knocked his hat off; he had done nothing to her, but told her she was tipsy; my father then threw the saucepan (which was in his hand) at her, and cut her across her eye; it hit her on the forehead; she was pretty near him; the saucepan cut her forehead, and a good deal of blood came from the wound; she was very bad, and desired me to lay the bed down, which I did; she laid on the bed; she got worse, and about ten o'clock, the next morning, she got up, and went to clean a room; she came back about one o'clock - I went and fetched her- she complained of her head then; my father went out directly after he had his dinner; she did not complain of her head till after he was gone; he had dined, but did not leave the house till she came home; she had two glasses of gin before she came home - I saw her drink them; she was accustomed to drink spirits; she had her head washed the night this happened, but had no assistance till Christmas night, when my father sent for a doctor; she would have nothing before that; she was taken to the Hospital on the 26th, and died there on the Friday following; there had been no quarrelling between them before this happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Your mother was tipsy when he complained of her? A. Yes; she used very bad words; he told her he had brought her some soup home; he said she ought to be ashamed of herself for getting drunk; she directly threw the fork at him, and he threw the saucepan at her; they had lived on affectionate terms; he offered to get her assistance, but she refused; she seemed very cheerful, when she went to work next day; she said she had one glass of gin, before the two which I saw her take; my father was very unhappy about the accident, and could not sleep night nor day; he cried very much; she had been out on Christmas eve, to buy things for the dinner; the doctor bled her, and my father went home with him for a bottle of stuff.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in Broadway, Blackfriars. On Christmas day, two or three messages were sent to my house, while I was out - I went to see the deceased - I found her sitting in a chair, quite insensible: a wound in her forehead was covered with sticking plaister; there was blood round the edge of the plaister - I bled, and did what I thought best for her. I knew she was addicted to drink; a violent blow on the head of a drunken person might produce very serious consequences, which might not happen if sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. From the external appearances of the injury, it did not appear very severe? A. I did not take the plaister off; she went to the Hospital next day; it is very probable, that had she not been drinking, she might have recovered.</p>

            . I am surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I saw the deceased there; there was a wound on her forehead, about an inch and a half long; it penetrated to the bone; it might have been inflicted by a saucepan; she appeared in danger, and died on the Friday. I opened the head; there was a slight fracture of the scull, and the membrane of the brain was inflamed; the injury, no doubt, occasioned her death; if she had been temperate, death might not have ensued.</p>

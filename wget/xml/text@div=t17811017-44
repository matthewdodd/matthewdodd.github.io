He knocked at the door. He was let in, and came up stair, and asked me if I had not received a letter out of the country. I said I had not. He said he had walked thirty or forty miles. I asked him to sit down, and gave him some refreshment. I had occasion to go down out of the kitchen. Going up again, I met him on the stairs. He said he was rested enough, and would go; and wished me a good day; and so did I him. About five minutes after he was gone, I missed a silver spoon off the shelf. On the Wednesday following, he came again, and asked me if I had received the letter. I desired him to sit down, and have a dish of tea. I sent for a constable, and charged him with the prisoner. He denied the fact.</p>

               <p>As I was going with the prisoner to the compter, he said, if I would take him back to Mrs. Jones's, he would tell where the spoon was that he had stolen. He told me he sold it to one Mrs. Ireland.</p>

               <p>The prisoner brought the spoon to me, on the 27th of September. He said he had come a journey, and wanted money, and asked me to buy the spoon of him. I said I did not want it. I sent it to be valued, to the silversmith's: they said it was worth eight or nine shillings. He said I should have it for 8 s. I gave him 7 s. 6 d.</p>

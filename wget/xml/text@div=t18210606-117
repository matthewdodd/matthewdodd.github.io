On the 12th of June, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came to the shop together; one of them asked to see some Italian net; they both looked at it and did not like the colour, and wished to see another. I shewed them three more pieces; they would not suit. They then asked to look at some satins; I shewed them two or three - they did not suit. They then asked to see some Persian of the same colour; I shewed them two pieces - they would not do (I had been watching them particularly all the time). They then said, they would look at some white Persian, and bought three-eighths of a yard, which came to 9 d. One of them observed, that was a handsome shawl which one of the men was shewing, and asked the price - I said, two guineas, and shewed them some other shawls. Every thing I had shewn them remained on the counter. I opened one or two shawls out, they thanked me for my trouble, and said, perhaps they would buy another time. I observed Williams hold up the end of the shawl as if to conceal the actions of the other. I took 1 s. for the Persian, and went to the end of the shop for change - I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060064"></xptr>and gave them 3 d. I believe Williams bought the Persian. They then left the shop - I missed nothing, but went after them on suspicion. Williams was following the other out, but had not got out - Knight was just out of the door. I saw my fellow-servant bringing her back, and a piece of silk drop from her (Knight). He said to her</p>
               <p>"Stop, I believe you have something which does not belong to you;" and as she returned at the threshold of the door, the silk dropped from under her cloak; there were twenty-five yards of it - it is worth above 5 l. - it cost between 6 l. and 7 l. Williams wished to go, saying, she had nothing to do with it. They both inspected all the goods.</p>

             the whole of the house - A. Yes; I found Williams had left her Persian behind, it might have been dropped by accident - I found it in the place where she sat - it is common for people to go shopping together - Knight had a large cloak, which concealed it all, and took it with the roller.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. I saw the prisoners come in together, (they had been there together the day before), Salthouse was shewing them goods - I saw Knight rolling up the silk, which was about a yard undone - they looked at the goods, and while he was shewing the shawl to Williams, I was watching, and saw Knight take the roll of silk - I left the counter on the opposite side to them, and went towards the door; Knight passed me, and as soon as she got outside the door, I told her I believed she had something which did not belong to her; she said, she had not - I brought her into the shop, and about a yard in the roll of silk, dropped from under her cloak; I picked it up, and she was stopped. Williams was coming out at the moment I laid hold of Knight; she was stopped, and asked what was the matter - I took them both to Marlborough-street, and on our return, found Williams's Persian on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the way Williams held the shawl up - A. It was unfolded, she held it about the middle, as if to help fold it up; it naturally took Salthouse's view off Knight - the silk cost 5 s. 6 d. per yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What size was the shawl - A. A yard and half wide, and nearly three yards long - it was extended at full length, there was nothing unusual in her manner of holding it - I should have thought nothing of it, had I not suspected them.</p>

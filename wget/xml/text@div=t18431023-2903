I lodged in the same house with the prisoner and his wife, in Leather-lane, for eight or nine months—we have been partners together for fifteen months. On the 5th of Sept. we went to lodge at No. 6, Saffron-hill—J am singie—I slept in the garret at Saffron-hill, but in Leather-lane we all slept in the same room—Luigi Donnini, another workman, slept in my room—the pri<lb></lb>soner and his wife slept down on the second floor—on Wednesday night, the 6th of Sept., the first night we were there, I went to bed at near one o'clock—I had come home with the prisoner—I had had no quarrel with him—I had hardly pulled off my clothes when I heard a quarrelling down in the Prisoner's room—I went down stairs and knocked at his door—I was ashamed of the noise, being the first night, and having taken the rooms myself—they were talking loud—I could not distinguish the words well—I knocked at the door two or three times, and said, "Open the door"—he said, "I shan't"—I kept on rapping rather loud, and in about half a minute the Prisoner came out—he had his trowsers on, but no coat—he had a light in his room—I did not go in—his wife was in bed—I had seen her there before I went up stairs</p>

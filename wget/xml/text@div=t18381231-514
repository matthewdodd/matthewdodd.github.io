On Sunday evening, the 23rd of December, I met the prisoner in South-street, Greenwich—I turned my light on—she said, "It is quite right, Sir, I am going to take my husband's coat"—I suspected something, and looked after her—I saw her run down Cut-throat-lane—I followed, and stopped her, and asked where she was going—she said, "I am going to the Centurion, Broad<lb></lb>way, Deptford, to take this coat to a man who drives a coach for Mr. Hummer"—I said, "Do you know the man?"—she said, "No, I am not to see the man, I am to leave it at the house, and to have a pint of beer for my trouble"—I said, "Who did you get it from?"—she said, "From a woman by the Eight Bells public-house in Church-street, Greenwich"—I said, "Do you know the woman?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Did the woman ever see you before?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Does the wo<lb></lb>man know you?"—she said, "No"—on the way to the station-house, I received information that the prosecutor's coat had been stolen about a quarter of an hour before—I consider the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

On the 17th of March the prisoner came and took Mrs. Hussey and Mrs. Wayland out in a coach; about 5 in the afternoon the prisoner came back with a woman she called her maid; she made as if she was tired, I asked her to sit down; I said, where is Mrs. Hussey? she said, at her house; she said, she had known her some years to have lived well, and she would keep her, and maintain her; she has lived in credit, and it is hard she should work for a bit of bread, which made her heart bleed to see it. She said she had got a little tenement, and she should dwell in it. I said, I wonder Mrs. Hussey did not let me know of it. She said, she did not know of it herself till she told her after she was gone out with her. I said, where is Mrs. Wayland? She said, she is making the room clean against the bed comes. What with her behaviour and appearance I believed her; she opened the prosecutrix's door, and brought the things out, with the assistance of others that she got to help her, and got a porter to carry them away. She said Mrs. Hussey had given her a strict charge not to meddle with any of Wayland's goods. She took all Mrs. Hussey's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176304130019"></xptr> except the bedstead.

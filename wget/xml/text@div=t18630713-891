I am a cabinet-maker at 47, Huntingdon-street, Kingsland-road—I was in the defendant's employ at the time of the bankruptcy—an officer was put in on 1st September—there was a van at the door, and some goods were put into it, by a man the defendant employed—I saw 4 maho<lb></lb>gany boards, 8 deal planks, 4 leaves of half-inch walnut, 12 coffee-table tops, 2 loo tables unfinished, 15 or 16 hand-screws, apparatus for laying the tops with, for pressure on the veneers, and 2 benches; put into the cart—the defendant then told me to take them to Mr. Slaney, a publican and cabinet-maker, at Brett's-buildings, and say that I had brought the things from Mr. Victor—I went with the carman to Mr. Slaney's, and the goods were packed on his premises—the half-inch walnut plank which was taken away in the van, was bought of Mr. LeTellier—I told Slaney I had brought the things from Mr. Victor—he said, "All right"—I remember that the defendant used to deal with Mr. LeTellier—two or three days afterwards I told the defendant that I had taken the goods to Mr. Slaney—about 4th December, a messenger came from the Bankruptcy Court, and I saw him making notes in a book—the messenger said to the defendant, "Is that all you have got?" he said, "Yes, that is all I have"—a fortnight after, he gave me a sovereign, and told me to go to Mr. Slaney's, and bring those things back again—I went, and Mr. Slaney did not seem inclined to let me have them, but I gave him the sovereign, got the goods, and took them back to the place I brought them from—I told the defendant that Mr. Slaney was rather dubious in let<lb></lb>ting him have the things, but that when I said I had got a sovereign for them, he said that it was all right—some of the goods were finished, some unfinished—the defendant bought material and sold it too.</p>

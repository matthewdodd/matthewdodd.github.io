               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come to you? - Upwards of two years ago</p>
               <p>Q. Has she lodged with you ever since? - Yes. she had a husband, a painter and glazier by his profession, he has escaped. She had two garrets at 4s. 6d. a week. The man paid very regularly. without it was for the last two weeks, They never quitted my lodgings till she was taken up for the robbery she has committed. I lost the feathers almost out of two beds entirely, one in each garret. One is quite gone, and the feathers are almost gone out of the other. I lost, besides, three pillows, and two bolsters, a copper saucepan, and several other articles, a great many more things than I can speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect to have seen these things lately? - No, I never was in the room. They never let me into the room. They had a son about thirteen years of age, and if they went out, he always kept the door locked, so that I could not get in. I have found out the pawnbroker's. The duplicates were found on her. I have seen them, and am clear they are mine.</p>

            ; the prisoner at the bar was a driver of one of our waggons; the waggon the prisoner drove came from Gloucester on the 26th, and arrived in London about three o'clock in the morning on the 29th: he came the last stage into London.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You cannot tell that? - A. He was employed by me, upon the last stage, to bring the waggon into London; the waggon was locked up; we never open the waggon but at Cheltenham, Gloucester, North-Leech, Burford, and Oxford: at these places, there are keys with the different book-keepers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. Whatever parcel or package that was put into your waggon to come from either of these places to London, is there any account taken of them? - A. Yes; this was taken up at Cheltenham; the way-bill has an account of the goods; I received it from the prisoner at the bar, upon the arrival of the waggon on the 29th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the way-bill, and see whether there is any article directed to Sir

            ? - A.There is, directed to Sir E. Bailey, 5 s. 4 d.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was it a box or a trunk? - A. A trunk to Sir E. Bailey; they never put the address in our invoice, nothing but the article.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. What is the sum charged against that? - A.5 s. 4 d.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the way-bill delivered by the prisoner to you? - A. Yes, I received the way-bill, and was present at the unloading of the waggon, and there was no trunk directed to Sir E. Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever account for the sum which is charged against it to you? - A. Never, in any way whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear any parcel directed to Mr. Budding? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar, as driver on that occasion, account to you for that package or the produce of it? - A. Not in any way at all.</p>

               <p>Q. The custom I suppose is to deliver the waybill immediately on the waggon's return to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There is an invoice of what is put in at Gloucester, and there is a way-bill of what is taken in in the way; then at Cheltenham they put in, where they change horses; and whatever they take in at Northleech, that is put in the way-bill; and at Oxford, if they have a parcel, that is put in the way-bill; and so the same way-bill comes to London, and is evidence of what things are put in at these places? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood the prisoner to be the person that took the waggon from Gerard's cross to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never comes back from Gloucester? - A. O yes, he comes back in his regular routine of the waggon's going.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is he coming from Gloucester to London? - A. About a fortnight, from his going out to his coming in, I am not exactly correct in that.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that sometimes a waggoner may make a mistake in his accounts, and he may correct it in another? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always had correct waggoners? - A. The way-bill corrects them; I was in the way when the waggon arrived: I questioned him about these trunks; he declared he knew nothing of them; he told me the waggon was exactly as he received it from Gerard's cross; he swore it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If there was any mistake in the way-bill it must have arisen at Cheltenham, because there they gave the way-bill, and there they put down the articles in the way-bill, and therefore, when he brought this way-bill, and you looking over the parcels finding a trunk in the way-bill and not in the waggon, you asked him how that came, and he said it was as he received it from the last carrier? - A.Justly so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the Gloucester and Cheltenham waggon stopping at your house, early in the morning of the 29th of September? - A. Yes, about three o'clock as near as I can guess: I received a box and a trunk; I have the book here;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240017"></xptr>it was written in the book by my master from my dictation, - Cheltenham-waggon, Bailey, a trunk, left 3 s.

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar; do you know him? - A. Yes, I am pretty sure he was the driver of the Gloucester and Cheltenham waggon on that occasion; I have no doubt but that it was the prisoner; I took them into the warehouse; the trunk to Sir E. Bailey was delivered by Mr. Richardson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. In your presence? - A No.</p>

               <p>Q. And then, when my friend put it more confidently on your part, you said you had no doubt whether you could positively swear it was him, aye or no? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you were pretty sure it was him; do you mean to swear it was him, or you believe it was him? - A. I am pretty sure it was him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he delivered the box and the trunk, did you pay him the carriage? - A. No, my master paid it in the evening when the man called.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Who told you to charge 3 s. for one and 4 s. for the other? - A. The waggoner; one was taken in at Cheltenham; he did not tell me where the other was taken in at; I put it down in chalk till my master came down, and then my master put it in the book.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. One was to be left, and you were to have 4 s. for it, and the other to be sent as directed, and you were to have 3 s. for it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any articles left at your warehouse from the Gloucester and Cheltenham waggon? - A.

               <p>Q.

No oftener than others, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively to the person of the prisoner? - A. To the best of my recollection it is the prisoner; I believe he was the person; I do not think that I ever saw that man before, but I believe he is the man.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q.You are a servant of Messrs. Heanes'? - A. Yes, I drove the first stage of that waggon, from Gloucester to Barns, two miles this side of North Leech.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take up any thing at Cheltenham? - A. Yes, a trunk and an empty hamper; I cannot say who that trunk was for; I never looked at the directions; I took it up at the warehouse at Cheltenham, and I took the way-bill from the book-keeper; the trunk that I took up at Cheltenham was put in the way-bill; I locked the trunk in the waggon myself.</p>
               <p>Q. After the arrival of that waggon, on the 29th, in London (look at the prisoner at the bar), did you see him again, and whether he said any thing or what? - A.Yes, I met this man again at New Barns; he was coming down again; (I had been up to London, and my master had examined me at London about this trunk;) I asked the prisoner about this trunk; he told me he delivered it, and received the carriage; he told me it could never be found out, because he had told the porter it was Mr. Hunt's waggon at Oxford.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the prisoner's name? - A.Thomas Curtis.</p>

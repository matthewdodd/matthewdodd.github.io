                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Glass House-buildings, Whitechapel, and am an unfortunate girl. On Monday night, 7th May, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was in the Blue Anchor public house—the prisoner and two More men were there, and all three of them accompanied me to my lodgings,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110034"></xptr>
               <p>and went up to my bedroom, but the other two did not stop, they went away, and the prisoner remained—when he went to bed, he asked me how much I charged for the night—I said, "Half a sovereign"—he was quite agreeable to that, and told me that provided I was an honest girl, he would give me more than what I had engaged for, in the morning—we went to bed, and about 2 o'clock in the morning I told him to send for some beer—I called in the old woman, who is like a servant, and sent her for it—the prisoner gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she brought the shilling back from the public house, and said that it was bad—she gave it to me, and the prisoner told me to open one of the papers which he had got, and to give her another shilling; the papers were in his coat pocket—I did so, and she then left the room for the beer, and brought it back bent; it was bad—the prisoner had given me seven or eight papers to keep till the morning; there appeared to be money in them—when the woman came back the second time, she said that she was very nearly getting locked up, as the money was bad—I said to the prisoner, "This money you have given me is all bad"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Tut, tul.</hi> lie down, no such thing"—I got out of bed and called a policeman, who came into the bedroom, and I gave him the money in the papers—he took the prisoner into custody.</p>

I keep the rooms in Glasshouse-buildings, where the last witness lives—she is a girl of the town—on the night of 7th May she came to her room, with the prisoner, and two other gentlemen—the other two went away; they did not stop more than half an hour—the girls went to their own apartments—there are two rooms; I live in the first, and Julia White has to go through my room, which is the kitchen, to go into hers—I was called into the room by the prisoner—he gave me a shilling—I do not know where he took it from—the girl was in bed with him—I went to a public house with that shilling; it was refused—I brought it back to the prisoner, told him that it was bad, and he gave me another—he had them in cartridges—he was still in bed when he gave me the second shilling, and so was the girl—it was the prisoner that gave me both the shillings—I took the second shilling to another public house, and that was refused—I came back with it, and told him that it was bad—White then got up, went out, and called a policeman—I cannot tell what time it was then, but it was not very long after he gave me the first shilling; it was about 2 o'clock when I went for the first pot of beer.</p>

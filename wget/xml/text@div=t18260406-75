            . I live at South Ockenden, in Essex - the prisoner and prosecutor are my brothers. On Saturday morning, the 1st of April, the prisoner came to my house, and having heard what had happened, I took him into custody; I told him he had been robbing his brother - he said it was not so; I said he had robbed him of nine sovereigns and thirteen shillings - he denied it- I persisted in it, and then he said he had taken it because nobody else should.</p>

On Sunday morning I always cast up my books, and put my money into a purse; On Sunday, the 5th of March, I put nine sovereigns and nineteen shillings into a red purse, which I put into a bag, and hung it by the mantel piece; he knew I kept my money there; I had got him into employment, and expected he was going to live with me; he went away that day, and I missed my money and purse. I informed my brother Samuel.</p>

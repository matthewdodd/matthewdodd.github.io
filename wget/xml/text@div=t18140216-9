            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. I was present at the Lent assizes, Kingston, Surry, when the prisoner was tried, convicted, and received sentence. I am certain he is the same person. I was one of the witnesses against him; I have no doubt in the least he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Taunton. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of February last, at the Three Jolly Butchers, Clare-market, in the parish of St. Clement's Danes. Nothing particular passed. I went in with a few other officers; I told him the charge against him, and took him to the office in Bow-street. He did not deny it, or his name; he declined saying any thing, even at the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Limbrick. If this be the same man it is fifteen years since this trial - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say for fifteen years you recollect his person - A. Certainly. I have no doubt of his being the person; I knew him a long while before he was tried for that offence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know how he has been employed before you took him - A. I believe he is something in the tallow chandlery way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say.</p>

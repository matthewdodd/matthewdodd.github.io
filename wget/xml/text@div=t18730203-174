                  </hi>. I am a publican, of 5, King Street, Tower Hill—the prisoner and other sailors were stopping at my house, and about 1 o'clock a.m. the prisoner called out for a candle, as he wanted to get up early—I put a candle 3 or 4 inches long on the table—before I went to bed, I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a little bag, in a drawer in a corner of the bar, which was closed and fastened—next morning, at 9 o'clock, I found the bar wrenched open; the bag was in the drawer, but the money was gone—there was some grease over the till of the same kind as the candle I supplied him with—the candlestick was in the prisoner's bedroom, 'clean, but no candle in it—that was the second candle I supplied him with—he was in bed when I gave him that—one sailor was gone to his ship, and the other remained in the house, and let them out.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at Mr. Denston's, and slept in the same room with Hiller—I left the house with the prisoner on Friday morning—we went across the street into a public-house, and had a pot of beer, for which the prisoner paid 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we left there in five minutes, and went up to the station—it was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before the train started, and we had another pot, opposite Fenchurch Street Station, which the prisoner paid for—he paid for our train, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and then we went to the Woolwich Tap, North Woolwich, and had some whisky and beer, which the prisoner paid for.</p>

I manage the North Woolwich—on Friday morn<lb></lb>ing, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner and Billett came there, and had a pot of ale, for which the prisoner paid me with a shilling; they then had another pot, and he gave me another shilling; then they had two glasses of ale, for which he paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then they had two glasses of whisky; I do not know what he paid for that, but he gave me half-a-crown for half a gallon of beer, which he took on board with him—he left his bag till the Monday, and I had information from the landlord who asked me to detain it till the prisoner came, when he was taken.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 73 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>). I was called to this public-house, and found the prisoner there—I said I should take him in custody on suspicion of robbing a public-house yesterday morning—he said "All right, I will go with you," and that he thought that it was something relating to the bag—going along he said "Has there been a robbery there?"—I said "Yes."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On 13th December I arrived home from a foreign voyage, and received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I had been acquainted with this landlord before, he had cashed my advanced notes, and I took this young man to his house, and patronised him as well as I could. On this morning I got up at 7, and found my candlestick, but no candle. I went into the next room and woke up this young man, and there was no candle in his room either. He went down to the landlord's room and got a candle. He said he could not go till the landlord came down, as he had no money to pay. I said "The landlord will not be down till 9, but I will pay the train for you" I did not know—that the house had been broken into, or any money stolen. The money I spent was my own, which I had ploughed the seas for. I had plenty of money, and there was no necessity for me to steal.</p>

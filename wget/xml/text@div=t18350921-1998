I went ground in the parish of Iver, but I live in Bucks—In Murch 1894, I lost a lamb—I had seen it in the morning of the 22nd, and missed it the next day—It was a fine lamb, worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—It was in a field belonging to Mr. Townsend, in Hilling<lb></lb>don parish—It was entirely taken away—I found no remains of it—the prisoner lived on Uxbridge-moor, four or five miles off—I have seen Haynes many times—he lived near Cowley, I believe.</p>

In March last year we lived on Uxbridge-moor, about a quarter of a from Hilling<lb></lb>don—he brought a knife and other things in a bag, and a cord—he came between eight and ten o'clock—he went out with my husband after that—the prisoner did not come back—my husband came back and brought a leg and should, and part of a lamb—the prisoner had said that he was going over Austin's-cut-bridge, into a field opposite Mr. Morris, on Uxbridge<lb></lb>moor, they did not say for what—In the morning they said they went into the field over against Austin's-cut-bridge, opposite Mr. Morris'—that was all I heard said—my husband is in Clerkenwell prison for ill-using me.</p>

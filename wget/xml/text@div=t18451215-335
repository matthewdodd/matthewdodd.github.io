                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in Great George-street, Bermondsey. The prisoner was in my service as a domestic servant, and left about the end of July or the beginning of Aug.—after she was gone my wife missed something—I did not—in consequence of something I heard I went to Mrs. Peters's, in Paulin-street, Bermondsey, with a policeman—I found the prisoner there, and gave her into custody—search was made there, but I did not see the things found—I afterwards went to the prisoner'i mother's house, in Baalzephon-street—I knew from the prisoner that her mother lived there—I searched that house, and found one shift belonging to my wife.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the prisoner gave voi notice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I knew she went to live somewhere, but did not know the person's name till last night—I did not know where she went, neither the name nor the house—I did not know whereabouts she was to be found—on my oatb I could not find her without making every inquiry the same as for an unknown person—I did not inquire for her at her mother's—I knew where the mother lived—I did not look for her—I had no cause—I did not make any inquiries for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you go and ask her to come back into your service before you said one word about this charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to her mother's for the prisoner to call on my wife—she was going to leave the person she was living with—her mother did not tell me in whose service she was—she might have said the name—she did not say where it was, to my knowledge—I called at the mother's for the purpose of getting the prisoner back into my service—I should have taken her back—she did not refuse to come back—she never told me she would not come back into the service of a person who wai addicted to drinking, who one day gave her things which she denied having given her the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not sworn you never made inquiries about her from the time she left your service till you gave her into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made inquiries at the last, a week previous to giving her in charge—you asked me if I knew where to find her, which I did not—I said I could find her by making every inquiry, which I might have done for an unknown person—I neither knew the street or number—I did not make inquiry where she was employed—the mother might have told me the name, but I did not go with any intention of finding out where she lived—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Mrs. Hill</hi>)—I saw that person at Union-hall—on my solemn oath I never told her that I wanted the prisoner to come back into my service, but she would not come—I will swear I never spoke to that female in my life, to my knowledge—I have decidedly seen my wife in the habit of taking something to drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. These linen chemises produced are mine, and this cape—I had such articles while the prisoner was in my service—I used to keep them in my drawer in my bed-room—I was</p>

               <p>ill when I lost them, and the prisoner had the care of them—she took an in<lb></lb>ventory of my goods before she left—I saw them in my drawer on the Sun<lb></lb>day as she left on the Monday—I never gave her either of these things—I misted them a day or two, or the next day after she was gone, and I told her of it the next time she called—she did call after she left—I often used to see her after she left—she called upon me several times—I told her about the loss of these articles, and she said the other girl had began to steal very soon—I had another servant, who had only been with me two or three days—I afterwards went to Mrs. Peters, where the prisoner was living—that was before my husband went—I saw the prisoner there, and spoke to her—I did not then search her box—I searched it when I went afterwards with a police<lb></lb>man—the prisoner was nut present—her mistress, Mrs. Peters, told me it was her box—I had not seen it at our house—the prisoner did not sleep at our house—I afterwards went to her mother's with my husband and two police<lb></lb>men, and was present when this shift was found—it is mine, and is marked "E. G. 3."</p>

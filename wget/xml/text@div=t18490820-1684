                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Richmond. I was there on 18th June, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, walking between the Black Horse and Mr. Gosling's lodge—there was a hay-cart about thirty or forty yards before me on the same side of the way, the near side—I saw a barrow about the same distance off, with a child sitting between the handles—the cart was opposite the barrow when I first saw it—I do not know whether there was space enough between the hay-cart and barrow for another cart to pass, I do not think there was—I saw another cart before me—it was a light spring-cart, which the prisoner was driving—he was going at the rate of about seven or eight miles an hour—in attempting to pass between the hay-cart and the barrow the off-wheel of his cart caught the barrow, and ran over the barrow and the child—I ran up directly and assisted the child, which was lying down bleeding from the eyes, nose, and mouth—I only saw it breathe once afterwards—at this time the cart the prisoner was driving had stopped, turned round, and came back again—the prisoner said, "For God's sake help to put the poor child into the cart"—it was put in, and carried to Mr. Anderson's—the prisoner asked me the way to the nearest doctor, and I told him—the horse he was driving was quite young and very high-spirited.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know the road before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents it exactly—there is a curve in the road—I was on the path—the distance has been measured—if nothing im-peded the view you could see the barrow at a distance of 180 feet—the road at Mr. Gosling's lodge is sixteen feet wide—the hay-cart was about five feet ten and a half inches wide, and the barrow about two feet six inches—the near wheel of the hay-cart was two feet six inches from the kerb—the prisoner's cart was about five feet five and a half inches wide—the wheel of the barrow was on the edge of the main road, half on the carriage-way leading to the lodge—I was on the near side when I saw the accident, at the corner of the barn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in marine-stores, at Twickenham. On the morning of 18th June I was driving the hay-cart, and as I was nearing Mr. Gosling's lodge, going towards East Sheen, I heard a noise behind—I looked round and saw the prisoner coming with a cart—it was going about seven or eight miles an hour, or it might be a little more, and in two or three seconds he was on the top of the barrow upon which the child was sitting—I had seen it there about twenty or thirty yards before the cart drove up—the wheel turned the barrow round, and it went over the child's head—I directly jumped out of my cart and went to the child—the prisoner's horse was stopped—he tried to pull him up as quick as possible—my cart was empty, not laden with hay.</p>

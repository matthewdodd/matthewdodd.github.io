               <p>Q. You keep horses as well as cows - A. Yes, I keep four horses. Having been robbed continually I set up six nights myself. On the 7th of July I was in my stables, and just as the watchman called three o'clock, I went to the door, I found my stable door locked; a man before I went in the stable told me that if I went in at the door I never should find the man out; I got in through the tiles; about a quarter after three I saw the prisoner come to the door, he put in a key and unlocked my padlock; he then came in and laid the padlock on a lidge of some brick work, then he bolted himself in and came up to the corn and chaff; at that time I was standing at the side of one of my horses, and as near as I could guess he went to the chaff, he had a sack under his arm; he took out four baskets of chaff, two out of each tub; he then removed the sack to the bean tub and then took out from three to four sauce pans full of beans; he put them into the sack with the chaff; the things that he first took off the beans he laid them on again in the same manner as he found them; then he twisted the sack and lifted it on the bean tub; when I saw him turn his back I walked past him with my soldier's piece and fixed bayonet; I called to my son William, I said pray is that a man; I said to the prisoner if you do not put that off your shoulder I'll shoot you dead; he threw the sack down, he saw a water pipe lay; he thought it was a pole, I suppose, he went to take it up to defend himself; I then declared with an oath, I believe, that if he touched any thing I would shoot him dead; then he saw I had a gun; he jumped into an empty tub and prayed for God's sake that I would not shoot him; my son was hard by, I told him to call the watchman; the watchman came and took him in my shed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You have been a little acquainted with the prisoner - A. Yes, he keeps horses and carts.</p>
               <p>Q. Formerly you were good neighbours together - have you not been in the habits of lending to each other - A. If he asked me to lend him a thing I lent it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And he did the same to you - you have not been upon good terms lately - A. Not this last twelvemonth; I had suspicion that I had been continually robbed by him.</p>

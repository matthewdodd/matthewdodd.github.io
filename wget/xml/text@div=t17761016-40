               <p>All the tools and utensils that were found are implements for coining; the flasks are used for casting (describing the manner in which it is done); the faceing sand is a finer sort of sand, used after the impression is made upon the mould, to fill up all the interstices of the sand, in order that the cast may come out smooth and free from spot or blemish; the buff leather which was found, was for the purpose of giving the metal a polish before it received its colour: it appeared to me when I first saw these flasks before the magistrate, which was a long while ago, that the mould was at that time very damp, and from the circumstance of its being damp, I am of opinion that it must have been used for casting within a short time, perhaps a week, of the time when the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

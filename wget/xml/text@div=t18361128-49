About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 2nd of November, the prisoner was pointed out to me—I saw him walk into Mr. Braithwaite's shop—there was another man on the opposite side of the way—I watched, and the prisoner came out with the merino under his arm—I ran over, and got up to him as he go to the curb—he looked me in the face, dropped it, and directly ran away—I cried, "Stop thief," and followed him as far as King-street, where he was stopped by some person—I never lost sight of him—he said, "What do you want with me?"—I told him I had been waiting for him half an hour—I had seen watching him that time before he went into the shop—I have no doubt about his being the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square, and am a consulting gas engineer, and the patentee of the dry meter. The prisoner was in my employ—Friday is my pay day, and on that day he applied to me to be paid for his work—I told him I had nothing to do with it, and referred him to my foreman and manager—on the following Tuesday I had been out and about 4 o'clock the prisoner came to the office, and said he had come for some money—I said I knew nothing about him, and rang the bell for the foreman—Cosway came, and I said, "Do you owe any money to this man and if you do let him be paid"—Cosway said, "This is the man who spoilt the work last week, and he ought to pay for it"—Cosway then left the office, and the prisoner said, "Do you mean to pay me?"—I said I had nothing to do with it—he then said, "Then I will pay you," and he pulled out a mallet from his pocket, brandished it about, and made a blow at me, which I partly stopped, and I received it on the side of my head—I saw him afterwards and asked him what it was for, and he said because I would not pay him.</p>

I live at Richmond-terrace, Southwark, and am fore<lb></lb>man to Mr. Defries—the prisoner was employed on 29th and 30th June—I discharged him for bad work and spoiling materials—on Friday, 2nd July, I saw by the book that he had been to be paid—on the following Tuesday he came about half-past 11 o'clock, and inquired for Mr. Defries—I told him he was not within, and he staid waiting about the premises—Mr. Defries came in about 4, the prisoner called a few minutes after—I was sent for to Mr. Defries' room, and found Mr. Defries and the prisoner there—Mr. Defries asked if there was any money due to him—I said I did not consider there was, on account of his spoiling materials—I then went about my business—I had walked across the passage into the Smith's shop, when I heard a scream and cry of "Murder!"—I ran out, and saw both the prisoner and Mr. Defries run out at the door, and the prisoner had the mallet in his hand at the time—Mr. Defries was bleeding—I took the prisoner about thirty yards from the factory, and he threw away the mallet—the men do not use their own tools, the tools are all found them.</p>

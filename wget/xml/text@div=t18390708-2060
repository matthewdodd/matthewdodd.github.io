                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hartup, who keeps a straw-bonnet shop, in Cross-street, Shepherdess-fields, in the parish of Shoreditch. On the 27th of June, I left the shop and went into the area, and while there, I thought I heard somebody enter the door—I looked through the grating, and saw the prisoner leaving the step with something in his hand—I immediately ran up stairs and saw one of my drawers open which I had left shut—we live in the shop—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner in the act of turning the corner, with something in his hand—I immediately ran up the street—a policeman stood at the corner—I called, "Stop thief"—he ran after him—the prisoner ran into a young man's arms, then turned back, and threw the things down the area of No. 27, Vaughan-terrace—these are the things which had been taken from my drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 27th of June, I was on duty near the prosecutor's shop—I saw a man in the shop between five and six o'clock, which was unusual at that time—I stopped and looked, and in a minute or two the prisoner came out—I had seen him at the drawer, pulling the things about—he came out towards Shepherdess-walk—I was in the act of crossing the road towards him, when the prosecutrix came out and called out, "There is a thief"—I instantly followed him—he ran towards the City-road with the things under his arm—I called, "Stop thief"—there was a young man who turned round to take hold of him, and the prisoner turned back and threw the things over the area, seeing me close on him, and ran into a man's arms—I took him into custody, and said he must go with me—he said, "It was not me"—I said, "What was not me?"—he said, "I did not take the things"—I took him back to the shop, and in going back with me the things were given me from the area—the prosecutrix claimed them.</p>

I have the charge of the skates belonging to the Skating Club—on Sunday night, the 21st of January, I put the skates into a box, and locked it—there was a pair belonging to Mr. Chilton, of the Temple, among them—on Monday morning, at nine o'clock, I found the box broken open, and all the skates gone—the box was in a tent.</p>

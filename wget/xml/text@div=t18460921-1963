                  </hi>. I live in Westmorland—row, Southwark. On the 25th of Aug., at half—past eleven o'clock at night, I was in the Old Kent—road, turning np the corner of King—street—Lewis met me, and asked me to give her something to drink—it being late I was rather alarmed—I put my hand to my pocket to give her 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a glass of beer, which she asked for; and in the mean time, she put her hand into my pocket, and drew my hand<lb></lb>kerchief out—I seized her by her clothes, and held her—she threw it to Wales, who was standing in a dark corner—I am sure it was her—I kept hold of Lewis, intending to give her into custody—when I came to the end of East—lane, Freebody came up to me, and said, "Let go the woman"—that was about three—hundred yards from where I lost my handkerchief—Free—body struck me under the ear, and knocked me down—the policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—Lewis got from me when I fell—I had such a tremendous blow on the side of my head that the blood gushed out of my ear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Samuel Lardner, a watchman, of Southampton-cottages, Hackney-road—I am almost thirteen years old On 13th March I was walking along Payne's Pond-garden, near Bethnal-green, going to school—I met the prisoners; I did not know them—Davis said, "You b—r, if you don't give me what you have got I will knock you down"—he had a short stick in his hand—Mason then threw me on my knee, and stifled me with his hands—I did not fall completely, he kept my arms down with his elbows—Davis pat his hands into my jacket-pocket, then into my waistcoat, and then into my trowsers, where I had three pence and three farthings, which he took out—Mason then put his hands before my mouth, and I was almost stifled; I was very much alarmed—they began to run—I was exhausted, and could not run much, because they had hurt me so, they strained my breast—I wat never quite down, only on my right knee—as they ran I saw a halfpenny and a farthing drop out of Davis's pocket—they heard it and looked round, but kept on running—I recovered myself, and picked up 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was all I had lost, and then sat down again, and in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoners again going into a field—I went home and told a policeman.</p>

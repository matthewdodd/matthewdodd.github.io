At a quarter past nine o'clock, on the 16th of February, I met the prisoner in Frederick-street, Regent-street, Westminster, with these four saw-plates on his shoulder—I followed him into a marine-store shop—I went and asked how he came by them—he said they were his own—I asked where he worked—he said, at Mr. Freeman's, by the Vauxhall-bridge; if I went there he would convince me they were his—I went there—it was shut up—there was no one there—I took him back to the station, and then he said he had taken them from his master, to make a shilling or two of them.</p>

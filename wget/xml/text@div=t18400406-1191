                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Astle, of Gloucester-place, Tottenham. The prisoner had been my house-maid five months. On the 20th of March I desired her to fetch a mutton-chop for my brother, who was very ill—she was very reluctant to go, and delayed nearly an hour—I went up to her bed-room to see why she did not come down, she was taking some things out of her box, and putting them into a basket—I asked her what she was going to do with that basket—she said, "To take it for the mutton-chop"—I said it was too large, and asked what was in it—she said, nothing but her pocket-handkerchief—I asked her to let me see—she said she would not, I had no right to see what was in her basket—I said she had no right to take any thing out without my seeing it—she knocked me down on the bed, and ran down—I ran after her—she got to the stable yard, and broke the widow to get out, but I just succeeded in turning the key of the gate, and my brother came down—I told him she had got something in the basket—he took it from her and in it were the articles stated in this indictment—I asked if she would tell me where some other things were which I had missed—she would not.</p>

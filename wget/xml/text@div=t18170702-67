On the 10th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the morning I went out-my wife went out before me. I left no person in the house - I double-locked the door, add returned about nine o'clock-my wife had not been home. I had met a woman about half a mile before. I got home; she told me something that hastened me home. I found my door broken open; the staple was wrenched off. I missed the bed and curtain, which were taken from the room on the ground-floor, where I sleep; there were other things there that were not taken-the prisoner is quite a stranger to me. About eleven o'clock the same day, I saw the bed and curtain at the watch-house; the prisoner was in custody. I knew it to he mine.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Garden-row, North-street, near Mr. Perkin's. On the 10th of June, I was at work at Mr. Ley's yard, he is a stone-mason, which is about forty yards from Perkins's, and saw the prisoner, a little before eight o'clock in the morning, go by the yard, which is on the same side of the way as Perkins's with the bed on his shoulder - I did not see where he came from; he was a stranger to me. A wo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020029"></xptr>man came up, and asked me if I had seen a man pass with a bed? I told her I had, and in consequence of what she said, I went after him, and stopped him before he got out of my sight. I caught him coming out of a court, about a mile off; I ran after him directly the woman gave me information - I had lost sight of him before, and I called out stop thief! he had got over Hare-street Fields-it was about a quarter of an hour after I had seen him go by; when I first saw him again, he was coming out of Hare-court - He was stopped ten or twelve yards from me; he ran as fast as he could; he had not got the bed then - I am sure of his person. He was stopped about a mile from where I work - I secured him. A mob came round, and said, I should get into trouble if I did not let him go - He said if I would let him go he would walk quietly by me; I did so - He immediately threw his coat off into the road, and ran off as fast as he could; he was pursued,and secured just by Spitalfields, and given into the charge of Boston. I am positive he is the man I saw go by with the bed.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL LAMBE. I live in Blackfriars-road, and work for a bone-boiler in North-street, Whitechapel. On the 10th of June last, I was at work about eight o'clock in the morning, just by Perkin's house; I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner about forty yards from Mr. Perkins's house, with a bed on his shoulder; I followed him and never lost sight of him all the way; he went down Hunt-court, I followed him and there he went into a house; I saw Rolt collar him. I am sure the prisoner is the man, he was taken to the watch-house. I saw him take the bed into a house and come out again; I went back and found it in the front room of the same house; it was an empty room on the ground-floor.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge from a mob; he was charged with stealing a bed an cutains; I took him to the watch-house, and asked him where the bed was, he said the people were all mad, and he knew nothing about it; I asked him his name and where he lived, he said he did not know the name of the street, having been there but a very little time. Lambe took me to Hunt-court, there we found the bed in a house, tied up in the front room, by Lambe's directions; Perkins claimed it.</p>

            . I sell fish about the streets. On the 10th of June, in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Brick-lane, with the bed; it was about half an hour before he was secured. Rolt laid hold of him, and asked me to assist him, which I did; the prisoner asked me to let him walk, which we did, he pulled off his coat, threw it behind him, and ran away; I ran after him, and caught him. He said he would be the bl-dy butcher of me if I did not let him go. I kept hold of him, and gave him to the constable.</p>

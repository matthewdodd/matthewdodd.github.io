               <p>Q. Did you see them two at the watchhouse - A. Yes, about nine o'clock. I knew them to be mine, one of them was broke on the breast bone; I put them two geese on two shelves in the shop, one was placed above the other, being the biggest geese; they cost me sixteen shillings.</p>

            . I live in Upper Rathbone place, I am a silversmith. On the 5th of October, about half past eight in the evening, I was passing up Charlotte street, Fitzroy square, I observed the prisoner and another man look into Mr. Browning's shop; there was a lamp in the shop; the prisoner got his foot on the threshold, the other man was standing near him, and as I saw no one in the shop, I had suspicion that he was going to rob it; I walked a few doors higher up and watched him. I saw the prisoner go in; in about half a minute he came out and ran across the way and gave the geese to the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how many he had - A. I did not know how many he had, he gave him all he had, it appeared to me to be two; it being very dark, and I stood at a great distance from him, I could distinguish it was a goose or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him when he came out of the shop to have any thing - A. I observed him have these two geese in his right hand, they both ran across the way, I followed them up Windmill street; they stopped in this street at a door and laughed very much; after stooping down for a short time they walked away again and went up Tottenham court road; I kept the opposite side; they walked to the corner of Bedford street, there was a watchbox at the corner and a watchman in it; I told the watchman two men had just passed who had robbed a shop in Charlotte street, and asked him to come with me; he instantly did, and we followed them up Bedford street, they turned into Bedford square, crossed and was in deep conversation; when they saw the watchman with his lanthorn and me coming, they parted; the watchman seized one of them instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that he seized - A. The one that got away; I told him the prisoner was the other, he took him into custody; the man that got away dropped the geese the moment we came up to him, I picked them up. I am certain the prisoner is the man which I saw go into the shop and bring out the geese; I never lost sight of him from the time I first observed him. I carried the geese to the watchhouse and the watchman took the prisoner; I sent to inform Mr. Browning instantly afterwards. When the geese were dropped they then were tied up in an apron, I opened it at the watchhouse, I saw it contained two geese; when they stooped in Windmill street it was for the purpose as I suppose of tying them up in the apron; they were not tied up in an apron when they came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SYKES. I am a watchman at the corner of Bedford street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, Mr. Jones, the last witness applying to you - A. Yes; about a minute before I saw two men go by, in passing they wiped my box, one of them had a white bundle on his back, the other had nothing; they walked close together; Mr. Jones asked me whether I saw two men go by; I said, yes; he said come along directly, they have been stealing some geese. I went with him directly, I saw them again before they crossed into the square; he shewed me the two men and said these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they the same two men that had passed you - A. Yes; I got him by the collar that had the bundle on his back, he let the bundle drop, and he gave a sudden jerk from me and ran away; Mr. Jones picked up the the geese and said do not run after him, this is the man that went into the shop; I laid hold then of the prisoner and took him to the watchhouse. The geese were delivered to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Browning. You went to the watchhouse and saw the geese - A. Yes, the constable of the night had them in his possession, I had the geese afterwards; I described the mark to the constable before it was shewn me; I have no doubt at all of their being my property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Tottenham court road, I met two men at the corner of Windmill street, one of them had a bundle, he asked me the way to Holborn; I told him I was going that away and if he would go along with me I would shew him; one of the men walked on before at a good distance, I walked along with the man with the bundle into Bedford square. The watchman laid hold of the man with the bundle; the man rescued himself away from him; so I stood by all the while with several other persons; the gentleman picked up the bundle; he said to the watchman, pointing out me, lay hold of that man, he is one of them; he laid hold of me and took me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY, aged 29.</p>

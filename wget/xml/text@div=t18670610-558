                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I keep the Globe re<lb></lb>staurant, 4, Rupert Street, Haymarket—on 24th April I went to a ball in Newman Street, with ray brother Sebastiano, my cousin, Auguste Muston, the wife of one of the workmen, and two young men—we left the rooms in Newman Street about a quarter to three on Wednesday morning—I was alone, walking in the direction of Wardour Street—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Wardour Street—that was about six minutes' distance from the ball-room—he came behind me and asked me a question—I turned round to answer it, and he stabbed me—I was so confused I began to halloo—my brother came to my assistance, and he likewise received 'a stab with a stiletto—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received the blows on my left arm, two cuts—this is the coat I was wearing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had seen the prisoner in the ball-room that evening, and asked if he would have a glass with me, and he refused—that was about an hour previous to leaving the ball-room—when I received the stab I hallooed, "Assassin!" and "Murder I"—my brother, my two sisters-in-law, and two boys came up and held him till we got a policeman, and I was taken to the hospital—I was there fifteen days, and was afterwards an out-patient twice a day—I did not see the stiletto before I was stabbed—only when I received the stab. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here put in and read. It stated in substance that the prosecutor had insulted him at the ball and beaten him, and that on his leaving to go home he saw the prosecutor and his friends; that the prosecutor ran after him with a knife in his hand, which he wrested from him; that he was then attacked by them all, thrown on the ground and beaten, and that he used the knife in self-defence.</hi>) I saw no blows struck between my brother and the prisoner at the ball—I saw seven or eight persons together, but I could not see what it was—I saw a row, and my brother came back with his face all scratched—I asked him what it was, and he said it was nothing—I did not see the prisoner there then—I did not say to the prisoner, "You shall pay for this"—I did not run after him in the street—I had no knife in my hand, not even in my pocket—this is not my knife; it belongs to the prisoner—I did not see any one struggling with him before I was stabbed—he was by himself—he was held on the ground by my brother and another young man after I received the two stabs.</p>

I am a Belgian, and reside at 28, Church Street, Soho Square—I am in the employment of Madame Fablis—I was at the ball on the night in question—I was standing at the bar with Madame Fablis—I saw Sebastian there—he offered me a glass of champagne; he said, "Here, you Belgian, drink"—I said, "No, thank you, sir,"—he asked me two or three time the same, "You Belgian, drink, and if you don't drink I will pitch it over your dress"—there was a young gentleman in my company at the time, and I went out with him, leaving Sebastian there—I saw the prisoner at the ball.</p>

I keep the Hôtel de Patrie, 5, Brook Street, Leather Lane—I was at the ball—I saw Sebastian there, beating the prisoner's head with his fist; Joseph went in among the crowd to do the same, but he was stopped by some of the friends—as they were leaving the room Joseph said to Sebastian, "Come out; when I meet the man I shall get him to render an account to myself"—they then went out—I was afterwards asked to come home with two or three friends, and I followed—when I got into Wardour Street I saw the prisoner on the ground, and six or seven round him—I tried to raise him up, and when I did he was left in my hands, and one more; Sebastian left him at liberty then—after<lb></lb>wards, as he was moving towards Oxford Street, Sebastian caught him by the collar of his neck, and held him till the policeman came—I was not before the Magistrate.</p>

I live in Cross Street, Hatton Garden—I was at the ball on the night in question, at very nearly three o'clock in the morning—I was close to the bar, and saw a squabble, and saw the prisoner receive blows from the two brothers—when they were leaving Joseph said to his brother, "Leave him alone; I shall satisfy him when I meet him"—I was afterwards in Wardour Street, and saw something shining in Joseph's hands like a knife—I saw one of them coming away from the crowd as I was going home—I left the ball in company with Melandré and Barbette, to see Barbetté home—when we got into War<lb></lb>dour Street I saw Joseph try to jump on the prisoner, the prisoner was at my side at the time, the other was perhaps a yard or two farther—Sebas<lb></lb>tian was in a group of persons in front—it was at that time I saw Joseph holding something in his hand.</p>

I live at 2, Edward Street, Wardour Street—I was at the ball, attending to the refreshment-room—I heard a noise, and I understood from Mr. Sebastian that he was telling the young lady to drink a glass of champagne—she refused, and he said, "If you don't drink it I will throw it over your dress"—after a few minutes I saw Sebastian and the prisoner fighting together; Joseph ran after the prisoner, to help his brother, if some gentleman had not stopped him—about three o'clock they left—seeing that the prisoner was very much excited, I told him, "Every one has left, you had better go home"—he said, "I will go home if you will go with me," so, as it was my way home, I put on my coat, and</p>

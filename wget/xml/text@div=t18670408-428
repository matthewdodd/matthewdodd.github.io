I am a cow keeper, of Back Place, Forest Hill—on Saturday morning, 9th March, about one o'clock, I was in my cart, and passed the prisoner just beyond the Prince of Wales, going towards Bell Green, where the prosecutor's field is, and all two miles from it—Fielder turned his head, and I saw him very plain—I went to Southend and re<lb></lb>turned, and met the prisoners again, about ten minutes' past two o'clock—Duffin was leading a mare, and Fielder was at the side of it—they were about fifteen yards from the field, just coming towards Southend—as soon as Fielder saw me he stepped back and turned his face towards the hedge, as if he was making water, but Duffin went on with the mare.</p>

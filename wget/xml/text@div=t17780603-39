               <p>What did you give Edgers? - Four shillings. I was asleep when Hughes went away; when I waked, I missed my watch, and half a guinea, and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you find your watch again? - Yes, the next week. Hughes came again, and pulling off one of my stockings waked me.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed in your stockings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was she going to steal your stockings? - Yes; I went to snatch at my stocking, and she snatched my breeches from under my head, and went to the other end of the room and dropped them; the half guinea and two shillings were in my stocking; they had pulled that stocking off before I waked, and were pulling the other off.</p>

She said, what was that to me? I had no money to buy; I said, I had money enough; I took her into a public house, and she showed me the watch; I told her I must stop her and the watch too; she said it was her husband's watch; that he was out of bread; she said his name was

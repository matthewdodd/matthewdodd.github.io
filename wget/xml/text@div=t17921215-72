               <p>Q. Was it a Bank note? - I fancy so, I did not see it only as it lay; they asked him how much his watch cost, he said, five guineas, with that they offered him five guineas, to pay for it, he said, he would leave it to the constables, for he did not understand whether he might be safe in taking it; with that Mr. Shurey wanted to make it up; Mr. Gass said, he should not; I went before the magistrate with them, where I related the same and he was committed.</p>

Mr. Shurey returned in about half an hour, we went down to the public office, Worship-street, and at a public house adjoining the office, there Mr. Shurey took five guineas of one Mr. Wise, and told the prosecutor to take the five guineas into his hand, till such time as he had his watch returned; and if he should not have his watch returned, he should have the choice of two or three together; after that, I told him he had done very wrong in so doing.</p>

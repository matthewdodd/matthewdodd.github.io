                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live with my father at Highgate—he has a stable in the Angel Inn-yard, next door to Mr. Harden. Yesterday three weeks, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my father's stable—I looked through into Mr. Bardell's stable, as I heard persons speaking, and saw Humberston put some corn into a sack—I saw Humberston and Watts there; Watts then came into the Angel-yard, and put the sack into the cart—his horse was in the cart—it was fed with some corn out of a pail—I do not know what corn was put into the pail—I saw the sack put into the cart, which was driven away—I know a per<lb></lb>son named Fisher—I did not see him then, but I have occasionally seen Fisher and Humberston together—he used t help him in the stable.</p>

                  </hi>. I was out of work in February, and Humberston en<lb></lb>gaged me now and then to come to the stable—yesterday three weeks Watts came there with a horse and cart—the horse was fed with a pail full of oats, beans, and corn out of Mr. Bardell's bin in the stable—I took the pail to the horse, by Humberston's order—I did not see the cart go away—before it went, a sack of corn which came out of the bin in the stable, was put into it by Watts—he held the sack up, and Humberston filled it—I did not know Watts well before—I have seen him up there at times—the cart had been there occasionally, once or twice a week—I should think there was a bushel and a half, or a little better, in the sack.</p>

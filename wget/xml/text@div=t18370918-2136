               <p>On the 13th of September, I had 2cwt. 3qrs. of lead put into an joining shed and missed the whole of it—I watched, and found a piece of lead down in the cellar under the shed, about double the size of a piece I afterwards found on the prisoner—I marked it with the letter H, and left it there—I afterwards heard the cellar flap shut down, and spoke to the witness Beale, and said, "Who has come out of the cellar?"——hesaid "It is one of the Irish labourers, I suppose he has come out of the water closet"—I immediately ran out, and saw the prisoner enter an office door, put a piece of lead down and cover it with a barrel—I ran back, tapped at the window, and Beale came oat—I told him to look under the barrel and he would find the lead—he did so but nothing was there, but on looking behind some sand he found it—I said, "If you open it, you will find the letter H"—the prisoner was in the office at the time I came there—it was the office of Tottenham Court Chapel burial ground—I am certain he put the lead under the tub—he must have moved it while I went to tap at the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in Chapel street, Tottenham Court-road—I was at the prosecutor's on the 15th of September, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner come from below the cellar which has the flap to it—I took no particular notice of him, as he could not run away, being a labourer about the premises—I went into the shop adjoining the shed, and Mr. Nodes asked who had come from below—I said, "One of the labourers"—he ran out, and re turned and tapped at the window—I ran out and went into the office which was close by—he said, "Look under that barrel, you will find some lead"—I looked, and it was not there—he said he was positive it was there, or somewhere close by, and the rascal must have moved it—I looked over about a yard from the barrel, and there it laid by some sand be said, "You will find H on it," which I did.</p>

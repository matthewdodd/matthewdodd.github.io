                  </hi>. I am drilling master at the Central London District School, at Westow-hill, Norwood. On Friday, 17th Dec., I went into the yard, a few minutes before 6 o'clock in the morning—there were a number of boys there, who directed my attention to a shed—I looked in, and saw some soap and candles—I then went to a storeroom in the back garden—I went in, and saw some mortar and plaster on the floor—I saw a hole had been made over the door, about a foot wide, and about fourteen inches long—there was a weighing machine by the door, which a person could get at from the hole—there was no other method for a person to have got in—the hole was large enough for a boy or a man to get in—I called Mr. Hall, the superintendent, and he directed me to go to Miss White—she came, and brought the key of the storeroom, and opened the door—I found a quantity about by the side of the chest, and a quantity of tea and coffee mixed together by the side of the fence—that appeared to have been the way they might get over—if a person came over the fence, they could get over the boys' yard, from that through the engine house yard, and through a small passage to the back garden—I know the prisoner; he had been employed there it might have been for four or five years altogether—he has left about twelve months—he used to sleep in the tailor's shop, close by the fence, where I found the tea.</p>

I am single, and live on the premises—I have charge of the storeroom—I was called on 17th Dec, about 6 o'clock in the morning—I had seen the storeroom the night before at 10 o'clock, everything was safe, and there was no hole in it—when I was called that morning, I observed the hole in the storeroom—I went into the room, and missed tea. and coffee, and sugar, beeswax, needles, thread, candles, and bread—I knew the prisoner when he was employed at the school—he came occasionally to the storeroom for stores—he would then see where they were kept—they were given to him from that place.</p>

               <p>and I went with the policeman to a house in the New-road, near the Hampstead-road—I saw the prisoner at work in the back shop—this was on Tuesday, the 21st—I waited till the prisoner came out, about fire or ten minutes to 10 o'clock—I and the officers followed him—he went to No. 10, Warren-street—I saw him go into the house—I did not see him come out, but I saw him when he crossed the road after he came out—the officer went and spoke to him; I then went up to him, and said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>"—he then said, "Well, it is no use to deny it, my name is Henry Aylett"—the officer said he most accompany him to his lodging, pointing to No. 10—the prisoner said he did not live there, he lived in Charlton-street, Somers-town—we took him to No. 10, and went to the upstairs front attic—he knocked at the door, and said to a woman, "Mrs. Prendergast, I have come to see you; some of my friends have come from Norwood"—the constable asked the woman if that man lived there, she said, "Yes"—I said, "Aylett, if you have the key, why don't you open the door?"—he took the key from his trowsers pocket, and either he or the constable opened the door of the back room, and we all walked in—the constable took possession of several articles there—I went with the prisoner and the officer in a cab; and as we were riding, the prisoner said that Price brought him these articles between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning—he said he had a bag with him—I said, "What did that look like?"—he said, "About the size of a fiddle; it might be a small clock"—there was a common sized eight-day clock missed from the premises—it might be about a foot across—I thought at first he said a man named Price, but I made further inquiry and he said it was Brice—I asked him if it was Brice that lived at our place once—he said, "Yes, it was."</p>

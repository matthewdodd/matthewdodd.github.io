                  </hi>. I live at Old Brentford, and am a hawker and umbrella maker—on 3rd February I was in the Cricketer's Arms, Eating, with two other women, about four o'clock—we had two pints of beer between three of us, and some bread and cheese—we went out about five o'clock; and I parted with the women—I went back to the Cricketer's Arms a little after five—I had two umbrellas with me—I put them on a table in the tap room—both the prisoners were there then—I missed the umbrellas directly—I kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about them—the master said they would be found in the morning, and I took his advice—shortly after I left to go home—the prisoners followed me out—after I had got a little way Ware came and walked by my side, and somebody put his hands across my mouth and eyes—someone cut my pocket out, but who it was I cannot say—they tore my clothes nearly off—I had 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and an old knife in my pocket—I was then flung in the ditch by the side of the road—Rose then went away, and I did not see him again—when I got up Ware came up and assaulted me—his father came up and took him away—I gave information to the police the next morning—at the first I only saw the two men, and the second time there was only Ware there.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you mean seriously to represent that the auditors audited the account without looking at their banker's book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they did look at it—every cheque in this banker's book is drawn by the prisoner—all these books were kept among the other books of the society, accessible to the members, committee, directors, and auditors—this fact proves that the prisoner was indebted to the society; that there should have been 520<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the banker's, when there was no balance—that was not an acknowledged debt as between him and the directors—he was not paying off a certain sum yearly, not of that—I have seen in the books that there was a loan made to the defendant—it was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first instance, but that forms no part of this—I only know from the books that he was paying it off annually, my knowledge is entirely derived from the books—I was not present at the meetings of the committee until subsequent to this date, I think—I do not represent myself as being any party to a fraud, certainly not—the directions he gave me as to the entries were openly given—it is one of the rules of the society that two stewards of each division should meet every Tuesday to investigate and superintend the affairs of the company—the directors met as often as the secretary called them together—there were occasional meetings; sometimes once a month, sometimes more often—on the occasion of the ball that has been spoken of, I was stationed at the door to receive tickets—I saw the piano there—it was there some time back; the directors have not sold it, it is in the defendant's hall—he lets the hall sometimes to the society, and sometimes to other persons—he has a horse and cart—I believe the parcels were mostly taken out in that horse and cart—the society has about seventy branches—parcels</p>

               <p>were not forwarded to them almost every week; once a year the bulk went, but occasionally parcels were sent—the prisoner appeared to have the general control over the whole affairs of the society, he was very active among them—I know from the books that some extra remuneration was given him on account of his services—all the cheques in question were filled up by me; he did nothing but put his signature—he told me not to enter his private accounts in the books—I knew when he was going to draw a private cheque,-because he would say, "Draw a cheque for me for so and so"—he did not name that the private cheques were drawn for his salary, but they were for his own purposes, and he asked me to write the cheque.</p>

Banks and Johns was for saddlery for his own private use—here is a bill headed, "Mr. Ruffey, to Houston and Peel;" I saw that at the time—Mr. Ruffey ordered me to fill up the cheque, and signed it, and I gave it to them—these bills were left in the office; I produce them now from there—all bills were put in a desk in the office—here is a cheque for 10£. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable to Mr. Ruffey, with "Mr. Smith," in a parenthesis—Mr. Smith is a coal merchant—here is another for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Gray—he is a person who was employed to paint some scenes for the hall, I believe Mr. Ruffey was going to have some amateur theatricals—this 20£. for repairs was, I believe, for sinking the floor of the hall—here is one for Mr. Hewlett—that was for some chandeliers for the house—they were not used at the festival—all these cheques were kept by Mr. Ruffey in a desk, where they were found after he was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether any of these cheques were ever shown to the auditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were not—the auditors are working men—some time back I spoke to the prisoner with respect to the mode in which the business was being done, and he said all the clerks he had had in his office had a method of their own in keeping the accounts, but he would have them kept after his own plan, or he would have no one there—I was his clerk—he paid me 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am one of the auditors of this society. I audited the accounts in March, 1856—I was not aware of any cheque having been drawn; I made out the balance from the sick book—I have asked the pri<lb></lb>soner for the banker's book, and so have the rest of the auditors; sometimes it has been refused, and sometimes he has left it at the bank—on one occa<lb></lb>sion in particular he refused it altogether, and said that we had no authority to ask for it, that his solicitor said so; and he defied us for him to produce it—that may be about two years ago—I have seen the banker's book in auditing the accounts, but I am not positive whether I saw it in March, 1856—we tried to compare it with the accounts, to see whether it showed the true balance, but were not able, as sometimes it was two or three months afterwards that we were called upon to audit, when the banker's book showed three months before, and being working people, we did not give it all our minds, and perhaps did not give it that consideration which we ought to have done—some of the cheques were laid before us; I have not got them here—I did not put my initials or tick them—I was not aware that any cheque was drawn by the prisoner for his own private purposes.</p>

Three men came up against me, and pushed me against the pump - we both fell; one of them came on each side of me, and pretended to pick me up, they held me while the other took my watch out. I pursued the man across Hanover-square, he got away - Kent is the man who robbed me; there was a good light from the lamps, I could see him plainly.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Prossor, in Swallow-street. I went to school with Knight about seven years ago. On the 25th of April, about twenty minutes after ten o'clock at night, I saw him and Kent together, with two others, standing at Mr. Burt's gateway, in Swallow-street, some distance from Hanover-street - they were with Walker and Bowman - Walker sat down on the stones, and the four wanted to lift him up, and said they would fetch him a coach for a pint of beer. Walker and Bowman walked away together - both appeared to have been drinking, but they were able to walk. Soon after this I was going into my master's house, they passed me, one of them said they had hit him a crack of the eye. I ran away. I saw three of them running. Knight spoke to me that evening in the public-house.</p>

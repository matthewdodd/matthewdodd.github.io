                  </hi>. I am mate of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Limerick Lass</hi>, which laid in Mill tier, off Bermondsey, in the river Thames. On the 14th of May, about a quarter before three o'clock in the morning, I heard a foot coming on deck—I came on deck, and saw the prisoner with the sludge cask and three or four pounds of sludge in it—he was carrying it from the starboard side of the windlass—I asked what brought him there, and he said he was taking two sailors from the other side of the water, and he had put one on board a vessel lying astern—the other man he had put on our vessel, and he had got over the ship's side and made off—he was taking this sludge as payment for his water job, as the sailor had run away—no sailors had come to our ship—the cask that the sludge was in belonged to the ship—the owner is John Russell, of Limerick, and the captain, Harrison Underwood—I saw a boat on the lar<lb></lb>board side of the fore chains—the prisoner left the cask on the deck, and made a spring, but I laid hold of him—a young man who was in the boat let go the painter, and pulled the boat in amongst the tier.</p>

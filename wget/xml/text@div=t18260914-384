            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner on the 8th of July, in Regent's Park, with a bundle - I asked what it was; he said he had bought a coat that evening; that it was his own, and he would not shew it to anybody; he tripped me up and ran away; I followed and secured him; he still had the parcel - he tore the string, and threw the papers about - we found the curtain and handkerchief in his cap.</p>

These things are mine - I cannot say when I had seen them last - I had been removing from No. 1 to No. 2, and am not certain where these things were - they were usually kept in a chest in my bed-room; the prisoner was working for me as a <rs id="t18260914-384-deflabel2155" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>

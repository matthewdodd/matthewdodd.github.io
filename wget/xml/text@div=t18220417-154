            . I live at No. 17, Gloucester-place. On the 18th of April, I called at Mr. Shone's and in consequence of what I heard, I sent for an officer. The prisoner's box was opened in his presence, and five bottles of wine found. On the first bottle being produced, he said it was sent to him by his sister from St. Luke's. When I found another bottle, I said I thought it was master's; he denied it: and on looking at a third bottle, Mr. Shone's seal was on the cork; he then said he had taken it from his master's cellar, and that none of the other servants knew it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he took it to be ready when it was wanted - A. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Miss Arabella Anna Mann, who keeps a ladies' boarding-school. in Barnsbury-park, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. About half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 13th of June I was called up by a policeman, and found the street-door wide open—Mr. Mann had fastened it himself the night before, but not in my presence—the back-door was open the evening before, till about eight o'clock—any body could have got in till about nine o'clock—it was on the latch until nine o'clock—there were no marks of force on any of the doors—I have seen the articles produced, which are stated in the indictment—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) these are all the property of my mistress—I saw them all safe at eleven o'clock the night before—the chief of them were in the kitchen, and the rest in the school-room.</p>

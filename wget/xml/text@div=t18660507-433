                  </hi>. I am a police-constable, stationed at Arlington, which is, a village between West Drayton and Hounslow—on 19th April, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I went on the road to Hounslow—I saw two carts loaded with hay in front of the White Bear public-house, in charge of the prisoner and his brother—they were baiting their horses—I spoke to the prisoner's brother Emmanuel in the prisoner's presence, and said I wanted to look and see what he had got in his cart—by his permission I got on the load, and there found six dead fowls in a bushel-basket, with the name of "Steptoe" upon it—that is the prisoner's stepfather, for whom he works—the basket was down in the hay, covered over with a little bit of green stuff—I got down into the road with the basket—the prisoner's brother had then gone—I asked the prisoner how he became possessed of the fowls—he said, "I brought them from home, and am going to take them up the road to sell"—I took him into custody, and took him to Arlington police-station in a fly—he opened the door of the fly on the road and wanted to get out, but I prevented him—I put him in a room at the Arlington station—there is no look-up there, and he managed to slip out unawares, and ran across the fields—he was taken in about a quarter of an hour after and brought back—I produce the heads and legs of the fowls, and a wing of each—Mr. Naylor saw the fowls when they were whole.</p>

                  </hi> I am a market-gardener, at Arlington—I had a number of fowls—they were kept in a brick-built out-house, about nine feet from the dwelling-house—I had fourteen on Wednesday, the 18th, and they were locked up at night—on the morning of 19th, I found the door broken open, and twelve of the fowls gone—I gave information to the police, and between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, I saw six fowls in a basket, three of which belonged to me—I knew them by their colour and general appearance—they had got their right wings cut, and one of the hens had lost a claw from one of the feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Tipstone Harmondsworth, and am a labourer, in the employ of Mr. Steptoe—he is a hay-dealer, keeping several horses and carts—the prisoner was also in his employ—I remember 18th April—I went to Cookham that day with the prisoner and his brother Emmanuel—we each drove a cart—we started about 7 in the morning—the prisoner drove a black horse, and Emmanuel a white one—they almost always drove those two horses—we returned home between 11 and 12 at night, and when we had shut up the horses we went up to bed together, I and the prisoner and his brother, and a young man who is outside—the prisoner and I slept in the same bed, and Emmanuel slept in another room—the prisoner got up about 6 o'clock next morning, and they started out of the yard with their horses after loading the hay—the prisoner drove a black horse that morning, and Emmanuel a white one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

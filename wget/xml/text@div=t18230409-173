            . I am an Excise officer. On Tuesday afternoon, the 25th of February, about ten minutes after three o'clock, I was in the <placeName id="t18230409-173-crimeloc918">East India Company's warehouse, Blackwall</placeName>

I found three bags of pepper concealed under some planks in the Company's yard - next morning I concealed myself in a watch-box, about ten yards from where they were concealed, and about a quarter before eight o'clock, the prisoner came to the planks and took the bags; he put one in his hat and one in each pocket - they weighed 5 lbs. together; he left two empty bags and a pocket handkerchief in the place where the pepper was; I ran out and took him to the warehouse-keeper's room - the warehouse is not open till eight o'clock; he would not be searched if he went out before eight - the prisoner worked in the same warehouse, but not on the same floor as the pepper was kept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you to find them there - A. I was told some had been there before - eight o'clock was the time to come to work; I have seen labourers go in and out without being searched - I have seen the prisoner go out without being searched. He did not say he was going to the counting-house.</p>

            . I am a constable at the Blackwall gate of the Company's warehouse. The prisoner was given in my charge for stealing pepper. I searched him in Mr. Brown's presence, and found three bags of pepper on him - he escaped from us as I was taking him to the office; I caught him two hours afterwards on Bow Common.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your duty to search persons going out - A. Yes, it is the custom at all the gates.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do not persons often pass without being searched - A. It might be so; if he left before eight o'clock he would not be searched.</p>

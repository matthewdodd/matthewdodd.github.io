                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer. On the 17th of October I was at a public sale-room in Seymour-street, in the drawing-room—while the sale was going on, I felt a pull at my pocket, I turned round, and the pri<lb></lb>soners were behind, me Ralph was nearest to me, but both stood by me—I observed a person in the room behind them turning to leave the room—I followed him, thinking he might have my handkerchief—I considered Ralph had taken it, and might have given it to the man who I followed out of the room—as he turned the stairs he looked a respectable person, and I turned back, and observed the two prisoners together in conversation with each other, one leaning on the other's shoulder—I waited a few minutes, and told one of the porters to report to the auctioneer that I missed my hand<lb></lb>kerchief</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was on duty on Tuesday, the 17th, and was sent for—I went into the sale-room, and Charles was given into my custody—I searched him at the bottom of the stairs, as he was charged with picking pockets, and found on him a silver watch, a silk purse, with three sovereigns and a half and some silver in it—and two handkerchiefs, one a red one, and one claimed by Mr. Hawkings—that was in his right-hand coat-pocket—the other was in his hat—he said, "How many handkerchiefs have you taken?"—I said, "Two"—he said, "You have not taken two"—Ralph was brought down, and I took him into custody—and Lloyd gave me two more handker<lb></lb>chiefs.</p>

On Friday the 15th of August I missed the things mentioned in the indictment ( repeating them.) The prisoner went up stairs at about eleven in the morning to make the bed; she staid a longer time than usual; in about an hour, I went to see after her. I broke open her chamber-door and she was gone: my wife missed the things. I printed some hand-bills, and the watch was found. She went away without the least notice; she was taken at the Dog and Duck, with part of my wife's things upon her, One of my spoons was in her pocket; we put her in a boat to bring her to town; when she was in the boat, we asked her what she had done with the rest of the things; she said she had left them at a public-house at the Dog and Duck. I staid in the boat with her, and the two officers went on shore and fetched the bundle from Deptford; coming up the river, she said she could not tell where she had pawned the spoons, but she would show us; we went with her to Mr. Smith's in East-Smithfield; there we found four teaspoons and a large spoon; she then took us to Mr. Morgan's. We took her before the justice, who committed her.</p>

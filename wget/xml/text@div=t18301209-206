               <p>JAMES WHITEHEAD. On the 24th of November I went into a shop, and put down a hat and a hat-box, while I transacted my business - I went out, and left them behind me, not recollecting them; I called at another place in the neighbourhood - I then remembered them, went back, the lady in the shop told me a person had taken them, and she could not detain them, not knowing whose they were; I have never seen them since - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I did not see the prosecutor leave the hat and box in my shop, but a few minutes after he was gone the prisoner came in and took it away in a moment - I concluded she had left it; she had been to my shop several times - the prosecutor then returned, and I found my mistake: the prisoner came to my shop about a fortnight afterwards, and I had her taken.</p>
               <p>- BERESFORD. I took the prisoner in Mrs. Read's shop.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the shop several times, and she never said a word about it till the day I was taken.</p>

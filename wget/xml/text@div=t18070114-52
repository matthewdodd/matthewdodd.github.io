            . - Mr. Gleed. You are a master carman. - A. Yes, I live in Lower East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 7th of January last was the prisoner Harding in your employ. - A. Yes, as carman; I sent him to the London Docks, No 5, to load some barilla for Messrs. Cleaver of Shoe lane. I saw Harding between seven and eight o'clock, then he came to my stable, I told him that I thought he was concerned in taking the barilla. In consequence of that I sent for an officer directly. When the officer came he dropped on his knees and begged that I would not send him to prison, for he knew nothing at all of it.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of some information that you received you went to him at the watchouse. - A. Yes, and he said he would speak the truth; he said that Mears and Hayes were the two persons that applied to him in the morning for some barilla, and Hayes and Mears were the two persons that drove the cart and horses away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you answerable, Mr. Briant, for the delivery of this barilla. - A. Yes.</p>

             TANNER. - Mr. Gurney. I believe you are clerk to Mr. Briant. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Harding in his service as a carman - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. On the seventh of January do you know what cart he had that day. - A. A blue cart. We have two blue carts, the other was not out on that day; Harding came to my house about four o'clock on that day, he told me he had lost his cart and horses and barilla. I asked him how he came to leave his cart and horses; he then told me that he had not had a bit of victuals the whole of the day, that he went to get a bit of bread and cheese and a draft of beer, and while he was gone his horses and cart were driven away. I then went immediately and informed Mr. Briant. It was near four o'clock when I first heard of the horses and cart. I went immediately after them, and did not see them till eight o'clock. On my return home I saw the cart and horses in the Minories, they were going home, in the custody of Mr. Kee's men, and the barilla was gone. I immediately went home, and the prisoner was in the stable with Mr. Briant. I fetched an officer and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with Mr. Briant to the watchhouse. - A. I did; the prisoner then said he knew nothing about the horses and the cart and the barilla, he said he did not know how they were taken away. He afterwards sent for me, I went to the watchouse to him, he said he was very sorry for it, he would tell the truth; he said Mears and Hayes were the two men that drove the cart and the horses with the barilla away, but where they were gone to he could not inform me. Mr. Briant was outside of the watchouse, he came in and heard him say it; he said it twice over. He said that Mears had applied to him for some barilla in the morning.</p>

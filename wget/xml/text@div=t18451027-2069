                  </hi>. I live at Somers-mews, Paddington, and am a livery-stable keeper. Before this transaction the prisoner borrowed a horse and gig of me—I think he had had it five times altogether—the 10th of Aug. was the first time—he used to have it for the afternoon, and on one occasion for two days—he paid for it—he had spoken to me a day or two before the 13th of Sept., that he should want a horse and gig, as he was going to assist his father-in-law in a law-suit he had depending; and he wanted a nice easy chaise, as his wife was an invalid—he said his father lived at the west end of the town, and he should want the chaise a week, or perhaps a fortnight, as he was going to collect witnesses to assist his wife's father in this law-suit, and that many hundreds, and perhaps thousands of pounds depended oil it—on the 13th of Sept. he came, and one or two chaises were shown him—he had one which we call u Stanhope—it was the</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Robinson, who keeps the Reposi<lb></lb>tory in Little Britain.

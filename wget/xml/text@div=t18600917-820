                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines at Woolwich—the prisoner is a private in the same corps, and slept in the same room with me at the Marine Barracks on the sixth parade, between Saturday night the 25th and Sunday morning 26th August, to the best of my knowledge—I put my purse, containing a two-shilling piece and one farthing, and a dupli<lb></lb>cate of a coat pawned for two shillings, in my trousers pocket, and placed them under my head—when I awoke in the morning, my trousers had been removed to the top of my comrade's bed, and I missed my purse—I looked round a minute and reported it to the sergeant of my company—this is my purse and this is the duplicate—I never saw the duplicate till I saw it now—I saw the purse at the police-office—I had been in a public-house with the prisoner the evening before—I might have been in another public-house with him, but I was not drinking with him—I was sober, but he was not—I took my purse out to pay for the liquor—I was sitting by the prisoner—there were several soldiers—they were not all sober—I dare say there might be forty</p>

               <p>persons in all—there was no female in our company; there were some in the room—I don't know how many—I went out of barracks about 3 o'olock in the afternoon to the best of my knowledge—I did not go with the prisoner—I don't know where I went to first—I have not been in the corps long; I was a recruit—we went into two or three public-houses, two to the best of my knowledge—I did not get to bed till 12 o'clock—that was nine hours after I left the barracks, but I went for a walk with a comrade up the common in the afternoon, and I went in the dock-yard with Allen—I met persons in walking—I met women, but I had no conversation with them—when I went out I had a sovereign, a florin, and some other money; I believe a four-penny piece and a farthing—I had not more than four or five shillings left in the purse—I had spent all the rest in the public-houses—in the public-house I was last in there were seven or eight altogether, and I stood treat—there were ho women, not a single female—I was quite sober—we went into the barracks together—I had my purse in my hand before I put my trousers under my pillow.</p>

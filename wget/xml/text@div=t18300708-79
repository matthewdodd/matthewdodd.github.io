On the 24th of May I received three 10l. notes, a sovereign, and 3s. or 4s - I lodged at Nunn's mother's four days; Platt was in the house, and I took them for brothers; I owed Nunn's mother 2l. 17s. - when I was paid Platt came to me, and said, "Give me the money for my mother;" and I gave him a 10l. note - he took it to Nunn, who put it into his pocket-book, and said he could not change it; I said I wished he would give me the change as I wanted to go home to Scotland by the steam-boat - Nunn then gave it to Platt; we went to some place to get change - Platt then said he thought the captain could give change; I then got another note changed, and gave him the money - I never got the first note at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you told all the story? A. Yes; I owed Nunn's mother 2l. 17s.; I never thought of asking the captain for change - I did not afterwards ask Nunn if he had returned the note; he did afterwards say, "I gave it to Platt, and he returned it to you;" I told him he had not, and he said he gave it to Platt to return to me - I went into a skittle-ground with some shipmates, but not to play at skittles; I cannot tell how many of my shipmates were there - there might be about eight; I am certain Nunn did not give me the note - I did not say, "So help me God I do not think he ever had my note."</p>

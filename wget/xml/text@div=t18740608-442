                  </hi>. I am a colonel in the Bengal Staff Corps, and reside at Pimlico—on 20th May last I was at Woolwich, and during the afternoon I was outside the Ansenal Railway Station—there was a large crowd and a good deal of pushing going on, the doors of the station were closed waiting for the Emperor's special train to start—after standing in the crowd for some time I felt a jerk at this chain—I turned round and I suspected a man who was standing near me, and whilst I was speaking to him a gentle<lb></lb>man said something to me—I missed my watch directly—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I missed it I seized on the person near—the constable did not search him; he turned out his pockets and he had no watch on him—I saw the prisoner on the 26th or 28th, and I then said he was a perfect stranger to me—I had not seen him before.</p>

               <p>the afternoon of 20th May I was outside the Arsenal Railway Station—there was a great crowd there after the review—I saw the prisoner there loitering about in rather a suspicious manner and I watched him nearly half-an-hour—I saw him place himself in front of a gentleman and put his hands in the gentleman's pocket—I could not say that I saw the watch in his hand, but I was satisfied he had it—he placed his hand in his pocket and ran out of the crowd—I told detective Morgan to take him into custody for stealing a watch from a gentleman—the crowd made a move and I saw the gentleman open his coat and heard him say he had lost his watch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been to the review—I am the son of a late inspector of police—I knew Morgan as a friend—he was in plain clothes—I have given evidence upon several occasions—I have not been about with detectives—I went into the crowd and followed the prisoner wherever he went—I never lost sight of him all the half-hour—I went wherever he went.</p>

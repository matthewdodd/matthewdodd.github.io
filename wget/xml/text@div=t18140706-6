            . I live at 15, Frederick-place. On Sunday, the 19th of June, I was up in my bed-room; I observed three men lurking about the road. I saw one man ring at the door, he tried to open the door at the key-hole; he could not get it open; he went away along with the prisoner. They went to Lady Owen's public-house. In the course of a little while after, the prisoner returned, and the other man; the prisoner got over the area rails, on to the cisternin the house of Mr. Maystone. I then awoke my brother. I saw Wall go down into the area, and open the shutter. I cannot say whether the window shutter was fastened or not. In the course of a minute or two, he opened the door, and let in the other; one was inside and one outside; the one inside opened the door, and let in the other man that was outside. I just at that time, I observed four men coming down the road, they appeared like working men; I came down, and addressed the men; I said, there were two men broke into the house opposite; if you will have the goodness to assist me, I have no doubt we shall take them. I knocked at the door, and turned round; I observed a third man standing with a sack under his arm. I said, to the men with me, pointing to the man with the sack, that is one of them; he immediately turned round, and went into Sidney-street, that leads into the New-road; he carried that sack away. I knocked violently at the door; the prisoner opened the door to me; he asked me what I wanted. I said, you have broke into the house; his reply was, I have done nothing; I came to see what you knocked at the door for. By that time, the prisoner and the other man stood in the door-way; the prisoner stood on the right, the other man on the left. The man on the left, took the opportunity to escape, as I was going to knock at the door again. I immediately seized the prisoner by the collar; he said, oh, do not, sir; you will tear my shirt. I replied, oh, d - n your shirt; you shall not go. I secured him; we sent for an officer. He searched him; a silver spoon was found upon him. I gave charge of him to the constable. This was about a quarter before six when I took him; it was about a quarter before five when I discovered him get into the house. There were three young men in the house; two of them came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Maystone there himself - A. No. The two young men that came down, are both in court now; I do not know their names.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for; I took the prisoner into custody. In his right hand breeches pocket, I found this silver salt-spoon; I am certain of this spoon, and I found upon the prisoner these five silver tea-spoons; these spoons were taken out of the cupboard in the kitchen, and carried up into the parlour; I found them on the floor of the parlour; these silver table-spoons were taken off the sideboard in the parlour; I found them on the floor of the parlour; they were laid there ready to take away; the time-piece was taken off the chimney-piece, and laid on a chair, ready to take away, by the side of the spoons.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Maystone. I left my master's house about half past five in the morning, I went out to fetch a little boy that I have with me all day. I am sure the window was close down, but I did not put the screw in. I shut the door when I went out, and locked it, and took the key with me. The five silver tea-spoons I had put in the cupboard in the kitchen the night before; the time-piece was hanging in the front parlour, over the mantle-piece; the table-spoons were on the sideboard in the parlour; the spoons are not marked. I am sure they are my master's. I have lived with my master four months. They have been used daily in the house; I have had the handling of them every day. I know them from their general appearance. The salt spoons round on the prisoner, is my master's property; the one the prisoner had in his pocket, has a flaw in it; I can swear it is my master's property.</p>

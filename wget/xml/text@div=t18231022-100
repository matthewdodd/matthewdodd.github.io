            . I am twelve years old, and am errand boy to Mr. Edgerley, who lives in this building. On the 6th of October, I was at work on the first floor; not over the prisoner's room, but on the right hand side of the staircase - I heard a cracker go off about half-past eight o'clock; the men went down stairs; I knocked at the prisoner's door, got no answer, went up again, and about a quarter past nine o'clock I went down and saw the fire burning the partition, about three or four inches from the prisoner's door, and half a yard from the staircase; lighted coals were dropping through the partition. I alarmed the men, who came down, broke into the room, and found about two shovels full of coals, alight, piled up against the partition, and the room full of smoke: - we put the fire out - the grate had no coals in it, the bars were quite warm; the coals were across the room, quite away from the stove. I went to look after the prisoner - I was present with Downes, and met him by Mr. Medburst's, on the other side of Fleet-street, nearly opposite the passage, and went with him to the watch-house; he said he saw the place alight, and put the key in his pocket and went away - he said so to Cousins, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he saw the wainscoat alight - A. He said he saw the place on fire; there were eight boys about the premises, some of them used to plague him. I know nothing of squibs or papers of gunpowder being put under his door, nor about the handle of his door being daubed with filth - Mr. Drury's pressman had let the cracker off - I have heard the boys talk of playing him tricks, but do not know what the tricks were. I know nothing of the key of his door being stolen, or holes being bored in his door.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Bingham, printer, whose office is over the prisoner's room; there is a room between them. On the 6th of October we were printing, and had paper and books there belonging to Mr. Wooller. I heard a noise soon after nine o'clock, went down, and saw the prisoner's door burst open. Philp and Twopenny were there; the coals were scattered round the room by the door; the partition was red hot, but not in flames; the coals were in flames, and the room full of smoke - water was thrown on them - the grate felt quite warm, and a few ashes remained at the bottom - the coals could not have got on the floor by accident. I had seen the prisoner go out of his room about half-past seven o'clock that evening, with a female - I saw him shut the door, but am not sure that be locked it - and heard him say that the premises had been burnt down twice before; that they considered it was by accident, but he considered it was done on purpose. I saw him afterwards in custody of the watchman, and one of the boys. I heard him say, with an oath, that he saw the place on fire when he came away - that he did not care about the house, and would leave it burning - he seemed intoxicated, and stamped about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was present when this was said - A. Philp, Twopenny, and Downes, who are printers' boys, and Gogan, a journeyman, and Plumber, a printer, were present - Moore, the constable, I think was present, and must have heard it. I never played tricks with him.</p>

               <p>"they?" - A. One Parsons was going to let a cracker off - that was generally known.</p>

               <p>"Old woman, which way is blackey gone" - A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mention before the magistrate, about his saying he saw the place on fire, and did not care a d - n about it - A. No. I was not asked the question. I stated it to the Grand Jury. I did not remember it at the time.</p>

I went with Moore in search of the prisoner, found him in Fleet-street - a boy was with me then, but not Moore; he said</p>
               <p>"Are you going to murder me, or cut my throat, or what." I went to the watch-house with him, and staid till Cousins came; he said</p>
               <p>"D - n the fire, I saw the fire alight, and locked the door, and came out, the premises do not belong to me;" he repeated it several times. I do not know whether this was before or after Cousins came in.</p>

               <p>JURY to DOWNES. Q. You were privy to a lark being played with him - A. I knew it was to be played - a squib was hung to a string, and put through his trap door. I should think the wood would burn through in the course of a few minutes.</p>

            . I know all the printers' boys, who have been examined. On the 6th of October, I was at the prisoner's academy, looking up his linen, several fire-works were let off - he said he had been annoyed by them all the evening - three squibs came under the door while I sat there, and a pistol was let off - I was alarmed, and wished to leave - I left in about ten minutes, and as I went through the court, three of these boys said</p>
               <p>"D - n him, we will do for him to night," and while I was buying a pennyworth of pears at the bottom of the court, one of the boys came and said to the woman,</p>

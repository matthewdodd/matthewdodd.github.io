               <p>EDWARD OSBORNE. On the 4th of April I was in front of the <placeName id="t18250407-211-crimeloc1158">Mansion-house</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Might not some person in the crowd have taken it, and pushed it down by me? A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I stood by the Mansion-house, with the crowd, waiting to see the Lord Mayor; I came in contact with Mr. Osborne, who suddenly turned round and charged me with taking his handkerchief; he afterwards picked it off the ground; I declared it was never in my possession; he asked several people if they had seen me drop it - they said No; he asked me if I had seen any body take it from him.</p>
               <p>E. OSBORNE. I asked the people if they had seen him drop it, but do not think I asked him.</p>

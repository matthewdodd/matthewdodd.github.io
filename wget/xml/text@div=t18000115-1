               <p>Q. Where was it that he struck you? - A. On this cheek, I believe. (Pointing to the right check.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did it stun you? - A.It knocked me down to the ground, but I was sensible; he knocked me down several times after that, and the neighbours cried out shame on him to use a woman so; and he said I was a b-h and a wh-e, and he would serve any b-h of a wh-e, that came to take my part, the same; he went away, and then I went to the Magistrate's; the officer, Mr. Brown, came to me, and said, I have got a warrant against you; I asked him what it was for; and he said,

             had taken out a warrant against me; I went up at six o'clock, but it was not heard till the next morning; when the Magistrate came to hear it he discharged me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he charge you with? - A. Beating of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner afterwards? - A. Not till the night that he was apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. He and your husband are pretty intimate, are they not? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe they are to this very moment? - A. I cannot say I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your husband here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought him here as a witness for you? - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. And yet he discharged him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went before another Magistrate, did not you? - A. No.</p>

It was language that I am a stranger to; be said she had been beating his child; I cannot say what was before; he knocked her down three times; and after he was gone, she said he had taken a note from her; I asked her what note, and she said a twenty-shilling note; I saw a piece of paper in her hand, but I did not know what it was; he knocked her down three times, and kicked her once.</p>

On the 15th of November the prisoner came to me for a warrant against Ann Griffiths; the back part of his head was cut very much; Mr. Staples granted a warrant; in consequence of that Ann Griffiths came to a public-house about an hour after, for a warrant against him for beating her; that was about three o'clock; I told her Gowens had got a warrant against her, and she must attend at six o'clock in the evening; I went to her house and she was very much in liquor, so that she could not attend at the office; the next day I went down to Gowens about seven o'clock in the evening, to know why he did not bring the woman down, and she was gone; I overtook her in Ratcliff-highway, and she was then so intoxicated that she was obliged to be led by another woman; she came into the office and had a hearing before Mr. Staples; she said then she had lost a twenty-shilling note; she was very much in liquor then; Mr. Staples asked Gowens whether he meant to hold her to bail for cutting his head; and he said he did not wish to hurt her, as her husband was away from home; and Mr. Staples said, shall I discharge her then, and he said, yes; I heard no more of it till the 9th of December, the day that the indictment was brought to me; I went to see for Gowens that evening, but did not find him; on the 10th, I apprehended Gowens, in company with some other officers, and brought him to the office; he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what he is? - A. He lodges seafaring men; I have known him about a twelvemonth; she is a woman that has frequently been at the office for assaults.</p>

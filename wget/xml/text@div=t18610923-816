                  </hi>. I am troop serjeant-major in the military train at Wool<lb></lb>wich—our quarters are on the common; it consists of ten rooms; mine is No. 9; the windows look out on to the common—on the evening of 7th september, I left my quarters about half-past 6 o'clock—the door and window were then fastened—I returned at half-past 9, and found the window broken and the place broken into—nothing was taken—I had left a cash-box there, containing 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a gold watch and chain—it was underneath</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday night, 7th September, my attention was called to the prosecutor's premises about twenty minutes past 8 o'clock—I ran out of my room, and ran round to his quarters—I opened the door, and entered; and just as I did so, I heard a scuffle outside the window, as if a man had got out there—I found that the window was broken, and a sort of box under the window; a looking glass had been upon it, and that was down on the floor—I picked up this cap on the floor—I do not know whose it is—I kept it in my possession till the serjeant-major came in—I looked the door immediately, and ran round to the back of the hut, and saw Buckmaster walking about there, and he said something to me.</p>

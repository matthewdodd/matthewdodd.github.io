            . I am constable of Enfield. On Saturday morning, the 17th of September, I was in the foot-path, near Mr. Dear's garden at Bull's-cross - I saw Alfred Hill and another boy coming out of his gate, between five and six o'clock; the other had a bag - I suspected there was something not right; I followed them - they walked at first, and when they saw me they made more haste - they dropped the bag; I took it up, and secured Alfred Hill; I found in the bag these three water-plates, this piece of carpet, and this bottle of wine; I gave information at the house, and we went up stairs with Amelia Hill - her master said to her, "How came you to rob me so?" she put her hands together, and said it was the first time, she hoped he would forgive her, and she would not do so any more - the plates were not mentioned then; there were three plates left in a kind of a hole in the attic - one of them corresponded with the three in the bag; Mrs. Dear produced a piece of carpet, which matched this piece in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Mr. Dear say he had not seen the plates for eight years? A. He said, "Not for some time; the prisoner were admitted to ball, and have surrendered to-day - the other boy is sixteen years old: he is older than this boy - he ran away, but this one did not.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. The officer came to our house that morning before we were up- he asked if we had lost any water plates; we had had six up stairs, four of one pattern and two of another; the three he found were of the same pattern with one I had left- this piece of carpet was produced; I have a piece which corresponds with it - Amelia Hill had access to the room in which that cupboard was, and she asked me what was in it; I said a good many things, and among the rest some pewter water-plates; I had them in my hand a few days before - the three brought back were the same pattern as the one remaining - in my judgment, they are ours- the prisoner said she hoped for forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you brought, them yourself? A. No; I took them there when we removed from London twelve years ago, and they had been in my kitchen two or three years before; there is no private-mark on them - if I had seen these twenty miles off I could swear to them; I can only swear to the state they are in; they are very dirty and dusty.</p>

We asked them for whom they carried it? they could not tell the gentleman's name, but said he would be there as soon as they; we followed them there, there they pitched them, there was no person met them; then we spoke to the landlord to get a constable, to stop them till we could let Mr. Greenwood know about it; we sent to him, he came, and brought the mark on paper which we found stampt on the iron.</p>

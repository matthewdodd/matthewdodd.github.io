I was standing in the bar, a woman called at the window and said there is a man gone out of your house with a pot under his coat; I followed him and stopped him, and told him he had got one of my pots he said yes; a quart pot he dropped a bag that he had under his arm, it was picked up, and another quart pot was taken out of it, which was my property.</p>
               <p>Q. They were both your property - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You say he had been four hours at your house, had he been drinking all the time - A. He might have had some beer; he was asleep part of the time, he appeared sober; I have known the man being in the neighbourhood some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. He buys clothes; he lives in a court in Hackney road; I served him with beer.</p>

Yes, I live in Hackney road; I was standing at the door, I saw Mr. Smith have hold of the prisoner; the prisoner had a bag, it was tied at the mouth of it; he dropped it at the door; I took the prisoner from Mr. Smith; a woman brought the bag to me; I opened the bag and took a quart pot out.

                  </hi>. I live in College-terrace, Camden-town. On the 13th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing along West-street, Smithfield—the prisoner came from a door there with another person—I was sober—they called me a b----r, used obscene language, and the prisoner seized me suddenly behind by my coat, dragged me inside the door of the house, with my back to the door—I was dragged in backwards—I am lame—I staggered against a wall, and the prisoner put her hand across into my pocket, and took out four shillings, and two sixpences—I struggled to get away, and my coat came off my arm—it was hanging by my left arm, and my waistcoat was torn open—I got out, and met two policemen—they asked if I had lost anything—I searched, and found I had lost my money—I had stumbled in the new street, leading from Farringdon-street, a few minutes before, and it was safe then—the policemen went with me to the house, and we found the prisoner there—she denied being the person—I ought to say two men at the end of the passage seemed to be urging the two girls—they seemed to be under the direction of an aged woman, and the two men—when we went there nobody could be found but the prisoner and another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Another female came into the house, and said, "I was not the person, I was washing at the time"—the gentleman then said, "I believe it was her," meaning that woman. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Nobody came in as she says—no<lb></lb>body said so—I said the prisoner was the person—the other person in the house escaped under pretence of fetching her clothes down—they were both the persons who had robbed me—I am certain of the prisoner.</p>

I met the prosecutor between five and six o'clock, at the corner of West-street, and went with him to a brothel of the lowest description, two doors down the street—the upper part of his clothes were in a very disordered state—his coat pulled back a good deal, and his waistcoat drawn up—we went into the house, and found the prisoner in the passage—he accused her of robbing him of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she denied it, and said he had got hold of the wrong person, he was a liar—I took her into custody—the prosecutor was quite sober—the other woman said, I should not take the prisoner without her bonnet, and she went away under pretence of fetch<lb></lb>ing it, and I saw no more of her—she did not say the prisoner was not con<lb></lb>cerned.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of 24th June I was in the Lower Marsh, in a public-house—I was sober—the witness King went in with me—we were having some beer—the prisoners were there—as I sat on the seat the female prisoner came and asked me for some ale—I said I should not give her any—a few minutes after that she came and snatched my watch out of my fob and left the chain behind, which I produce, broken from the swivel—she went out at the door—I called to King, and said "She has got my watch"—I was knocked down by the male prisoner inside the door—it was a violent blow; I had a black eye for a week—when I recovered my senses I went outside—the male prisoner was there—I told him I should give him in charge, and he knocked me down again—I went to Tower Street, and gave information—I saw the prisoner again that night at the corner of Tower Street—I was with King—I said to the prisoner "I shall give you in charge"—he said "Come out in the road, and I will give you a b----good hiding"—he knocked me about then—I saw him afterwards in a public-house, and a constable came up and took him—I am sure he is the man—I gave 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at this public-house, the Spanish Patriot, at 7.30, with Webb—the two prisoners were there—I was standing at the bar—I saw the prisoner Morris knock Webb down; that first attracted my atten<lb></lb>tion—I went and picked him up—I did not know what had happened—Webb had hold of the female prisoner, and when he was knocked down she went out—I picked him up, and asked him what had happened—we went outside, and went to the police-station—I went afterwards with constable Davis to a little street in the Cut, where I saw the female prisoner—there was a crowd outside the public-house after it was said the watch had been lost.</p>

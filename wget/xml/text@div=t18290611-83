               <p>GEORGE BARRETT. I was going towards Tyburn-gate, on the 7th of May; I heard some one halloo, and saw Baister turn down Harewood-place - I saw the prisoners; one was carrying something - I believe it was Taylor, but I cannot exactly say which; I went on, and saw a watchman - I went up to Taylor, and took the property from him; they were twenty or thirty yards, I suppose, from the prosecutor's house when I saw them first - they then went on to Hanover-street, and then to Argyle-street; I secured them both.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You cannot say who had the parcel first? A. I did not see either of them in the prosecutor's shop.</p>

               <p>TAYLOR's Defence. I was walking down Oxford-street, and met this prisoner and another man dressed in blue; they asked if I would do a job; I said I would - we went on, and this prisoner gave me a bundle, told me to go on to Argyle-street, and he would follow me; I went there, and then missed them; I waited at the corner, and this gentleman came up and asked what I had got; I said I did not know, it belonged to a gentleman just behind.</p>

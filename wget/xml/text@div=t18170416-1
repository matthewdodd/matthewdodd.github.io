On the 27th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs, and went out, leaving my door on the catch, the prisoner used to sleep under the sheds in the market; his dog ran after my dog-it ran out of Gerrard-street, which made me know that he was in Gerrard-street; I went to my slaughter-house, and returned in about three minutes, and found my door partly open, I missed a piece of beef, and saw the hook upon which it hung swinging; suspecting the prisoner, I went to a public-house that he used, and told the landlord to stop him if he came there. I went in search of him, and returned to the public-house, when the landlord informed me that he was just gone in with something under his great coat. I went into the tap-room, and saw the prisoner putting this great coat (producing it), under the table; I told him I thought he had got something there that did not belong to him - He said he had not. I found my beef and mutton wrapped up in his coat. As I was taking him to the watch-house, he asked me to forgive him, as it was the first time he had ever robbed me; and said he would never come in the market again.</p>

            . I am book-keeper to this waggen, I was going after the waggon to Piccadilly, to give an account of some affairs in the Country, when I saw the prisoner on this horse riding back; I thought he was going back by order of the waggoner, for something forgot at the Inn. This was about three quarters after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ryall. I am porter at the King's Arms to this waggon, Mr. Dredge informed me the horse was lost, so I went to Smithfield, and there I saw the prisoner riding on the horse: I knew the horse very well, and found the man cloathed as Mr. Dredge described him to me. There we took the prisoner, &amp;c. The horse was worth 8 l.</p>

            . I tied the horse to the tail of my waggon, before I went out of the Inn-yard: This was my Nagg. I missed him about the Upper Watch-house, in Holbourn. I had stopped to let two carts go by me, he was at the tail of the waggon then, and in five or six minutes he was gone. Our book-keeper asked me, if I had sent the horse back for any thing, then I concluded he was stolen. Caleb Jackson was in Smithfield market at the securing the prisoner. He described the horse, and deposed as the others.</p>

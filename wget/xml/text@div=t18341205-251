                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Begg. The prisoner lodged in the same house with me—she left on the 23d of September—while she was there, I had some lace, which I put, with some other things, into my box—on the 28th of September, I missed it—I went to Worship-street, and they sent an officer, who went to where I lodged, but the prisoner was gone—I afterwards went to where the prisoner lodged—I saw her box open, and this lace was found in it—it is mine—it is exactly eleven weeks ago since I missed it, on a Sabbath morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This poor woman has sur<lb></lb>rendered this morning, has she not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she attended three or four times before the magistrate—I lodged on the first floor, and she on the second—I was not receiving much money at that time, but I had a good many things in my boxes—I changed lodgings with the prisoner—I have two children—I never was without food for them, but the prisoner has often given them bread and butter—I had no furniture but my boxes and bedstead—the prisoner lived with her husband, and they were com<lb></lb>paratively well off—the lace was found in her box—I cannot say that I remember that box being packed up, when she removed—I did not assist in packing her box—my hands were never in her box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it through Mrs. Burroughs that you were induced to take this woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She told me what she had lost—I heard that the prisoner had a quarrel with her in consequence of her calling her a thief—I did not assist in packing the prisoner's box—I saw her packing a box, but I can<lb></lb>not say whether it was the box my lace was found in—I was not present when her boxes were packed—I know a girl named Ann Clark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you again, (Clark is here,) did you not actually assist in pack<lb></lb>ing this very box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: the prisoner went to live at Mrs. Burrough's, in Paul-square—I called, and saw her there, on the Monday after I dis<lb></lb>covered my loss—I had lost a great many things—my husband and another person were with me—I mentioned this lace to the prisoner—I called it "My cap borders!"—the prisoner did not, on that occasion, offer to have her box searched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see the officer, and did not the prisoner offer that he should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183412050058"></xptr>
               <p>search her box, but you refused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; but she did not know it, be<lb></lb>cause I did not then suspect her—Mrs. Burroughs sent a policeman into the prisoner's room, to search her boxes, but that was six weeks after I lost my things—the box in which this was found, was not locked—I do not re<lb></lb>member the prisoner recommending me to go to Worship-street—perhaps she did—I do not know when the policeman broke into her room—he handed her over to another officer—I do not know when I heard about the quarrel between her and Mrs. Burroughs—the prisoner said she would tell her husband that the lodger kissed her—I received a letter, written by Elizabeth Nicholls—I did not know from Mrs. Burroughs that she desired Nicholls to write—but it was in consequence of what Burroughs said, that the letter was written—Mrs. Burroughs said she had been robbed—Mrs. Nicholls knew I had been robbed, and she sent me word—Nicholls was not intimate with me—I knew her, but had not seen her for weeks before—I do not know that Burroughs knew Nicholls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was she taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One Monday night; but that was six weeks after I had been at the office—I did not suspect the prisoner when I went to the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mrs. Nicholls live next door to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she lived at No. 18, Aske-street—I live in Clerkenwell-close—I removed two or three days after my loss—I could not bear the room—my husband knew that I had this lace—it is in the same state now as it was, only it is unfolded—my husband left me to myself sometimes—I have never charged my husband with robbing me, nor with taking my things out of my box, and selling them, and getting drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. BURROUGHS</hi>. I did not induce Elizabeth Nicholls to write the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know Nicholls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till I saw her at the office—I did not know that she wrote any letter—I lost some things—I did not hear of the letter till the prisoner was in custody—my husband works at Mr. Springfield's—he is not a regular porter—I do not know what wages he has—he allows me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I let the house, and do needle-work, and earn 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the name of the lodger that the prisoner threatened to tell your husband had kissed you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sir, it was false—his name is Reuben; but it was false—he is a foreigner—the policeman did not break the pri<lb></lb>soner's door—he put his staff to it, and it flew open—he never forced it at all; but she would say any thing—I wonder she did not say something worse.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>We were going up the lane; there was a man had two horses; he was drunk; he had tied them to a rail; he asked us, if we were going to town? I said, yes; he said the horses had broke into his ground and he had a mind to pound them; he asked us to drive them; he said he would give us 6 d. or a draught of beer; he helped me on the horse, and on these men coming up he ran away.</p>

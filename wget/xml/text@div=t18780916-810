About 2 in the morning of 28th August I was on duty in Oxford Street, and saw Burn's turning the corner of Dean Street and Oxford Street—he went into a urinal, I followed him—he was taking off his coat and other things—I took him in custody and took him to the station, and found on him a coat, vest, trousers, and boots belonging to the prosecutor, and in his left coat pocket I found this chisel, also some matches, candle, and two wedges generally used by thieves—before seeing Burns I had seen Johnson in Dean Street about 1 o'clock, with a costermonger's barrow—I asked what he was doing with a barrow at that time in the morning—he said he was waiting for a friend, that he had had a moving job on during the day which made him late—he then went down Dean Street into Gerard Street, towards the Dials, there lost him—about a quarter of an hour after I had taken Bums to the station Johnson was brought there by another constable—about 5.30 a.m, I was in Tichfield Street, which leads out of Dean Street, and found this iron chisel in the gutter—I took it to the prosecutor's premises and compared it with four or five marks on the door there and found they corresponded.</p>

               <p>crossed over and asked what he had got—he made no reply, but threw it down and ran away—I ran after him and caught him—he struggled very hard to get away—another constable came up, I then took him back to where the bundle was lying, it contained seventy-one skins, I have three of them here.</p>

From information on this morning I went to 102, Dean Street; I entered by the door, which had been forced from the inside—I found 95 dozen skins, similar to these, packed up in bundles near the door ready for removal—I found this screwdriver on one of the benches near the counting-house window, it was covered with blood which had dried on—the warehouse had been entered by getting cm a low facia three or four houses off, walking along the leaden facia and opening the first-floor window and forcing open the door, and thus getting access to the warehouse—the window was closed but not fastened—there was no broken glass about—I compared the chisel with the marks and they corresponded—I was at the station before Johnson was charged—I observed his hand, he had a piece of paper round one of his fingers; I did not examine it then; I found afterwards it had been cut and it was bleeding, the paper was wet with blood—he refused his address—he said he was a respectable man.</p>

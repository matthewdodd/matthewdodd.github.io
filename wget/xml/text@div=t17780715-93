            ? - I have seen him at the Bricklayers-Arms; he used to call there at a house I lived at as waterman; I met him in Grays-Inn-lane, and drank part of two pints of beer with him at the Green Man in Purpool-lane.</p>
               <p>When was that? - Last Friday was a week.</p>
               <p>What time of day was that? - It might want a quarter of ten o'clock, and I believe I was there with him till a quarter or half past ten; then I walked with him into the Strand, to Queen's Head-court, and then parted from him.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave him in the Strand? - Near upon eleven, I believe.</p>
               <p>And are you positive this was on the 10th of July? - It was last Friday week; I cannot say any further.</p>
               <p>Defendant. Meadows came up to my house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150074"></xptr> at the time he said, rather before eleven; he was never out of my house till very near one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Briggs. Was you present at the trial of Meadows? - No, I was in the Borough with a custom-house officer.</p>
               <p>Did Meadows send to you? - He desired I would appear upon his trial; when I came the night before, he said, he did not think his trial would come on till Saturday: I came to him in Newgate the night before his trial came on.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any person that you was to be witness for him? - I cannot say, I did, any particular person.</p>
               <p>Do you know that young woman at the bar? - I never saw the woman, so help me God in my life, till I saw her since Meadows was cast for death, that was in prison; I heard when I came to see him, that she was committed for perjury.</p>
               <p>What was the business that detained you? - He told me that he did not expect his trial to come on till the next day; he told me that the night before his trial came on: I was stopped upon a seizure; a man desired me to fetch a custom-house officer for a seizure of run goods.</p>
               <p>Could not an hundred people have done that? - They might, but Meadows did not think any thing of his trial coming on then; he said, he hoped I would come and speak in his behalf, of drinking with him where I did.</p>

               <p>Briggs. Meadows told me Green was the man that committed the robbery: that was in the bail dock immediately after he was tried. I came here to give evidence but was too late; I left the custom-house officer in the Borough, and told him what I was coming on. Meadows said he was an innocent man, and that Green committed the robbery; what I say is true; else, I hope I shall never move my feet.</p>

I went down to the Bolt and Tun, Fleet-street, pulled off my coat and chucked it into the coach, in the Bolt and Tun-yard. I then went down to Covent Garden, met the coach, looked inside of the coach, and all over the coach, and could not find my coat any where; there were six passengers in the coach. I laid my coat on the cushion when I left it in the coach. I asked the coachman what had become of my coat; he told me he did not know. A young man, who is in court, said he saw the prisoner take it. All I know, I lost my coat.</p>

            . I am a coachman. On Wednesday, the 17th of November, I asked the coachman that drove for Mr. Adams to give me a cast to Charing Cross; I asked him to let me ride by the side of him, and put my little boy inside; he gave me leave. My little boy is seven years old. When I put him in, I saw a drab coat on the front seat inside; soon after that, I got up outside of the coach myself, and several people got inside of the coach, among whom was the prisoner, he got inside; But previous to the coach going out of the yard, I saw the prisoner get out of the coach on the near side of the coach, with a drab coat on his arm; he then walked out of the yard, and I saw no more of him; I described him to Mr. Adams, by which means he found the man, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he inside of the coach - A. I suppose not more than seven or eight minutes; I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Foreign Office in the General Post Office, and have been so about fifteen months—the different receiving-houses and branch post-offices in town send bags of letters to the General Post Office once a day—they also each send a letter-bag containing foreign letters—the inland bag should go straight to the Inland Office, and the foreign bag to the Foreign Office—Colonial letters, and letters to North America, go thought the Inland Office—foreign letters come into the Foreign Office—it some times happens that letters directed to the Colonies are for<lb></lb>warded to the Foreign Office instead of the Inland Office—they come in the bags from the receiving-houses to the Foreign Office, by mistake, instead of the Inland Office—that is not the proper course—if a person at the receiv<lb></lb>ing-house has a letter directed in North America or the Colonies, he might by mistake put it in the foreign bag—when what is discovered by the person who receives the bags at the Post-office, be gives the letter and the postage paid on it, to a messenger to send to the Inland Office—the postage</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040152"></xptr>
               <p>is paid on all foreign letters—I do not know Colonial letters—if a letter, by mistake, got into the foreign bag at the receiving-house, the postage would be paid—there is a tunnel which communicates from the Foreign Office to the Inland Office—if a letter which ought to be sent to the Inland Office comes to the Foreign Office, the letter and postage are con<lb></lb>veyed through the tunnel—the prisoner was a President in the foreign office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Being President of the office, he have control of the money, so that if he directed a clerk in the office to give him money, or any thing, ought they to obey him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they ought to obey him. On Friday evening, the 4th of March, I was on duty at the Foreign Office—I was a window-clerk at that time—I stand at the window, and receive foreign let<lb></lb>ters and the postage which is paid for them—on that afternoon the pri<lb></lb>soner came to me with some letters, and wanted the postage for them—he was the President on duty that evening—he said he wanted the postage to send the letters with the money to the Inland Office—he said they were letters for the Inland Office—he asked me for foreign letters to the amount of the same postage, to send with them to the Inland Office—that was to discharge myself from the money which I gave him—I am charged with all the postage of the letters I receive at the window, by some one who looks over all those letters, and they know what money to charge me—if I had given the prisoner the money he asked for without giving him foreign letters to the same amount, I should have been charged with more money than I had in my possession—I took notice of the directions of some of the letters he brought to me, and afterwards saw them in the prisoner's hat—he went to the fire-place after he asked me for the money—that was before I gave him the money—he went and sat down by the fire-place—his hat was on the bench in a little place parted off from the rest of the office, where the presidents generally sit—there were letters and newspapers in his hat—he had newspapers, as well as letters, from me when he asked me for the money—I noticed that the letters in the hat had the same directions on them as those he brought to me—I took the letters out of the hat, and copied the addresses—the prisoner at that time was sitting by the fire a short distance of—this is my cop (looking at it)—this was not the first time the prisoner had asked me for money in the same way—8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was the amount of the postage I gave him—he mentioned the addresses of some of the letters for which he wanted the postage, and I saw them also—I gave him the money shorlty after I saw the letters in his hat—I recollect the addresses of the letters the prisoner mentioned to me—they were Halifax, Curacoa, and Madras—he did not tell me any other addresses—I saw Mau<lb></lb>ritius on one—the one for Madras was a newspaper (<hi rend="italic">looking at several</hi>)—this is the one for Curacon—this is another—here is one with Mauritius on it—that is one I saw, which he did not mention—I was present when the prisoner was examined at Mr. Peacock's office on Saturday, the 5th of March—he was asked if he had any letters, and he said no—he was then asked if he had any in his drawer, and he said he had none—next day I cast up the amount of postage on the letters which I found in this hat—it was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the sum the prisoner had asked me for.</p>

               <p>time for his coming on duty, it depends upon the Inland Office—there is a stated tome for leaving duty—I was there the whole day on Friday, the 4th of March, and was relieved by Mr. Arrowsmith—I came on duty between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—I was there till six o'clock alone, at the window, but not in the office alone—it is my duty to take the letters and money which are entrusted to me for the time I have stated—I believe the prisoner has formerly held my situation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then supping he held that situation when he was on duty there, I take it for granted he had opportunities of defrauding the revenue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know, I suppose he had—he had the care of the money in the same way—he could not have applied it to his own use long—he would have been obliged to have returned it—if he had the money as I have, I suppose he might use it—he might have destroyed a foreign letter, and pocketed the postage—there would have been an inquiry about the letter—persons inquire if a letter is missed—I do not receive letters for the colo<lb></lb>nial department—it is the gentleman who does the hags—I have the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of pocketing the money and destroying a letter—this paper is a list of the letter found in Mr. Barnes's hat—I merely took the places and stamps—I know nothing of the names—there might be more letters for Madras—the paper enables me to tell the places from which they come and to which they are destined—I have not the names—the postage of other letters in London to the same places would be the same on all letters—a private soldier's would go for one penny—Mr. Barnes ought to have asked the bagman for the money on these letters, and not me—Mr. James was the bagman on duty on Friday—he is here—the letters lay exposed in the prisoner's hat—any person in the room would have seen them—he was sitting by the fire at the time I took the account of them, apparently asleep—he did not appear unwell, or fatigued—he said he was sleepy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it usual to give him money and letter without making inquiry when he asks for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have no right to ask him, certainly—I should not have given him money without his producing letters—he has asked me for money with letters, but not without them—I do not require to see the letters—If he held them in his hand it would he quite sufficient—I had not time to take down the full addresses of the letters, and I did not think it necessary—I did not do it for both those reasons—the Foreign Office is a large room, much about the size of this court—there are two fire-places. One for the messengers, the other where the clerk generally sit—all the clerks in the Foreign Office are entitled to come into this room, messengers and all—the windows are opposite the fire-place and the door—(looking at a plan of the office)—there is a screen between the door and fire-place, and the window at which I was on duty—it is ten feet high, I should think—it goes nearly the whole length of the room—when the door of the screen is shut the persons at the fire-place cannot see the window where I am—that door is exactly opposite the window at which I was placed—the door in the screen shuts with a spring of its own accord—it must he held or fixed to be kept open—I often leave the window to go to the fire-place in the course of the day—I leave nobody at the window then—it is closed—it has a slide, which is fastened by a catch or spring—that spring is in bad condition—I had left the window when I looked into Mr. Barnes's hat, and nobody was behind the screen—there was a messen<lb></lb>ger at the further end of the room, with whom I had no communication—I am a permanent clerk in the establishment—it is the course of the post</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Foreign Office at the Post Office. On Friday, the 4th of March, I was on duty at the window in the Foreign Office—I came on duty there about five minutes after six—the prisoner came to me at seven o'clock, and demanded 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some letters which he said were to go to the Inland Office—I gave him that sum—he came about five minutes afterwards, and desired to have 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for two newspapers addressed to Mauritius and Madras—I paid particular attention to what he did and what he demanded that night—I was present at Mr. Peacock's office, on Saturday, the 5th of March, when the prisoner was pre<lb></lb>sent—Mr. Peacock asked him whether he had any letters about him—he said, no, he had none—he asked if the letters for which Mr. Young had given him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the night preceding were forwarded—he said, "Yes; undoubtedly"—he was asked if he had any letters in any part of the Post Office, or in any of his drawers—he said, "No."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose these letters to have arrived at the office under a mistaken impression that they should come to the Foreign Office, how should they be conveyed to the Inland Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would go through the tunnel, according to the usual course of business; but if, instead of sending then through the tunnel, the President comes and asks for money, I am bound to give it to him—it is not the proper practice orfont the President to come himself for the money—he ought to send the letters by a messenger—Mr. Barnes has done it—the messenger should take the letters to the bag clerk to receive the money, and the money and letters are forwarded immediately to the Inland Office by the tunnel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that Friday night a foreign post night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. it was not a particularly busy night—I have quite a distinct recollection of it—there were no mails made up in addition to the ordinary mails that night, as far as I can recollect—I cannot swear it, but it can be proved I do not recollect any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not, on that night, the Malta, Indian, Brazil, and Buenos Ayres monthly mails require to be made up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am certain of it—I am</p>

               <p>as far as possible convinced of it—I cannot take on myself positively to say so—if they were made up that night, it would cause a great dead of additional business in the Foreign Office, and would require considerable attention on the part of the President—but there could not have been a great influx of business that night, because the mails for Malts and India were in time on the Wednesday—a foreign mail night does not require the attention of the President more than any other night—his attention is required every night—he is longer on duty, no doubt, but he should pay the same attention on another night as on a foreign post-night—there is a greater influx of letters in the Foreign Office on a post night than on another night—that would not require greater attention at the time—the office is longer open—the fatigue would not he greater in time—a man would he more fatigued at the close of a foreign-post night than on another night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the great multiplicity of business a gentleman has in his office, might you not expect a mistake to be made to be made at times? Yes; he might make a mistake—my occupation in the office is more busy than his I have occasionally made mistakes myself in business, and have been re<lb></lb>proved—not over and over again—it has occurred—I have been reproved several times for mistakes I have made—I am not aware of Mr. Barnes being compelled to assist at the sorting-table—I have known him to do it once—will swear I have not known him do it oftener—he may have done so on other occasions without my knowledge—the President is obliged to perform various duties in the office, and is referred to on all occasions of difficulty—questions of difficulty frequently arise—I cannot give any ides of the number of letters that come in on a foreign post-night—they are so numerous—there is an account kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the kindness to look at this newspaper, directed to Granada—if a paper came directed to that place, would it not be referred to Mr. Barnes, to know whether it was to go to the West Indies, or to Spain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should have known where to send it by the direction of Granada—when I first went into the office, I was frequently obliged to refer to Mr. Barnes in matters of difficulty, but not latterly—I have occa<lb></lb>sionally—I should think there are thousands of letters come into the Foreign Office on the foreign post-night.</p>

I was employed at the Post-office on the 5th of March last, at the solicitor's office—I took the prisoner into custody there—I did not hear anything said to him—I searched him, and found some letters and papers, and some keys—I marked them, and gave them to the solicitor—I went with the prisoner down to the Foreign Office—before we went there he said he had got some letters and papers in his drawer, which he would give me—he went with me to his drawer—it was a single key, and two bunches that I found on him—one of those keys opened his drawer—he said he would show me which key opened his drawer, and did so—I opened the drawer, and found a quantity of papers and letters, and wearing-apparel (<hi rend="italic">looking at some let<lb></lb>ters and newspapers</hi>)—I found all these in the drawer—I found four letters and two papers, I think, on his person, which I marked, and gave to the soli<lb></lb>citor of the Post-office(<hi rend="italic">the directions of those found in the drawer being read,</hi>

               <p>court, to be called upon to explain acts of official negligence, or other official acts, whether of omission or commission, has excited very sensibly my feelings, and I hope to be pardoned if I say my indignation—Gentlemen, at the outset I must remind you, that I held the responsible situation of President of the Foreign Post-office, a situation which necessarily gave me the control of every act of duty on the part of the officers of that depart<lb></lb>ment—in every case I was authorized to use discretionary power, and to de<lb></lb>tain letters if there was any doubt as to the accuracy of their direction of the mode of forwarding them—I am accused of having embezzled small sums of money, and not forwarding the same to the Inland Office—all that I can say to this, is that if any such monies came into my hands for any such purpose, they were, with the letters, for<lb></lb>warded to the Inland Office—I say, "If they ever came into my hands. "for the first charge bears the date of Wednesday, the 2nd of March, which you have not now before you—on that very evening the Malta, the Buenos Ayres, the Brazils, and the Indian Mails, in addition to the ordinary mails, were made up; and it was with considerable difficulty that they could be prepared for dispatch—I believe the amount of postage received that evening, between five and seven o'clock, equalled, if it did not exceed what is taken on grand post nights, which are Tuesdays and Fridays—but, gentlemen, I am unable to state the exact amount, as an extract from what we term the night charge-book, in which the sums the window-man receives are entered, has been denied me, although I applied by letter to the President for it—my exertions, in addition to the confusion of the evening, may be estimated; for though I was President, and had no obligation to stoop to so menial an officer, I delayed settling the window charges, that I might assist at the sorting table; in fact my presence was constantly required in every part of the office—if I had any letters or money for the Inland Office, I should have sent them there directly, just as I received them, to have kept my table clear—I say, that, not only on post nights, but on every evening, there is an immense pressure of business, and a variety and multiplicity of things to attend to, which it is next to an impossibility that I or any one else can remember, as it relates to every transaction—Gentlemen, it is notorious that Mr. Young, who has been before you, is a very had reckoner; and I, as President, have had very frequent occasions to reprimand him on that account—no account of the transactions of the kind of which I have been speaking are ever kept—many letters going from the Foreign Office to the Inland Office, are completed at the moment out of hand—there is no account kept or taken, likewise, I should mention to you, on the otherwise of the tunnel, the Inland side, of what monies or letters are received—therefore that sum for letters and newspapers, which Young says he believes he gave me (8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) on' if you bear in mind, according to his deposition, he had not previously seen those letters—that some letters were found in my drawer is certain, but it is a circumstance that happens to every public officer, and has happened to myself after twenty-seven years of service—can an act; call it negligence if you will, or rather by its true term, call it accident—is it possible that these letters, from among hundreds, nay thousands, were mislaid, and I neglected them purposely?—is it to be concluded that I intended to steal them?—is it intended to say I intended to steal the postage on them?—as to receiving from Arrowsmith or Young the sums of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., (or as I think in my agitation I may be incorrect as to the amount,) I can only say I have no recollection on the subject—Gentlemen, my house was searched, the peaceful abode of my</p>

               <p>wife and family, and were letters and newspapers found? No—does it not rather prove as strong as proof can be, that the suspicion attached to me is false?—Mr. Young has said that I asked him for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for letters from the Inland Office; and he stated that he did not give it to me at the time, but he did give it to me about a quarter of an hour afterwards, Now this is important, because there is no proof that he gave it to me at all; and this brings me from half past four o'clock to half past five o'clock, when he tells you I was asleep before the fire, and the letters were in my that—he has admitted to you, that he had not given me the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before he saw the letters in my hat—has he satisfied you, Gentlemen, how it happened, that he, a public officer like myself, should see, what must have appeared to him a neglect of duty—should see me asleep before the fire with fatigue, (and those letters, which he must admit, if I had the money for them at that time, ought to have gone down the tunnel)—has he explained to you his neglect of duty, in not awakening me and reminding me of mine? But my Lord and Gentlemen, there is the messenger Craddock, a very respectable and steady officer, for what I know to the contrary, and he says he was on duty on Monday evening from five to eight o'clock, and no such letters came through the tunnel—suppose, as might be the case, that I overlooked them at the moment for the night, and that I put them into the tunnel next morning—I do not say that this was the case—I do not, I cannot, pretend to have any recollection of it; but can you believe me guilty of purloining such sums?—is not the smallness of their amount a proof of my innocence instead of my guilt? Gentlemen, need I further trespass on you concerning the present charge—I am convinced I need not—I almost think I hear you saying to each other, "Can it be possible that this man, who is in the receipt of £500 a year—can it be possible that such an indivi<lb></lb>dual could have hazarded his situation for the paltry sum with which he is charged?" At all times, if I was in want of money, I could readily procure it from my friends—can you think that, I who have filled in society the station of a gentleman, a man of education; and estimating at no mean rate the blessings which attend those advantages, with a wife and five children—having the approbation of my constant friend, Mr. Henry Free<lb></lb>ling, the assistant secretary to the Post-office—I ask of you—I request—I desire—I implore you, Gentlemen, to look at these facts, and then, can you conceive it possible?—can you conceive it credible, (even put it is a lower grade of words)—that such a man as I now stand before you, after twenty-seven years of service, during which I trust I have been an honest servant of his Majesty—that I could be mad enough—that I could be such a fool as to put my myself—my character—my family—my existence, all in stake for the value of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 43, Wingate-street, Goswell-road—on 30th December, between 3 and 4 in the morning, I was awakened by the sound of footsteps—I lit a candle and proceeded to the bed-room door—in consequence of what my child said, who had been asleep on the sofa, I went down into the kitchen, and missed a coat—the table was upset, and some clothes were strewn about—I found a candlestick in the garden, which had been safe the same evening—I opened the street-door in my night-shirt, went out' for a policeman, brought one in, and showed him the kitchen—he entered the garden, and proceeded over the wall to No. 44—I then left and went into the house—another constable came in at No. 44, and one was at the front and another at the back—I went to the front of No. 44, and saw the police bring the prisoner out—I saw an overcoat of mine at the station—the door was bolted over night, and the window closed.</p>

The prosecutor called me to Wingate-street at a quarter to 3 in the morning—I found the back entrance open—I found a candlestick on the wall, so 1 got over to the back of No. 44, and found the back door open—I went in and tried every door—when I opened one floor a man came out, and said, "What are you doing here?"—I said, "Why!</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 109). I was on duty in Goswell-road, and was called to 44, Wingate-street, and found Cook in the passage—we went up to the prisoner's room—he was awake, and as if he had just got into bed—we asked him what he did with these things—he said, "I do not know"—we took the great coat, and he said that it was his—we found some more concealed under his bedding and partly under some old drawers—he said that he did not know anything about them—we told him to dress himself, and he said that there were two men on the roof of the house who had led him into it—I examined the roof; it was impossible for any one to get on to it from his window—I tried to get out, but it was impossible. The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was, that he met two men who asked him to let them go through his batch garden to the water-closet, which he did, and they got over Mr. Blazeys wall, upon which he said that he should get out of it, and had been up stairs three quarters of an hour when they came, and threw a lot of clothes on the floor and then got out on the tiles, saying, "If you get took and you round on us, you shall have it."</p>

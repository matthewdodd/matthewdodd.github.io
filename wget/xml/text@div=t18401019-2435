                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Chelsea. On the 31st of August, 1 heard a disturbance in Exeter-buildings—I went there and saw a great number of men making a disturbance, and fighting—I saw the prisoner there, and James Quinn—I did not know them before—I saw the prisoner fighting with a lot of others, and when the fight was over his brother was fighting with two or three more men, and the prisoner threw a stone or brick at him; whether he meant to throw it at him, I do not know, but it hit him on the head—there were two or three more near him, fighting all together—the prisoner was jumping about with his arms up—I could not understand what he said—there was a great disturbance—James Quin put his hand up to his head when the stone was thrown, and fell down—the prisoner was four or five yards from him—I could not tell whether they were drunk or sober—some were drunk—the beginning of it was the prisoner wanting a man named Jerry Hayes, to come out of a house, and when he came out they commenced fighting—the deceased was taken into a house—I afterwards saw him dead, and saw his body at the inquest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at Brompton. I heard the disturbance in Exeter-buildings—I went and saw the prisoner, whom I have known four years, and his brother James also—I saw a lot of them fighting—after the fight was calmed a little, James and John came towards the top of the court—another man came up to James, and said, "Do you know me?" calling him by his name—James said, "Yes," and made a strike at him, which the other man warded off—they directly closed, and got fighting—the prisoner stood by the side of them, three or four yards off, and heaved a stone with his right hand, and at his brother was fighting with the other one, they turned round, and the stone caught James on the side of his head—the prisoner turned round, ran into a house oppo<lb></lb>site, and shut the door—I believe the Quins are bricklayers, labourers—the stone was thrown at one, I cannot tell which—I did not see him pick it op—I saw it in his hand—when I went down there was a great many of them fighting, seemingly most upon one person—I do not know who—the prisoner and his brother were both there at that time, and seemed both of one party.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live at Chelsea. I know both the Quins—James lived near Exeter-buildings—I was standing at my own door, between six and seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another party going down the street, jumping and making violent gestures, throwing their arms about—the prisoner was a little the worse for liquor, but not much—they went into the buildings, and I followed—there were two distinct parties—the two Quins were of the same party—<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Hayes's party was in a house Higher up the buildings—Quin's party challenged the others to come out, Hayes's party came out, and each party began to fight indiscriminately—Quin's party had the best of the fight—they were fighting with any weapons they could get hold of, stones, fists, or kicking, any thing to injure one another—Hayes's party was driven into the house—one man was left, who did not go in—he was on Hayes's side—James Quin and that man said some<lb></lb>thing to one another, and immediately began to fight—the prisoner was standing behind his brother, with a stone in his hand—I have no doubt but what he threw it at the opposite party; but just as the stone went out of His hand, the men shifted their position, and the stone took effect on his brother's head—there were plenty of stones and brickbats lying on the ground—James was about the soberest of the party, and did not appear to be hurt by any thing before—he fell down directly the stone hit him, and was taken in to No. 11—the stone was about the size of a half-pint mug—it was rather a flat piece of paving-stove—some of the party had been going to Ireland that day, and they generally have a drinking <hi rend="italic">bout</hi> on such occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's-hospital. I saw the deceased there on Thursday, the 3rd of September—he had a compound fracture of the skull on the right side—the bone was depressed—the operation of trephine was performed, and the bone removed—he was very little relieved by the operation—on Friday the symptoms still continued—I considered him in a dangerous state—on Saturday, on making a more minute examination, another portion of the bone was re<lb></lb>moved, and a piece of stone was found underneath the skull, about the size of a hazel-nut—it was between the skull and the <hi rend="italic">dura</hi> master—he never rallied, but got gradually worse, and died on Monday morning, about eight o'clock—I afterwards examined his body—I think his death was caused by inflammation of the membrane of the brain, occasioned by the presence of some foreign body under the skull, probably the stone—but there was a portion of bone depressed as well—the stone must hare come through the skull from the wound—there was no other way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many days elapsed from the infliction of the injury till you saw the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the morning of the third day—I think the inflammation was actively going on when I first saw him—if medical assistance had been at band at the time the injury was inflicted, perhaps it would not have necessarily been mortal, but I think it was always very dangerous—I was informed by his wife that he was very weak, and she had been giving him beer, and he also went to his work the day after the accident, both of which were calculated to increase the in<lb></lb>flammation.</p>

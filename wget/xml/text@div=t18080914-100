             - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. State to the court what was the duty of the prisoner in that house in regard to his receiving of money - A. He was to bring the money into me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deal with the customers that came to the house - A. Yes, and then they pay it over to me; it is the general custom of people who have the goods; they receive the goods of him, and pay the money over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of receiving the money for goods - A. If there was no person in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. It I had come to the house and received glue, and paid for it, what must be done with the money - A. It must be brought in to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to that book, 27th July, and tell me whether he entered on the 27th of July, an hundred weight of glue sold to Messrs. Hiscock and co. - A. There is no mention of the article.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he give you any other entry - A. On the 28th of July there is an entry of ten gallons of train oil and one gallon, two pounds and a half, of neat's foot oil, sold to Messrs. Hiscock.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is an entry of a contract made by him, in which he had taken the money and delivered the goods - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner then frequently in the habit of selling goods and taking the money - A. If nobody else was in the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. It is your duty generally to receive - when you are not there the prisoner receives - A. When I am not there, there generally is another clerk. If there is no clerk there, of course he receives it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the other clerk here - A. I believe not; he was not at home on the 27th of July at half past two o'clock in the afternoon, because I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you dine - A. At two o'clock, or half past one; I stay about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are not there, is it not customary to put the money on the inkstand - A. No; I never found any laid on the desk, nor on the inkstand, since I have been in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person receives money, who has not the key of the place where the money is deposited, he would lay it down till you came in - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that could not have happened - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Was you in the house during the whole of the transaction with Messrs. Hiscock's porter - A. I was in and out; I never received the money for the glue that was paid to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. State to the court the duty of the prisoner as <rs id="t18080914-100-deflabel586" type="occupation">warehouseman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18080914-100-defend871 t18080914-100-deflabel586"></join> - A. If any body sends for goods to our house, it is his duty to deliver them and to give an account in the accompting house. If he receives any money he is to give it to Mr. Thompson, but the account of goods sold, he is to give it to any body in the acompting house. He was as clerk in our accompting house till I became very unsettled with a warehouseman; we then took him in as warehouseman; we took him in warehouseman from the very situation that Mr. Thompson now has.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible that he could be ignorant or the duty of your house - A. No, we took him in warehouseman, because he knew the whole duty of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any examination take place of the prisoner in the accompting house. did you threaten him or promise him any favour - A. We neither threatened him or promised him, we charged him with the fact; he at first denied it. It was in the middle of August that we apprehended him, he was examined by us on the Thursday, the day he was apprehended; we charged him with having taken the money for this hundred weight of glue, he denied it; in consequence of which I believe myself said, we had evidence and could prove the fact; he then stated that he had received the money, and hoped we would let him go, he would do any thing that we wished; he desired me to intercede with my father and not to prosecute him; my father said as he had sent for a constable he could not let it pass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Your warehouseman was authorised to bargain for goods and receive the money if they were paid for - A. He might receive the money; any person might receive money except the porters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was not he entrusted to receive money in your business to the greatest extent - A. I put him in the warehouse because I thought he was confidential.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen that if money was not brought in one day it was brought in afterwards - A. It was not allowed; if it had happened I certainly should have reprimanded them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Has this money ever been paid to you or to any of your firm - A. It has not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Has the money ever been offered to you or any of your servants - A. It has not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can only say, as I said before the sitting alderman, that I certainly did receive the money, and there I placed it, I believe I have witnesses in the court that will prove that the accompting house as been left for a long time in a day, if you will please to hear them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

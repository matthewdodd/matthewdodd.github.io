             sworn. - I am a Marshalman of the city of London: On the 10th of September I went to Plumb-tree-court with Watson and Myers, and saw them go into the house; I had the two Reads, Lawrence, Cartwright, Simpson, and Crabb with me; three of us stood at one end of the court, and three at the other; Watson and Myers staid about five or six minutes in the house, and on their coming out I took hold of Myers, who gave me two seven-shilling pieces; Watson gave me a paper with a shilling: we then went into the house, and up one-pair-of-stairs we saw Holden side into his seat, and take a piece of leather before him, as if he was at work; he had a knife in his hand cutting the leather, and there was a roll of scoweringpaper, which appeared as if it had been just used, with aqua-fortis, and likewise a piece of leather, with some cream of tartar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Shoemakers have two or three different forts of knives? - A. Yes, but at first I saw but one; on searching the room I found what is called a crooked knife, and three shillings and two sixpences, rather on one side of the room; I also found a sleeve of a coat, which I thought had been used to rub the money with.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Holden slid into his seat; don't you know he is a shoemaker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I see you produce some files; don't shoemakers use files to their lasts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And don't these poor sort of people use leather to clean their fire-irons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And as for cream of tartar, you know it is a very good thing if a person gets a little drop too much? - A. I know nothing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. The three shillings and sixpence you have produced, they seem to be good? - A. They may be.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there is aqua-fortis, have you ever smelt oil of vitriol? - A. I have, but saw no oil of vitriol; I am sure it is aqua-fortis.</p>

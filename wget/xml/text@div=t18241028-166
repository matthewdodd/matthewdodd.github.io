            . I am a constable. On the 14th of October, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I and Hesketh were in London-wall; I saw a confusion with some people, and a man crossing the road; I ran after him, and when I got hold of him, I saw the prisoner about thirty yards before me, walking with a kind of trunk under a gas light; I went and collared him, and asked what he had got there; he said nothing, and threw it down - I took him to the Mansion-house - Hesketh took another man, but he was discharged. I afterwards opened the box, it contained umbrellas, and a bill of parcels, which I have in my hand - in consequence of the direction on the case, I went to the White-Bear, Basinghall-street, and found that it had been lost from there; he was going in a direction from Fore-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman at the Great Northern Railway—on 1st December, about 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I went out with a van; a guard, named Stevens, went with me—I stopped the waggon at Dowgate-hill and took a parcel out to convey to College-hill, leaving Stevens in charge of the waggon—I was absent about four or five minutes—on coming towards the van I saw two men on the off side talking to Stevens, and the prisoner on the near side, with one foot on the spoke of the fore-wheel, and a parcel in his hand, which was inside the van, in the corner, when I left—I collared him, he struggled, and said, "I am a respectable man; you are drunk; let me go you scamp"—I said, "It looks like a respectable man to steal a parcel from a van"—I held him for five or ten minutes before a policeman came up, and there were then 300 or 400 people round, some calling out, "Let him go you scamp," others calling out, "Stick to him <hi rend="italic">Great Northern</hi>"—the other two men ran down Cannon-street—I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the guards attached to the Great Nor<lb></lb>thern Railway—I went out with Chapman with the van on 1st December—we went to Cannon-street, and I stopped with the van in Dowgate-street, while he took a parcel to College-street—while ho was gone two men called me to the off side of the van, and asked me to direct them to Harrison-street—I did not see anybody on the other side of van then—I told them I did not know it—they then pointed towards the King William statue, and asked me if it was not up there—I said I did not know where it was—my attention was taken off for a minute, and when I looked round again I saw Chapman struggling with the prisoner—the parcel had been moved from where I had placed it—I know where I placed it—I did not see it in the prisoner's hands—the two men then crossed the road, and ran up towards the statue, as hard as ever they could go.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 448). I took the prisoner—the carman charged him with stealing a parcel off his van—the prisoner said that he was passing, saw the horse move, and put his hand up to the parcel to save it from falling on his head—he gave me an address 28, Charles-street, Regent-street, Piccadilly—I went there the same morning, and found it to be false—it is a gentleman's residence.</p>

               <p>were some people trying to rescue him—he tried to throw me twice—when I loft the van, the parcel was lying on the inside rail of the van, resting on another parcel—there are two rails—when I saw it in the prisoner's hand, he had just lifted it from the van—it was not touching the van at all—he was in the act of leaving the van.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was passing along Cannon-street, and just as I got within about a yard from where this parcel was, on the edge of the van, the horse started suddenly, the parcel tilted over, and I just put up my hand and pushed it into the van; the carman came up and said I was trying to take the parcel; a gentleman there said, "He did not try to take it; he was only pushing it on to the van." The carman did not know which parcel it was till a gentleman told him; I don't think any jury can convict me on such evidence as this; if I had intended to steal that parcel, I should not take it off the van and then put it back again.</p>

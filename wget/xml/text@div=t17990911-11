             sworn. - I keep a warehouse at Charing-cross, where the coach comes. Cox, the coachman, brought me a bundle, and said, he had got a thief that had stole a bundle out of his coach. He had got the prisoner with him and the bundle; it was in a white cotton-handkerchief; I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner talk English to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In such a way that you could understand him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it explained to the prisoner what the charge was? - A. Yes, I explained it both going along and in the watch-house. He said in English, as plain as I could speak almost, that he found the bundle under the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the coachman, in the hearing of the prisoner, give an account how he had lost the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110024"></xptr>bundle? - A. Yes, he said he had stolen Mr. Lingham's bundle out of the coach; the prisoner then said he had found it under the coach: the coachman said he had found it under his arm. I made answer, and said, if he had found it under the coach, it must have been very dirty; but it was as clean as it could be Mr. Lingham took the bundle that night to his family at Greenwich, and brought it to Bow-street next morning.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lingham.) Did you take the bundle to Greenwich that evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you had the things ever since? - A.No, I had them; but they have been in the hands of the Greenwich coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them to be your's? - A. Yes, they have my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Lingham.) The coachman is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, whether the coachman might not have given him the bundle, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was sort of an evening was it? - A. Very dirty; if the handkerchief had fell in the street, it must inevitably have been very dirty.</p>

             sworn. - I drive a hackney-coach: I was sitting upon my box, and saw the prisoner viewing the coaches, there were three Greenwich coaches; he crossed over between them, and about two minutes after I saw him come round the coaches upon the street-side: he opened the door of one of them, threw his body in, and reached the bundle out; the coachman was at the wheel of the coach, on the other side, at the same time; and I told the coachman of it, and he took it from him; he took the man by the collar, and he said he had picked it up in the street; the coachman delivered him to the book-keeper, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a coachman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it this was at noon-day? - A No, just before nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been dark then? - A. No, it was not; it was the 5th of July.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not the 5th of August? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lingham. It was the 5th of August.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it not past ten? - A. No, it was not past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness here before? - A. If I have not here, I have elsewhere, before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You was never prosecuted yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many informations have you lodged before Magistrates? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been before a Magistrate except on this occasion? - A. Very likely I may be there before a week is out; sometimes people will not pay, and then we are obliged, and sometimes we charge too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been in a gentleman's service? - A. Yes, Mr. Vaughan's, the tanner, over the water.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he turn you away for? - A. I turned myself away.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lingham.) What time of night was this? - A.Within five minutes of nine; and it could not be above ten minutes past nine when he took me up in Parliament-street.</p>

             sworn. - I am coachman of the Greenwich-stage.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - did you ever see him before? - A. Yes; the first time of my seeing him was at Charing-cross, on Monday night the 5th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Gould, the hackney-coachman, there? - A. Yes; Mr. Lingham came and gave me a bundle in a cotton handkerchief, I put it into the coach, upon the seat, and shut the windows up on both sides, there was nobody in the coach at all; about two or three minutes afterwards Gould came round to me, and asked me if I belonged to that coach; I told him yes, I did; he pointed to the prisoner, and said, that man had taken a bundle; I cannot say whether he heard him or not, he was nigh enough to hear him; he was on the other side of the coach, and I ran underneath the horses and caught hold of him; I said, holloa, my friend, where did you get this parcel; he made no answer; I opened the coach door, and missed the parcel; I then looked at it, and found it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say to this? - A. He said something, but I could not understand what he said; I called for a watchman, but could not get one; I took the bundle, and gave it to Mr. Lingham, in Parliament-street; I delivered the prisoner to Mr. Strickland, and he was carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Lingham.) Are the articles you have produced the same you had from the coachman? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. In going by, I saw a bundle, and picked it up.</p>

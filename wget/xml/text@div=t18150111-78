            . I live with Mr. Reeve, junior, in St. Paul's Church-yard. I was seventeen years of old last June.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch, seal, and key, at any time - Q. Yes, on Wednesday, the 28th of December, I was under <placeName id="t18150111-78-crimeloc446">Temple Bar</placeName>

As I was going under the bar, the prisoner and another man hustled me; the prisoner came behind me; the prisoner held me while the other man snatched my watch.</p>

            Now, do you know whereabouts you where when the watch was taken from you - A, I was about in the middle of the passage under Temple Bar; I am sure the prisoner was the man that held me while the other man took the watch; after the other man took the watch away, I cried stop thief. The prisoner held me, he got me into the middle of the road, because I should not run after the other man, I struggled with him until he got me into the middle of the road, I then saw his face plainly: he knocked me down, he threw me down in the middle of Picket-street, on St. Clement's Church side; he ran away; I got up and ran after him, until he got into a crowd of a few people, and a watchman, when I got up to him; I got up to him for a moment, I cried stop thief all the way I run; I am quite sure the prisoner is the person, I charged the watchman with him, and when I came up to him the prisoner charged Mr. Bennet. I could not swear to the other person; Mr. Bennet was dressed something like the other man; the other man was running towards St. Clement's Church. The prisoner gave charge of Mr. Bennet as the man who had taken the watch. I gave charge of the prisoner; I have never seen the watch again. I said the prisoner was the man that held me while the other man took my watch.</p>

            . I live at 24, Wood-street; I am a wholesale hosier. The prisoner gave charge of me on coming from the Strand; I was within six yards of Temple Bar; when I first saw the prisoner the prisoner had fast hold of a youth, round the body of the boy; the other man made a snatch at the prosecutor's watch, he ran away; I saw him make a snatch, I ran after the man whom I supposed had taken the watch, I saw him only make a snatch, I did not actually see him take the watch. I thought he had robbed him, therefore I ran after him, I pursued that man as far as the second house in the Crescent, as far as St. Clement's Church. The prisoner came up to me; there was no watchman there at that time; the prisoner took hold of my collar, and with great violence threw me against the shutters; two watchman came up, he gave me in charge of one of the watchman as being the man who had robbed the youth; he then looked me in the face, and begged my pardon; the prosecutor came up, and said the prisoner had held him while the other man man robbed him, I then laid hold of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DOBEY. I am a watchman. I heard the cry of stop thief, I made up directly; the prisoner came up, and Mr. Bennett, I and another watchman took them both to the watchhouse. Day came up soon after, he said the prisoner held him while the other man robbed him.</p>

I lost this property on the 12th of May, from my box - I had seen them safe on the 10th; I called a Police-officer, and some of the things were found in the chimney of a lodger's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was the lodger you speak of? A. I do not know his name - I lodged with the prisoner; I remember sending the prisoner for some sugar of lead to make a lotion - whether I meant to drink it or not, has nothing to do with this; I did not drink it - she did not, exactly prevent me from drinking it; I had before this lived at Miss Reginald's, in Sloane-street, and at Mr. Gregory's - I left there because Mrs. Gregory said she wanted the lodgings for some one else; she did give another reason, but I am not obliged to say what - she turned me out for a fault she found with me; I lived in Sloane-street as cook -I did not go there to open my boxes till I went to fetch them away; the lady did not turn me out, saying I was a drunken strumpet - I left because I was ill; I did not see the mistress - she called to me, and said she was doubtful whether it was not a fever; that was the only reason I left - Mr. Gregory keeps the White Swan; I was there from the Sunday afternoon till the Thursday afternoon; I slept in the house every night - I did sleep one night in the watch-house, because I was taken by the Police.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270028"></xptr>Q. Did not you tell me that you slept from the Sunday till the Thursday at Mr. Gregory's? A. I misunderstood you, Sir; I was there from the Sunday till the Wednesday - I believe it was Thursday night I slept in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you were you not turned out of Mr. Gregory's? A. I am very sorry for it - I slept with Mrs. Varley at the prisoner's; I had her taken up, and she was discharged - the prisoner went out one morning to work while I was there; I was only there four days.</p>

The prosecutrix came to me on the 12th of May; I went to the prisoner, and searched the room in which the prosecutrix and Varley lodged; I found nothing there, but a man on the third floor called out for a Policeman - I went up, and he said he had seen a woman sitting between his bed and the fire-place that morning; I searched the chimney, and pulled down a bag, in which I found this property.</p>

            . I lodge at the prisoner's house. I was awoke at half-past three o'clock in the morning of yesterday fortnight; I saw a woman between the bed-foot and the fire-place, with nothing on but her petticoat; I said "What the d - I brought you there?" she held up her finger, and said, "Hush! Hush!" she went out, and staid at the door a few minutes; she then came in, and said Hush! she went down stairs; I afterwards heard the Police-man, and called him up - he looked up the chimney, and pulled down a little blue bag; I went down, and he asked if I could point out the woman - I said neither of the two I then saw were the woman; the prisoner was coming up stairs, and I said she was the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And this was found in the chimney in your room? A. Yes.</p>

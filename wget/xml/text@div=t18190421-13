On the 30th of March, about twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop, and wanted to match a piece of lace; Mr. Vipond was serving two customers at the time - we could not match the lace. I showed her some more; she put her silk handkerchief on the counter, and shook it several times, which made me suspect her. I took the lace-box away, and showed her several cards of lace, and one loose piece - she did not like them. I turned to get more, from the window, but kept my eye on her, and saw her take a piece of lace off the counter very quick, and put it into her shawl. I turned round, and missed the loose piece of lace. She said she would call some other day, and wanted to be going. She went to the door, and looked at something there. She kept moving her hand about her pocket; I thought she was putting it in, and let her go out, then took her by the arms, and brought her back. I sent for a constable, who came and searched her, but found nothing on her. The lace was produced by my brother, who said he found it where she stood. She bought a yard of edging, which came to 3 1/2 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long was she in the shop - A. About a quarter of an hour. I held her hands down, to prevent her throwing any thing away while I had got her.</p>

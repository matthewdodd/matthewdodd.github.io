On the 6th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I was in Great Garden-street, Whitechapel-road, on my way home. The prisoner introduced himself to me, and asked me how far I was going? I told him I was going down the road. He said he was going that way, and was fatigued, having been up all night at Ascot Races, and wanted to get home - He sometimes kept close to me.

I called out stop thief! and ran after him, the watchman stopped him. I came up at the same moment. While he was going to the watch-house, I saw him drop the spoon. The watchman told me to pick it up.</p>

On the 6th of June, about one o'clock in the morning, I heard the cry of stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me - I stopped him-Brown was within five or six yards of me, he gave him in charge. I saw the prisoner's hand in his pocket, and heard the spoon drop on the pavement immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Brown was sober.</p>

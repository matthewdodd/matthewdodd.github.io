            . I am porter to Mr. Sutcliffe. On the 13th of March, 1813, I locked up the warehouse on Saturday night; I left the warehouse about six o'clock at night. On Monday morning the 15th, I returned to the warehouse about half past eight in the morning, I found the warehouse door opened; I went into the warehouse, and saw ten pieces of cloth gone. I was in the warehouse when Harrison, the constable, came to me, and asked me if I had lost any pieces of cloth, he said if I would go with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300023"></xptr>him he would shew me where it was gone to. I went to a baker's shop in Grub-street, and in the one pair of stairs room there were Williams, Holmes, Hands, and the prisoner now at the bar, all four in the room; Harrison and me entered the room; Williams opened the window, and jumped out; Murphy followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Murphy - A. Yes; I ran down stairs, and ran after Williams up Grub-street, and down a court, Williams fell down, and before he could get up again, I catched him; I got hold of the prisoner Williams; Murphy came past me in the court. I brought Williams back to the house, where I found the cloth. The other man escaped. Then Williams said he knew nothing about it. The property was secured afterwards. That is all I know about it.</p>




               <p>Q. What were they doing with the cloth - A. Cutting it up; here are the ends here that they cut off. I know it was my master's property; it was worth about one hundred and forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Upon your oath sir, did you say whether you knew any of the other persons upon the last trial, when you was asked, did not you say no - A. I cannot say whether I said no or not; I rather think I did not say no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know Williams before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not know Murphy was one of them at that time, you did not say any thing about him - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago, 15th of March, 1813, next March it will be two years - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time had you of observing the prisoner; you had never seen him before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So you mean to sware to the prisoner, you never having seen him before - A. Yes, because I saw him in the room, and I saw him afterwards.</p>

            . I am a porter. On Monday morning, the 15th of March, I was in Basinghall-street between eight and nine o'clock, I opened my employers warehouse, Mr. Yatherd and sons, it is near Mr. Sutcliffe's. I saw four men loitering about the street; I saw Holmes and Williams standing opposite of the warehouse where I live in discourse together, there were two more with them, but them two I could not get a clear sight of that; I cannot swear to either of them; the other two Holmes and Williams I did swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - A. I cannot speak to him. I saw Holmes with a blue great coat on; I saw Holmes pull the great coat off his back, and another man put it on; the man that put the great coat on was the man that first went into the warehouse; he came out with the cloth upon his shoulder; Holmes followed that man, and brought out cloth likewise; another man went in, a third; the fourth man went in while Williams he came out, and did not bring any cloth, Williams did not. The man that put the great coat on, had returned with the great coat off; he went in again, and brought out another piece of cloth. Harrison took the great coat in the room they went up afterwards, and he left the great coat in the room. They then left the street; I saw Harrison coming up the street; I called him over, and spoke to him; I told him that Mr. Sutcliffe's warehouse had been robbed. He went and found it had. Harrison went up into the room in Grub-street; he took Williams and

            . Holmes was taken shortly after; I knew him.</p>
               <p>- ELKIN. I am a painter; I lived in Grub-street on the morning of the robbery. On Saturday, the 15th of March, I saw two men carrying cloth from Basinghall-street to Moor-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men - A. There were four to the best of my remembrance. I followed them after they passed me; they seemed to be in a great bustle; they went into a house in Grub-street, where they took some of the cloth in; the men carrying the cloth were Williams, Holmes, and Gale.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - A. That is not the man Gale that I saw went into this house. Before I went into the house, I went to Harrison, he was not up; he said, he would come presently. I said, it was a business of consequence, you must come directly. Harrison got up, went with me; I shewed him the house, where the property was, and he went into Basinghall-street. Then we came back to the house in Grub-street; Harrison went first into the house in Grub-street, and Brooks; by the time I got up stairs two men jumped out of the window; Brooks ran down stairs, and I followed after him; we took Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know Stiles's name - A. I knew him by being at the house where I live; he did live in the same house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that house - A. No length of time, more than a week, not so much as a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know his person - A. I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is not the prisoner the man - A. No; the man that jumped out of the window was a taller man.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw with the cloth one of them lodged in your house, that was Gale - A. Yes; that was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw on the 15th of March in company with Williams, was a man of the name of Gale, who lodged in the same house with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where did you both lodge - A. I lodged at the upper part of the house No. 16, Butler's-alley, in Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your landlord's name - A. Guillim; he keeps the Weavers Arms; the house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of March, did Gale lodge in that house - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, do you mean to say the prisoner is not the man that lodged in that house - A. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that man well - A. Yes, I know him well if I was to see him; when I came into the room up stairs in Grub-street, one of them had jumped out, and the other was in the act of jumping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300024"></xptr>out when I went into the room, and therefore I am sure the prisoner is not the man; the shop where these people was found was a baker's shop.</p>

There were five in the room altogether. I laid hold of Williams; he pushed me from him, he jumped out of the window, and the prisoner Murphy followed him. Murphy is his right name. I cried out stop thief, and laid hold of Hands.

             ran out of the room, pursued, and in a little time he brought Williams back into the room. I searched the room; I found nine pieces of cloth in the room by the side of the bed; under the shop-board I found some paper and some string; and under the bed, between the mattras and the sacking of the bed, I found these pieces that had been cut off, and two great coats. I secured them; and on April the 7th, I apprehended Holmes. In April sessions, they were tried and convicted, and Murphy stood indicted. Holmes, Williams, and Hands, were tried together, and Murphy stood indicted. On Tuesday the 25th of October, I met the prisoner in company with a man of the name of Hunt, in Rose-lane, Spitalfields. I said to Hunt, how are you? The prisoner ran down Rose-lane, I ran after him. I said halloo, Jack, is that you; he said my name is not Jack; Johnson was with me. We took him in custody; he is the man that stood indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that man you saw in the room is the prisoner at the bar - A. I am sure of it; I knew him before; he is a known thief. I am sure he is the man that was in the room; he has been to India since he lodged in Butler's-alley where the last witness stated. I am sure of him; I know the man well; people have been to me, offering me money to put it on one side. I have kept these pieces ever since; the whole of the property I gave up to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You said not one word about Murphy in the last trial. - A. I kept the secret to myself. I have looked for Murphy since,</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen him since - A. Not to my knowledge, if I had I should have known him before.</p>

            . Look at your property; - A. These were cut off the ends of the pieces; I measured them over and compared them; they agree with the original length of the pieces, I had the care of the goods; I was agent and salesman; I had them in my custody; the proprietors are in Yorkshire; these were all the ends of the goods; the value was about one hundred and forty pounds,</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent of it as a child; I declare I know nothing at all about it. At the time this robbery was committed, I was on board an East Indiaman. I cannot say it was at the time, it was either before or after I was on board the Carnatic. When I returned home I heard I was indicted; I have seen the gentleman that took me in some of the public houses, and drank out of the same pot with him. He says I run away, he took hold of me by the collar, and called me Murphy; he said I was his prisoner, I went along with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Leather-lane. On Sunday, the 28th of May, about one o'clock in the night, the prisoner came and said there was a man stabbed in Dorrington-street, and pressed me to come immediately—he was crying—I went with him, and found a man at No. 5, Dorrington-street—he was dying—he was wounded in the thigh—there was a great quantity of blood—it was a stap of the same</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I heard of this accident, and was requested to go there by the officer on duty, a little after three o'clock in the morning—I found the deceased quite dead, lying on a sack of straw in the kitchen—he was a young man about twenty-four or twenty-five years of age—I examined his wound, it was in the lower part of his thigh, partly in the front—it had cut one of the arteries—I examined it with my finger, and found it was about three inches deep—it had divided the femoral✗ artery, vein accompanying it—I have not a doubt of that being the cause of his death—there was also an unimportant wound on the palm of his hand—it was a cut which such a knife as this would certainly occasion—the knife is bloody now.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, Dorrington-street. The prisoner and deceased were lodgers of mine—on Saturday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner, the deceased, and the other witness, left me in Laystall-street, they went and bought two pounds of steaks for their sup<lb></lb>per, and went home to my place to cook them—I returned home, and found the witness cooking them—the prisoner and deceased were then sitting quite comfortably in the kitchen—the deceased paid me 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one week's rent, and required the prisoner to pay me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he owed me, and did so—I went up and paid my landlord, and when I came down I found the prisoner and the deceased quarrelling—the prisoner the deceased he had no business to order him to pay me—the deceased struck him three or four blows over his face, and sat down—they were hard blows—the prisoner told him to keep his hands to himself—he said, "Why?"—the prisoner said, "Because, if you hit me again, I will <hi rend="italic">knife</hi> you"—the deceased got up and struck him, while he sat in his chair at table, having his supper—the prisoner then snatched a knife out of the plate, and got up—the deceased followed him, till he got him up in the corner of the room, and then hit him a blow and knocked him down—the prisoner had retreated—I asked the deceased to come away—he said, "No, I won't; d—his eyes, he has subbed me in the hand"—I immediately went to his assistance, when be turned round, and exclaimed that he was stabbed in the thigh, and asked me to fetch a doctor, for he was a dead man—the prisoner imme<lb></lb>diately said, "I will fetch a doctor," and ran out to fetch one—I went out, and saw a policeman in Brook-street—hecame with me to the door, and we found the prisoner and the doctor at the door—the deceased was a powerful man—he was about five feet six inches high, and twenty years of age.</p>

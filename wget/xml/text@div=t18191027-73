On the evening of the 27th of October I answered the prisoner's knock at the door - she informed me that she had engaged with my wife to become her servant - I let her in and questioned her. She said my wife had had a very good character with her. I said, as my wife was not in the way, it would be necessary that I should have some character of her; she said I should have one in the morning. I shewed her the kitchen, and told her she might remain that night, and if her character suited she might remain as our servant. In the course of half an hour I requested her to attend to the fire on the second floor, and sent my brother William to No. 17, Queen-street, Soho-square, to

My gold watch was in a pair of slippers, which were in my basket. I put the basket on the left side of the fire-place, on the ground, in the second floor. As the prisoner was coming up stairs with the candles Mr. Smith called me down; she had not got into the room before he called me - I was down stairs five or six minutes with him. I met the prisoner at the foot of the stairs as I went up - I am sure she did not come into the room while I was there. Mr. Smith went up with me, and in about five minutes I missed my watch - the slippers remained. Smith told me to go home and look for it, I did so, and told him not to permit her to leave until I returned. I found I had brought it, returned, and found the prisoner in the shop. I asked her for the watch, she said she had not got it. A constable was sent for - it was found about two hours afterwards. I was in the kitchen when it was found.</p>

             to my brother's - she lodged at my house - I returned home. Soon afterwards she came, and said she had lost her watch; I returned to my brother's with her and found the prisoner there. I got Pepper. I was in the shop, the prisoner stood by the cutting-board. I was left alone with her, and told her it was evident she had it, and if she gave it up it would be better. She fell on her knees, and begged I would do what I could for her - she picked it up from behind the chest and gave it to me. I called my brother and Harris up - Harris claimed it.</p>

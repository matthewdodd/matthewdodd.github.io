                  </hi> I am manager of the business of Mr. Frederick John Barnes, a gun-master. The prisoner was employed as a gun-stocker at the manufactory, in Queen-street, Tower-hill. On the 17th of March I received information, and found the stock-shed had been broken open, and nine stocks were missing—I went up into the workshop, and on the prisoner's bench i found this fore-end of a gun-stock, which I recognized as a portion of those we had had down stairs—this is a peculiar one, being made of maple-tree—they are generally walnut-tree—I went to the shop on Tower-hill, and saw the prisoner—I went to tell him, but he had been told of it, and expressed his surprise—I showed him these stocks—he said they did not belong to Mr. Barnes, he could find the owner of them—he went away, and did not return—I believe this property to be my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Paradise Walk, Chelsea—the prisoner is my husband—on the evening of the 25th May I came home from work about 11.15—I found my husband at home sitting in a chair against the fireplace—he was drunk—he would not have done it if he bad not been a little drunk—we had a few words, and he up with the knife and he came to the room door, and he touched me with the knife—he did not throw the knife—he struck me in the neck with the knife in his hand—I don't think he intended to do it—I called out "Police!" and a constable came in directly—I lost some blood—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in St. George's Road—I was called to attend the last witness on the morning of the 26th May—I found her saturated with blood and suffering from an incised wound in the left side of neck over the sterno mastoid muscle behind the angle of the lower jaw—it had bled considerably, but the bleeding had ceased when I saw her—it was over a dangerous region—as far as I could explore the wound with safety it was about half-an-inch in depth downwards and inwards, and and about three-quarters of an inch in length.</p>

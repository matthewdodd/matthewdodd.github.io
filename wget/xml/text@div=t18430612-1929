                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Armour, a cabinet-maker, we live in Old Cavendish-street—on Friday, the 21st of April, Vickers called at our house to look at some lodgings which she said she wanted for a family—she said a lady would arrive that evening, and the rest of the family on the Tues<lb></lb>day following, that she, herself, was the lady's maid—I showed her our apartments—it was then about three o'clock, and she went out in the afternoon and ordered goods, which were brought to the house by the trades people—she left at six o'clock, and said she was going to meet her mistress—she came back afterwards with another woman, whom I did not see till the next even<lb></lb>ing, and it turned out to be Manship—Vickers was up and down, or in attend<lb></lb>ance on what she called her mistress—on the Saturday evening the drawing room bell rang, and in the absence of Vickers, the maid, I answered it, and saw Manship in the room alone—she inquired for her maid, I told her she was absent, and I believed giving orders to trades people for the next day—I offered to send her any thing she wanted—she said she was alarmed about her maid being out so late in the evening, as she was perfectly unacquainted with London—(I think it was then about ten o'clock)—I said, if it would be any satisfaction to her to know that her maid was not alone, I had permitted my daughter to walk with her—on the following Tuesday Vickers left the kitchen about half-past three o'clock, saying she had to meet another part of the family, and about five o'clock that evening I found the prisoners were both gone—I missed a tea spoon, two India China plates, a water bottle, and a stopper for the ink stand—they were all my husband's, and were in the apartments let to the prisoners—they went up for their use when they required them—these are them.</p>

On 31st May, I was on doty in Leatherseller's-buildings, about half-past 5 in the morning.—I passed the prosecutor's shop, heard an unusual noise inside, put my hand against the door, and asked who was there—one of the prisoners answered from inside, "It is all right, we have come to work"—I said, "Open the door"—they did not do soz—I put my hand against it and pushed it a little open, so that I could see in a little—I saw Ormston sitting on a shoemaker's stool, and Lloyd standing behind the door—I could just see his boot—he had got his fiat against the door—I saw that it was he when I got in—I asked him to open the door again—I then heard one say to the other, "He thinks we are thieves, surely"—I got in and asked them who gave them authority to pome up—Dunston said, "It is all right; a man has been and let us in with a key"—I then sent for Mr. Draper, and took the prisoners to the station—I pulled Lloyd's boots off, and a half-crown dropped out of his trousers—there was no marks of violence on the door, it was only locked.</p>

I am a shoemaker—on 30th May at half-past 8 o'clock in the evening, I left my shop safe—I was the last person there—I locked the door from outside and took the key with me—the window was fastened with outside shutters which have a screw inside, which had not been <hi rend="italic">catched</hi>—the door had been unlocked somehow—there was no violence—I do not know the prisoners—I never gave them authority to go there—I saw some of my boobs and shoes, in a sack, which did not belong to me and some leather and tools—I missed two half-crowns and a penny from a little drawer which was not locked.</p>

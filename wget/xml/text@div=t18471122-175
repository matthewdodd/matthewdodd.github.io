                  </hi> I am foreman to Charles and James Heaton, Italian warehousemen. The prisoner was in their service—Wharf was their carman—I was called up in the morning, about half-past six o'clock, and saw the hamper, with Messrs. Heaton's goods in it—they had been in the cellar under the house before they were taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> A man who works for Messrs. Heaton asked me to carry the hamper; I said, "No," at first; he said I must come, he would give me a few shillings; I did so, as I had not got a coat, or a bit of bread.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

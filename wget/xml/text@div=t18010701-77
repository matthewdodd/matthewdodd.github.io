In my bed-room; I had seen the purse and the money that morning; I put into it, previous to going to dinner, four guineas and a half, or five guineas, but I think it was five guineas; there were in all nine guineas, ten half-guineas, and a two-guinea piece.(

             the Second's, 1740; I believe this to be the same, I have had it above a twelvemonth, and one of the half-guineas was a crooked one; upon perceiving that the escrutoire broke open I made enquiry among the servants.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CLUTTERBUCK sworn. - I am one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010068"></xptr>of the servants in Mr. Mestaers's family; my mistress gave an alarm among the servants by ringing the bell, in consequence of which Elizabeth Burgress and I went to search the house; I could not find any thing for some time, at last, in the front garret, I found the prisoner lying between the bed and the mattress, where nobody could see her, with one hand under her face and the other over, to keep the bed from smothering her; I took the prisoner out of the bed, and almost under her, by the side of her, I found a purse; I found also a broken carving-knife, which was under my care; she spoke to me and gave me the purse before I said a word to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure neither you or Burgess had said any thing to her? - A.Not a word; she said she was the wicked thief that had taken the purse.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe the escrutoire? - A. Yes; it had every appearance of being cut with a knife; the constable was sent for, and, by my mistress's direction, I placed the purse exactly where I had found it, that it might remain there till the constable came.</p>

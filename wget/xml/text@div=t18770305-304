                  </hi>. I am over seventy years of age—on 13th February I was in an upstairs room of No. 1, Upper Park Place, Dorset Square—there is a counting-house behind the shop—I heard a knocking, ran down without my hat, and saw the prisoner in the shop—he said "I have been knocking some time"—I said "It is a shame, and I am sorry for it; what is it you want?"—he said "Change for a sovereign, or two if you have it"—I said "I think I cannot, but if you will walk into the counting-house I will see" I—he followed me; I sat down at a desk, unlocked it, and took out a bag of silver—he put down some gold—I counted out 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and as I was getting the second pound I received a blow on the back of my head which stunned me, and when I came to myself I was on my back, and saw him taking the silver—he stepped over me and walked out—I called to my son, who ran after him—I saw some blood where I lay, and a 7 lb. weight, which had been at the end of the counter, was a few feet from where the prisoner had stood—I found a florin on the floor, and the canvas bag was gone—there was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, I do not know positively.</p>

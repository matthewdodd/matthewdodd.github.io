                  </hi>. I was an inspector of police, but I am now inspector of nuisances in Clerkenwell. I was present at the June Session, 1844, at this Court, when the prisoner was tried and sentenced to ten years' transportation. On Saturday, 24th Aug. last, I saw him in Leonard-street, near Leonard-square, Shoreditch—he was walking at large towards his residence—I took him into custody, and told him it was for running away from Western Australia—he said he was pardoned, and he could show me his ticket—I told him he must do so, but he must go first to the station—he then said it was that b—y rogue <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> that had <hi rend="italic">sold him</hi>—I produce a certificate of his conviction—(<hi rend="italic">read, Edward George Barrington, Convicted June, 1844, and ordered to be transported for ten years</hi>)—I saw Mr. Clark sign this paper.</p>

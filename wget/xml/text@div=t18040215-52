               <p>JOHN BROWN sworn. - On Tuesday, the 14th of February I was coming home, a little before nine, and saw the prisoner at the bar go and open my door, with a basket under his arm; I directly went in and asked my wife who that was; she said she did not know any body was there; I looked and saw the pots were gone; I ran after the prisoner, and caught him in Johnson's court; I asked what he had got there; he said nothing belonging to me; I took the basket down from his shoulder, and took hold of him, and said he must go with me to Mr. Smith's; he refused very much to go; and then Mr. Smith sent for a constable; I waited till the constable came; I marked the pots.</p>
               <p>(The constable produced the pots, which were identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going past, and took and opened the door, and put the pots in the basket; I was going to carry them to Mr. Smith; I told him I was going to carry them to Mr. Smith.</p>

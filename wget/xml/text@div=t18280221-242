            . I am the prosecutor's son. The prisoner goes about with a cart - I saw him at my father's stable door at Southall, on the 31st of December - he had this corn in a sack under some hay in his cart; I went up to him, and asked what business he had there - he said, he only came for a little rubbishing hay to make hands; we rent the stable of the person who keeps the Red Lion public-house: I made the prisoner turn out the hay, and when I saw the corn, I said, "What is here?" - he said,"I don't know;" I opened and found it was our mixtures, which we send up weekly - I compared it, and it matched exactly - it is an unusual mixture; I was on horseback: I do not know how long he had been in the cart - I missed some corn from my father's loft, where there were about forty bushels, which had been shot on the preceding day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But might not that have gone to feed your horses? A. It might - I cannot say how long his cart might have been there - there was some loose hay in it: I have not brought any of my father's mixture here, only a sample of what was found in the cart.</p>

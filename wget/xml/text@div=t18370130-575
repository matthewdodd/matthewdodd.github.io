I know where I took it in change," and he immediately put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and gave me a good one—he had taken the other from his fob—the moment I saw it was bad, I put it on a shelf under the counter—there was no other money there, I am certain—I gave him change for the good shilling—after he drank his gin, he held his hand over the counter, and said, "I want my shilling"—I said, "You will get no shilling of me, I never give bad money back again"—he was very insolent—I went round, and said, "I shall give you in charge"—I took up the shilling and went to the door, and called the police, and while I did that, he endeavoured to escape—I pushed him inside, and kept him till the officer came—I then marked the shilling, and gave it to Berry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to his Majesty's Mint, and have been so many years. These are both counterfeit shillings in all respects—they are made of Britannia metal, and cast from a die produced by a good shilling—these are not from the same mould (the moulds are made of plaster of Paris) when they get dirty, they appear like old silver that has been in circulation.</p>

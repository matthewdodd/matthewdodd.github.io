                  </hi>. I am shopman to Charles Mills, a leather seller, in the Kingsland-road. In the forenoon of the 7th of October, the prisoner came into the shop—after he had looked out a portion of leather, he asked to look at some fronts—I showed him these, and some others—I saw him put these into his pocket—he had an old boot in his hand—he placed it on the leather he had looked out, and said he would call for them as he came back—as he was going out of the door I accused him of stealing those he had in his pocket—he said, "I am <hi rend="italic">done"</hi> took them out of his pocket, and gave them up to my employer—these are the fronts—they are my master's—the prisoner did not pay for the leather he had looked oat.</p>

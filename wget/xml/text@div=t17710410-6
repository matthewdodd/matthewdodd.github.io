            . On the twenty-third of February, about twelve at night, I met the prisoner in Holborn; she picked me up; I was going to see a friend: it was near the Bull and Gate. She took me to a house of bad fame in <placeName id="t17710410-6-crimeloc33">Church-lane, St. Giles's</placeName>

We had something to drink before we got there; but I cannot tell what house. She stole my watch there. I had my watch and money when I went to bed,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other woman in the house?</p>
               <p>Foreman. Yes; two or three: there was another bed in the room we were in; a man and a woman laid in that.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose those were not women of the first character, but of the same stamp yours were of?</p>
               <p>Foreman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your watch and money?</p>
               <p>Foreman. About six or seven in the morning; it was day light. On the fifteenth of March, I found the prisoner in a house in Drury-lane; she owned the whole fact to me and the watchman; the watchman is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her to induce her to make that acknowledgment? Did you promise her any favour?</p>
               <p>Foreman. Yes, I told her I did not want to prosecute her: then she confessed it.</p>
               <p>Court. The whole of the evidence depends upon her confession, made under a promise of favour, which cannot be allowed.</p>

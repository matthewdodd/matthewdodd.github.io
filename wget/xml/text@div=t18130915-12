On the 17th of July I was in my warehouse at four o'clock in the morning. I put four crown papers of halfpence upon a desk that I had in the accompting house. After I had put them there I took one paper away; I went out and locked my accompting-house door. I went to another warehouse that I have; that warehouse is opposite of my accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out of that warehouse did you go to your accompting-house - A. I did, directly. I saw the prisoner and a woman looking into my accompting-house; they were looking in at the front window; the halfpence were on the desk, near to the accompting-house door. When I returned to my accompting-house I found one paper of halfpence taken away. There were but two left. The prisoner was close by. I detained the prisoner; the woman escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any halfpence upon the prisoner - A. No.</p>

            . I live opposite of Mr. Galloway's warehouse, in the market. On the 17th I saw him put his hand through a broken pane in the accompting-house and take out a brown paper parcel. I saw the paper parcel in his hand; he gave it to a woman in a red cloak. I went and told Mr. Galloway; he took the prisoner; the woman went off.</p>

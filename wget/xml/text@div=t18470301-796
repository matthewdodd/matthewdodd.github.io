                  </hi>. I live at Barnett-grove, in the parish of Bethnal-green—I keep pigeons in the loft at the top of my house. On the 18th of Feb., at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I had eighteen pigeons safe there—next morning, at seven o'clock, I found six tiles had been taken off the roof, and sixteen pigeons were gone—on the Friday morning I found six of them in Mr. Pellet's possession.</p>

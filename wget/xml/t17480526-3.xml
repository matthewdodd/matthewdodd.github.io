               <p>Q. Do you know the plates to be Mr. Smith's?</p>
               <p>Collins. As to this plate I am very sure, because it was my mother's when she was a widow; and as to the others, I do believe them to be our plates, for we have others of the same mark now; we bought them at a sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>

               <p>Collins . She was our servant.</p>

               <p>Collins . The Monday after the fire .</p>

               <p>Q. How came she to go then?</p>
               <p>Collins. Because we thought she was not honest: we turned her away on suspicion, before the things were found; we found them at Mr. Worral's, a pawn-broker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Glover . I am a lodger at Mr. Smith's; the Prisoner was suspected of being dishonest; I had missed some of my own things, and went to enquire after them, and these plates were at Mr. Worral's , and I heard the Prisoner say, that she took them out of Mr. Smith's house, and pawned them at Mr. Worral's.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Worral. In Houndsditch. I have known the Prisoner seven or eight years, and I have taken things in of her several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ever a house-keeper in that time?</p>
               <p>Worral. No: I knew her as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take these things in all together?</p>
               <p>Worral . Yes: I took the plates and sheet in all together. Mr. Glover came to me to enquire for a shirt, and some other things, and I brought these plates down without being asked for them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Glover. Have you paid the money for these things?</p>
               <p>Glover . Yes, I have; because Mr. Worral was so very civil as to bring them down without their being asked for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Pray, Miss , did not my mistress say, she did not know all her plates?</p>
               <p>Collins. She did not know them all.</p>

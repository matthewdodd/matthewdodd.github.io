               <p>"I carry on business as a stationer, at 5, Edgware Road. I know the prisoner Enever, and have done so for nine or ten months. I was anxious to dispose of my business; the prisoner Henderson introduced himself to me, and wanted to buy the business; this was from three to four weeks ago; a few days before the 29th I saw Enever speak to Henderson in the shop, and so I knew that they were acquainted; this was after Henderson had proposed to buy the business of me. It was arranged between us that Henderson should have possession of the shop, and that an agreement should be signed between us on payment to me of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Henderson, on account of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was arranged that the money should be paid on the 23rd August. The agreement was signed. On 23rd August the prisoner Hender<lb></lb>son came to me, but he did not pay me the money. The two prisoners and myself had drunk together after I had seen the prisoners speaking to each other in the shop. Between the 23rd and the 28th, Henderson made excuses for not paying the money—on the 28th, in the morning, Henderson and I were in the New Inn public-house, Edgware Road. He asked me if he might have some goods brought in on the Tuesday, the 29th; I said 'Yes,' believing he was going to have the business; he said that the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be ready in a day or two. On the afternoon of the 29th, some skins of leather and bundles of paper-hangings arrived at the shop; these goods</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200049"></xptr>
               <p>might be worth from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The goods came at different times, and apparently from different places. After some of the goods came, I saw the prisoners together in the shop. In the evening, at 9.45, I shut up the shop, and went to have a glass of ale with both the prisoners. A few minutes after I parted from the prisoners, from what I was told, I asked Mr. Barnes to go back, and stop in the shop all night. About 2 o'clock next morning I was at the police-station, and I there saw the skins of leather, some silver-plated articles, some pipes, 14 packets of note-paper, 3 boxes of envelopes, 36 lead pencils, and 12 quill pens. I identify the note-paper, envelopes, pencils, pens, and 2 books, and 2 packs of cards, as my property. The prisoners had no right to take these things. I had given the prisoners no authority to come to my shop at night The articles which are mine are worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Enever came first to the shop as a customer; he occasionally bought a newspaper. Enever came into the shop in the afternoon of the 29th, but made no purchases; he did not say in the evening that he had bought plate-powder in the afternoon. I was in an inner room of the shop when the goods were delivered. I had nothing to do whatever with the ordering or obtaining of the goods. I have misted a latch-key; the key produced is it, to the best of my belief; I did not lend it to Henderson at any time, or authorise them to have it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Bravery, a baker at Sydenham. On the 12th of Dec, at night, I heard somebody in the yard—I went up stairs to the window and saw the prisoner walking in the yard—I saw him carry a pail towards the gate, which was not locked—he went out at the gate—I immediately went down stairs, took a candle and two men with me, and from the yard missed two pails—I went up stairs again, looked out of window and saw him come again—he stepped over the wheelbarrow and felt the bakehouse window and door, and was apparently walking away—I came down stairs and told the men who were in the house who it was—I took them into the bake-house—I sent for a policeman—I knew the prisoner well before; we took the business of him—it was a very moonlight night—we found the wheelbarrow in Mr. Scudder's shed—the prisoner lodged there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you related to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My husband is to his wife—we took the business of the prisoner and a Miss Peters—she is his step-daughter—I believe the business hat been paid for—money passed between my husband and Peters—I do not know what my husband has done—an action was brought against him for the amount, and the Sheriff was in possession of the goods at that time, at the suit of Miss Peters, the prisoner's partner—it was the sheriffs officer I went down to—it was not a foggy night, but perfectly clear—I saw the prisoner twice in the yard—there was about ten minutes between each time—the barrow had belonged to the prisoner—I was examined before the Magistrate, and this is my signature to this deposition—I will swear I told the Magistrate I saw the prisoner twice—my deposition was read over to me (<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read, omitted to state that she had seen the prisoner twice in the yard</hi>)—I saw him twice and said so to the Magistrate—it was from half-past ten to eleven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mr. Bravery's. On the night of the 12th of Dec. I was in master's yard, and met with the prisoner—he was leaning his head against the side door of the house, leading into the sitting-room, apparently listening—he addressed me as Robert, and asked if I could give him a lucifor to light his pipe, he said he was making a <hi rend="italic">jolly spree of it</hi>—he was on the pre<lb></lb>mises full ten minutes—he did not appear in the least afraid of my seeing him—I saw him talking to the sheriff's officer afterwards—the two sheriff's officers, Mrs. Bravery, and Mr. Bravery's sister Mary, were in the place where he appeared to be listening, and he said, "What a <hi rend="italic">jolly spree, Bob!"</hi>—I did not know what he alluded to—the yard is not common to any other premises, it opens into the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184512150118"></xptr>
               <p>road—the shed in which the wheelbarrow was found is about ten yards from the bakehouse—it was a shed belonging to Mr. Scudder, of the Woodman public-house, in Pinalley, where the prisoner was lodging—about twenty yards from our yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it not 100 or 200 yards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have not seen the sheriffs officers since this affair—not Mr. Morris, I have seen the other officer—I have had no conversation with him about this affair—I never said a word about it—I did not go to him—I have passed conversation with him in the house—we have not talked about this affair particularly—we have spoken a word or two about it—I have not said it would be a good job for me—I believe 1 said this morning that if I got paid for my trouble I would bay myself a Sunday hat—I said so to the sheriff's officer—he told me to be care<lb></lb>full and say no more than 1 could help, to be careful what I said, and I then said no more about it—I believe he added, "Or else you will get six months' imprisonment"—he laughed and told me to be careful—I believe he said I was to be careful, or I should be liable to get six months' imprisonment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why about the hat I suppose—Mr. Bravery's sister was in the sitting-room with my mistress, at the time the prisoner was there, he was talking to the sheriff's officer—it was about half-past nine o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 290.) In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion from Mrs. Bravery, I went on the 12th of Dec, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, to the Woodman, within twenty yards of her pre<lb></lb>mises—I found three pails there, in Pin-alley, and the wheelbarrow in the shed adjoining—the roll of tin was behind the pails, up against the boards—when the prisoner came down stairs, I asked him if it was his property, or if he knew anything about it—he said no—I told Mm Mrs. Bravery charged him with stealing it—he said he knew nothing about it—I then took him to Mrs. Bravery, and asked if he was the person—she said he was—there are no other witnesses here.</p>

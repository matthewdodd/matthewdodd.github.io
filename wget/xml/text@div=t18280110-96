On the 24th of December was at the King's Arms public-house - I came to the door about twelve o'clock at night; the door was shut against me - I tried to get in again; the prisoner came up to the door, and wanted to go in also - I did not know him before; they would not open the door - I said I should go - I turned round, and the prisoner snatched my watch out of my fob, and ran away - I pursued him to the Quadrant, about one hundred yards, and never lost sight of him - I called Stop thief! and the watchman stopped him - I ran with such force, that I fell over him; they took us both to the watch-house. The patrol found my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did you go the public-house? A. About seven o'clock - I was eating and drinking there - I was not turned out; they wanted to get us out - I had not paid my score - I was quite sober - I drank nothing but ale - I could not have drank two quarts - I was not so sober as if I had drank nothing - I was not even what is called fresh; we were both on the ground when the watchman came up - I might be a little fresh - I cannot tell whether the prisoner was drunk.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner, calling "Stop that man, he has stolen my watch" - I jumped out into the road, and crossed to the prisoner - he fell, and the prosecutor fell over him; the prosecutor was collected, or he could not have run so fast; the prisoner appeared drunk, when he was taken up, but he ran well; the watch was brought to the watch-house; it happened near the Quadrant, in Regent-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is that from the King's Arms? A. I suppose about one hundred yards; the prisoner seemed drunk at the watch-house; the prosecutor did not appear so in the least; the prisoner had a bottle of gin in his pocket.</p>

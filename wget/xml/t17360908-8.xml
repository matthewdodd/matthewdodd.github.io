I had him cry'd at St. Ives, and 2 or 3 other Places, and at last this next Witness Mr. Unwin gave me Information of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Unwin. I live in Well-street, near Well-Close-Square. The Prisoner came to me the Sunday after the Horse was lost, about 3 or 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and told me he had got 2 Horses, but as one was enough for his Business, he would dispose of the other. One of them was sit for a Saddle or a Chaise: I said, I wanted such a one, and he brought this wan Gelding to me on the Tuesday following, and told me he was worth 5 or 6 Guineas; but if I would buy him, I should have him at any Price. The Horse was in very bad Condition, when I saw him: and I suspected he was not honestly come by. He call'd for Bread and Cheese, and sent me out for some Onions; instead of going for Onions, I got a Constable and had them before Justice Farmer: the Prisoner had a Boy with him, whom I took up too, and he gave me the Information.</p>
               <p>Cox, the Boy. The Prisoner and I had swept the Prosecutor's Chimney, and when we had done, he came to me and fell a Laughing; I asked what he laughed at; why says he, here is a Saddle and Bridle, and there's a Horse in the Church-yard, we'll come at Night and take them away, and go to London. We came about 12 o'Clock, he took the Bridle and Pannel out of the Stable; I held open the Gate; he rode the Horse out, and we both came away together. <rs id="t17360908-8-verdict38" type="verdictDescription">

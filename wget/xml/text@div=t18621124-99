I am assistant to Miss Ferris, my cousin, of 115, Portland-street, Walworth—on 10th November, about 8 o'clock at night, the prisoner came for a penny candle and a box of lucifers—he gave me a shilling—I tried it in the detector, and found it was bad—he said, "I will go and fetch another one"—Miss Ferris came in, and bent it very much in the detector, so that it could not pass—the prisoner took it up, and went out, and Miss Ferris and Mrs. Anderson, my cousins, followed him.</p>

I am the wife of Frederick Anderson—on Satur<lb></lb>day evening, 5th November, I was at Miss Ferris's shop, about 8 o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—I saw a shilling in Mr. Anderson's hand, and saw it bent—it appeared bad—the prisoner took it, and left the shop—I followed him to the bottom of the street—he joined two young lads, and threw something over the houses, but I cannot say what, as it was dark—one of them then gave him something, and they went two or three hundred yards together—the prisoner then went into Mr. McClaren's shop, 2, St. Peter's place—I followed him in, stood behind him, and saw a shilling in Mrs. McClaren's hand—I told her to look at it, she did so, and said that it was bad—the prisoner was in the act of turning to run out, but I caught hold of him, and told him he had passed a bad one in my shop, and should not escape—he was given in custody—he called me a liar, and struggled very hard to get away, but I would not let him—I saw the shilling in Mrs. McClaren's hand; it was quite straight, and could not be the one passed at our shop.</p>

My husband lives at St. Peter's-place, Walworth—on 15th November, the prisoner came there for half an ounce of tobacco—I served him—he put down a shilling, and, before I had given him change, Miss Ferris and Mrs. Anderson came in, and told me to try it—I did so, and it bent very easily—I told the prisoner it was bad, and Mrs. Anderson took hold of him and held him—the father, who is a very aged man, went for a policeman, and the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

On the 19th of March I was going down Wentworth-street, I was accosted by the prisoner, she asked me where I was going; I told her, I should not tell her; she said, go with me; I went up a court with her, into a room, she then asked me to give her some gin; I told her I never drank any; I pulled out my watch and six-pence; she came round the table, snatched up the watch and the sixpence, and put them into her pocket. In about a minute or two she went to the stairhead and went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You meaned to make her a present did not you - A. I suppose so; I had money in my pocket. I staid in the room about twenty minutes, or a quarter of an hour; I found she did not return; I left the room and went to the office, and informed Miller the officer that I had been robbed; he persuaded me to go home, because he said she would not come home that night. This day fortnight Mr. Freeman came to me, and said he had got the person that robbed me of my watch. I went up and identified the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch - A. No; I am sure of the person of the prisoner. She owned to the magistrate of taking the sixpence, but not the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not made any agreement to give her any money, had you - A. No, I had not.</p>

            . I am an officer. Glazebrook came to me on Monday the 19th of March, he gave me information that he had lost his watch in Wentworth-street. The prisoner was taken in Houndsditch on the 4th of April. The watch was never found.</p>

On the 19th of March I was standing at the end of the court where I live, the prisoner was with another girl, he returned and asked me where I lived; he followed me up into my room; I asked him if he was going to give me any thing to drink, he put down sixpence; I went for a pot of porter; he said he did not drink any gin, and when I returned the prisoner and the other girl were gone. I am innocent of the crime I am accused of.</p>

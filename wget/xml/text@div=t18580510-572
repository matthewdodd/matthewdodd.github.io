                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Gray, who lives at No. 39, Upper Thames Street. On 21st April, I was going on board a steamboat, near London Bridge pier—I had a gold watch on—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—itcost 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed it within three minutes of its having been stolen—I saw it when I left home—I picked this ring up on the ground three minutes after the watch was missed—we were detained three quarters of an hour for a boat—an accident had happened, the place was very much crowded, and I was jostled—I then felt for my watch, and it was gone.</p>

On Sunday night, 2d May, I went with Sheridan to No. 4, George Street, Brick Lane, Bethnal Green—it is not a respectable neighbourhood—there are only two floors—the prisoner occupied one room up stairs—there were four chairs and a table there—it was about 11 o'clock at night—when I went in I saw this gold watch, with some more property, on the mantelpiece—I took it down—I took it down in his presence—Sheridan spoke to him; I did not—I took the watch away—theinspector asked him, at the station, where he bought it—he said he did not know who he had it from.</p>

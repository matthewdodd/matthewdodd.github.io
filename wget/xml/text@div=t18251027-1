The prisoner has been in my service since March last. On the 19th of September, having missed a microscope and case of instruments, I charged him with taking them, which he denied - I told him if he would inform me where they were I would not prosecute him, and in consequence of what he said I found them at a pawnbroker's; he offered to redeem them - I went to Marlborough-street, and got an officer, who searched, and found duplicates of my property upon him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of September I was fetched to the prosecutor's house, and found the prisoner there, searched him, and found on him four duplicates of surgical instruments, and at his lodgings I found some other property of the prosecutor's - he said they were his lodgings.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Perryman, pawnbroker, of Compton-street. I have three brass syringes, a microscope, and case of instruments, pawned in September, by the prisoner, at separate times. The microscope was pawned all at one time, for 3 l.; he only asked for that. I am no judge of its value.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he often redeemed things which he has pawned? A. Yes, often, for the last two years.</p>
               <p>MR. MAYO. This property is all mine. The microscope is worth upwards of 10 l. I never authorised him to pawn or redeem goods. The value of the whole is 12 l. or 13 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the microscope in pieces, which could have been taken at different times? A. It is in different pieces. I said if he would confess to the two instruments I would not hurt him; I did not say I would allow him to work it out at so much a week; he shewed great contrition.</p>
               <p>Two witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

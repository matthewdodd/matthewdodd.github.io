On the 3d of August I went out about three o'clock in the afternoon, and returned about six; when I returned I missed a silver tankard; there were several people in the house at the time, but my people suspected the prisoner, who was missing at the time the tankard was. He was described to me. On Friday the 5th of August a lad came to my house and told me he believed his father had some of my tankard offer'd to him for sale, cut in pieces.</p>

               <p>Lebeau. I can't tell. The boy's father met me at the Gun in Shoreditch, and shew'd me the house where the prisoner lodged. He went to the Thistle and Crown in Kingsland Road, where the gentleman described him, and said he lives at next door. I said he answer'd the description, having a greasy place on his left shoulder. We went into his room. I said to the prisoner where is the plate which you offer'd to sell to this man? He said, after some little hesitation, he had it about him. I sent for two gentlemen, named

This plate was found upon him, but I was not by at the time; I stood in the entry, being afraid the building would fall; it was a very old place. We took him to my house, and a number of people followed him in. I took him up-stairs, and there the plate was open'd by the constable. I found it in pieces, but upon one of them was a cypher, by which I can swear to it. ( He takes it from the rest.) There was only this cypher upon it. We carried him before the late Sir

            . On the 3d of August I was at the prosecutor's house, there were several drummers in the room, during which the prisoner came in with a large bag on his back, a little round hat, and had a carroty beard; there was a collection made for money to make the drummers drink, one of them went round with his drum. I put a penny on the drum head, we gather'd to the sum of six pence, and they spent it in beer; they had it in a tankard, which appeared to me to be silver, without a lid; it was handed to me. I had it in my hand, the prisoner said it was his turn to drink. I drank to him, and deliver'd him the tankard; so it went about from one to another, till it came to me a second time. The prisoner sat upon a chair with his back to the chimney. I drank to him a second time. I deliver'd it to him again, and we got talking about one thing or other. I never saw the tankard afterwards, nor did I see the prisoner go out of the room; but soon after it was missing, and the prisoner was gone. After that the prosecutor came home, and was told one of his tankards was missing by his maid; he inquir'd what sort of people. I described the man had been there. (meaning the prisoner.) On Friday the 5th of August the prosecutor came to my house, and desired I would go along with him, for according to the description of the man, he thought he had got the person that had note his tankard. I went with him to the prisoner's house. The prosecutor said is that the man. I said, to the best of my knowledge, he is the man that was there at the time, and to whom I delivered the tankard as we were drinking. He was secured, then Mr. Mercier came, and said he was the man; the prosecutor's maid said the same. He was taken before Sir

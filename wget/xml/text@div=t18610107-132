I carry on business as a wholesale cheesemonger in Miles-lane, Upper Thames—street, in partnership with Arthur Brock<lb></lb>sopp—I have seen the prisoner at my place of business about three times altogether—on the first occasion my partner sold him some goods; I was in the warehouse—we told him we would sell them for cash—that was about two months before this transaction—we were paid by a cheque from his father—the cheque was paid and then we sent the goods—we got the money first—I remember his coming a week or two after, with a second order for goods—I was present then—nothing was said to him about credit—the goods were brought back, in consequence of no money being paid—on the afternoon of Wednesday, 2d January, he came and selected articles to the value of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which form the subject of the present indictment—I distinctly told him I should not sell them unless he paid cash for them—he said, "Very well, when you send the goods I will pay the money"—I sent the goods by Rowland, the carman, with an invoice, and I gave him in<lb></lb>structions—he came back again about two hours after, without the money or the goods.</p>

               <p>my partner went to his shop—I visited the shop myself last Wednesday evening; not before this last parcel of goods was delivered—I believe Rowland took the first parcel of goods—we entered these goods in our ordinary day-book, as sold to the prisoner—I have not my books here—I believe there was another party present, besides myself, when the prisoner selected the goods—I do not know who it was—it was some party with the prisoner—I do not know that I should know that party if I were to see him—our warehouseman was present—he is not here—the prisoner was a few minutes selecting the goods—he did not call in the morning and ask me about butter, nor did I tell him that I had not any that would suit him then, but would have if he called by and bye—he asked me if I had some other description of bacon, and I told him I had not—I did not say that if he came again next day I would have some that would suit him; nothing of the kind—he did not, on the very first occasion that he called, tell us that his father was a man of means, and that we should be paid by his father's cheques—we knew nothing of his father—he did not mention his father to us on the first occasion and tell us, when he handed us the cheque, that it was his father's cheque—we received it from the father—the father did not come there with him—we sent the invoice to his father and he paid the cheque—his father is not living at the place where he carries on business—he lives at Trinity-square, Tower-hill—I believe he is carrying on business as a provision merchant—when the goods were brought back by our carman, Mr. Brocksopp went first to the shop, and I went after he came back—I was there while he was there—it was a few minutes before 12 at night when I ordered the prisoner to be given into custody—when I got there I found these very hams and bacon in the shop; the greater part of them cut up—I was rather excited—the prisoner did not tell me that that was not the way to speak to him, that he was a respectable man, and that we should have had his father's cheque for the goods, if we had only waited—he said nothing of the kind—Mr. Brocksopp said, in my hearing, "Now, Mr. Bell, I must have my money, or my goods back"—the prisoner did not say, "So you shall have your money, but I have been treated very grossly by your carman, and I am not to be insulted with impunity"—I was not present during the whole of the time that Mr. Brocksopp was there—the agreement was that the money was to come back when we sent the goods.</p>

I said "Yes"—he side "We are going to the railway station, will you ride?"—they had a one hone trap, a sort of tradesman's cart—I got in—William sat in front and drove, I sat on the right hand side, George on the left, Lee was behind—William drove towards the Green Lane,' Hornsey, where there is a rail<lb></lb>way station—when I had been in the trap about five minutes I received violent blows on my mouth and on each side of my nose and on my eye—the first two blows knocked me partly insensible—after that I saw them taking my watch and chain—I could not say which took it—I was wearing it in my waistcoat pocket—I was then sitting in the bottom of the cart—William Stretton chucked me out of the cart in the road in High Street, Hornsey—the other two had then gone—I called out "Murder" and "Police"—some people came to my assistance—I was assisted home—I to my senses—I remember no more till 6 or 9 o'clock—the doctor then attended me—my nose was cut, it is very painful now, and I have suffered great pain in the back of my head—I gave information to the police the erne night—it is about three miles from the Victoria, and three and a half miles from the Three Compasses, where I was thrown out, and not a quarter of a mile from where I live—hearing that the prisoners were in custody I went to the police court at Wood Green on 27th January—I there identi<lb></lb>fied William and George Streeton from a number of other persons—I did not recognise Lee at first, but afterwards did so—I was sober, I had had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of whisky and afterwards 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth, that is all.</p>

I live at Park Terrace, Parkfield Road—I am a booking clerk at the Stamford Hill station of the Great Eastern Railway—I recollect George Streeton coming to the railway station one evening in January with another man I should not know—George Streeton tool up a book belonging to me entitled "Oliver Twist"—I took it from him, and as he went through the station he said "Good night, Oliver," to me at the window—the gas was alight.</p>

I saw George Streeton at the Malvern Castle public-house on 19th January a little before 8 p.m.—I heard of their being in custody, but I was not sent for—George Streeton did not know my address—I have only just been subpœnaed—I remember Lee knocking the side of my hat—he was with George Streeton.</p>

I live in High Street, Hornsey—my master is a bate there—one evening in January I saw two men in a cart outside the shop—one was raving and throwing his hands about, and using bad language—he overbalanced himself and fell out of the cart—two young fellows standing by picked him up—William Streeton stopped about five minutes, and when they picked him up he drove off—the man who raved seemed the worse for liquor.</p>

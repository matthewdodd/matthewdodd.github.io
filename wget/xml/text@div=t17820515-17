I went out on the 11th of April, to drink tea at a carpenter's in the neighbourhood, and staid there till past ten o'clock. When I got home, I put the key into the door, and opened it, and immediately two men rushed in upon me, and both came into my room; the prisoner stood against the door; the other man, who I can't swear to, opened a dark lantern which he had, and came to me; they cut off my pocket, and took out a box with a ring in it, and five guineas, and he gave them to the prisoner,

               <p>Do you usually carry so much as five guineas about you? - It was all I had got; I carried it about me, at that time, because I was at a lodging.</p>
               <p>It was dark; had you any light but from the dark lantern? - The room was quite light from the lantern; I could distinguish his face so as to swear to him.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay with you? - About ten minutes. There was nobody in the house but me; the person I lodge with goes out a washing; she was not come home.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you see him next? - Two men were taken up upon suspicion; I went before the justice to see them; they were not the people; then the constable desired me to go into a public-house, and see if there was any body I knew; I went in, and picked the prisoner out from among a dozen; I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear that the prisoner is the man that received the money, and was present when the man took it from you? - I will. The light of the lantern reflected on the face of the prisoner; I could not see the face of the other man, when he cut my pocket off.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A cook in gentlemen's families. I have kept a house in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>You said, as soon as you opened the door they rushed in. Was that the outer door? - Yes; there are two rooms on the floor.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner dressed now as he was when you was robbed? - No; he had a black handkerchief on then.</p>

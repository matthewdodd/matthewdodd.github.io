I sent my little girl to tell my wife, who came home and opened the large drawers, and found that they had been opened, and some things taken out.</p>

            . I was with the other officer. I saw Robinson, and said, "I want you;" he said, "Will you allow me to go up and speak to my wife?" he went up, and I heard something chink as he was giving it to his wife; I took hold of her hand, and found three keys in it - she said, "Do not hurt my child" - I said I would not. I have a handkerchief which was taken in by a person belonging to Mr. Reynolds, the pawnbroker, but he is ill.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JOHN HARRAD re-examined. Q. What size was the chest of drawers? A. About a foot high. There were two bird cages and a sieve of currants stolen - I do not think they would all go in one bag, or that one man could have carried them.</p>
               <p>ROBINSON'S Defence. A young man was taken in company with me, who was. I believe, a nephew of the prosecutor - he was suspected of robbing his uncle; after the second examination they had him out privately, to see what they could make of him, and promised him his liberty. The prosecutor told him he was his uncle, and if he told where the property was he would not give charge of him; we were then remanded, and the young man's mother went to the grandfather, and they made up among their friends 21 l., and gave it to the prosecutor, not to say any thing against the young man. When we went up again Lady Minto, as she is generally called, came up half tipsy, and said she knew I was the person, because I was so very much pock-marked - the Magistrate asked if there was any charge against the young man - they said, No, and he was discharged.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JOHN HARRAD re-examined. Q. Was there any other person taken up? A. Yes: a young man named Goat; my sister married his father's brother - he was taken up on suspicion of robbing me, but I do not know where he is now; I have seen him since - he passed the door on the Saturday following; there was no such thing as any money made up. I do not know who took him up.</p>
               <p>COLDECOTT'S Defence. I keep a lodging-house, and used to buy bones and rags, and who comes in or out I do not know. The chest of drawers was brought in for 2 s. - 8 d. of the money was for an old man's bed, and 1 s. 4 d. I let them have.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Robinson a good character.</p>

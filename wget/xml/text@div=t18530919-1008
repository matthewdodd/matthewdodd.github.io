                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner go out at 20 minutes to 10 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left the bar then, and came back at half past 10 o'clock, and was there when he was apprehended.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were not before the Magistrate, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was at the bar when the prisoner came in at a quarter to 8 o'clock—I spoke to him—I looked at the clock at the time—he asked me if I wanted the newspaper—he was reading it at the time—he was talking to Blaney about going to Liverpool, and I was cross with Blaney, and told him I thought he was talking too much—that was at a quarter to 8 o'clock—he was talking to Blaney till I left the bar—it was after 8 o'clock that I was cross with Blaney, that was about 5 minutes to 9 o'clock—it was a quarter to 8 o'clock when I went into the bar—he had been talking to him some time, and that detained me in the bar, and I told him I did not like so muck talk—he was serving and talking—I cannot tell when they began talking; they were talking when I came into the bar at a quarter to 8 o'clock, and I spoke to him about 5 minutes to 9; the clock had not struck 9—I saw the prisoner there up to that time—I stopped in the bar until 25 minutes to 10 o'clock, and the prisoner was still there, with his back against the counter—he could not have gone out without my seeing him, during the time I was in the bar—he went to the door once, a woman called him—he was not there half a minute, and he returned back again; he did not go out—there were about a dozen persons at the bar at that time—he was about half a minute talking to the girl—there were more than a dozen persons at the bar at that time—there were about a dozen when the policeman took him out—it was a very slack evening, and very wet—I believe there were two women there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went into the bar at a quarter to 8 o'clock, was the prisoner there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was, with his back to the counter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Blaney talking to him so early as a quarter to 8 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was talking to him during the time I was in the bar till I spoke to him; he was talking to him at a quarter to 8 o'clock, and serving him at the same time, as he was standing against the beer engine—he remained talking to him on and off till I left the bar—it was about 9 o'clock when I was cross with him; it might have been a few minutes before.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Moss Allen, a cigar maker, of No.</hi> 3, <hi rend="italic">Princes-court, Drury-lane, also gave the prisoner a good character.</hi>)</p>

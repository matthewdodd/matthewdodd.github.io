On the Friday in Whitsun week we erected a bit of a booth before the door, for people to sit in as they went to and from the fair. I was informed there was a ladder set up against my house in the lane: I went to see, and saw the prisoner just putting his legs out of our one-pair-of-stairs window, coming out; it was between ten and eleven at night, it might be a quarter after ten: I cried, Stop thief! By that time he was on the ladder. I turned the ladder round, and threw him flat on the ground: when he was down, I fell upon him with all my strength: we had a struggle; he tore my shirt almost all to pieces. Another man came to his assistance; he was released from me, and run down Ducking-pond lane, to the brick fields. I followed him as fast as I could, till I overtook him and secured him: he was searched; he had nothing upon him but these keys. (producing them.)</p>

               <p>Did you lose any thing? - I lost nothing. I shut down the window about five or six o'clock; I do not remember whether it had been opened afterwards or no.</p>

            . I am a silk-dyer, I rent a room of the prosecutor to work in; I went to my work chamber there about half after eight, there was nobody then in the house, with my own key, I unlocked the street door, I saw the kitchen door open and the two drawers taken out, as I was going up stairs to my work-room, I heard the sash in the one pair of stairs room thrown open and heard somebody jump down into the court, I turned round and saw the prisoner jump down, he fell upon the ground, I was frightened, he had time to get up, he ran by me, I pursued him, he turned about under the gate way and made a motion with his hands to sight me, upon that I having the key of the street door in my hand, said if he offered to strike me, I would knock him down, then he put his hands into his pocket as if he would take something out, not knowing but it might be a pistol or knife, I drew back, he took then to his heels again, I followed him and cried stop thief, upon which he said you lie d - n you; I asked two men at the corner to stop him, they said, d - n your eyes stop him yourself, upon their behaving in that manner, I was frightened and lost sight of him, about four or five hours afterwards I went to Justice Fieldings for a warrant, I got Dinmore the constable to attend with the warrant, he took me to several houses such people frequent, I saw the prisoner at the Marquis of Granby's-head, in Chicklane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180044"></xptr> I went in with Dinmore and Kippin, I told them he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you know him by his voice or person.</p>
               <p>Chennell. Chiefly his person, though I knew him too by his voice, he insisted upon it, that he was quite innocent, Dinmore then asked him where he was at eight o'clock, he said abed, Dinmore asked where he was at half after eight, he said, he was then at the Marquis of Granby's, and appealed to the landlord if he was not there, the landlord said, he did not know that he was, but he was as likely as any body to commit the robbery. I was the first person that went into the prosecutor's house, the kitchen door was broke open, the lock was bent back, and the chamber door likewise was broke open, when I opened the outside door with the key, it was locked as usual, so it is most probable the prisoner got in by a false key.</p>
               <p>Mary Pitt. I was the last person in the house, I came out about ten minutes before eight; I locked the kitchen and bed-chamber door; I did not come home again till after my husband and Chennell had both been there; as to the things they were lying in confusion ready to be packed up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When they first of all came into the Marquis of Granby, Dinmore challenged me and asked me what time I got up in the morning, I said, I believed about nine, I can take my oath it was nine before I rose; about three in the afternoon they came into the house, he called me on one side and asked me what time I got up, I said nine o'clock, said he are you sure you was up no sooner, I said yes, I could bring people to witness it; as soon as I had spoke the words, he said to the man do you think this is the person, he looked at me pretty hard, and said, I don't know, I think he may be the person, said Dinmore, if you think he is the person, I will lay hold of him, and secure him, he said, I think he is, Dinmore said, only say the word that he is the person and I will secure him, then he said, I say he is the person, and he took hold of me immediately. I could get the man of the house here, but a poor person cannot afford to subpenae any one and therefore I shall be wrongfully cast, I was abed with my lawful wife at the same time, who I married at Edinburgh five years ago, I expected my trial to come on last night, else I could bring a lad from the public house, who said he saw these parties run by and they were both bigger than me; the man at the public-house, said he could not do any thing in it, for he supplied the milkman with money to carry on the prosecution; if I had money to subpoena the lad, I dare say I should have got through the thing.</p>
               <p>Chennell, Dinmore and Kippin were all asked whether it was before or after Chennell challenged the prisoner, that Dinmore asked him what time he got up: they all said it was after.</p>

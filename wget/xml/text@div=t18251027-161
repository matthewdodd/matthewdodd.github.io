            's window - I made inquiries, and the servant sent me to his master's shop in Crown-street, Finsbury; I there found six pairs - I gave information to an officer, and we went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Bishopsgate-street, where I found his wife and two daughters - the duplicates were produced out of the wife's pocket, in a very reluctant manner, a few at a time; having got these I went to my own place of business in High-street, Southwark, where the prisoner was at work; he is in the habit of taking stays home for his family to cover them with cotton. I never allow any to be taken out without being entered, and I found no entry in the book of these six pairs of stays. I called the prisoner down stairs, and shewed him the stays - I told him I had proof that his daughter had sold them, and asked him to account for them - he said he knew nothing about them. The officer then asked him what he would say if he was told his wife was in custody, and those duplicates had been taken from her; he then said he hoped I would forgive him, as it was sickness in his family that had occasioned it. I had the stays with me, which I got in Crown-street. I then said "Have you taken the whole of these yourself, or has your son taken any?" he said "My son is perfectly innocent - I have taken them all myself" - the value of the six pairs was 20 s. or 21 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who makes those entries in the book? A. I do, sometimes - this first entry is mine, which is copied from a former book - there is no one entry of mine made since this book began - there is no person here who made any of these entries - I do not know whether they are correct - I do not know whether the prisoner and his family make stays completely - he does one department. When I produced the stays I opened the paper, and stated they were mine, and he said he hoped I would forgive him. I found some stays afterwards in his drawers - I can swear to five pairs of these, as being cut out of two particular pieces of stuff - one of them is about a penny or three-half-pence a yard worse than the other - they tally in such direct coincidence that I have no hesitation in swearing to them.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Have you informed your own mind by the materials of which they are composed? A. They correspond in workmanship and materials, with those in my house; the stays missing were never entered - all the stays in this book are returned, except those found in the prisoner's drawers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has this book any account of those six pairs in it. A. No, it has not - the entries are made by his dictation.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I accompanied the prosecutor and his brother to the Borough - the prisoner was sent for down into the dining-room, and was asked if he knew of any stays being sold to Mr. Attenborow - he said No - I then said "What will you say if I tell you your wife is in custody, and I have the duplicates here." He then fell on his knees, and said he hoped he would forgive him, it was through having a sick daughter, and he would sell the bed from under him to make it up - his son had no hand in it.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to EDWARD ARPTHORP. Q. What state were they in when taken from your house? A. Without the bones they might have been taken in the state they are now.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the prisoner have taken the materials, and made them himself? A. Yes, he might, but I do not think it likely.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did he make the defence made by his learned Counsel - that they were not stays when he took them? A. No; he had the most easy access possible to the place where he could have got the stays when they were finished - if he had not brought back stays he had to finish, it would have been detected by the book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what state are they when they leave your house? A. They go to his wife to be covered, and then he uses the iron to finish them in my house.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the house in which the prisoner lives. If any manufacture of stays had taken place in that house, I think I must have known it; I have never seen whalebone or work people going there. I am myself acquainted with the business, and am sure stay-making could not have been carried on without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The whole that has been said against me I solemnly deny. I never made any confession to the officer; he said my wife and daughter had acknowledged to taking some stays, and I thought they had taken some; they then asked me about my son, and I said he had nothing to do with it. I then said to my master that I hoped he would forgive my wife if she had done wrong, and I would make it up in the best manner I could. I said I had taken charge of the stays which were taken home for my wife, and if I had taken any others, the shop-girls would have seen me, and I should have been detected. I have been in the habit of making a few stays to sell or to pawn, as all my family are able to do them - the articles I can purchase at different shops, which I have done for years past; as to the pattern of the stays, it is natural I should make them to the pattern I had been accustomed to.</p>

            . I live in the Commercial-road. I have known the prisoner for 30 years. I have been an officer with him in the Excise, and know his character well. I was in his house on the 26th of September, and saw his daughters at work on stays.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were those stays the same that were sold at Attenborow's? A. Yes, they were working on them; I did not know in whose employ he was at that time.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Shoreditch. I have sold goods to the prisoner's wife for six or seven years, especially coloured jeans to make stays and lining, and fents of various kinds - I always considered it as for stays.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ARPTHORP re-examined. Q. You had some conversation with the prisoner, will you have the goodness to repeat it? A. When he came to the room, I asked him what account he could give of the stays which I produced, which I knew, or had evidence, that his daughters had sold to Mr. Attenborow. He said he knew nothing about them. The officer said, "What will you say to it, when you are told your wife is in custody; and the duplicates. I have in my hand were found on her?" He said he hoped I would forgive him - it was sickness that induced him to do it. I then asked if his son had taken any, and he said, No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are these stays your's? (producing another pair) A. No, they are not; this line is not made by my rule. I cannot see any other difference, but I should say they were not made in my shop; they are not so finished.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mention to him where the stays had been sold? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a stay-maker. I see no difference in those two pairs of stays, they are so much a like - there is more difference in those which are made by the same rule. I have made the same difference, and Mr. Arpthorpe has, and so has every man - here is another pair of Mr. Arpthorp's, where the line is different from the first pair of his own.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Are they not ruled alike? A. No. I do not think either of these pair of stays are stolen, by the look of them.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter. I myself made the greater part of this pair of stays - my mother and sister did the other part, and my brother boned them. I had neither of these other stays by me to make them from. I have made many pairs like them.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Then, without seeing the pattern, you have made them so much alike, that the last conscientious witness cannot tell the difference? A. Yes, from having made so many. My sister and myself took these half dozen pairs of stays and sold them. My father goes to the East India warehouse, then cuts work for us at home, and then goes to Mr. Arpthorp's. I was present when the officer took the duplicates from my mother - she took them out one by one.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you made many such stays in your life? A. Yes, if a person were to order a pair now I should sit down and make them like these, without seeing the pattern. It is possible for persons to make stays in our room without our landlord knowing it. My father is sometimes at the warehouse from seven till two o'clock, and sometimes from eight till three.</p>
               <p>JURY to THOMPSON. Q. Have you sold any materials like these six pairs of stays to the prisoner's wife? A. I cannot say that I have, for there are different shades of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I desired the prosecutor to forgive me, I did not know what my wife and daughter had done, and I wished him to forgive them if they had done wrong.</p>
               <p>JURY to EDWARD ARPTHORP. Q. How do you know the jean? A. I bought the whole two pieces together -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270071"></xptr>the front of them is of a better quality, and the other inferior, though it matched in colour.</p>

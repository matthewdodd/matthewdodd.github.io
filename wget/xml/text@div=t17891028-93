               <p>Court. Who do you mean by they? - The mob; there was a great number of them.</p>
               <p>How many people do you think were assembled round the house? - I cannot exactly tell; there was a great many women at first.</p>
               <p>Was it a very large mob? - A very large one; a good deal more than a hundred people; when they rushed in upon me, (there were stairs going up to the fore door into the cellar); I ran up these stairs to the front door; I ran to go to some of our people that were guarding other houses; there were about four or five rushed in; I was glad to get off; but one man laid hold of the keg, and I ran up the stairs; and then I was pursued by all the mob; they heaved stones, and glass bottles, and every thing they could lay hold of, at me; one struck me on the leg; I could not walk for half a year; he struck me with a slint stone about two pounds weight; I observed the prisoner after the goods were taken away; he was the man that laid hold of me, and said he would have me away, that I might as well deliver myself up to him, for that I should never go home to Plymouth alive; I took out my pistol to defend myself; I threatened them, and I swore I would shoot them; the prisoner and two more enclosed me; they came nearer to me, and kept in a round circle; the stones were coming every way; I am sure the prisoner laid hold of me, and caught me by the collar; and after some time, he brought me down; when more assistance came down, they brought me down to the house of Jones; Thomas Bradley, and Ellerton, and Kay, came up; they got me away into Jones's house; and they followed me, continuing heaving stones and glass bottles; and when we got into the fore parlour, they hove stones, and broke all the windows.</p>
               <p>How many people were assembled at that time? - I could not see, but there were a great many.</p>
               <p>Was there a hundred? - Above two hundred at that time; they hove several stones in the tap-room; we were between two fires; there were some stones hove from the street, and some from the tap-room; we got in there between two and three o'clock; and it was after candle light when we got out; we were there four or five hours; we were released by the captain's officers belonging to the cutter, who rescued me, and took me on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Was you able to make any seizure on the other houses? - No; we could not make any seizure or search in the other houses.</p>
               <p>When you were in the house, did you see any thing of the prisoner? - Yes; I saw him now and then by the window, swearing what he would do to me; and that they would have me out by and by; some said they would cut me down with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280085"></xptr>a cutlass, like a bullock; and this prisoner was the same as the rest, saying what he would do.</p>

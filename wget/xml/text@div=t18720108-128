I am barmaid at the Prince Albert, St. Martin's Lane—on 14th December, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner was there, with some other men, one of whom called for some sherry—Mr. Mahon, the manager, also served some of them—Mrs. Carthew emptied the tills while they were there, but I did not notice anything wrong—on Friday, the 15th, the prisoner came again, with one of the same men—I recognised them—I served the prisoner with half-a-quartern</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Prince Albert—On 14th December, about 9 p.m., the prisoner came with some companions—two stood together, and the others stood back—I served them, and his companion paid me three times for sherry—they were drinking and speak<lb></lb>ing together—I cannot say what they tendered first, but a florin was tendered by the companion, which I put in the till—Mrs. Carthew came in and cleared the till while the prisoner was there—she clears it every half or three-quarters of an hour, sometimes less—it is never more than half an hour—I did not serve them after the till was cleared—the companion paid the fourth time for the sherry, which I put into the empty till, the one nearest St. Martin's Lane—the prisoner and his companion left, and then I saw Mrs. Carthew clear the till a second time—no other money had been put in except by me, and that was small money—Mrs. Carthew subse<lb></lb>quently showed me two bad florins, one of which was broken—I took them and gave them to C 236—next day, between 10 and 11, the prisoner came in with his companion of the night before—I recognised them, and served them with half-a-quartern of sherry, for which I was paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they both drank of it, and had some more, and the companion gave me another 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from a handful of shillings and half-crowns which he took from his pocket—I went into the bar parlour, and saw the last witness give Mrs. Carthew a shilling, who pretended to get change for it, as I had sent for a policeman—the companion then went out fast, but I stopped the prisoner, and charged him with passing a bad florin—he said "I was not aware it was bad," and asked me to show it to him—I took him back to the bar, and gave him in charge with the florin—he was close enough to see the coin tendered on both occasions.</p>

I am the wife of James Henry Carthew, landlord of the Prince Albert—on the night of 14th December, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the bar with his companion—there were several others sitting in the bar—I clear the till every hour, or perhaps oftener—the first time I cleared it, I put the money into a little bowl—I did not stay to count it, but after I had found the first bad florin, I looked among it, and found another bad florin—they were all going away together, when I went in to clear the till again, and I found a bad florin in the last till near St. Martin's Lane—an hour or a little more had elapsed between the first clearing and the second, but I could see the till during that time—I then looked in the bowl which I had taken into the parlour, and found another bad florin—I gave the broken one to the manager—on the Friday I was in the bar about 10.45, and saw the prisoner come in with his com<lb></lb>panion of the night before—Jane Newton brought me a bad florin into the parlour—Mr. Mahon sent for a constable, and I went round to the till under pretence of getting change, and when the prisoner saw that I was a long</p>

                  </hi> I am gardener to Mr. Brown, of Conduit Lodge, Blackheath Park—on Saturday night, the 13th July, about ten o'clock, I saw some ducks and chickens safe on my master's premises—I shut them in the coop, five in one lot and eight in the other—the chickens were three weeks and five days old—on the following morning I missed four out of the lot of five, and also four ducklings—a policeman came to me on the Mon<lb></lb>day morning and showed me four chickens, which I identified—I could positively swear to them—one of them had five claws on one foot and four on the other—I have not seen the ducklings since—the chickens were in Jackman's yard—I took them away—Jackman told me they were seven weeks old, and that he had bred them.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 14th July, about 6.30, I saw Coston with a boy named Woodley—from what took place then I took him into custody for being concerned with Woodley in stealing chickens—I took him to the station, and he told me if I went to Alfred Jackman's house I should find some chickens and ducks that were stolen—I took the last witness and three other gardeners to the place, and found a quantity of young chickens and ducks, and out of them he identified four chickens—Jackman lives with his father—there was no appearance of any hen—I did not see Jackrman until after the gardener had taken the chickens away, but on that night I was crossing the Heath just at the corner of the Park, and I met Jackman and Coston—Jackman said, "I am going over after those chickens that were taken away from my place"—I went with them, and when we got to the house Jackman said the four chickens were his property, and that he had hatched them—I showed them to Lawrence, Jane Thomas, and to Mrs. Lawrence, and they picked them out—they were mixed with other chickens—Coston told me that he and Jackman had been out several nights together, and that they had taken chickens from different places and sold them, and that Jackman and the others had not given him his share of the money.</p>

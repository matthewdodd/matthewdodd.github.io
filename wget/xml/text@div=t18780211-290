                  </hi>. I am in partnership as a wholesale bootmaker, at 1 to 4, Room Street, Greenwich—on 18th January Johnson was my fore<lb></lb>man, in the closed upper and material department, and Powell as a boot closer and maker—on 18th January, in consequence of information I received, I communicated with the police, and afterwards went to Powell's house, 101, East Street, Walworth Road, with two detectives—it is a re<lb></lb>spectable house, with a workshop at the back, where a manufacturer sends out work and pays so much for what is done—I saw Powell and said, "There have been a great many mistakes, and it is necessary that every man's work should be examined"—Powell said, "I will get my book"—I said, "I want to see the work, not the book"—on entering the first room I saw some of my goods—I took them down, and said, "These are mine"—Powell said, "They are not"—I said, "Here is my stamp"—he said, "They are your soles"—I said, "Here is my stamp scraped out of the upper"—he asked me to have mercy on him—he gave me no information of the stamp being scraped—I found more than 100 pairs of my uppers—he said that he bought them of Johnson at nine-pence a pair all round, and had paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, or else the full value, I am not sure which—I know them by the stamp, also by the patterns—there were a lot of other uppers there—the proper price would be from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pair—I also found seven pairs of heavy boots, and five pairs of others—I know those by the style of the upper—the stamp has been scraped out, but you can see where the leather has been scraped—I saw a lot of soles and heels—Powell said, "They are not all yours"—I said, "Pass into my hands what is mine"—he did so, and I found between 200 and 300 of my soles and heels; the heels fit this knife, which is not used by one in 100 manufacturers—this a list of the goods which I found belonging to me—Johnson had the entire charge of cutting out and taking out of the work—a clerk was kept to assist him in the booking, as he could not write fast and well enough himself—33 pairs were found at Powell's house which are not entered—those are not charged—I and the detectives then went back to Johnson at our office, and said, "We have been heavily robbed;" do you know anything about it?"—Johnson said Powell had bought some uppers of him, but they were his uppers, and that he had paid him ninepence a pair all round for them—I then went to Mr. Snead's, a bootmaker, and found a number of my toe-caps there—I know them by my clickers' mark—none of the goods were entered.</p>

It is usual to scratch a boot to make the ink mark—there was nothing to arouse my suspicion—my father started in business 50 years ago—I have been in the business all my life—Powell worked for me—I have entrusted him with 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stuff at a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I should not have dealt with Powell unless I thought him honest—the scratching did not seem to be deeper than usual—clickers sometimes scrape more than necessary—I thought he had done so in this case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a prisoner in Newgate—I pleaded guilty in January last to two charges of forging and uttering a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the Imperial Bank, and a cheque for 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the City Bank—in 1877 I was office boy to Dudgeon and Co.—I left their service in June, 1878, and went to my uncle's, and was afterwards out of work—I am 16 years of age—I first met the prisoner on 19th November, 1878—I was standing in the street outside the Elephant and Castle public-house, Newington, when the prisoner spoke to me and said"I think I have seen your face before; where do you live and where do you work?"—I said "I have just left Nunhead and am out of work and have left home"—he said"If you like, me and you will work and live together; where are you lodging?"—I said "Nowhere"—he said"I can give you a lodging for the night," and then we went to No. 26, Parsonage Walk, Newington, where he and a woman named Hancock occupied a room together—I slept there that night—Mrs. Rand is the landlady—the next morning, the 20th, I went with the prisoner to the City, and we walked about and returned to Parsonage Walk in the evening, and we had a conversation which he began—he said"About the bank accounts; if we can write out an order for a cheque"—he asked me where Messrs. Dudgeon banked; I told him at first that they were my late employers, and he asked me where they kept their banking account,. and he said "If we can write an order for a cheque-book on the Imperial</p>

               <p>Bank, and can get the cheques, we can get the money; can you sign Mr. Dudgeon's name to the cheque?"—I said"Yes"—I slept that night in the prisoner's room; the woman Hancock was there then, and on the previous night—I went out the next day with the prisoner to a coffee-shop in Camberwell Road or Kennington Lane, and he there said"We'll write out the order for the cheque-book to-day"—we returned to Parsonage Walk, where I wrote out an order in his presence on the Imperial Bank for a cheque-book of 100 cheques—he produced the paper and pen and ink—we then went to the Imperial Bank, Lothbury, and at the corner of Prince's Street he said "If you get one of the paying-in slips out of the bank it will take them off their guard, "and I went in and got the paying-in slip, and when I came out the prisoner was at the corner of Prince's Street, opposite the bank—I returned with him to Parsonage"Walk and wrote there in his presence this order. (<hi rend="italic">Written on the back of a paying in slip of the Imperial Bank</hi>: "Thursday, 21st, 1878. Please send per bearer a cheque-book containing 100 cheques, and oblige yours truly, A. J. Dudgeon.") The prisoner saw me write it—I then destroyed the one I had previously written in his presence—I went to the bank with the prisoner and took the fresh order to one of the clerks, who gave me a cheque-book for 100 cheques—tho prisoner waited for me opposite the bank, at the corner of Prince's Street, and we went back, returning to Parsonage Walk about 11 o'clock—I then took out one of the cheques in the prisoner's presence and wrote the cheque produced. ("No. C. 144901. 6, Lothbury, London, Thursday, 21st November, 1878. The Imperial Bank, Limited Pay office or bearer 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. A. J. Dudgeon.") The amount was suggested by the prisoner—I gave the cheque to the prisoner and returned with him to the Imperial Bank, and he waited outside as before while I went in—I presented it and got the money in gold—I gave the prisoner 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and kept the rest myself, and we went to the Crystal Palace together at my expense and stayed till evening, when I returned with him to Parsonage Walk, and slept there again—Hancock was there—this was the evening of the 21st, and I slept there till the 25th November—I went out during the day to places of amuse<lb></lb>ment with the prisoner—on the 25th he said"Ain't your money nearly gone? mine is; I think we had better have some more"—my money was nearly gone—he asked me where Dudgeon and Co. kept the company's account—the Imperial Bank was the private account—I said "At the City Bank, Finch Lane"—he said"Will you write out another order?"—I said "Yes," and he gave me the paper and I wrote out in his presence this order for a cheque-book. ("10, London Street, 25th November, 1878. Sir,—Please supply per bearer one cheque-book containing 200 cheques, and oblige, J. W. Cooper, secretary, Dudgeon and Co., Limited.") At the bottom is Written "Received by G. W. Richardson"—I wrote that when I went to the bank, and invented the name myself at the bank—the order was written in the prisoner's room in his presence, and we then went together in a cab to the City Bank, Finch Lane, Cornhill—I had been with Dudgeon and Co. as office boy and knew they had an account there; I used to go there with letters—I do not know if their address was printed on their letter paper—we left the cab at the top of Finch Lane, and the prisoner waited at the top of Cornhill, about 100 yards distant, while I went to the bank—I gave the order to one of the clerks, who gave me the cheque-book, and I rejoined the prisoner and returned with him in a cab to his room in Parsonage Lane,</p>

I suggested yard expenses and he agreed to it—we then returned to the bank in a cab and he waited again at the same place while I went in and presented the cheque, which they cashed for me all in gold, and I rejoined the prisoner and gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was November 25th—the prisoner then proposed we should buy a pony and trap, and said he knew of one for sale in Bethnal Green Road—I agreed, and we went there together to Mr. Silverton's—the prisoner waited opposite in a public-house, and I bought the pony and dog-cart and paid 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I took it to the public-house and the prisoner got into the trap and we drove to the Elephant and Castle, where we picked up Hancock and another woman who I had seen before with her—we took them in the trap to the Crystal Palace, and stayed there till evening; I paid all the expenses—I carried the money in my pocket—on returning in the evening we agreed to put the pony and trap up at the Artichoke public-house in the Borough Road, and the prisoner drove there with me and spoke to the ostler, and we left it there and went into the public-house, and remained there talking and drinking from between 8 and 9 till about 12 o'clock that night—we paid in turns for the drink—on leaving we returned to Parsonage"Walk and took two small bottles of whisky we had bought at the Artichoke—we found Hancock at Parsonage Walk, and we bad supper in the prisoner's room and finished the whisky, and I became intoxicated—I slept there, and got up about 8 in the morning, and found there was no one there—I fetched the pony and trap from the Artichoke, and left it outside with a boy, and I went back to bed and slept till 1 o'clock, when the landlady woke me up and said something to me, and I found that I had lost 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my pocket, nearly all the money I had, and the prisoner and Hancock had gone—they had said nothing to me about going—the two women were with us all the time at the Crystal Palace the day before, and on returning we left them at the corner of the Elephant and Castle at 8 o'clock—I saw Hancock again when we got back to Parsonage Walk—I did not see the other woman again that night—on coming down at 1 o'clock I found the pony and trap still outside the door, and I took a drive, and then took it back to the Artichoke—when I got up first at 8 o'clock I left the money in the room in my trousers pocket—the trousers were wet—I did not look for it till 1 o'clock—I was arrested some days after—I found these three books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the prisoner's room, and believe they are his—I put them at the back of the pony and trap on the 26th, so that if I should be arrested it would lead to the prisoner being taken—I had no authority from Dudgeon or Dudgeon and Co. to sign their name to the cheques.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. You were out of employment when I first saw you—I did not meet Miss Hancock in town the evening before I brought the pony and trap to Parsonage Walk—I purchased her a hat and gloves on the night of the 24th, I think—I had not the trap then, so I did not promise to bring it to take you to the Crystal Palace next morning—the trap was purchased on the 25th—I was never at Parsonage Walk with the trap any morning at 9.30 while you lived there, only on the morning of the 25th, and when I came from the Crystal Palace in the evening I left Miss Hancock and the other girl at the Elephant and Castle—I did not leave you</p>

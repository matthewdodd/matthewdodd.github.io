                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons; I was house surgeon at St. Mary's hospital on 29th Aug.—the deceased child was brought there about 11 o'clock that night by the prisoner—it was dead when it was brought to me—from its being quite warm I should fancy that it had only just died before it was brought in; it was very much emaciated, and there were marks of bruises over its forehead, and near its mouth, and blood was flowing from its nose and mouth—the bruises on the forehead</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180084"></xptr>
               <p>appeared recent, they were red; there Were two or three more on the left side, and one large bruise on the right side of the forehead, and there was a bruise on the left side of the mouth—they all had the appearance of having been recently inflicted; they were red puffy marks which afterwards turned to the black appearance that is called a bruise—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation of the head; in addition to the bruises that I have already men<lb></lb>tioned, I observed that the whole head was literally covered with marks of bruises—I also observed some small marks, something like scratches over the face—the body was very much emaciated, and there were also red marks, as of scratches, on its buttocks—I removed the scalp, and saw blood effused between the scalp and the pericranium—that effused blood corresponded with the external marks on the skull—I opened the skull, but before doing so, I observed a fissure over the right frontal eminence, corresponding with the large bruise that I mentioned before; it was not a fracture, it did not go through the skull, only the external plate, the pericranium was not severed; a blow might cause the bone to crack without lacerating the skin—on re<lb></lb>moving the skull cap, I found a great deal of blood effused between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, the external covering of the brain, and the bone; and on remov<lb></lb>ing the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, there was blood effused between it and the surface of the brain—on removing the brain from the skull completely, there was blood effused at the base of the brain, more particularly on the left side, there was no laceration of the brain—those appearances were sufficient to account for the death by pressure of the blood on the brain—the organs of the chest and belly were perfectly healthy; the glands in the abdomen were slightly enlarged, but not actually diseased—taking the whole of the appear<lb></lb>ances together, I should say that the death was owing to external violence acting upon a frame very much weakened by inanition—my opinion is, that that inanition was caused by want of food, inasmuch as the organs of digestion were perfectly healthy; in fact I think they were the very healthiest I ever saw—if several blows had been inflicted upon the head of the child shortly before it was brought to the hospital, I should consider that sufficient to account for the death, and for the appearances I saw—I saw the mother of the child at the hospital some days afterwards, and the child was shown to her by order of the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you that the proxi<lb></lb>mate cause of death was the effusion of blood on the brain, caused by violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the immediate cause—I would not exactly attribute the violence producing the effusion of blood, to the blow which caused the fissure; I cannot lay the cause of death to any one particular blow, because blood was effused all over the surface of the brain; the fissure did not go into the brain itself—the shock of a violent injury to the head will cause effusion of blood in other parts, but in this case the blood effused between the scalp and the skull corresponded with the bruise on the outside of the head, and the effusion of blood throughout, corresponded in the same way with the external bruises—I do not mean that there was an effusion corres<lb></lb>ponding with each bruise, the head was covered with bruises—there was no large vessel wounded, it was the rupture of several smaller vessels, and a blow on one particular part would not cause the rupture of small vessels in other parts as easily as it would cause the rupture of a large body like one of the great vessels of the brain; several small vessels had given way, so that there had been a gradual effusion producing a gradual pressure on the brain up to the time of death—the greater portion of the effusion did not correspond with the fissure, the greater correspondence was on the left side, the fissure</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180085"></xptr>
               <p>was on the right—it often happens if a blow is given on one side, that a vessel is ruptured on the other—I think the effusion is generally nearly mathematically opposite the place where the blow is inflicted; for example, when a man has fallen from a great height upon his feet, the blow is carried up through his body in a straight line, and the fracture is very often at the base of the skull, that is a well known surgical fact; in the same way if a blow is given in one spot on the head, it is carried in a straight line in the direction in which the blow is given—in a child the bones of the head are remarkably soft—the fissure was about an inch and a half long, and in breadth it was just a line, just perceptible—such a fissure might be occa<lb></lb>sioned by the forehead coming in contact with an angular or sharp body—it might probably be caused by that—I think if it had been something sharp and angular it would have caused some actual wound on the outside—it might be caused by coming in contact with some hard substance—I should say it was probably caused by some substance harder than the hand of a woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you attribute the cause of death to the fissure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the effusion of blood—the fissure was not altogether the cause of that effusion—I found an effusion which corresponded with the recent bruises that I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the prisoner brought the child to the hospital what did she say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She told me that the child had fallen out of bed while she was away from home, and struck its head against a box at the side of the bed—she cried for a short time, probably for two or three minutes—some of the bruises were of long standing, they were of all ages—nothing is more difficult than to state the age of a bruise; I should say that probably none of them were two or three months old—some flesh will retain the marks of bruises longer than other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon a child in that weak, emaciated state, the marks of bruises would probably remain longer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think as a rule it would be generally rather shorter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the mark of a bruise removed by absorption? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in a case like this I think that absorption would take place as quickly as possible, on account of the weak state of the child; because we often give medicines to weaken a patient, in order to assist absorption—the mark on the mouth appeared more like a blow than a sore—I saw no sore or abscess in the process of being healed—I opened the mouth to see where the blood came from, and found it was not caused by laceration, but it came from the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you attribute death to a blow inflicted three months ago, or just before that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To blows inflicted just before that time, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was partially intoxicated—very likely the fright at finding the child dead, might have made her a little more sober, but I can be no judge of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Barnes, a coachman, and live at No. 10, Praed-street, Paddington. The prisoner lived in the same house—she said she had a husband—I remember her having the little child Groves, to nurse—on Tuesday night, 29th Aug., I went into the yard, about a quarter before 11 o'clock, and heard the prisoner making use of very shameful and abusive language—she said, "You b—b—, I will shake your b—guts out"—I heard blows at the time—I looked through the window, and saw her sitting on the foot of the bed with the baby in her arms; she was knocking it about its head and face with her hand—I went to the door and called Mary Ann Cork, and she came and looked as well as myself—I never heard the child cry at all, and never heard any sound at all from it—she struck the child twice after Cork came to the window—I saw the prisoner's little girl come out of the room—I went into the room, and told the prisoner she ought to be ashamed of herself to ill use the baby in the manner she had been doing—she said she had not struck the baby—I said it was no use denying it, for I had looked through the window and seen her for the last two minutes—she said, "I certainly have struck it, for the child dirtied itself, and it made me angry"—I said that was no reason why she should illuse the baby—I did not see the child's face, she covered it over with a night gown—she said she would get up, and put it into a warm bath—she did not do so—she got up, and I went up stain to the landlady, and told her what had occurred, and that she had better get up—she did get up, but before she got up, I went down into the passage again—I might have been gone six or seven minutes, and Mrs. Knight passed in with the baby in her arms—while I was in the room, I heard the rattles in the baby's throat, and I said to the prisoner, "I believe you have killed the child, for it has the rattles in its throat; and whatever I have seen I shall say again"—Cork and I were at the street door when the prisoner passed us with the child in her arms—we followed her, and saw her go into the hospital with the child in her arms, and saw her come out again without it—I asked her where the baby was; she said it was dead—I said to her directly, "You have killed it"—a man, named Matthews, who was there, said, "You ought to give her in charge;" and she was given in charge to a policeman—she was first taken to the hospital, and then to the station—I had heard her use bad language to the child before, but I never saw her beat it till that night—she said on the Sunday morning, "The little b—I wish it was in the flames of hell"—I have not heard her use any other bad expression with respect to the child—I have given the child milk and broth two or three times; I could not say whether it had food or not, it appeared to take the food ravenously.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you hear the prisoner scolding the child, Sophia, for so placing the child on the bed that it had fallen off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard her say anything to her daughter—I did not stay in the prisoner's room more than two or three minutes, because I found that the child was dying, and I went up to the landlady—when I first heard the prisoner I was in the yard—I did not hear her mention her daughter's name, or address herself to her.</p>

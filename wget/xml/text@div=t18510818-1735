                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN SERGEANT</hi>. I live at High-street, Woolwich. On 17th July I was at Woolwich-common, some horse-racing was going on—I had a watch in my waistcoat-pocket, as it is now—I was looking at a horse to which an accident had happened—I felt nothing, but when I left the crowd I found my watch hanging down from my pocket, against my legs—I put it into my pocket and walked away—Newell came up and spoke to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 38). I was on duty at Woolwich in plain clothes, and saw the prisoners, who I knew before—I watched them about an hour—they went towards a crowd where a horse had fallen—Mr. Sergeant was outside the crowd—Armstrong pressed upon him—Martin and White were a little way behind—Armstrong then went to Mr. Sergeant's side and looked down at his waistcoat-pocket, while the others closed up against him—I could see Mr. Sergeant's waistcoat-pocket—there was nothing hanging out of it then—Armstrong put his left arm on Mr. Sergeant's right breast and shoulder, and was doing something, I could not see what, with his right hand, but I saw him take his hand away with the watch in it, but the chain was still to the waistcoat—I was not more than eight or nine yards off—there was a move in the crowd which caused Mr. Sergeant to move—his watch was then hanging down, and I saw Martin looking down at it—Martin then went and put his hand down towards the watch; I saw it move, and I believe he had hold of the chain—the horse then made a move, and Mr. Sergeant came out of the crowd with his watch hanging down—White stood close by the whole time—I saw Mr. Sergeant put his watch in his pocket, and sent Newell to get his name and address—I took Armstrong a short distance off, and told him he was charged with stealing a gentleman's watch—he said he knew nothing at all about it, and I might search him—I said, "You would have stolen it if you could"—he said he had not attempted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was the watch out of the gentleman's pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hardly three or four minutes—there were a great many people there, but the only witnesses are us two policemen—there were a good many people in front of Mr. Sergeant—I did not see how the watch got out of his pocket—Mr. Sergeant did Dot throw Armstrong's arm off him, he roust have felt it—I am the <hi rend="italic">persecuted</hi> Carpenter, I was a witness against Lord Ranelagh—the charge was dismissed, leaving the railway people to indict if they thought proper—I expect to be indicted—I have not seen the bill—they are indicting the railway porters now—I only know that Lord Ranelagh threatened from the first moment that he arrived at the station that he would ruin me if it cost him 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say where Newell was standing, I was not looking at him or the horse.</p>

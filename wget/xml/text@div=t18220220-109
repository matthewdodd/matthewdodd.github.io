On the 8th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop for two sheets of post paper, which I gave him - they came to 2 d. - he gave me 1 s. I thought it bad, and shewed it to one of my daughters, who said it was very bad I asked if he had any other money; he said he had no more about him. I gave the shilling to Mary. to take to a neighbour for his opinion, and get it changed if it was good. She returned, and said it was very bad, Smith came in with her, and questioned him, and sent for an officer, to whom I gave the shilling, after marking it. He was taken away, and I then found, behind some reams of paper, where he stood, four bad shillings, in a piece of cloth, three were in separate papers; they appeared the same sort as that he gave me.</p>

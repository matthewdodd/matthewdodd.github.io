In consequence of suspicion I had him taken into custody, and asked if he had any thing to communicate to me respecting what was happening in our concern; he said he had not - he went with us to his lodging; I found his wife there, and found a pair of boots and five pairs of shoes; he had nothing to do with manufacturing, only cutting out; these boots have been worn, and four pairs of the shoes - his wife was a binder; I can identify the whole of them; I am acquainted with our own manufacture, and most of them have marks - we never allowed him to take goods home; I claimed them in his presence - he said, "The pair of shoes which are not worn are here for my wife to repair;" there was a cut in them, and on trying them on his wife, I found they had been cut to fit her foot - he had worked for me eight years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What was his duty? A. He was foreman of the manufacturing department; he gave out the materials; his wife could not have work to do without his knowledge; I swear to the manufacture of all the boots and shoes - each of them have our mark on them, which was made at the time they were given out to be made; they have no soles when sent to the binders' - our trade is entirely in the country and shipping; it was the prisoner's duty to see that shoes sent out were brought back - the prisoner never bought any shoes of me; it is not usually done.</p>

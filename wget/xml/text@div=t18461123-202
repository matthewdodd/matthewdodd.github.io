                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Richard Moser and Son, of Vaux<lb></lb>hall. The two prisoners were porters in our service—it is their duty to look out the steel for customers and weigh it, and bring the weight into the counting-house—they have no right to deliver any without going to the counting-house, and giving the weight to the clerk, who would tell what it came to, and he would take the money—Young bad been in our employ about eighteen months, and King more than seven years—they knew perfectly well what the custom Was—I was at the counting-house that day during the timé of this sale—I did not receive any money for this forty feet of steel—it would have been their duty to have come to me before the steel left the premises—this steel weighs 1cwt. 4lbs.—the value of it would have been 25<hi rend="smallCaps">

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it usual to give bills of parcels? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, For ready money we sometimes give bills and sometimes not—I know the steel called No. 3—I do not know the weight—it is not sold per foot—we sell it by weight—it might be about half-past six o'clock when we got the men one by one into the counting-house—I was in the way from four till six—this took place about ten minutes before six—King had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—Young, I believe, had 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they have not authority to sell supposing I am not in the way—they have not authority to receive money—their place was to serve a man with steel, and bring the weight into the counting-house—if they had served a man with steel, and received the money, and not come into the counting-house for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, I should have considered it wrong—they had no right to receive money.</p>

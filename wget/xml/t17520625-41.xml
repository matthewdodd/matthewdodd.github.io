Then the prisoner came up and took five pence halfpenny out of my breeches pocket. Then he asked me if I had a watch, I said I had none. Then he unbuttoned the waistbane of my breeches, and took out of my fob pocket a crack'd farthing and a cane head studed with silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Wiseman. It was not moon light, it was neither light nor dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Wiseman. I have seen him several times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamps?</p>
               <p>Wiseman. There was not, it is an open place, I could see the prisoner very well. The other man said, d - n your blood, deliver the hat, then the pistol was under my throat. I did not chuse to deliver my hat, then the prisoner said, d - n your blood, why don't you deliver your hat. Then I let go my hand, upon which the other man said, perhaps it is a felt hat, if it is let the poor man have it. The prisoner felt at the corner of it, and said, d - n my blood, it will do for me; I was looking at him all the while. When they left me I went down to the bottom of Old Gravel lane to see for somebody. I saw a watchman at a distance, I told him I had been robbed, he answered, you may rob and be d - d. Then I went to the watch house and inquired for the headborough; he asked if I knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250016"></xptr> the thief; I said, yes. Betwixt 5 and 6 o'clock that morning I was drinking a halfpenny worth of sallop in Rosemary lane, the prisoner went by and could not forbear looking at me; there were two others in company with him. About 12 at noon I saw him come by me again in Ratcliff highway, he then could not forbear looking at me.

             observed the prisoner to look at me, and said, what makes that man look at you so? I said he had reason enough, for he has robbed me. I immediately collared him. There was another man with him, but he ran away and fetched about fourteen men, and they rescued him from me. He was taken up last Tuesday, and had before justice Bury, who committed him.</p>

            . I never saw the prisoner before Monday the 8th of June at about 12 o'clock at noon, the prosecutor was telling me the story, just as the prisoner was coming by; when he had passed as he look'd behind him, I said, what makes that man look at you so? he said he was the man that robbed him. The prisoner went down Gravel lane, and two men with him, looking behind them now and then; we overtook them at the end of some broad stones. I ran round and met the prisoner, and said, is this the man that robbed you last night? he said it was. I took hold of his shoulder, the prosecutor said to him you are the man that robbed me last night. We pushed him into the Black-boy alehouse ; we had not been there above a minute before a score of Irishmen arose, and the prisoner was rescued from us.</p>

            . About a fortnight or three weeks ago, on a Monday morning about 6 o'clock I saw Wiseman as drunk as a man could be, he said he had been robbed that night by three men. I said, you have been to a bawdy house, and the whores have robbed you. I asked him what time of the night it was; he said about twelve o'clock. I asked him if he thought he should know them again; he declared he should not.</p>

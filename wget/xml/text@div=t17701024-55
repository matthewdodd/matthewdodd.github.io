They were asked if the prisoner was in a great passion; they said, he was not. They were asked if the How appeared to be given with great violence, which they answered in the negative, and that the deceased was very careless about his learning; that the prisoner took more pains with him than with any other of the scholars. and used to say, it went against his heart to beat him; and also, that the prisoner was a very good tempered man, and behaved very well to his Scholars.</p>

            , who is a servant of Mrs. Poole, deposed, that the deceased came home from school very ill; that he was put to bed, and died about two next morning.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hunter. I saw the deceased after his death; I did not see him before. I went to see him on Wednesday the 10th; I opened the other parts of his body, but when I came to his head, I examined if there were any external marks of violence; I could not observe any: then I scalped it; I sawed the skull, and then I observed a large quantity of extravasated blood coagulated, lying between the skull and the first membrane of the brain, or that which immediately lines the skull. I then served the membrane from the skull, more than the breadth of my hand and fingers; the blood was of the thickness of about an inch and an half. I then examined the skull itself; upon its inter surface there appeared below where I had sawed, a piece of the skull projecting in wards, I suppose about the bigness of a sixpence in the whole. Then I observed the outside of the skull opposite to this piece of fractured bone, and still there was no marks of violence, till I came to the very skull itself. There were all the appearances: there was upon the outside of the skull a dent answerable to the inside appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. From these appearances do you or not believe that the blow you have heard described was the cause of this young gentleman's death?</p>

               <p>Dr. Hunter. Without a doubt the extravasated blood was the immediate cause of his death; the fracture there was the cause of that extravasation. Now I don't think an open hand would beat in a skull in that particular part; it must be done by some instrument that was angular, such as a knuckle, or the corner of a Chimney.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form a judgement with what degree of violence the blow might be given?</p>
               <p>Dr. Hunter. In a young skull the bone is thin; it was upon a part that was flat, a part that rather projects in wards; therefore a small blow is capable of taking in a piece of bone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have taken as much pains as was possible with the deceased, which is not unknown to Mrs. Poole. I have devoted my time to teach him, such as Thursdays and Saturdays in the afternoon, Sometimes Sunday not exempted. I have bore it with as much gentleness of temper as possible; I did not expect this would have had any worth effect then former corrections of the same kind. I have sat for hours instructing him with regard to the conjugating his French verbs, I have chalked them upon his desk, that he might remember them. He was dull by nature, I believe more so by inattention. I taught him longer than any of the other scholars, for I did expect, and I told Mrs. Poole so, that if I could gain the point to drive out his inattention, she would not be wanting to recommend me. She told me, I might depend upon it she would recommend me. He was a very valuable scholar to me. I had 45 l. a year for teaching him and giving him a dinner every day bot Sunday. Had he been my own son, I could not have taken more pains, with him, and should have given him a box on the ear with the same inadvertency. I used to read his lesson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240035"></xptr> for him, when I read them to him, he seemed to give no attention. I used to remonstrate with him; he would take the book and lay it down and do to play. He was frequently guilty of these things. I did the best I could for him; I loved him; I told Mrs. Poole, that if I was to have an estate left me after I had taught him, I could not take more pains than I did; she said she did not doubt it, and was very much obliged to me.</p>

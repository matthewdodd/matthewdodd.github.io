When this was committed, the house belonged to Robert Gould; but I had the shop. I had no other apartment; the shop was connected with the body of the dwelling-house; it is part of it; my son slept in the shop. On the evening of the 17th, St. Patrick's Day, about half past nine, the prisoner at the bar, and another man, broke open this shop of mine. There were two locks to the door, a padlock, and another lock, which was locked double. This night, about that time, I saw my son to his bed; I generally send one of my sisters with him; but this night, I went myself. When I came in the shop door, I found the padlock was gone; it had been on the outside of the door, and the staple screw was forced out. I kept articles of trade in the shop. I tried the door with my hand, and found it open; the trial I made was to ascertain whether it was open; I then pushed it wide open, and found it hit against some person; I said to my son, there are thieves here. The moment I spoke the words, the prisoner at the bar made an attempt to rush but; he rushed from behind the door; I laid hold of him immediately by the collar; another followed immediately, another man; a vielent scuffing then took place on the pavement. My shop was on the ground floor. The consequence of that was, that there being two to one, I was thrown down in the horse road, with great violence, by the two; but the fall did not break the hold I had of the prisoner. The accomplice, who afterwards made his escape, fell upon me, and struck me, and dragged me, and tore me, and this is the coat I wore; it had been a wet afternoon; those were the small clothes I had on. The accomplice, finding that I kept my hold, had a cudgel, and as I was laying down with the prisoner, straight as a person would lay in his bed, he made a violent blow at me; but fortunately he missed me; still I kept my hold. My son was there, and did what he could. Then the accomplice, when he made the blow, ran away. I then got up, keeping hold of the prisoner, and I never left hold of him until I gave him into the custody of the officer; he is here; the officer is also here who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030015"></xptr>picked up the padlock. I lost nothing out of the house. I saw the padlock after it was picked up; it was considered a safe one, and no picklock could enter it; but they forced the staple out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you catch hold of me inside the door or on the step?</p>

               <p>Witness. Inside the shop; for the door was pushed to, and to a person passing by, it would have appeared fast.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN BRYDGES. I am the son of the last witness. I went to sleep in this shop; my father went with me; it was on a Sunday night. My father pushed the door; the padlock was off; I had put it on at ten o'clock on the Sunday morning. When my father pushed the door, it bounced to again, and seemed to hit against some one. My father said, there were thieves in the place, and my father apprehended the prisoner directly; there was no light by which I could see his face; it turned out afterwards that he was the man. After my father had collared the prisoner, another man appeared; the other man rushed on my father, and the prisoner, and all three fell down, my father having hold of the prisoner; I fell down with them. Then I gave the alarm, and a few people came; and then the other man ran away. I immediately went for a constable to Marybone-watchhouse, and he came with me. My father was holding the prisoner all the time; he never let go of him once; he delivered the prisoner to the custody of the constable, and then he was taken to the watchhouse. We did not find the padlock that night. The prisoner never said a word; he gave no account of his being there, or how he came there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The witness says, his father had hold of me all the time, and never let go of me once. How can he swear that, when he went away for the constable?</p>

               <p>Witness. I mean he had a hold of you when I went away, and he had a hold of you when I returned.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did I not say, I was standing up from the rain on the step of the door?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes; but it did not rain when we were there; the padlock was found the next morning, and it was file same padlock that I had locked on the Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>HALL REED. I am a constable of Marybone parish. I was fetched on the Sunday evening, at nearly about half past nine, by young Mr. Brydges; I went with him to the house of Mr. Brydges; I round the prisoner there; Mr. Brydges had hold of him; they were in the shop then; he gave me charge of the prisoner. He asked me if I was an officer, and I told him I was. I found nothing on the prisoner. His coat was all over mud and dirt, as well as Mr. Brydges's, very wet indeed. Mr. Brydges's coat was torn as it is now; it was a very dark night. I saw the padlock was forced off; but could not find it; it was found the next morning by the watchhouse-keeper. Mr. Brydges gave charge of the prisoner, and the next morning he was examined at Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>-NEWITT. I found the padlock the next morning, as soon as it was light; I went to examine the premises, and when I went into the middle of the road, I found the padlock; there was a hole of the size of this screw in the door frame. Mr. Brydges recognized the padlock, and claimed it as his own, and produced a key which looked and unlocked it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing up at the door out of the rain, and Mr. Brydges came up to me, and exclaimed, he was robbed; in the mean time, Mr. Brydges laid hold of me, and we all fell together.</p>

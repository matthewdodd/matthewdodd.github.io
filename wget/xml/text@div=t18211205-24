On the 26th of November, between nine and ten o'clock, I heard a cry of Stop thief! the prisoner was coming along with a flannel petticoat in his hand - I seized him, nobody but him was running, the watchman came up directly, I did not see Levi till we came to the watch-house, she said she had lost a gown and others things, and a box, she claimed the petticoat which I took from his hand, and the gowns picked up.</p>

On last Tuesday night early, or on Wednesday morning, my stable, which is a part of my dwelling-house, was broke open; I saw my stable window safe at ten at night, as I generally go down myself to see that every thing is fast; it does not open into the street, but into the Artillery ground; I found in the morning that a chain had been broke, and the window was broke open, and the lock was forced; I believe I was the last in the stable; I looked round, I missed four saddles and ten or eleven bridles, and the rest of the things that are mentioned in the indictment. Morgan Rice lived servant with me about two years ago, and indeed was in the yard about a month.</p>

On Wednesday morning between seven and eight o'clock, she came crying to my door, and said, her husband had been out all night with Johnson, he came in just after and asked me to drink<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030028"></xptr> part of some purl, I drank part of two pots of purl; he said he was exceeding cold, having been out all night; he then called me into his room and shewed me the bridles and saddles, which are now produced; he told me that he had sold one of them, a new one, for a guinea and an half; I always thought that Rice was an ostler; I suspected immediately that he could not come honestly by such a quantity of saddles and bridles, therefore I asked him how he came by them, he certainly must have stole them; he equivocated, at first he denied it, at last he said he did.</p>
               <p>How came he to shew you these things to produce such evidence against himself? - He might be a little in liquor at the time. I directed the officers to Johnson's house in consequence of what Rice's wife had told me that he had been out over night with Johnson.</p>

Bank notes from my jacket-pocket - I had come on shore and slept at the prisoner's house for a fortnight - he keeps a lodging-house. I had been paid on Monday, and told the prisoner I was paid - he took me to his wife, and I paid her 14s. which I owed - I went to several public-houses, and got home to the prisoner's house in the evening; neither he or his wife were at home - I went to bed and counted my money - I laid down across the bed, and in two hours one Valentine awoke me, and I undressed, but did not look for my money; I went to bed, and in the morning missed the notes. The prisoner and his wife were in the opposite room; I said,"Brockford, do you know any thing of my money?" he said, I was drunk last night; I said I was not - he came into the room in his shirt, and said I had better look about, which I did, but could not find it - there were other lodgers, and the door was open all night.</p>

            . On this night I was playing at cards when the prosecutor came in - he sent for half a gallon of beer, and then went to bed. The prisoner came in afterwards, then went out, and came in with his wife, and said we had better go to bed, which we did; as I went up-stairs, the prisoner touched me on the shoulder and said, "I am going to put you into another bed;" I said,"I have no objection," and I went with Valentine - soon afterwards I got up to go down-stairs, and as I passed Cooper's room-door, I saw the prisoner putting his hand into his jacket pocket, and saw him take out three pieces of paper, which he separated - I did not go down-stairs, but returned to my room, and the prisoner came in directly and said to Valentine, "There are some men on the bed in their clothes, will you help me to get them to bed?" he did so, and came back. I am sure he took the paper from Cooper's jacket, which was on his back at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you accuse him of this till ten days after? A. I went to the officer next day - I was turned out of the house by the prisoner's wife before this happened - I met the prisoner on Thursday, and fought with him; he got two men to beat me - I did not say I would be revenged - the prisoner has surrendered. <rs id="t18261026-246-verdict1358" type="verdictDescription">

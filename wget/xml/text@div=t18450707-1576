                  </hi>. I am a japanner, and live in Waterloo-road, St. George's. On the 28th of May I was returning from Epsom races—I went with a friend to the Angel public-house, in Webber-street, St. George's, South<lb></lb>wark—I took off my coat, and put it on a short seat, previous to playing at skittles—I played for about twenty minutes—I then turned to look for my coat, and it was not where I left it—Jocey afterwards pointed out Hart to me, and I gave him into custody from what Jocey said—Hart said he was innocent, as far as I can recollect—I do not know that I said anything in particular to him—he must have heard what Jocey said, because he was outside at the post at the time—I went there while I was playing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer; I live in Gray-street, Webber-street. I was at the skittle-ground, at the Angel, on the night of the 28th of May—I saw a coat lying on the seat at the left side of the door—I saw Smith take it away and give it up to <hi rend="italic">Lew</hi> Hart, who went out of the skittle-ground, but where he went I cannot tell—I saw Mr. Tubbs playing at skittles when I went in—I went out as soon as I saw the coat go away—I did not stop five minutes in the place altogether—I heard a noise about a coat being lost—I did not know Mr. Tubbs before—I told Mr. Barnes about the coat, and afterwards I told Mr. Tubbs—I said, "That is the man that took the coat"—Smith never left the ground at all—I pointed him out to Mr. Barnes—I did not tell Mr. Tubbs who took his coat—I was not along with Mr. Tubbs at all—Mr. Barnes came out<lb></lb>side the door—I called him, and said, "That is the man that took the coat"—I told Tubbs when he came outside the door—I pointed out to him the man to whom the coat had been given—Smith was inside the ground—I pointed him out to Barnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at the time you told Mr. Tubbs about the coat see Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Smith was outside the door, and I pointed him out to Mr. Tubbs, as the man that took the coat up—we went to several places to look after Smith, but we could not find him at all—he had left the skittle ground when we went to look after him—I saw the officer take Hart—I did not see Smith then, nor till two o'clock next morning—I pointed out Hart to Mr. Tubbs, and a policeman was sent for, who took him.</p>

               <p>see the policeman then—at the time the policeman took Hart, Smith was inside—I saw Smith at the time Hart was taken, he was outside—I did not point out Smith to the policeman, because he (Smith) was not there.</p>

            . I live with my father, who keeps this public-house. On the 5th of July, between six and seven o'clock, the prosecutor came in for a pint of porter - he laid his hat on the table; I took the money, and went out; in a few minutes the prisoner came and asked for a paper; he then had an old greasy hat on - he made some remark about the weavers, and went into the tap-room again; in a few minutes he went out - no one went out but him; the prosecutor came to me, and said he had lost his hat, and this old one was left, which I believe is the one I had seen on the prisoner's head.</p>

When I came home my son told me what had happened; I went to look for the prisoner, but could not find him - I found him the next day, and said, "I want you;" he said he would not go with me, as I was no officer; he got from me, and run away - I pursued, and took him; he then had an old hat on, which did not fit him.</p>

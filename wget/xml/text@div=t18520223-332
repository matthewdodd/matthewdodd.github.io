                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and live in Upper George-street, Greenwich. The prisoner was in my employ about two months—he was so on 24th Jan.—on that day a man named Jeremiah Radley was entrusted to drive my errand-cart—the prisoner was with him, as an assistant—my cart plies between Greenwich and London—it was the duty of the prisoner and Radley to proceed to London on 24th Jan.—they had some parcels in the cart—I afterwards had some conversation with Mr. Corney, and, in consequence of information from him, I asked the prisoner whether he knew anything of the parcel that was lost—he said he knew nothing of it—he did not say whether he had left it anywhere—I afterwards went with him to Thames-street—he pointed out a place, with the name of "Saunders" over the door—it was an unoccupied house—he told me he saw a man stand on the step of the door, and he said to him, "I have a parcel from Mr. Corney, and I want a receipt for it;" that he gave it to the man who was standing at the door, and the man said, "It is all right; I will send a receipt by post."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Queen's-place, Blackheath-road. On 24th Jan. the prisoner came to me, with an errand-cart, in com<lb></lb>pany with Jeremiah Radley—I do not know which of them drove the cart—they draw up to our door every afternoon—I had a parcel I intended to send to Mr. Saunders, 43, Upper Thames-street—it contained cash to the amount of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I delivered it to Radley—he showed it to Mr. Ilsley, his master, as he went out at our door, and then put it into his pocket—I explained what was in it—it was directed to "Messrs. Saunders, 43, Upper</p>

               <p>Thames-street"—I found afterwards it bad not been delivered—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to Mr. Ilsley—I had previously spoken to the prisoner—he said at first that they promised to send a receipt by post—he said he had left the parcel at 156, Upper Thames-street—I requested him to call and make it right; he was not to leave it at 156, but 43—he said he would call—on the Tuesday, when the prisoner and Radley came, I said to the prisoner, "The house where you said you left it is shut up"—the prisoner said he gave it to a man standing on the step—I explained to Radley what the parcel contained when I gave it him, because I had sent a parcel the week before, and it was not delivered till the Monday—I said, "Take care and deliver this"—he said, "I will, because I had such a <hi rend="italic">dressing</hi> about the other."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You delivered the parcel to Radley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was in the habit of coming with the cart every afternoon—the prisoner was outside the shop—I think he could not hear what I said to Radley.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 448). I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, 9th Feb., on the prosecutor's premises at Greenwich—I told him he was charged with stealing a parcel of money directed to Mr. Saunders, 43, Upper Thames-street—he said he knew nothing about it, neither should he say anything about it, and I might do as I liked—he was then taken, and on the following day he was remanded—when I took him out of the lock<lb></lb>up he said he should like to see Mr. Ilsley, he had got something to say to him—I said very well, what he said must be in my presence, and I should make mention of it—he stated to his master that henever saw the parcel, and never had the parcel, and he said it was all false that he had said to his master—he had previously said he had left it, and-when he was brought to the station he said that Jeremiah Radley had told him to stick to his text, that they could not hurt him, and the old man would have to pay for it—Radley was present, but was not in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The story the prisoner told in prison was the same the master told here to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; partly so—much to the same effect—the prisoner said that they drove up to China Hall, on their way up from Greenwich, and there had some drink.</p>

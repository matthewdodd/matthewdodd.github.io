                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Norris Herring, of Streatham<lb></lb>hill, in Streatham parish. Between twelve and one o'clock, on the 1st of May, I noticed the prisoner go out at the front gate—he turned to the left, then turned round to the front of the house, and looked up—I ran down stairs, missed the plate out of the basket, and sent a man to run after him—I am certain the prisoner is the man—I had a full view of his face when he turned round, and looked up—these spoons and forks are ours.</p>

               <p>when I first saw him—I took hold of him, charged him with robbing the house of some spoons, and said he must come back with me—he returned with me—I found the spoons and forks under some grass in the field where I took him—I picked up a stick, which he said did not belong to him—he had ran quite near enough to the spot where I found the spoons to deposit them there.</p>

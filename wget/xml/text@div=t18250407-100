The prisoner was in our service on the 10th of March, and for six months before; we missed some nutmegs that morning from a glass in the window - while he was out we sent for a constable, and searched his box, which was opened by a smith; we found in it some tea, nutmegs, and ginger; he came in in about a quarter of an hour - I asked him where he had taken the nutmegs and other things - he appeared very indifferent, and said,</p>
               <p>"What nutmegs? I have taken none;" I asked him if he would allow us to look into his box; he said Yes, and went down for the key, which he said he could not find; the officer was present; I said we would save him the trouble of unlocking it - we brought it out, and opened it before him; I asked him when he got them - he said about nine weeks ago.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for - the lock of the box was picked by a smith, and the nutmegs and tea were found; the prisoner came in - I heard Mr. Corder ask what he had done with the things he missed; he said,</p>
               <p>"What things?" Mr. Corder said ten, nutmegs, and other things; he said,</p>
               <p>"I have none of them, and know nothing about them;" Mr. Corder said,</p>
               <p>"Have you any objection to my looking into your box" - he said, No; he went down to look for the key, and said he could not find it - Mr. Corder said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, we have been opening the box;" it was opened again, and the ten and nutmegs were there; Mr. Corder then asked when he took them - he said nine or ten weeks ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, White House-yard, Drury-lane—the prisoner lived in that house for about nine months, and left on 24th August, without giving me any notice of his intention to leave—he left about 8 o'clock on a Sunday morning, before anybody was about—I did not discover anything till Henry Lind came home from his work—in consequence of something he said to me, I went upstairs with him, and found his box looked—I went to the police-station and gave intelligence—I did not miss any of my property—I cannot speak to any that was missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at the house of the last witness—on the day the prisoner left, when I came home and opened my box, everything that I had left in it was gone—I missed a coat, a black pair of trousers, two shirts, two collars, and two handkerchiefs—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—I had seen them safe in my box the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Gloucester constabulary—on the morning of 22d September, the prisoner was given into my custody at Cheltenham—he was wearing this coat when I took him—he told me if I would go to his father's house, 15, Sidney-street, I should find the other articles there—I had told him he was charged with stealing a coat, a pair of trousers, two shirts, two collars, and two silk handkerchiefs—I went and looked in the box, and found these trousers, a shirt, and the two collars; the other things here belong to the prisoner, and have nothing to do with the case—I brought him to London—I heard him, in the prosecutor's pre<lb></lb>sence, say that he was a ruined man for ever, and he begged Mr. Higgins to forgive him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Will you swear you charged me with stealing the things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not hear a man say, "This bloke has been robbing his lodging in London," nor did I hear you say, "It is a lie"—I was not too confused to hear it—Mr. Higgins caught hold of you first—you said you were a ruined man for ever, and would make away with yourself—I cannot say much about you; I have not known you lately—I saw you once before—I have never known you at the police-station at Cheltenham—I know nothing about your character at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I left my home in the early part of this year to come up to London, because there were better wages in London. Circumstances made me go to Cheltenham. I bought these things of the witness, and paid him for the coat and two waistcoats; I was to pay him weekly. The reason they have not put those in the indictment was because they acknow<lb></lb>ledge the money I have paid to be sufficient for those articles, and therefore they say I stole the others. I have always been known in Cheltenham as a respectable young man. My father has been in Cheltenham now about thirty-five years; thirty years in one firm.</p>

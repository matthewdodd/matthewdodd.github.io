                  </hi>. On 3rd November I was a constable in the Post-Office, and I and Sergeant Chamberlain saw the prisoner in Walworth Road—I said "Is your name Kauffman?"—he said "What!"—I repeated the question—he said "Yes; but what Kauffman do you mean?"—I said "Sam Kauffman!"—he said "Oh, no"—I said "Are you the Mr. Kauff<lb></lb>man that lives in the Waterloo Road?"—he said "Yes, that is my shop"—he shortly afterwards entered an omnibus going towards Camberwell—about 12.45 the same day I went with Chamberlain and Mr. Hurst to the Hero of Waterloo public-house, Waterloo Road, where I saw</p>

Bank of England notes you left with me; they are stopped"—he said "Well, what of that? I know nothing about them; I took them in my business"—I called him on one side and said "I am a police-constable from the Post-Office; about a fortnight ago you left two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes with Mr. Hurst; from whom did you receive them?"—he said "I do not know; I received them in my business"—I said "Well, you do not receive 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every day, and it is not so long age; I should think you might say from whom you received them"—he said u How can I say from whom I received them; I receive hundreds of notes, as my book will show"—I said "As you do not choose to give me any information about them, you will have to go with me to the City"—he said "Very well"—we all four went in a cab to the City, and on the road I said "<hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, how long do you think you had those notes in your possession before you left them with Mr. Hurst 1"—he considered for a moment and then said "Well, I don't know; I had them a fortnight; it may be three weeks or a month; I can't say"—when at the Post-Office, at the prisoner's request, I showed him one of the notes"—he said "Where is my name on it?—he was asked if he wrote his name on it, and he said "Yes, on both"—he was asked when and where he wrote it, and he said that he did not know—he was taken into custody.</p>

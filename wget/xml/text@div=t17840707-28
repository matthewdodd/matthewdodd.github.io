             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Portpool-lane, I know the prisoner, and have known him for a great while.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing about Mr. Willis's bed? - Not about their bed, the constable and Mr. and Mrs. Willis came to my house, and took a bed from my house.</p>
               <p>Is that the bed that is in Court? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Look at it? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>How came you by that bed? - This young man the prisoner came from sea when I lived in Castle-street, I have known him a great while, and he told me he was going to provide a room for himself he had plenty of money, and some time after this, I did not see him for two or three months, I cannot tell which, then he came and asked me to buy a bed.</p>
               <p>About what time was that? - I think it is about three months ago, it might be short of that, or it might be full that.</p>
               <p>Might it be a month or six weeks? - It must be more than that, Seasons has had it three weeks, I had it two months before he fetched it from me to the nighest of my recollection.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner asked you to buy a bed, did he bring you the bed? - Yes, the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did you purchase it of him, I did, Mrs. Willis saw the bed.</p>
               <p>In what situation was it when she first saw it? - It was with other things laying about, and people lived in the room, I told her I had not bought a bed for two months, she said she had lost her's within a month, she then went up stairs and said here is the bed, says she I know it by the outside being my own spinning.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Willis. Did you ever say any thing about the spinning? - Nothing but the darning, I said it was what we called in the country a home spun tick.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of the expression that that woman mentioned? - Upon my honor I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you doubt this being yours when you first went? - My Lord I was terrified, there was many people in the rooms, and they were making their diversion, and I went into one room and they

               <p>Then they shewed you more beds than one? - We saw all the beds, but only these three rooms we could not see till the keys came up, there was a bed in every room, I cannot tell how many.</p>

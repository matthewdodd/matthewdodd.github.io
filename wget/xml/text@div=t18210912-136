Among this copper was 2 s., I I gave them the copper with a view of getting rid of them, I took the silver from the copper, and kept it in my hand, and was going away, Mascoe held my coat, I turned round and said "Let my coat go" - a severe bow came from some of the party, at the side of my heard. I had done nothing to provoke them, nor said anything, it was a tall boy who struck me, it knocked me down - I got up and another struck me over the eye, with a mop stick, with a nail at the end of it, it nearly cut my eye open, I put my hand up to my eye, and then they all went off in different directions. I lost the money in the scuffle, when I was knocked down, I dropped it, and never saw it after, I did not look for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say then that the money ever came into their posession - A. No; I did not look to see if it was left, for I could not see for the blood. They did not attempt to open my hand. Mascoe was taken ten minutes after, and Shirley next day. I never saw either of them before, nor have I seen the money. Joshua Roberts is the boy who struck me, and asked me for the copper.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going through Orchard-street, about four o'clock on the 15th of July with Ward, I had seen a quantity of boys before this, they had followed me to the watch-house, the prisoners were among them - that was before this affair. I apprehended Mascoe afterwards on the spot or within five yards of it, I said, I took him for robbing a man, he said he knew nothing of it. I found no silver on him. I took Shirley on the Tuesday, and told him, I took him for robbing Abel, he denied it, and said he was at some distance from the place, but afterwards he said he was there, but had nothing to do with it.</p>

               <p>SHIRLEY'S Defence (written). I declare I know nothing whatever of it. When I came up I saw him on the ground, he appeared drunk, and several boys were near him, talking to him, he told Roberts if he would fight that chap he would give him all the money he had, showing him some halfpence; and soon after some of the boys pushed one over another. I was sent on an errand by my mother, and as I returned the prosecutor was gone; that is all I know, I never saw his money.</p>

            . I live at No. 19, Duck-lane. I am a married woman, and take in needle-work, my husband is a coachman; Duck-lane joins Orchard-street. I know Shirley, he lived at the bottom of Duck-lane with his mother, he has lived servant with a lady for two years. I went to take a walk on this day, and was coming back into Orchard-street, between three and four o'clock, and saw the prosecutor and four boys tussling in a row; he was very much intoxicated; there were only four boys together, others were about.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you say, there are more persons to speak to the prosecutor's state than himself. You saw four boys - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your husband coachman to a gentleman - A. No; he is a post-boy, he goes out with coaches at times, he now drives a post-chaise. I only saw four boys together at play. I saw the prosecutor have hold of Josuah Roberts's coat who I knew by sight, I have seen him since but not for three weeks. The prosecutor was very much intoxicated, I think he did not know what he was about. He gave himself a fling, and Roberts threw him down and Roberts fell with him. The prosecutor reeled about like a drunken man. A boy, name

Shirley was on the other side of the road looking on. I did not interfere. I could not get to him for he was very drunk. I did not speak to the boys. I was in Orchard-street, Shirley was on the other side the street the row was in, he stood opposite; it is not a wide street.

            . I live at No. 27, Duck-lane. On the 15th of July, on St. Swithin's day, Sunday, between three and four o'clock, I saw the prosecutor turn the end of Duck-lane and four boys with him, he turned out of Orchard-street to go into Duck-lane, and got about the space of one door in Duck-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is widest Duck-lane, or Orchard-street - A. Orchard-street. This happened in Duck-lane. I was looking out of my room window. The four boys were Roberts, Barney, Hunt and Yates.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120081"></xptr>Q.You saw no other boys - A. I saw the prisoner standing on the opposite side of the way, in Duck-lane, the prosecutor had hold of Joshna Roberts's coat, they were only a few doors from me; I was looking out of a one pair of stairs window, and could see what passed in Orchard-street; I had been looking out of the window ten minutes, and saw them in Orchard-street - I saw them turn into Duck-lane, Roberts gave himself a turn round, and struck the prosecutor on the breast, and as the prosecutor fell, his hat fell off, he was very much intoxicated, he staggered very much in Orchard-street; he stopped to pick his hat up, Barney stood along side of him with a broomstick, and cut him about the eye; I saw the blood trickle down his face directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body there must have seen it, I suppose - A. Yes; Mrs. Wright lives in the neighbourhood, I did not see her there; Shirley stood on the opposite side of Duck-lane. If Wright had stood there too, I must have seen her; I think I saw her at Queen-square next day - I know Mascoe, I did not see him there, I saw none but the four boys; Shirley was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boys did you see then - A. Some boys ran when they heard the skirmish.</p>
               <p>Q. What skirmish - A. Why the prosecutor crying out, he d - d and swore about the boys, he did not say he had lost any thing. This passed in Duck-lane, I did not see the prosecutor give the boys any money; I did not go down to enquire what was the matter, nor speak to the boys.</p>

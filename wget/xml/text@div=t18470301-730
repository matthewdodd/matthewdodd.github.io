                  </hi>. I live in Johnson's-court, Peter-street, Westmin<lb></lb>ster. About seven months ago, I forgot what month it was, I was living at No. 1, in the same court—that is not the same house I live in now—the prisoners lived at Mr. Manning's, in St. Ann-street—they pass as man and wife, and I believe they are so—on a Tuesday or Wednesday, about seven months ago, the prisoner James came to my house, and knocked at my door—he came in, and bid me the time of morning, and asked me to come out and have something to drink—I objected—he asked me several times, and forced me to go out—I told him I could not go out by myself—he and I went up stairs to the landlady of the house, Mr. Graney—he wanted her to go out to drink along with me—she objected—I was up there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I heard a noise in my room, which was the middle room, looked over the landing, and saw Mary Dowling come out of my room, with some<lb></lb>thing in her apron—she went down stairs—in a about ten minutes after, I went down into my own room and found my boy's money-box, which had laid on the shelf, was gone—my husband's box was broken, and two coats, a pair of trowsers, two waistcoats, and a silk handkerchief, were taken out—that was all</p>

I remember seeing Mary Dowling some time before the robbery, several times, two or three times a day—she asked me did I know whether my brother-in-law had any money—I said I did not know, but I had heard that he had—she said nothing more that day—that was on Satur<lb></lb>day morning—she came to me on Tuesday morning at my sister's door—that was the day of the robbery—my sister was in the room when she came for me—she called me out—I went out with her, and she gave me something to drink—James Dowling came up at the time, and he made me drink some more—he left me and her there, and went up stairs to my sister, and said he would take her to have something to drink—Mr. Dowling and I came out of the public-house—he went out first—she stood talking to me about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he left us—she was talking about the box—she asked me would I give her consent to break the box and see what was in it, and I would not—the box belonged to my sister's husband—before James Dowling left, he had said he would not break the box if he did not think there was some money in it—nothing had been said in my hearing as to who was to break the box—it was after he had gone that his wife and I stood talking together, and she asked me all about the box, and if I knew whether Sweeney had any money—she then left me, and went up stairs into my sister's house—I saw her go into the house—I did not see her go into my sister's room—I stood at the top of the</p>

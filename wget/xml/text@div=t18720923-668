I am a labourer, and live at 14, Francis Street, Hyde Road—on 20th August I was passing along the Hackney Road with a friend, and saw the male prisoner with the child beside him—as I came up, he put his hand to his cap to my friend, and my friend put his hand in his pocket to give him a penny; but the child attracting our attention, instead of giving it to the prisoner, we ran across the road to get some bread for the child, thinking it was hungry—my friend brought the. bread, and offered it to the child—it dropped its little head on its shoulder, and shook its head, as much as to say it could not eat it—my friend went across the road again, and bought it a cheesecake, and gave it—it snatched at it, and got it to its mouth, and took two little nibbles at it; and the prisoner took the child by the elbow, and said he did not want any cakes: he had cakes</p>

I am medical officer at Bethnal Green Work-house—on 20th August I received the child; it was very much emaciated, and looked very ill indeed—I treated it; it died on 31st—I heard the prisoner say when it was admitted that it was two years and a-half old; but I afterwards came to the conclusion that it was four years old; I judged by the teeth; it weighed 17 lbs.—if it were four years old it should weigh from 33 lbs. to 39 lbs.—the immediate cause of death was diarrhea—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—in my judgment the diarrhea was caused by improper and insufficient food, and exposure to the outer air—I can hardly say improper food; I would rather say insufficient in quantity—the mesenteric glands were not diseased—the weather was not very cold at the time—the child was fairly clothed; it had no flannels on; I ordered it flannels directly it was admitted—the probabilities are it would have lived if it had had proper treatment; there was no disease to cause death; when a child is in a weakly state the being taken into the open air and kept there for some time would accelerate its death.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know these persons before this unfortunate woman came by her death - A. Yes; I had known them about six or eight months; Mrs. Gaskett and Mr. Ricord lived in the same house together; Mr. Sawyer lived in the same house, and boarded with them.</p>
               <p>Q. The day this unfortunate person died was the 27th of April - A. Yes, the 27th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before she was killed had you seen these parties - A. I had accidentally called on the evening of the 26th, and seen them; Mr. Ricord complained of illness; I visited them the following morning; all the parties were together in the same room; they had been dining together, it appeared it was after dinner; I thought they appeared all agitated; Mr. Roach appeared ill; on the 27th Mr. Ricord was in bed. When I first called about eleven o'clock, the prisoner desired I would go with him, and view a piece of ground, and a house in the neighbourhood that he was thinking of renting; I accompanied him to the ground, and the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in company with him - A. Perhaps two hours and a half; he looked at the house; he appeared very auxious to take it, he persisted in taking it; I thought it objectionable for many reasons; when I returned home with him, he requested I would go back again, taking a portuguese servant with me that understood the English language to speak with the landlord about taking the place; he at the door left me without any reason assigned, and went up stairs; I remained at the door some time; I went up stairs, and asked him if he was going; he said, no, I will not go now; I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after, did you see any of the parties that lived in that house - A. About eight o'clock, Mr. Ricord and Mr. Green came running into the my house, very much agitated; Mr. Ricord required I would repair to his house, that Harriet and the prisoner had murdered each other; I went immediately to the house; I found the prisoner laying on the floor in a room in Mr. Ricord's house with his throat cut, and a wound in one of his temples.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she there - A. No. I remained there some time; I washed him, and dressed the wound, and had him removed into another room. In the room in which I first found him, the parlour, there was a paper which he had been writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your first going into the room, and you finding him on the floor, state what passed - A. Upon my enquiring for the female, he desired the paper might be handed to him, it was half a sheet of footscap paper, and pen and ink on the table; he wrote upon my enquiring, that she lay in the garden, at the back of the house, in the first lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to go and find that was a true description - A. Yes, I did, and found the body, she lay on her side in the front of the seat where she had been sitting, as it appeared; I saw a ball had passed through one temple and out of the other; I caused the prisoner to be washed, and placed upon a sofa in the drawing-room; about eleven o'clock Dr. Donnally came to dress him; I remained till two o'clock in the morning; the doctor dressed the wound; nothing material passed that evening. On the next morning I called again at eleven o'clock, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050005"></xptr>found him in bed; there were several gentlemen of the department of the prisoner in the house; we judged it adviseable that he should give an account of the transaction.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you write it by the prisoner's dictation - A. No; I wrote it from certain facts and accounts that I collected from him, and the general reports in the house, and from what I saw after I had written it. I went into the room with it to Mr. Sawyer; I stated to him, that it was agreed by all the gentlemen, that he should state or avow the particulars of this unfortunate circumstance, and then read over this paper to him; he asserted to the truth of this paper; I read it distinctly over to him; he asserted to the truth of this paper, by writing and by words, he signed it, Dr. Donnelly witnessed it,

Yes; I went to Mr. Sawyer again on the 30th, I came to Mr. Sawyer on the next day, with an arrangement made according to my own mind; I read over the memorandum to Mr. Sawyer; Mr. Pink accompanied me. I read over that paper which had been signed on the 28th; I said, I considered the paper signed the day before, left room for a consideration, that the female had murdered herself, and requested that I might be permitted to amend it, as it wanted the word my.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had it gone through her head - A. Nothing had made its exit out; I apprehend the wound was occasioned by a pistol bullet, and that wound was the occasion of her death; she was dead when I first saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the enquiry the next day into this business - A. I was; I was present when Mr. Sawyer put his signature to that paper, and I witnessed it; I think I saw Mr. Pink sign it, and Mr. Tobin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A severe wound in my throat renders me incapable of distinctly articulating; I have therefore reduced to writing a few observations; no man could feel a greater regard for the young woman; never for a moment had I a thought of killing her; I have but a confused recollection of this melancholy event; I very much regret the absence of Mr. Ricord, he would have been a most important witness in my behalf, as he alone is acquainted with all the circumstances of this case; the gentlemen who conducts this prosecution, have done every thing in their power to obtain his presence; I understand their applications have been ineffectual; I express my acknowledgement for the endeavours they have used, I leave my case to your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury.</p>

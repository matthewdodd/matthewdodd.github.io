On the 22nd of April I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Red Lion-street, Holborn; I got on duty about half-past two o'clock - I had known the prisoner about thirteen months previous to that day -I have had him in custody three or four times; frequently when I have had him in custody, and when I have met him in the street, he has used violent threats to me, and about three weeks before I was standing in Theobald's-road, when he said I should soon be from there, I should not be there long, for he would do for me; he shoved me off the curb at that time, and on several occasions before that he has used similar expressions - I went on duty that day about half-past two o'clock, and saw the prisoner almost directly coming from Red Lion-street into Theobald's-road; he was on the opposite side of the road; he saw me, but nothing passed - I went up Red Lion-street and returned in about a quarter of an hour; I saw him, but nothing passed then - I passed down Lamb's Conduit-street, and again saw him at the end of Red Lion-street and Theobald's-road; this was about half-past three o'clock - he then began to abuse me, and followed me down part of Lamb's Conduit-street, nearly to East street; he asked if I should not like to have him again, if I should not like to take him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300021"></xptr>- he called me a b-r, and said it would not be long that I should be there; I made no reply, but passed on, leaving him on the other side of the road - I turned back, taking no notice whatever of him; my duty rendered it necessary for me to remain in the neighbourhood, and I saw him hanging about the neighbourhood till five o'clock - nothing more passed till five; he made use of some words across the road to me, which I did not understand, a little after four; I took no notice of it - at five I saw him take a key from a boy and a girl, who I believe to be his son and daughter, at the corner of Red Lion-street and Theobald'sroad; I heard him say it was the key of his shop, and he had been looking for it - he gave the key of his shop, and he on receiving the key he went down Theobald's-road towards Gray's Inn, and I lost sight of him till near seven o'clock - I saw him again then at the other end of Red Lion-street, next to Holborn; I then saw him coming up Holborn from towards Gray's Inn - I turned my back to him, and looked the contrary way, towards St. Giles', and let him pass me; I was standing in Holborn, just by Red Lion-street - I turned my back towards him, and he passed in the rear of me, and turned up Red Lion-street, on the other side, which was the way I had to go back; he said nothing to me - he crossed to the opposite side of the road, and began to use the same abusive words as he had in Lamb's Conduit-street, saying should I not like to have him again, and he would take care I should not be there long.</p>
               <p>Q.Were these expressions uttered loud enough for persons round to hear? A. I heard them - I was only the width of the street from him, and in a second or two I crossed the street towards him, and told him to go about his business, for I wanted no altercation with him; he said nothing, but faced to the left and went right up the street twenty or thirty yards, and I following him on the same side as he was - seeing me following he crossed to nearly the other side of the road, and put his hand into his coat pocket, but which pocket I cannot tell; he pulled out a shoemaker's knife, and flourished it at me, making a kind of bravado with it two or three times with his hand - he then excaimed, "By Heavens! if you come near me I will do for you!"</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time any weapon in your hand? A. I had none - I was on the opposite side of the street, on the left-hand side of <placeName id="t18310630-14-crimeloc74">Red Lion-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310630-14-crimeloc74" type="placeName" value="Red Lion-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Do you speak from your recollection of that, or are you certain you had not struck him before you received the first stab? A. I am quite confident of it - I had not offered to strike him before I received the first stab; I had done nothing more than holding my staff in my own defence, as I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the third stab was made you both got on the other side of the way? A. I call that the second stab; I do not call that a stab which only cut my clothes - when I received the second stab in my side, I was endeavouring to secure him, but finding my force of no avail I cried Murder! and tried to make my escape from him; I extricated myself from him, and went towards Holborn - he then pursued me; he over-ran me, and stabbed me in the back as he ran by me - I might have got ten or twelve yards at that time; the knife entered my back - I still kept running to the end of Holborn; I staggered across Holborn, and recollect seeing him make his escape - he ran down Holborn towards Gray's Inn: I fell in Holborn from the loss of blood and being faint - I was confined five weeks and two days in St. Bartholomew's hospital; I still feel the effects of it, and always shall do so. I am afraid - the prisoner appeared quite sober, and knew what he was doing; he walked as well as I could myself every time I met him that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where did you live at that time? A.In Cromet-street, near Judd-street; I should have come off duty at nine o'clock - I have known the prisoner more than a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always have him in custody at your own complaint, or the complaint of other people? A. The first time was at the complaint of his wife and youngest son, the other times were at my own complaint; I believe his wife sits in the street with oranges and fruit.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you on the day this happened call him an old cuckold? A. I did not, nor tell him I knew as much of his wife as he did; I never told him any thing of the kind, nor to that effect - I never called him an old cockold.</p>
               <p>Q. And all the three or four times he abused you, you never used any offensive language to him? A. I never did; when he was on the opposite side of the way, with the knife in his hand, he said if I came near him he would do for me - he once made a complaint to the Commissioners about me; it might be about three months before this happened - I do not know the date; he told me afterwards he should complain again when I met him in Red Lionsquare, and said I should not stay there long.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Was any inquiry made by the Commissioners? A. Yes; he was down there with me, and the complaint was heard - I was continued in the Police.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS COX. I live in Red Lion-street, Holborn - my father is a printer and bookbinder. On the 22nd of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at my father's door, and saw Fuller pass down the street, towards Holborn - he walked down as far as Mr. Kettle's, the bookseller's shop, which is the first door out of Holborn, and looked at the books: he was on the same side of the way as I was - I then saw the prisoner come down from Holborn, on the opposite side of the way, on the left hand side, coming from Holborn - he began stamping and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300022"></xptr>swearing at Fuller; I do not remember what he said -Fuller turned round to him, and walked over towards him- the prisoner kept going up Red Lion-street, towards the Foundling, still stamping and swearing, and Fuller following him; the prisoner then walked a little further on, and jumped into the road, saying "Catch me if you can," and at that instant the prisoner pulled out his knife -Fuller, when he saw the knife, went towards him, pulling his staff out of his pocket - then the prisoner made a stab at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what Fuller did with his staff? A. No- he went to catch hold of him, and after the prisoner made a stab at him he hit him over the hat - I could not tell whether the stab reached him or not; Fuller did not make any blow at the prisoner before that stab was made.</p>
               <p>Q.Which hand did the Policeman use when he tried to catch hold of his knife? A. He put his left-hand out to the prisoner, they then closed, and the prisoner had his left arm across the Policeman's back, and with his right hand he was stabbing him in the side - I did not see how many times he stabbed him; fuller then got away on the pavement, on the other side of the way - I was still on the right-hand side of the street, going from Holborn; when they got on the pavement they were fighting, and Fuller cried Murder! he got away, and ran down the middle of the street, towards Holborn - the prisoner followed him, and just as they got down close by Holborn, the prisoner stabbed him in the back; Fuller crossed Holborn - the prisoner then ran down Holborn, towards Featherstone-buildings, and there two men got hold of him, one took hold of each arm; he was carrying the knife in his hand - a man struck him.</p>
               <p>Q.Before he was stopped in Featherstone-buildings, did you observe any body try to stop him? A. No, we all got out of his way - he was secured, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How many people were there about the spot when the Policeman took the staff from his pocket? A. I saw a few there, but not many.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking away when the prosecutor followed him? A. Yes, he was walking on, and kept stamping and swearing - I did not hear the Policeman tell him to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have gone away if Fuller had not followed him? A.No; directly he saw the Policeman he began stamping and swearing at him - he walked on; they were face to face - the prisoner was jumping backwards; Fuller did not take his staff out till he saw the knife - he then went with his left hand to catch hold of the prisoner; the prisoner made a stab at Fuller before he struck him - I am sure the blow was not given at the same instant: he stabbed at him with the knife - he aimed towards his body, and then the Policeman struck at him; I did not state to the Magistrate that the first thing done was the Policeman's striking the prisoner on the head - the prisoner held the knife so (holding his hand out) and stabbed under; the Policeman did not strike at the same time as he went to seize the knife - the prisoner's head was bleeding as he laid in Featherstone-buildings, after he was stopped; I did not see him bleed while he was engaged with the Policeman.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of his receiving any injury to draw blood while he was engaged with the Policeman? A. No, I do not know one way or the other.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Where did the man strike the prisoner when he was stopped? A. On the forehead, and knocked him down.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Where did the Policeman strike the prisoner? A. On the crown of his hat - he did not touch his face with the staff at that time; I stood nearly behind the prisoner, but not quite - I was within a yard of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were you within a yard of him at the time you saw the prisoner making the first stab at him? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in the Holborn division on the 22nd of April - I came up after this happened, and saw the prisoner running down towards Brownlow-street; I saw him stopped by Plume the officer - I did not see him struck by any body; I assisted to secure him, and when we picked him up, he said,"I hope the b - y b - r is dead;" he said he went home on purpose to sharpen a knife to do for him, and said, "If I am committed and tried for him I shall die happy, for now I have had my revenge, for he called me an old cuckold;" I only heard him use that expression once going along - he had been drinking, but was sober enough to know what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did any body hear these expressions besides yourself? A.Not that I know of - I had hold of his arm at the time, leading him to the watch-house; Plume, the officer, had hold of his right side, but people were coming round him so that Plume was engaged in keeping peace and quietness - the prisoner was speaking to me all the way along very softly, very quietly; I paid every attention to what he said - I stated all this conversation at Hatton-garden; I did not see him struck in Featherstone-buildings, but I know he had been struck - I saw his head bleeding in front, but do not know who struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us have the expressions again? A. He hoped the b - y b - r was dead; that he went home on purpose to sharpen the knife to do for him, and if he was committed and tried for it he should die happy, for now he had had his revenge, for he called him an old cuckold.</p>
               <p>HENRY PLUME. I am a Police-constable. I was in Holborn on the 22nd of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, but not on duty - I saw Fuller running up Red Lion-street; he crossed Holborn, put his hand to his side, and said, "Oh!" I did not know he was stabbed - I directly after turned my head, and saw the prisoner running up on the left-hand side of Red Lion-street, with a knife in his hand - he turned the corner, and ran directly towards Featherstone-buildings; I was at that time at the corner of Red Lion-street, the opposite corner to that he came round - I pursued him, and attempted to take him, but he held the knife up to me in this manner, (over his head); I jumped off the pavement into the road, and seeing me going from him he turned his head and ran again - I immediately turned on him, and seized him by the arm; I saw Taylor strike him over the forehead with something - the blow produced blood; I had not noticed any blood on the prisoner's face before that blow was struck - other persons came up, and he was secured; I saw the knife fall from his hand when I seized him, and I have it here, (producing a shoemaker's knife) - it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300023"></xptr>bloody at that time; I went with him to the watch-house, and at the watch-house I heard him say, "I hope the b - r is dead, and I shall be hung, and I shall die happy;" he said that Fuller had laid with his wife, using a much coarser phrase, and he used similar expressions while going to the watch-house, to the same effect - I have had the prisoner in my custody before this; I never heard him say any thing with respect to Fuller before - he had been drinking, but not so as not to know what he was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were there several people at the watch-house at the time he used these expressions? A. Yes, seven or eight - he spoke in a loud tone; Riley was there - Riley and I had led him to the watch-house; I did not hear him say any thing to Riley on the road to the watch-house - I mean I did not hear him address Riley, but what he said he hallooed out in the street in a loud tone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any disturbance among the people which rendered it necessary that you should keep them off? A. There was a great mob following us, but I held the prisoner - they did not press on us; I had to push one or two that were rather in my way walking along - all the prisoner said going along was said in a loud and angry tone.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that all you heard him say was in a loud and angry tone? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BAKER. I am a Policeman, and was on duty in Theobald's-road. I saw Fuller at the corner of Lamb's Conduit-street, about half-past two o'clock - I spoke a few words with him; the prisoner came on the opposite side of the road, and walked over to the corner of Red Lion-street - he turned round, placed his back againt the post facing me, stamping with his feet, shaking his fist at us, and saying he should be hung for those two blue devils yet; Fuller afterwards turned up Red Lion-street - the prisoner followed him up that street as far as Princes-street, then stopped, and came back to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he doing when he followed Fuller? A. Nothing that I saw - he was out of my hearing; he then came back to me, and asked if I knew his son - I said I did not; he said a little boy had got the key of his shop, and he wanted to go to work - I gave him no answer; he said, "I mean to let them know it;" that is what he said when he turned from me - I do not know what he meant; I still kept him in sight till half-past three o'clock, because he kept on my beat, but he said nothing to me - I saw him again about four, at the corner of Red Lion-street; he stamped his feet, shook his fist in the same manner, and said he would be hung for those two blue devils yet - Fuller was then on the opposite side with me; he then returned down Theobald's-road to his wife, who sat with a stall at the corner of Great James-street, and Bedford-row - I lost sight of him then till five o'clock, and then saw him at the corner of Lamb's Conduit-street; he said nothing to me - he took a key from his little boy, and went away towards his shop; I saw him again at half-past six, in Theobald's-road - I do not know where he lives; he was coming from Gray's Inn towards Red Lion-street, between Bedford-row and Gray's Inn-lane - after passing me about three rods, he said, "I will stab the long b - r the first opportunity," and turning round, he said, "And you too if you don't mind;" Fuller was not present then - this was near Gray's Inn; he went over to his wife's stall, had a few words with her, and then went away - I followed him to the extent of my bear, which ends in Kingsgate-street; I do not know whether he observed me - I left him in Kingsgate-street, about five or ten minutes before seven o'clock; he stood stock still when I left him - he had been going in a direction towards St. Giles'; I left him at the upper end of Kingsgate-street, next Theobald's-road - I saw him at Hattongarden the next day, and there he said he hoped he had killed the long b - r, and then he should die happy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is "Blue devils" the expression usually used to Policemen? A. I cannot tell, I never heard it before - I do not think Fuller heard the expression; he was standing with his back towards me, and about a stride from me - what he said at Hatton-garden was in the room before he went before the Magistrate; there were some people there, but not a great many - I do not know any body else who heard it; I was sitting close by the side of him - he spoke inwardly, so that I could hear, as I sat by his side.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. I am a smith, and live in Red Lion-street. I saw the prisoner come into Red Lion-street a little after seven o'clock in the evening - I was standing at my door, which is four or five doors out of Holborn, on the left-hand side from Holborn; I saw the prisoner coming up the street, and as he got about opposite the butcher's shop, three or four doors from me, he ran into the road, in a kind of flustering attitude - I did not particularly notice him then, till the Policeman crossed into the road towards him, and when he got opposite to me, he (the prisoner) pulled a knife out; I heard him calling the prosecutor a blue b - r, or a black b - r, or something, when he took the knife out: he said, "I have been looking for you a long time, you b - r, and I will give it to you now;" he had the knife in his hand at that time, holding it out towards him, and said, "If you come near me I will stick you;" the Policeman then went towards him, and whether the Policeman struck him before he stabbed him, I do not know, for when I saw the knife in his hand jabbing at him, it gave me such a turn that I ran into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then directly you saw the stabbing begin, you ran into your own house? A. Yes, to get something to assist the Policeman - I armed myself with the poker, and when I came out the Policeman was running down the street, and the prisoner after him; I did not see him do any thing to the Policeman during the pursuit - they had got nearly to the end of the street; the prisoner turned round the corner - I followed, and took him at the end of Featherstone-buildings; I made a blow at him with the poker - I will not say whether I struck him on the head or shoulder, but I believe on the shoulder; the blow did not knock him down - he was stopped at the time by a person in a brown coat, who turned out to be a Policeman; the prisoner's face was towards me when I struck him - I did not observe any blood on his face before I struck him, but cannot say whether there was or not; he bled profusely afterwards, when we brought him into Holborn, to tie his hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How far was Fuller from the prisoner when you first saw him? A. I suppose he was full the length of one of the houses, eighteen or twenty feet - he was following the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300024"></xptr>Q. When the prisoner went into the road he went up to him? A. He did not go up to him, for the prisoner ran faster than Fuller; he got up to him beyond my door - the prisoner was running from him till he got the knife into his hand; I was three or four yards from them when he had the knife in his hand; I saw the staff in Fuller's hand, and saw him strike, which struck first I will not say - I saw a boy in Holborn. I do not know his name; there were several people about when the prisoner used those expressions - I do not know whether the boy was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner use that expression immediately before Fuller advanced to him, and when he had the knife in his hand? A. It was; he said, "I have been looking for you a long time, &amp;c.," immediately before Fuller advanced to him - after coming out with the poker, I ran after the prisoner from my shop to the end of Red Lion-street, and to Featherstone-buildings; I might have lost sight of him just in turning the corner - I did not see him strike Fuller after I came out with the poker; I think I struck the prisoner on the right shoulder.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.When this expression was used, was the prisoner standing still, or moving on? A. He was advancing towards the Policeman, having the knife in his hand.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of St. Bartholomew's hospital. I attended the prosecutor on the night he arrived in the hospital; he had a recently inflicted incised penetrated wound on the left side, between the fourth and fifth ribs, near the breast-bone - he had a similar wound in the integaments of the chest, on the left side, lower down, and a slight wound in the skin on the back of his chest, on the back of his shoulder - that was a slight wound; those were all the wounds which I noticed; this knife would be likely to produce such wounds - the first wound in the breast-bone was a very dangerous wound: he was about six weeks under my care - I conclude that that wound penetrated the lungs; I considered his life in danger from that wound - I could not pronounce him out of danger for a fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.How many other wounds were there? A. Two; I did not consider either of them dangerous - the one on the back was very slight - that could do no great bodily harm.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live at No. 3, Red Lion-street, three doors from Holborn, on the righthand side. About seven o'clock in the evening, I was outside my door, and observed Fuller a little below my house towards Holborn - the prisoner was on the same side of the way; my notice was attracted by seeing what I supposed was a tipsy man crossing the road, with a kind of shout or halloo - when he got on the other side he began shouting out in a kind of frantic way: Fuller followed him a little distance, keeping perhaps a dozen yards from him; I heard the prisoner call him a b - y b - r, and several names of that kind; he kept prancing backwards, or sideways - Fuller still followed, keeping about the same distance - he then said he would fight the b - y Police, he would fight the whole of them, he would take the whole body; by this time he had got a little below Mr. Taylor's house - he then crossed over to my side of the way; he was abusing the Policeman, and when he got on my side of the way he halted, and still kept on the same abusive language - a mob began to collect; I saw Fuller pull out his staff, merely, as I thought to keep him at bay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice at that time whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand? A. Not at that time, to the best of my knowledge - I was looking more at the Policeman at that time than at the prisoner; directly the prisoner saw the staff he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled something out; he then advanced into the middle of the road, and the light shone on the knife - he held it in his right hand, held it out, and said, "Come on now, you b - r, I will fight you;" he advanced to the Policeman in the middle of the road, from the pavement - he was exactly in the middle of the road when he used the expression; the road may be twelve yards wide - the Policeman was on the pavement: he advanced half way across the road to the Policeman, and struck out his right foot in the attitude of defiance, daring him to come on - the Policeman advanced to him then, and struck him over the head, at arm's length, keeping his chest open - the prisoner attempted to stab as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively whether the prisoner stabbed or attempted to stab before the blow was struck? A. No, I believe the Policeman struck him first, but he was daring him to come on; the prisoner kept attempting to stab as fast as be could - they came to a struggle, and fell; I afterwards found the Policeman stabbed - I did not see the wound given, though I saw the prisoner attempt to stab him several times: his hat fell off, and he ran - he turned his back, and ran towards Holborn; the prisoner followed him as close as he could, and when he came by the public-house door he made a thrust at his back with the knife.</p>

               <p>HENRY BROKENSHIR. I live at Mount Pleasant, and am a clerk. I was passing down Holborn about seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner annoying Fuller just at the corner of Red Lion-street, in Holborn - I cannot recollect the expressions he used, but they were very violent; the prisoner went down Red Lion-street, and Fuller also - the prisoner was on the right-hand side of the way, going from Holborn; previous to that Fuller had made several feints, as if to pursue him - I did not hear Fuller say any thing; the prisoner passed over towards Fuller, and Fuller drew his staff; I cannot say whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand when he crossed over towards Fuller- I saw him come quite close to him; Fuller struck him on the head with a staff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether the prisoner attempted to do any thing to Fuller before he struck him? A. No - I did not see the prisoner strike any blow before Fuller struck him; I was about twenty-five or thirty yards from them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.After the prisoner had been struck did you see him then do any thing? A. Yes - I did not see him put his hand into his pocket, or take any thing out; I saw him make two thrusts at the Policeman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see whether either of those thrusts took effect? A. They took effect, for the Policeman appeared faint when he ran away, but I cannot say even that the prisoner had a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see the prisoner's head broken from the blow with the staff? A. Yes, it was bleeding from the wound in the forehead.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When did you see him bleeding?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300025"></xptr>A. Not till I saw him captured and laying down; I have no reason to believe his head was broken from the blow, except from seeing it bleed after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lived nine years within two hundred yards of Hatton-garden office, and was never there in my life till this Policeman put a hand on me, through my wife, and what happened between them I cannot tell; the first time he attacked me I never said a word - he came up, and said, "I want you;" I said,"What charge have you?" he said, "I will tell you directly;" I said, "I won't go unless somebody gives charge of me;" I said, "I work for several houses in the neighbourhood, and every gentleman knows me;" he would not let me know the charge, but took me to the watch-house, and took 1s. 6d. from me - I never saw that money again; he took me before the Magistrate, and charged me with being disorderly in the street - the Magistrate asked if any body gave me in charge; he said "No - he struck me in the breast;" I was locked up, and had to get bail - in a month or two after wards I was in the street, and he took me again - I live about twenty yards from Lamb's Conduit-street; I was waiting there for a pair of shoes to mend - when he saw me he attacked me that day about complaining to the commissioners: after I had made the complaint I went with my wife to a public-house, about six o'clock one morning - he and a lot of Policeman were there drinking gin, and we had some; he said, "We are having a parting drop here, as we are going to leave the district, old woman: I know this old fellow," (calling me an old b - r); he said, "I know this old fellow is glad of it;" I said, "I don't care where you are going, if you let me alone;" a month or two afterwards my wife and I had some words - she said, "Police, come and take him;" he dragged me to the watch-house every time he chose and locked me up, and after taking me another time I was in the office yard waiting for my business, a serjeant was with him, and he said, "There's an old cuckold, I have his wife whenever I like; I know her well, and now I have buried my wife, I will keep her for a week, and then turn her up;" my little girl was by at the time; when I was taken before the Magistrate he asked what I had been doing - he said I was disorderly; the Magistrate said, "You have charges constantly against this man;" the officer said, "Your Worship. he is quite an innocent man, but takes a little drop of drink now and then;" the Magistrate said, "Well, discharge him" - this man saying he had buried his wife, and would have mine when he chose, I came home and broke my wife's stall, out of passion, then went to Mr. Mayne, the commissioner, who took down my complaint, and desired me to come at eleven o'clock the next morning - this man was there before me; I was outside in the hall - I was taken in, and not Mr. Mayne but some gentleman heard me; I told him he was constantly annoying me, and calling me a cuckold - I was ashamed of hearing the language before my children; I was turned out, and that was all the satisfaction I got - when I got back as far as Charing-cross he ran after me, and said,"You old cuckold, I will serve you out; if I can do nothing else I will swear you broke a window;" I told two or three neighbours of it, and begged him not to disgrace my children - one Saturday night, about a month after I made this complaint, I came out to go to a public-house, in Lamb's Conduit-passage - I had nothing on but my shirt; my waistcoat and coat were off - he caught me rapping at the public-house door; he said, "I have you, old fellow, and will be revenged on you;" he would not take me home, but took me round into Bloomsbury-square; another Policeman came behind me, and knocked me down - I declare it is as true as the Bible; I was looked up that night - I said, "Do you want to kill me?" for they all kicked me about - I got some bread and cheese in the morning, and next day, on my going up, he said to one Policeman, "You charge him, and I will swear to him;" they both swore against me, and said, I struck him in the breast - the Magistrate said, "Fine him 20s., or lock him up for a month;" the money was made up between my son and myself - I came out of prison, and about a week after he said, "Oh, you are out again, I will have you in again;" and when he met me he said, "Oh, you old cuckold, I will serve you out for going before the commissioners;" I said nothing to him - I came down to Jones', in the King's-road, and was talking to a young man; a ballad was being sung in the street, and he began to cough at me - I said, "It is a shame to persecute a man like me in that manner;" he said, "I know more than you are aware of; I will stick to you" - when he caught me alone he began langhing at me; I went to St. Giles' watch-house, and told the serjeants - they said, "Come up to-morrow night, and complain to the commissioner;" I went to the commissioner's room, and said, "I have been getting my living in the neighbourhood for nine years, but I must quit the place on account of this man, and I can bring a character from the neighbours;" the superintendent said, "I am bothered with you and Fuller, I would not believe you on your oath:" he took me in charge whenever he liked, and one morning in Lamb's Conduit-street, I saw him coming, and ran away - and on this day I was waiting to get something to eat, and he began laughing at me, about three o'clock; I believe I had had a glass or two of gin, and afterwards I was buying two pairs of upper leathers - when I got somedrink; I pawned the upper leathers, and have the duplicates to produce - I was coming home that night, and had 9d. in my pocket to get my supper; he met me, and said, "You are a cuckold, your wife was out last night," and that made me vexed - we began to jaw each other; I saw his staff, and ran away from him as fast as I could - he pursued me, gave me that stroke, cut me, and broke my hat - here is the cut he gave me, and the stroke of the staff; I staggered, and do not know what happened afterwards - I declare, as true as God is in Heaven, this is true - he said my wife made him take me at first, I know nothing about that; I do not know what is his reason for it at all.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FULLER here produced his clothes, which were bloody, particularly the shirt.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN ROADWAY. I am a horse-keeper, at the George and Blue Boar. On the evening the Policeman was wounded I was coming home - I live in Eagle-street; it was as near five minutes after seven o'clock as possible; I was carrying three stone bottles - I saw the Policeman and prisoner together in Red Lion-street; there was a crowd round them - when I first entered the street they were jawing, but I could not hear what they said; I walked on as fast as I could. and just as I got up within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300026"></xptr>twenty yards, the prosecutor pulled out his stick, and hit the prisoner over the head.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had the prisoner struck him? A. I had seen no blow - the prisoner struck him again, and in stopping the blow to defend himself, knocked his hat off; the prisoner hit him three or four times after that - he resented it with his fist, as I thought; I saw no knife in his hand - I was about five yards from him; I heard the prosecutor give a screech - I did not hear him cry Murder! I then went on with my bottles, as a crowd gathered.</p>
               <p>JAMES HUTCHINSON. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 20. Devonshire-street, Queen-square. I was at the corner of Red Lion-street on the 22nd of April, about seven o'clock, and saw two men standing talking, one of them had a leather apron on, the other was a Policeman - I do not know what they were talking about, but there was a Policeman came and took him by the arm, spun him round, and said, "Go along with you;" the man turned round, and resented it, and the Policeman gave him a second push, and said, "Go along with you, you d - d old cuckold;" with that the man turned round, and resented it again - he d - d him and said, "What do you mean by calling me a d - d old cuckold?" the Policeman laughed in his face, gave him a push, told him to go along, and said he could always get a good natured woman like his wife at any time, and laughed in the man's face - I never saw either of them before; a scuffle ensued between them - the Policeman pulled out his staff, struck the man over the head several times, knocked his hat off, and blood came from his ear, I believe - I saw the blood.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you go to the Police-office? A. No - two Policemen wished me to go, but I told them I did not like to interfere; Fuller did not wish me to go - he was not there; there was a stoutish man near Red Lionsquare, wished me to go, and a man who is now in the passage, wished me to go - I said I did not wish to go, as I had nothing to say in his favour, for he certainly insulted the man first; I did not wish to mix myself up with the transaction - I said that was my reason.</p>
               <p>Q. In which direction were you going - were you going down Holborn, or Red Lion-street? A.Red Lion-street; I first saw them in Red Lion-street, near Holborn; the man who was talking to him was on the same side of the way - that was another man, and then the Policeman came up - that was the beginning of it, to the best of my knowledge, at least it is what I saw - I did not hear the prisoner use any abusive language till after the prosecutor struck him- I did not hear him speak to him; I was only just going up at the moment the Policeman came up; they both used bad language - the man was irritated; before any blow was struck I heard the prisoner say, "D - n you, what do you call me an old cuckold for?" - there were so many words passed, I do not know what; I am sure the Policeman said he was an old cuckold - he was then within a yard and a half of me; I am sure Fuller is the man who used that expression, but he was not dressed as he is now - I saw two woman, and a man with two jugs there; I cannot say whether the man with the jugs was there when he called him a cuckold; I should think there were one hundred people there in the course of five minutes; I do not know any of them - I did not see the prisoner after he was taken into custody - the blood was about his forehead; his hat fell off, and with lifting up his arm the Policeman stuck, and I believe both their hats came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you saw blood on his head in Red Lion-street? A. Why, I can almost take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Almost take your oath? A. Well, I am sure of it then; I can take my oath of it conscientiously - I meant to say I dare take my oath.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The Policeman asked you to go to Hatton-garden; you said you could say nothing in the Policeman's favour, for the man had been used ill - did they afterwards send a summons for you to come? A. No - two men came to my house, but I did not see them; and who they came from I do not know.</p>
               <p>JAMES SULLIVAN. I am in the employ of Mr. Perry, who keeps a public-house in Red Lion-street; I know Fuller - before the day on which he was stabbed I heard him call the prisoner an old Irish cuckold; the prisoner was not by at the time - I do not know where he was; I once saw him disputing with the prisoner, who was standing near a post - he said, "Go on, Irish," and,"There is an old cuckold;" the prisoner could hear that, I have no doubt - Fuller came to our house next morning, and was talking to our bar-maid; he said what he had done yesterday, and what a row he had with the Irish thief - he said if he had an opportunity he would knock him down with his staff, and that he insulted him first; I said, "No, you insulted him first."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was this before the 22nd of April? A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is the name of the bar-maid? A. I do not know - she has left; some more Policemen were there at the time - when Fuller used these words in the street, the prisoner was on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>JOHN BYRNE. I am a journeyman boot and shoemaker, and live in Smith's-court, Brewer-street. I have known the prisoner from his infancy - he is a good hearted humane man as ever I met with in my life; I know he was in the habit of carrying a shoemaker's knife about seven years ago; he used to take it backwards and forwards to his house to cut his soles with - on the morning of the 22nd of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I met him and a young man coming from his stall; I asked him for some money which he owed me - he said he had some shoes to make, and to-morrow he would pay me; he showed me some leather he was going to cut, and he had the knife also - he went to a currier's shop; I met him coming out, rolling up some upper leathers - he said,"Now, if you have any money treat, and I will pay you altogether;" we went into a public-house, and had two pots of ale, which I paid for - I saw the blade of the knife coming out of his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>JAMES LOWE. I am a currier and leather-cutter. I have known the prisoner seven years - he dealt with me; he always appeared mild and agreeable - about seven o'clock on this morning he came to my shop, and cut part of his leather, which he had bought the night before; I supplied him with a knife, or he used one of his own, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOWELLS. I know the prisoner. On the morning of the 22nd of April, about seven o'clock, or halfpast, I saw him with this knife in his possession going to the leather-cutters; I was with him nearly the whole day - he had the knife with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300027"></xptr>MR. BODKIN. Q. How late in the day did you see him with the knife? A. I left him at half-past twelve o'clock, and returned to him again at three, when he was looking after his son for the key; I did not see him get the key from his son - he did not go to his stall while I was with him; I left him after the accident happened - I was walking on a few paces, and saw what took place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Who struck the first blow? A. Mr. Fuller - I suppose I was fourteen or fifteen feet off; he had not his knife out at that time, to my knowledge - he very frequently carried the knife about with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carry the knife about to cut old boots and shoes with.</p>
               <p>CHARLES KETTLE re-examined. I was about twenty - five yards from him when I saw him strike.</p>
               <p>Five other witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

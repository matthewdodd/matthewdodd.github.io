                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Strahan, 5, Osborne-street—he is an india-rubber manufacturer—on the morning of 29th June I heard a noise, between 3 and 4 o'clock—I was disturbed in my bed by hearing somebody going out of the side door, which caused me to wake my husband—he flew to the window, and saw the prisoner going up the street with a bundle—I did not see the prisoner with a bundle in her possession—I saw her running, and hallooed out, "Stop thief"—when I saw her run out of my side door, two policemen were there, and they followed her—my husband afterwards produced this bundle to me—it contains three frocks and some other things—they are my property.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 490). On the morning of 29th June, I heard the last witness crying "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—I ran and stopped her—I took a bundle from her person, containing these articles produced and several other things, which were ordered to be given up by the magistrate—I asked the prisoner where she got the things—she said she was going by and saw the door open, and saw a dress hanging up, and she had lived there before, and she went in and took the dress—as I was going back towards the house I said to her, "What have you got be<lb></lb>hind here?"—she said, "I have another dress"—it being dark, I could not see what it was; it was under her dress—I took her to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>) These dresses are mine, and were safe the night before—I locked np the house at 11 o'clock; at that time they were safe—I saw the prisoner going away from the door between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning—when I went to bed, the side door was fastened; in the morning it had been forced open; the top bolt was wrenched off—the pri<lb></lb>soner had not been in my house—I have lived there 31 years—I never saw her to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been to a fire, and as it was late I did not like to go home to my lodging—I sat down on a step and fell asleep—some per<lb></lb>sons came and told me to carry this bundle, and they would show me where to go—I stood waiting for them, and was going away, and I was taken—I could not see anything more of the men who gave them to me—I was treated by some men who gave me more than I ought to have—they gave me those things.</p>

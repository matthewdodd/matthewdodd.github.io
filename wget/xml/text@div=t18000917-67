               <p>JOHN MARCH sworn. - The prisoner came to live with me in March 1799; she said, that she understood I wanted some person to take care of my house; I asked her what wages, she said, she did not want wages, she wanted peace and quiteness, she referred to a M. Le Marchand, a counsellor of the Parliament of Rouen; he came with her, and said she was a very proper person.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At <placeName id="t18000917-67-crimeloc367">Knightsbridge</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was any application made to you by Mr. Winden, to settle an account for bread? - A. No, nor did I know that such a man did exist, till I was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you furnish the prisoner, from time to time, with money to pay for the articles of housekeeping? - A. Yes, regularly every day, constantly</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of August, was there any dispute between you and her, with respect to accounts? - A. I was arrested upon a note which I never gave; I sent for Mr. Winden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, during the explanation, stay in your house, or did she run away? - A. She left the house; I then examined my plate, and, instead of finding it, I found but three silver knives.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of the place where the plate was deposited? - A. She had, and went away with the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time give her authority to pawn any of your plate? - A. Never; I called at Bow-street, when I left the spunging-house, and got a search-warrant; I was present when the house was searched; I found this pocket-book full of duplicates, and in searching the drawers, they found other tickets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had no dispute with the prisoner till the 25th of August last? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lived in perfect harmony with her? - A. Yes, as much as a master can do with a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it extremely odd that you should be arrested, and she be the means of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the dispute arose? - A. I had no dispute.</p>
               <p>Q.You were a little angry at her being the means of your being arrested? - A. Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you prefer a bill of indictment to the Grand Jury at this sessions, for forging that note upon which you were arrested? - A. I did</p>
               <p>Q. And the Grand Jury threw out that bill, did not they? - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this note, and this dispute, did she remain in your house? - A. She went away directly, I never saw her again till I saw her at the bar at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that she went to Mr. De Clerville's, and that he came with her the next day to Bow-street? - A. I did not think Mr. De Clerville capable of so base an action, after he had eaten and drank, and been cloathed in my house for five years, and after I had begged for him -</p>

               <p>Q. In December last, did you pawn any thing, and what? - A. I never have since the prisoner has been in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never redeem any property which was pawned in December last by the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in December last? - A. I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those things that you redeemed? - A. A gold watch and a diamond ring, and to the best of my recollection I never redeemed any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner live with you after that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. A month? - A. More than that.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that you never gave her authority to pledge any thing? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. There was that ring, you know? - A. I pledged it by some person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not send it by the prisoner? - A. To the best of my recollection, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that ring pawned for 10l. during the time that the prisoner lived with you? - A. I cannot recollect; I gave her a watch to pledge for me that I had redeemed.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave her no wages at all? - A. I gave her a present now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not in the character of a servant to you? - A. I never took her in any other shape.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not dine with you, and sit at table? - A. Yes, she did; she prepared the dinner, and dined with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you never gave authority to the prisoner to pledge any of the articles, except the watch? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the habit of pawning your plate for some time? - A. When I wanted money, I thought it was better to go to the pawnbroker's, than to go for the bills that were owing to me; I have done so for fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you ever given the prisoner authority to pledge any one of those articles for which the is now indicted? - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Q. And though you had this opinion of her, you go to visit her in prison? - A. I would go a hundred miles to see her.</p>

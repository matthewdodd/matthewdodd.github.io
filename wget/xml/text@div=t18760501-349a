                  </hi>. I live at 32, Searles Terrace, Deptford, and am a time<lb></lb>keeper to Frederick Braby &amp; Co., Limited—this is a certificate of the incorporation of the company—on Saturday, 8th April, I had a communi<lb></lb>tion from Brown, a fitter in the employ, after which I went in company with Steele, the foreman of carpenters, to the prisoner; I found him by the side of the trying up machine, at the company's works, at Deptford, about 11.20 a.m.—he was in the machine room—there are three machines there, a general joiner machine, a moulding machine, and a trying up machine—they are worked by steam, the prisoner was employed as a general machinist, to do any kind of work that might be turned out by those three machines, a piece of board was produced and Steele-asked him to pass it through the trying up machine—he said there was not time to do it—I said "What do you mean by not having time to do it, it is now only 11.20, there is plenty of time to do it"—he said "I will see you b——first or any other man, is it likely when my head is off at 12 o'clock, that I should leave the machines so that any other man could work them after me"—I said "Webster, consider your character, unfortunately you are one out of eleven that are off to-day through slackness of work; if you have done anything to the machines, put them to rights for the sake of your own character"—he said there was not time to do it—I said time should be no obstacle in his way as I would have steam run till 1 o'clock, or later if it was required for him to do it—I remained with him about ten minutes, trying to persuade him to put the machines to rights—he replied that he would not do so, he would leave the machines so that no person could work them after him—I said if that was his determination I should have to go to the office and acquaint Mr. Hart, the manager of it—I went and informed Mr. Hart and returned with him to the prisoner, that was about 11.40 or 11.35—he was still in the same place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not examined before the Magistrate, I was at the Court, I heard the prisoner make a statement there—he had been in the company's employ two years and three weeks—the general joiner machine was on the works when he came, the others were added afterwards, about two years ago, but they had only been at work about sis months—I believe I wheel of the general joiner was broken once—if the machinery got slightly out of order he would do it himself, but if it required repairs, it would go to the fitters'; it did sometimes require a little repair, and that would be he prisoner's duty—part of the trying up machine is wire roping,; I never heard complaints of their slipping—I am always through the shop; I have. general superintendence all through the works—I have seen the prisoner til the machines and shift our piece of work out and put in another, the utters can be taken out, ground and sharpened, they are in the moulding machine—the prisoner would be told of the notice to leave by the manager then he came to the pay table on the Saturday—they are all paid at 12 'clock on Saturday, then they would knock off—he would come at 9 o'clock on Saturday morning—we had about thirty men then employed on the works; there is no set quantity of men, it all depends upon the class of work there is—on this morning eight or ten were at work at the machines, of in the workshop—others would be passing and could see the machines—was about 11.30 when Brown came to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Victoria Works of the company at Deptford—on Friday, 17th April, at miday, I gave directions to Harvie that then should be discharged—one of the carpenters came into the office while was giving those instructions—on the Saturday morning Harvie came and</p>

               <p>made a communication to me and I went to where the prisoner was, about 11.45 or 11.40—I said to him "Before I pay you your money I shall require to see your three machines in motion"—he said "I will sec you b——first, it is nearly 12 o'clock, and there is no time to do it"—I told him that I would have the steam kept going for him till 12.30 to enable him to work the machines, and I added that I would pay him for his over time—he then said "I will put this machine in motion," and he got his sharpen<lb></lb>ing stone to sharpen the cutters in the trying up machine—I said "That won't do, it will take you too long to sharpen the knives and it is not neces<lb></lb>sary, I want to see the machines in motion"—he refused, saying "Iam not going to leave these machines for any other man to come in and work them, I will put them in working order if you will all go out of the place"—I then told him that he should have nothing more to do with the machines and that he must go out of the works, and refused to pay him his wages—in the yard he took off his coat and made some remark to the effect that he would make mo pay, but he thought better of it, and at last we got him out of the yard and he went away—before he went he put the moulding machine in gear for about ten seconds and then took it off again—after he left I in<lb></lb>structed Brown to examine the machines; they were examined in my pre<lb></lb>sence—on the Monday morning, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner came into my office, I had sent for a policeman and I gave him in custody on this charge—I saw him turn out his pockets at the police-station, and there were fifteen pieces belonging to the machines—after he was sent for trial a piece of wire rope was brought to me by Samplin—I have compared that with the remainder of the rope belonging to the trying-up machine and it cor<lb></lb>responds, it was cut from it—if repairs were required for the machines it was the prisoner's duty to report them for repair, and Brown, the fitter would do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot tell in how many months last year he was engaged in repairing the machinery—I am there every day from 10 till 5 o'clock about the works, superintending—I may have had instructions to shorten hands for some months, as soon as the work in hand would enable us to do it—the prisoner worked by the hour—there was no arrangement as to notice, and I should not give him any until he came to the table to be paid—I could not say whether the moulding machine worked properly it was in motion such a short time—he was very abusive, he was the worse for liquor—he sent on Sunday to say that he wanted to come and put the machinery right; I was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fitter in the company's service—I am thoroughly acquainted with these machines; if repairs are required it is my place to do them and no one else—I was on duty at the works from day to day in the week preceding 8th April—the machines ran all right and were at work, and the prisoner was working them; he made no complaint of their being out of order—on Saturday, 8th, I had occasion to go into the place where the machines were, about 11 o'clock in the morning—I observed the pri<lb></lb>soner drinking some liquor out of a bottle; he was in drink—I said to him "Jem, lend me a shilling"—he said "Yes, mate, I will," and in pulling his hand out of his pocket I observed a marking stud like one of these (<hi rend="italic">produced;</hi>—I said "Let me look at that"—he closed his hand—I said again "Let me look at it, Jem"—he said "No, I will not let you see it, or any other man"—I asked what it was for—he said "A moulding machine"—I went and acquainted Mr. Harvie of it; I knew it belonged to machinery, but I did</p>

               <p>not know that it belonged to ours, as I had not examined it, he had no right to have it in his pocket—I have since ascertained that they <hi rend="italic">belong</hi> to the machinery—I found the place for them, two in the moulding machine, and one in the trying-up machine, I am positive of it—I was afterwards present when Mr. Hart and Mr. Steele were there—Mr. Hart asked the prisoner to put the machines in motion and plane a piece of wood—he said at first ha would if we all went out—he afterwards said "I will see you b——first"—Mr. Hart asked him again—he said "No, I will not, I have had to get the machines right and I will not leave them right for anyone else"—after he was got away I made an examination of the machinery—as to the trying up machine, I found a half-inch stud missing at the foot of the block spindle and the cutter block spindle—the machine could not be worked for any time without these—I found two keys missing belonging to the feed motion—the effect of their absence would be that the machine would be entirely useless—the drum spindle was displaced altogether, and I found two collars moved and one five-eighths set screw slackened and another taken out, the one found in his pocket—the wire rope was cut, the end nearest the drum, apparently by a hammer and chisel, there was a part of it missing—it is attached to each end of the table to draw backwards and forwards—there was about 18 inches of the rope missing—the piece that has been shewn to me very much corresponds with the end that is cut, as near as I can say—there was one more screw taken away from the drum that fastened the rope to the drum—I have given you now the result of my investigation of the trying up machine on Saturday, and in the state I found it; it was entirely useless—on the Monday I examined the mould machine—as to the cutter block spindle I found this block nut (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)taken away—this is one of the fifteen pieces—the <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> of it—would be dangerous, because it would allow the spindle to work sideways and with a cutter being on the block (they run so often) that if it had got any side play it would cut on the sides as it came round, and of course the least thing would break them—if one was standing there it is quite likely one would go into them—I found two screws missing from the cutter block slide; they are here—the effect of heir removal would render that part entirely useless—these screws (<hi rend="italic">two produced</hi>)belong to some spindles for steadying them; they are called set crews—I found two three-eighths screws likewise missing, they are here—here is scarcely a bolt of any kind or a nut that was not slackened—the effect would be, on the cutters, as soon as ever they touch the wood it would cause them to fly off the cutter knives, that would be dangerous, quite likely) stick into anyone—the revolution of the moulding machine, the speed, would be about 3,000; the machine in the condition in which I found it would be of no use for the purpose of manufacture—the joiners' machine I examined and found it quite right; it has been worked since—there is no ate of circumstances to render necessary such tampering with the mould<lb></lb>ing machine—it will take a person about three days and a half to put these machines in working order—apart from the defendant tightening a screw which might slacken with work, he had nothing whatever to do with arrang<lb></lb>ing or repairing the machinery.</p>

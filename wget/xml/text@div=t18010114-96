             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Messrs. Pearce; the prisoner was employed as a cutter in the warehouses; On the 6th of December I went into the room, and observed that he had something concealed behind his coat; I charged him with having something about him; he seemed confused, and made no reply; I charged him a second time, and he produced the blue cloth from under his coat and waistcoat; he begged forgiveness, and said it was a bit of blue cloth that he had taken, and that it was his first offence, (produces it); the prisoner was cutting the same coloured cloth at the same time; to the best of my knowledge it is the property of Mr. Pearce.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I did not mean to take that cloth to sell it, to make a property of it, I meant to have made me a waistcoat, and got a coat out of pledge, because I thought my garb was so mean, that it kept me out of employ; I have a wife and four children, I have been been out of employ for four months; I hope you will consider me an object of pity more than any thing else.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him an excellent character. <rs id="t18010114-96-verdict538" type="verdictDescription">

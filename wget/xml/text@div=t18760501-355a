                  </hi>. I am a clothier at 98, Powis Street, Woolwich—the prisoner was a salesman and-traveller in my service—his duty was three days a week to solicit orders, to deliver the goods, and receive the money—the goods would be entered by myself in my daybook, and if not paid for at the time, they would be entered to the customer in the ledger—his duty was to account to me for the money he received the next morning—he has never accounted to me for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Hills on 8th July; he accounted for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Such on 30th December, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 10th February, but not for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has not accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Plummer on 5th January—I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether on Plummer's</p>

               <p>account of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a traveller named Austin, in consequence of something that occurred I gave Austin into custody—I then called the prisoner into my room and asked him if he had heard of Austin's affair, he said he had—I said "Well, I should like to know if your customers' acconnts are in any better state?"—he said "No, they are not"—I said "It will save me a great deal of trouble if you will make out a list of the amount of your defalcation," and I sat down and went through the ledger name by name, and wrote this list at his dictation—it contains the names of Hills, Such, and Plummer—he said the money should be paid in the course of the day—I said "It is too late now"—after that I asked him if he would like to see his wife; he said yes and I sent for her and she came—I said nothing to him about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made subsequent inquiries that same day and gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 23rd of February, that I spoke to him—I gave him into custody about 9.30 the same evening—he was not under notice to leave—he was not locked up in my sitting-room till 8.30; he was there—I saw his wife about 10 o'clock or 10.30 in the morning; she went away, and returned about 10 o'clock—I did not say to the prisoner that I would take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover everything—my conversation was with the wife—he has been in my employ about six years; he came first as salesman—I don't think his salary was as much as two guineas a week; he had no commission—he commenced travelling about three years ago for three days a week, and the other three days he acted as salesman in the shop—he had 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as traveller and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for ex<lb></lb>penses—I keep my own books; these three accounts are entered in the day<lb></lb>book and ledger—I told his wife that he had received these amounts and not paid them over; she begged me not to prosecute him on account of her<lb></lb>self, her family, and friends, and asked me what I thought the amount was—I said I should fancy somewhere about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she then went away, saying she was going to see her brother-in-law, and asked me not to lock the pri<lb></lb>soner up till she had seen her brother-in-law—I told her I would wait; I did not wait—the prisoner did not tell me that he bad used the' money in the course of the business.</p>

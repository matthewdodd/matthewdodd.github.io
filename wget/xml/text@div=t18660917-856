                  </hi>. I am married and am a laundress—I live at 4, John Street, Greenwich—on Friday, 20th July, I was at work at my ironing board, when the prisoner came in and struck me with a stone on the head three times, and the last time the stone flew out of his hand and hit the cupboard door—he then walked out of the house—it was the half of a large pebble, about the size of my hand—it was taken to the station and the doctor saw it—I was in a gore of blood, and Dr. Ryland was sent for—I was laid up, and have not been well since; the doctor is still attending me—I had not spoken to the prisoner, and had not seen him—I had done nothing to provoke this—I have only taken my daughter in when he has ill-used her—she is his wife—she was at Leytonstone at the time.</p>

                  </hi>., M.R.C.S. I live at 8, South Street, Green-wich—I examined the prosecutrix the same evening, and found her suffer<lb></lb>ing from two contused wounds on the scalp—the openings were not very large, but the contusions around them were about the size of a crown piece—she had been bleeding very freely, but the blood had stopped when I arrived, and she seemed to be in a very nervous state from the shock to her system, and was suffering much pain—I attended her for a week and have seen her occasionally since—she still suffers from giddiness and dim<lb></lb>ness of vision—such a stone as she describes would cause the wounds—the blows must have been very violent, as they cut through her head-dress—the bones were not injured—the wouuds must have been produced by a jagged point somewhere on the stone—a stone about half the size of my fist was shown to me which would very likely have caused the wound, as it was not perfectly even—I cannot say whether there is any permament injury—she seems to suffer still.</p>

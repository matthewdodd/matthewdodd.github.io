                  </hi>. I am a velvet-weaver, and live in Straits-mouth, Green<lb></lb>wich. On Friday, the 4th of March, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was in a public-house near London-bridge—I had four half-sovereings in my pocket—I changed one, and put the change, which was two half-crowns and five shillings, with the other three half-sovereigns in my right-hand trowsers pocket, expecting to have to pay a few shillings on my road to Deptford—I was going by the railway but it had just closed—I spoke to the prisoner Dust, who is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> mau, or he to me, to take me—he asked me how far I was going—I said, to Greenwich, that I was going over the way, and if he would come with me I would speak to him—he fol<lb></lb>lowed me to the public-house, and I agreed with him to carry me to Dept<lb></lb>ford-cross—he went out, came in again, and asked if I had any objection to allow a young woman to ride part of the way with me—I said, "Why if it is any benefit to you I have no objection"—he went in and out seve<lb></lb>ral times, at last the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was ready—I got in and was very glad to find no one in it—he drove some little distance, and by a turning as I thought by St. George's church, he pulled up all at once, in the dark and took in two females—I consider it was by St. George's church, but it was dark, and I could not be on my oath as to the exact spot—St George's church is in the road, but he turned down into Kent-street—I had two coats on—I clapped them over so that nobody could get at my pocket—the women came in, sat one on each side of me, and put their hands about me—I put their bands off as well as I could, and said, "You are mistaken, I am an old man, when I was a young man-of-war's-man I might joke with you"—they forcibly dragged my clothes open—one of them <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her hand right into my trowsers, took hold of me in an indecent manner, and pulled me so hard that I was in pain, and to get her hand away I was obliged to turn to her, and while I did so the other one took every thing I had clean out of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040258"></xptr>
               <p>my pocket—I buttoned up as quick as I could, remained still, and took no further notice—I did not find out that my money was gone till I got out at New-cross—I then immediately put my hand into my trowsers' pocket and walked into Seabrook's public-house—my pickets were very deep, I could hardly get my hand to the bottom myself—I found all my money gone from that pocket—I had a trifle in my waistcoat-pocket—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> first—immediately on missing my money I said to the <hi rend="italic">cab-man,</hi> "I have lost three half-sovereigns"—I do not know exactly what reply he made, but he wanted to run off with his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he did not drive off—he was not on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> but on the ground—he attempted to get on the box—the women were then out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—one of them jumped in again, got out at the other door, and escaped—the other one was standing to <hi rend="italic">go</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">cab-man</hi> did not say a word to the women when he first of all let them into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> nor they to him—they got in immediately he stopped—they <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> in, I could hardly see what they were, and should not have known them again—he helped them in, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> them in—I heard no agreement made where they were going, what they were to pay, or any<lb></lb>thing of the kind.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you were a velvet-weaver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider I am—I am also a Greenwich pensioner, and support three orphan children, besides my wife and family—I had come up to London on business that day—I had had three half-pints of beer in the morning, and 4<hi rend="italic">d,</hi> of rum and water in the afternoon—that was all I had drank until this occurred—I was not ten minutes in the public-house by London-bridge—I did not sit down there—I called for a pint of beer, as a shipmate asked me to have a glass of ale with him, but I gave it away to anybody that would drink it—I do not know the exact place where the women got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I swear I was sober at the time, and collected in every respect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the women behaved so indecently, why not call out to the cabman to stop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew it was no use, for they might have got out and taken away the money altogether—I thought it better to let them be till I caught sight of somebody else—I did not know for certain that I had been robbed till I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the Rose public-house, New-cross—I went into the Rose, but was not there a minute scarcely—if the women went in I never asked them, and knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you all four go into the Rose public-house after getting out of the cab? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Like enough—they were no company of mine—I do not know whether they were inside or outside the door—I was not positive I had lost my money till I got into the house—I did not give any money to either of the women in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I am certain of that—I had never seen them before they got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I might have passed them on the road and not have known them—I never had anything to say or do with them—they might have been in the same public-house where I was, but I never saw them to my knowledge—I have been married thirty-two years, and was married at Hackney church—my wife was in the Court at Greenwich when the examination was going on—I did not say then that I did not like to give any particulars about what passed with the women in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> because my wife was there—I said nothing like it—I told the Magistrate that they behaved very indecently—I did not mind my wife hearing it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dust.</hi> When we got to the Post Boy, you told me to go on further; we went on to New Cross; you asked me what the fare was—I said, "Two-and-fourpence, but I hope you will give me half-a-crown;" yon said, "Come in here, and I will pay you;" we went inside; you called for <hi rend="italic">id.</hi> worth of rum and water, and gave me half-a-crown; you kept feeling your pockets, and said, "I think I have lost my money"—I said, "If you have, you had better make it right before I go away." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You might have said so, but not as I recollect—I paid you your fare, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. over—I said, "I am robbed," and followed you to the door—you were outside the door—you did not offer to run away when the policeman came.</p>
               <p>Fraser. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were we not at the public-house, by London-bridge, eat<lb></lb>ing bread and cheese when you came in. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know anything about you—I did not give the cabman 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi> on the road, to pay for a pint of rum—I did not say that two was company, and three none, and say I would give you a trifle if you got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I bought a set of ra<lb></lb>zors at the foot of London-bridge, and gate 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—the man did not show me a piece of cloth for velvet, nor did I say I would not wear such a paltry thing, that I was a velvet-weaver, and could always <hi rend="italic">cabbage</hi> enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could the woman know all this if she was not with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They might be standing about the Railway Tavern, so they tell me—I did not tell them anything in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about my buying razors—I bought the razors of a man who was standing there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any man offer you any cloth for sale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it is all a fiction—I certainly bought the razors, and paid for them—I did not tell the prisoners I was a velvet-weaver, nor mention it at the tavern—I said it at the office—no woman was going to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with me at the tavern—I rode off by myself—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> had asked me to let a woman ride with me, but I expected he had forgotten it, and I was very glad of it—I did not say, "Let the woman come in"—I never saw the women then.</p>

               <p>got about them was one silver sixpence; they were willing to be searched there and then—I said, "You must all of you go with me to the station"—at the time the female prisoners got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and out again, Dust was standing at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door which they got in at—I said "You must drive to the station"—he said, "Who is going to pay me?"—I said, "Never mind about paying; you will be paid, no doubt"—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>

I said, "I don't mind;" he said, "Don't go in there, there is a friend of mine there." We got into the <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> we had not been in five minutes before he said, "I did not know that two of you were coming, two is company, and three none." I got out and rode with the cabman; when we got a little way he knocked at the window, and asked the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to get some<lb></lb>thing to drink, and to get what he liked for himself; he went and fetched half-a-pint of rum, and when we got a little further we had a quartern of gin; when we got to New Cross he pulled out 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he wanted some rum and water; he asked me if I had got a penny. I said no, I had only got a half-a-crown and a halfpenny, which I had to take home with me, and Thornton knows the same.</p>

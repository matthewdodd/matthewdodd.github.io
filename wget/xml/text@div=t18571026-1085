               <p>him some bristles for sale, on the Wednesday, of which these were, the samples; that he offered them at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and he had gone to Mr. Frinneby to offer them to him at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, less 2 1/2 per cent, nett cash; that Mr. Frinneby had asked him for the samples, and he, had taken them to him; that he then asked to see the bulk, and he told him that he had not got it; that he received the sample back from Mr. Frinneby on the Friday, who stated that he believed they were part of the stolen property referred to in the bills—it was then Monday at 1 o'clock, and I said that I should like to know how it was that he had not come and told us before, since he had been told this on the Friday and had received the bill, offering the reward, on the same day—he said that he thought we were closed on Saturdays—I asked him why he did not go to the inspector on duty at the station, as he did not close on Saturday—he made no reply—he showed me the bristles, and I told him that I recognised them as the stolen property—I asked him for a description of the man—he said, "A man about your height, very pale, as white as a sheet, with little or no whiskers, and dressed in dark clothes;" that he stated to him that he had been recommended to him by some one whose name he had forgotten, as he was very busy at the time, and that he then offered him the bristles for sale, and that the man was to call on him again to receive his answer whether he would buy them or not, and that he might even then be at his warehouse, in which case he had given his foreman orders to take him into custody—I asked him distinctly whether he had the bulk, and he said that he had only the sample—he then left, taking the sample with him—about 7. o'clock that evening I went to Prichett's premises—I had not intimated to him that I intended to come—I had officers waiting in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> outside—I went in alone, and saw Pritchett in his counting house—I said that from the wilful delay that had taken place, he had placed us in a very difficult position, since whatever clue we might have gained was thereby lost, and that it was necessary that he should give me a more specific account or description of the man who had called on him on the Saturday—he said that he would give me every assistance in his power, and again gave me the description, which I wrote down on one of his invoice papers—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Five feet six or seven inches, dark coat, short, respectably dressed, fair, pale, no whiskers; stopped about ten minutes, busy; gave precaution; no name; recommended by Smith; did not ask his address; Wednesday, 13th Sept., between 3 and 4 o'clock: Thursday to Frinneby, between 10 and 11 A.

               <p>give us every assistance in his power—I told him that at 12 o'clock that night the affair would be out of my hands entirely, but that I should return again in half an hour, when I expected he would have a statement to make that would prevent further disagreeable proceedings—I then left him—I returned in half an hour, and asked him if he had anything to say—he said that he had been over to a friend of his, but that his friend was out of town till evening, and would not be there till next day—I asked the name; he Briley—I asked the address; he said No. 78, Kent Street—I told him to remain where he was, and that I should go round to Briley's—I went round to Briley's place, but did not see him—I subsequently saw him in the neighbourhood with an officer, and he accompanied us; but when I found that Briley was not there, I went back to Pritchett, and took him with me to show me Briley's stables, and when I came back with Pritchett, Briley was standing outside his door in Kent Street—the stables are in Castle Street—Pritchett pointed him out as Briley—after searching the stables we all went back to Pritchett's house—I told Pritchett that the more I saw of it the worse it appeared, that it seemed more and more suspicious; that he had a name and a business, and that if he knew of the thieves or of the property, to give me the information in reference to it, and on my word of honour as a gentleman, I would assist him to the best of my power—he said, "Do not move in this affair any further till 9 o'clock to-morrow, when every hair you have lost shall be returned to your office"—I said "No; the affair is gone too far for any compromise, and to-night shall settle it"—we then went on to Pritchett's house, went in, and saw the foreman with a spade in his hand, and saw a cask buried in the earth, but not covered—on opening that cask we found the bristles which are produced here—they ought to have been all in blue paper, each done up in a parcel—when they are used as samples the paper is torn off—we always send them out in blue paper—the bundles would tumble to pieces if the paper was torn off—these cost 800 francs the case, less 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent. discount—the cost is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound, reckoning the freight and other expenses—the selling price was then about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that these were bought very cheaply—I asked Pritchett to give me the proportions of the case which the man had given to him, and the weight of each size of bristles—he took some torn pieces of paper up from a corner of his office, and, putting them together, showed me a list of the contents—I have not got it—I left it there, not thinking it of any particular consequence—I know that the proportions in the case were peculiar—I never opened it to see, but I had given the orders myself for it's preparation—the ordinary cases contain a certain number of each size—a written order is given to our house in Paris.</p>

Delavalle and Forey, in Paris, are agents for the house in London; Mr. Forey gave me the order—the bristles were prepared by numbers; the case was 100 kilogrammes—they were tied up in blue papers, like these, and were marked on the root—I identify these as part of them (<hi rend="italic">Opening a fresh packet</hi>)—I believe well that these are my bristles, but I cannot seriously affirm it—I recollect the composition of the case from memory, but it is also written in my books—there were fifteen kilogrammes of No. 2, sixteen of No. 3, twenty-seven of No. 4, twenty-seven of No. 5, ten of No. 6, and five of No. 7; there were none of No. 8—that was the only order we have made containing No. 7—the order was sent in my vehicle to the house of Delavalle and Foret.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner in a second-class car<lb></lb>riage, on the 15th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—she was going down to Birmingham—I said, "You are my prisoner, I suppose you know what it is for?"—she said, "Yes"—I took her to the station, and told her it was for robbing her master of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I searched her pocket, and found a coral necklace, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a half-sovereign, and a duplicate of a ring pledged for half-a-crown—I have left the duplicate at home—I asked the prisoner when I took her if she had any luggage—she said she had—I got a small red morocco trunk and two baskets out of the train, from the department in which she was sitting—she owned them—I found a key in her pocket with which I opened the trunk in her presence—I found in it two cotton dresses, a pair of fur boots, and a pair of gloves—in one of the baskets was a cotton dress not made up, and one made up, a new worsted shawl with a ticket on it, and a silk pocket handkerchief not new—on the Monday, I asked what she had done with the other coral necklace—she said she had lost it out of her pocket—I cautioned her before 1 ques<lb></lb>tioned her.</p>

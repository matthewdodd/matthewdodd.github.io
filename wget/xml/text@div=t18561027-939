                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Governor and Company of Copper Mines in England; their office is in Broad-street-mews. In Jan. last the prisoner was in their service—he had authority to receive money on behalf of the Company, and it was his duty to hand it over to me about 3 o'clock the same day—in Jan. last, Thomassett and Co. were indebted to the Company—the prisoner has never accounted to me for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from them on behalf of the Company.</p>

               <p>aware then that he had not returned an amount of petty cash that he had, but I did not know of this deficiency—it must have been about a fortnight I ago that I heard of this 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the first intimation I had of that cheque not having come into the Company's possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But had you not made any demand for this money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two months ago, I think, there appeared to be a deficiency to that amount, and a gentleman went to Messrs. Thomassett, and they gave another cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not then aware that it had been paid before—when the prisoner left, I knew the amount of the deficiency, as far as the petty cash—it was a little short of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as far as I then knew, the only money he had was a little short of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw his wife a few days afterwards—I did not say that I would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as part of what deficiency there might be, and take the remainder as he could pay it; certainly not—I did receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not from his wife—I did not say that I did not know what the amount of the deficiencies were—Mrs. Ashton asked me if that was the extent of Mr. Ashton's liabilities, and I answered that as far as I knew that was the extent; the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he only sent 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did say if she would raise 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and come and bring it the next day, I would take the officer off that I had had watching—I did take him off; he was not put on again at all—the prisoner was apprehended in Broad-street, I think in the establishment of Barton Brothers—I do not know what they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did you ever dream of apprehending this man till you heard he was in some rival employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not knovr he was in a rival employment—directly this deficiency was discovered, it was brought before the committee, and <hi rend="italic">from</hi> them I took my instructions—I knew of the deficiency in the petty cash in April.</p>

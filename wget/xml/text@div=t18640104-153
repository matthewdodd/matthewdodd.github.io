                  </hi>. I reside at 6, Sydney-place, Blackwall, and am a boat-builder—about 9 o'clock, on 26th December, I was walking with the prisoner at the back of the London Hospital, when he caught hold of me, threw me down, fell on top of me, and put his hand in my right-hand pocket—I put my hand in at the same time, and struggled with him for some time on the ground—I had twenty-two shillings in my pocket at the time, and he took twelve shillings out—he had his hand in my pocket about two minutes—after we got up, I took my coat off, and the prisoner hit me in the eye, and blacked my eye very much, and ran away—some parties were there at the time—I took my oath that I had been robbed, and they would not assist</p>

               <p>me—they were with me—when I was on the ground I called out to them, but they laughed, and did not assist me in any way—they said they did not think I was robbed, they thought that he was only larking with me—I have known the prisoner about three months—I was walking with him, and with some others at the time—after he ran away I took a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and went straight down to the police-station—I was not tipsy—I can't say whether the prisoner was or not—we had all been drinking together—I believe there are two of the party here on the prisoner's part—the prisoner was working on the same ship I was—I saw him again two days afterwards, and gave him into custody.</p>

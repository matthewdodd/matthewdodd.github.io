I am a weaver; I saw two men, the prisoner was one of them, removing pantiles out of the cellar into the shed, the shed was about thirty feet from the cellar, I do not know what became of them afterwards; it was on Saturday in February, I believe, I did not take notice of the day of the month.</p>

             sworn. I am a bricklayer. On Saturday morning the 22d of February, I bought a dozen of pantiles of a man of the name of Toosen, in Petticoat-lane, it was for a job of my own that I had to do; I went to this man and asked him if he had any odds and ends of tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner. - A. Yes, I went down into the cellar and handed them up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work for Mr. Story. - A. I did, but not at that time, he put them into the shed; that day I was working for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose tiles were they that he out in there. - A. Them that I had took from Petticoat-lane to there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Mr. Story's cellar. - A. I went and asked the prisoner for some more, the cellar was open for any one, and when I had got more I was to return them to Mr. Story.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Story that. - A. No, I did not see Mr. Story then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the prisoner any money for these tiles. - A. No, I did not say I would give him any money; in the course of about a month after that I meant to give Mr. Story half a crown for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mean to take them from Mr. Story without returning the same number. - A. No, or paying him.</p>

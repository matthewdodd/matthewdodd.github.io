I felt and said, "They are gone;" the prisoner had them in her hand - I went and said, "They are my pockets;" she said, "You d-d old fool, I know they are, but I will not give them to you" - when we got to the watch-house, the gentleman desired her to give them to me; there were a few little things in the basket, but in the pockets were the spoons and my money - she took up the pockets, and put them under her arm; she was in my debt.</p>

            . I was just coming home from work, and saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner - I stood a few minutes, and saw the prisoner pick up the pockets and try to conceal them to her breast; I went and asked the prosecutrix if she had lost her pockets - she said Yes; a Policeman came up and took her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you there when the Policeman came up? A. Yes - you had the pockets, and he took you; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix has some things of mine - I met her in the street; there was another woman with me, and she said, "Did you ask Mrs. Culf to give up your things?" I said No - she said, "There can be no harm in asking her;" I pulled her gown, and said, "Do you mean to give up my things?" she said, "No, you good for nothing wretch, I will not" - she struck me twice; the Policeman came up while I had one hand on the basket; I let it go - she was walking off, and said, "I will give you a night's lodging in the watch-house" - I then felt something against my feet; I did not know what it was - I stooped and picked up the pair of pockets; I gave them into the Policeman's hand - he said, "There feels something like spoons in them;" whether she heard that or not I cannot tell, but she turned back, and said, "Give me the pockets" - he said, "I shall not deliver them to any one till I get to the watch-house;" when there she said I had insulted her in the street, and mentioned five half-crowns and two spoons, as being in the pockets - the inspector asked her if these were every thing in them; she said Yes, and was going away perfectly satisfied, and made no charge against me - he said, "You had better let the woman go about her business;" I went down, and then she made a second statement, said I seized her in a violent manner, and by some means untied her pocket.</p>
               <p>MARY CULF. I have some goods of her's, but her husband begged me to keep them and the receipts, and he would come and settle with me.</p>

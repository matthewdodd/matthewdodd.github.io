               <p>On the 3d day of January, I lost this bacon out of my shop, about a quarter before ten at night; I heard a noise in my shop; I was in a little back room, and when I came out, I found the shop door open; nobody was left in the shop; I did not miss my bacon till morning; it had hung up by a string, on a brass hook in the front of the shop; the constable brought the bacon to my house about twelve o'clock on Saturday; I never saw the prisoner till I came to the hall.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; about ten minutes before ten, on the 3d of January, I was going to look after our watchmen, and I saw the prisoner and two more; the prisoner had a piece of bacon on his head; I caught him hold by the collar with one hand, and the bacon with the other; I looked at him, and he at me; and the others ran away before I laid hold of the prisoner; I took him to the watch-house, and to the Compter the next morning; I carried him before Mr. Alderman Hart, and he ordered me to seek for the owner of the bacon.</p>
               <p>(The bacon produced and deposed to by the string.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is there particular in the string? - I can swear to my bacon, and to the place where I cut it; I know it by the example of my string hanging in this place.</p>
               <p>Court. May not it hang in any place; how is it possible you can swear to a piece of bacon? - I have no particular mark, but my string being tied here; many has them tied in other places: I can swear safely to it being mine.</p>
               <p>Does it differ in any thing, from any other piece of bacon? - I know no other difference; but I can swear to the piece.</p>
               <p>Is there any body else that knows the bacon here? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been of an errand, and a man asked me to carry it.</p>
               <p>Court. The proof of this bacon, is a very uncertain and loose kind of evidence; though the prosecutrix may believe it to be hers, yet she cannot have a sufficient certainly.</p>

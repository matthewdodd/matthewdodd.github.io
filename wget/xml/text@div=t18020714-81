             sworn. - I am a soldier, and was standing at my own door opposite, I heard the cry of stop thief, I turned round, and saw a man run with some linen under his arm; I followed him, and took him about one hundred yards from the door. (The shirts produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Saturday evening a person called upon me and requested I would go with him to purchase a pair of stockings, which I did, and having an Indian shawl which I brought home, I took it with me, and asked the prosecutrix the value of it; he stood bargaining for the stockings till I was tired, and walked on, but not ten yards from the cellar, then I was challenged with having the shirts, but they were picked up several yards from me; several people were rushing forward at once, and that man took me; the chief part of my time has been spent in the navy. <rs id="t18020714-81-verdict421" type="verdictDescription">

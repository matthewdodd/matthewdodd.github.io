The prisoner entered into my service about sir months ago—he wrote his name on this paper, as "James Horle"—it was his duty to receive money on the redemption of pledges—having received the money, he was to pin the two duplicates together, and put them into a drawer kept for that purpose—he had no right to put any tickets anywhere but into that drawer—I was in the habit of seeing these tickets every night, and com<lb></lb>paring the money with them—every night there would be an account of the money expended in advances, and the money repaid—I ascertained the ad<lb></lb>vances made by casting up the book—the prisoner cast up the book—it is what we call the auction-book, in which pledges are entered that are above 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if the pledges are under 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they are entered in another book—I refer to those two books, to the duplicate-drawer, and the money in the other drawer, and balance the whole—on the 13th of Feb., I found, on going through this procedure, that the money would not balance, there was a defi<lb></lb>ciency of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I mentioned it to the prisoner—he assisted me to cast the books over again to see if he could make the account right—he did not say anything about having any duplicates in his pocket—we did not succeed in making the accounts right—we gave it up—he was in the habit of going home on Sunday morning—he went home the next morning—after he was gone, I and my son had some conversation, and in consequence of that I sent him to where the prisoner kept hid clothes—my son produced to me a glove containing duplicates—I told my son to put the glove back again—the pri<lb></lb>soner came home about eleven o'clock that night—I had previously sent for sergeant Brannan—he was with me when the prisoner came—I said to the prisoner, "Walk in—you recollect last evening our account would not balance, and in looking over the auction-book, I perceive a watch booked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the lad says it was taken in for a guinea, and they came and had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on it—now, this is a sergeant of police—in looking over the tickets I could not</p>

               <p>for the last three months—I do not recollect his saying my son knew they had been there for the last twelve months—my son keeps his clothes up stairs—he may keep a thing or two in the shop—he sleeps there sometimes, and takes his clothes off there—the prisoner generally stays to breakfast on Sunday morning—he did not on that occasion—he did not tell me he should not stay—he went out and said nothing—all the drawers in the shop are not unlocked—there was an entry in the auction-book of this 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—by referring to that I could ascertain there had been a transaction about the watch.</p>

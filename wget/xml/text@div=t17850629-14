               <p>What is the prisoner at the bar? - A woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Where did you meet with her? - In Bond-street, I believe it was the 10th of this month, between eleven and twelve at night; I went with her to a house in <placeName id="t17850629-14-crimeloc72">Oxford-buildings</placeName>

               <p>Had you been drinking? - Not too much.</p>
               <p>How much had you drank? - I believe I had drank part of a bottle of wine, on returning we came back to the house again, and the patrol would not let her go in, he said I might go in; her reply was, that she would not quit me; I wanted to know the hour of the night, and looking for my watch, and not finding it, I said I missed it; I had no sooner pronounced the words, I had missed it, then I saw it in the prisoner's hand, and the patrol seized it; I have some doubt remaining with me of the prisoner positively meaning to keep the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. I will ask you one question ; did the prisoner immediately upon your speaking of the watch, say here it is, or to that purpose; did she conceal the watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is too much to say this is a felonious taking.</p>

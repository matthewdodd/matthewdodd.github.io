                  </hi>. I am a corporal in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich. On the 22nd of Sept., between eight and nine o'clock at night, I met the prisoner on London-bridge—she induced me to turn down a dark court with her, on the left—hand side off the bridge—in two or three minutes a man stepped in front of us, and both he and the prisoner ran away—a watchman came up, and asked if I had lost anything, and my purse was gone—it had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I had had it about two minutes before, when I crossed the bridge—it was in my right-hand trowsers pocket—I did not feel anything at my pocket—I identified it when it was in the possession of the inspector—the money was init when I saw it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private watchman of Montague-close—a little be<lb></lb>fore nine o'clock that night I saw the prisoner walking with the prosecutor arm in arm, and a man walking twenty yards behind them—they went down a passage, and the other man went and leaned his arm against the boards, where he could peep round the corner—I went to look at that man's face, bat he turned from me—I then went back and told the policeman—I then heard a cough given as a signal, and the man who was standing round the corner went to the prosecutor—the prisoner ran away directly, and the policeman caught her—I then saw her throw the purse down, about three yards behind the policeman—I saw him pick it up.</p>

About nine o'clock that evening I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together in Montague<lb></lb>place—Willy spoke to me, and called my attention to them—I told him to watch them, while I concealed myself behind a cart—I remained some time, and saw the prisoner approach me, running—she did not see me—I stopped her immediately—I heard something fall on the ground, I stooped for it she got away, but I followed and picked up this purse—when I stooped for it she got away, but I followed and took her again—she entreated me to let her go, and laid she would recompense me on another occasion—for the sake of her poor mother and her child she entreated me to let her go.</p>

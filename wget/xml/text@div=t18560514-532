                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of No. 8, Victoria-street, Hackney-road. On Friday night, 28th March, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in High-street, Shoreditch—when I got to Hare-court, which I did not know before, two men came out of it; one of them jumped at me, and snatched at my watch, and the taller one hit me a How under the ear—I fell against the corner of the alley, and then ran after the other party, and was struck a violent blow—the men both went up the court—I ran after the one who had taken my watch, the shorter one—I cannot say who he was, as it was done in a moment—in the court I was struck another violent blow on the back of the neck—I cannot tell by whom, am I was running, the person was on one side of me—that knocked me senseless to the ground, and stunned me—mine was a silver hunting watch, with No. 8172 on it, and my initials—I have not seen it since—this chain was left hanging round my neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No, 80, High-street, Shoreditch. On Friday, 28th March, at a few minutes past 9 o'clock, I saw Sharwell in High-street—when he got near Hare-alley I saw Clouse rush on him, snatch his watch out of his waistcoat pocket, and run up the court with it—he had been loitering about the court previously—it was fourteen or fifteen yards from my master's door—Sharweli ran after him followed by Weaver, and a man who is not in custody—I had seen these prisoners together ten minutes before the watch was taken, with the man not in custody—I knew them all</p>

On Wednesday, the same day that I was before the Magistrate, I saw the prisoners together in George-street, Spitalfields—I took Weaver, and told him that I wanted him for a watch which was stolen at Shoreditch—he said that he knew nothing of it—I had seen the prisoners and another party about 9 o'clock on the night of the robbery standing about thirty yards from where it took place, in High-street—I had a good view of them—I might be three or four yards from them—I knew them before, and have no doubt about them—Weaver is one of the three.</p>

I was with Andrews on Wed<lb></lb>nesday in George-street, and saw the prisoners—as soon as Clouse saw me he ran—I ran past Weaver, telling Andrews to take him—I took Clouse, took him to the station, and charged him with stealing the watch—he looked at Weaver, and said, "We know nothing about it"—after a witness came to identify him, he said, "I did do it, but Weaver had nothing to do with it"—I know them, they are always together.</p>

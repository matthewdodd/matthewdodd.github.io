            . I live in the City-road. On the 24th of October, about mid-day, I was walking down <placeName id="t18121202-27-crimeloc152">Ludgate-hill. Very near Stationers-alley</placeName>

I put my hand to my pocket. I said to my friend, my handkerchief was gone. I immediately turned round. A man, who was very near, said, there he runs up Stationers-alley. I looked up Stationers-alley. I saw the prisoner running with all his might. I pursued him as swift as possible, and called, stop thief. The crowd then began to increase, and when in Warwick-lane I lost sight of him. They told me that he had gone up a street leading to the Oxford Arms; and on my coming into that yard I saw some people detaining the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of the prisoner in Warwick-lane - A. I did. He was stopped in the Oxford inn, I believe it is called. I only know the man by seeing him run. I am sure the prisoner is the same man that was running up Stationers-alley.</p>
               <p>MR. TRERY. I am beadle of Castle Baynard ward. The prisoner was brought to me. I took him to Guildhall. I searched him, and found on him two or three shillings, and a duplicate of a broach.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM YATES. I was loading a load of dung down the Oxford Arms; the prisoner ran by me, and got up into a waggon, and after he came out of the waggon I got up in the waggon and found the handkerchief. The gentleman came and owned it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the handkerchief. It is mine. I received it out of Yates's hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime.</p>

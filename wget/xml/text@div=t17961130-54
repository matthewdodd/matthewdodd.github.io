               <p>Q. Does the mark prove it to be your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A tire-smith and coach-spring maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been any where else, you would not have known it was your's? - A. No, most affuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the passage you had this conversa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300076"></xptr>tion with him? - A. Yes; the passage to the shop, not of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came back to ask my master for a few shillings; as I came in, I kicked my foot against this iron; I was going to take it up, and my master laid hold of me, which surprized me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said he was tying up his breeches, what do you mean by that? - A. I suppose he took it out of his breeches, and put it in his apron, it is only supposition.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor and another witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. By the will of the deceased, the prisoner is the owner of the house you live in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the rent of that house? - A. Forty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, if she should be convicted, you will have a chance to live rent free? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother was to have two-thirds of the profits of this job? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, supposing these articles had never been recovered, they would have gone out of the profits of the job? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Would your mother have paid her share of the loss? - A. No, the loss would have been my own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Suppose, by any accident, there had been no profit at all, you would not have given her any? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose you had lost a plume of feathers, or any things else that eat up the whole profit, would she have had any profit? - A. Yes, she would have had her share of the whole profit, all the loss would have been my own; I myself was answerable to the furnisher for every article that was sent.</p>

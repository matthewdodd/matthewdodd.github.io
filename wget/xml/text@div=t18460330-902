                  </hi>. I live at Great Berkhampstead, in Hertfordshire. I went to the bank at Hemel-Hempstead, on the 13th of Feb. and received there some 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, Nos. from 1343 to 1347—I paid away the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and three of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I came to town on the 24th of Feb.—I had then the two remaining 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, Nos. 1345 and 1346, safe in a purse in my right hand breeches pocket—I have been in the habit of putting up at a public-house in Villier's-street, but the house was full—I went to the bar of the house—I had my money safe then—I was then going into the Strand, and just as I got to the edge of the Strand, in three or four minutes after I left the public-house, I missed my money—there were a great many people passing, and some of whom might have got my money without my perceiv<lb></lb>ing it—it was about half-past ten at night—I gave notice to the police, and to Messrs. Currie, in Cornhill, who are the agents of the Hemel-Heropstead bank—some days afterwards I saw the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi>, and in it there was a note, No. 1345, advertised as being found at Cambridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Cambridge Borough police.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 41, Vauxhall-street, Lambeth—I have carried on business there as a master butcher for thirteen months. On Fri<lb></lb>day, the 27th of Feb., I sold three pigs to a man in Smithfield-market—I do not know him—I sold them in open market to a pork-butcher, as I thought—they were fat pigs—I received for them a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Hemel-Hempstead bank note, and a sovereign—I think it was between one and two o'clock—I had taken several notes on the same bank before—it is not unusual in Smithfield to be paid in country bank notes—the man did not put his name on the note—I believe there was no writing at all on it—I have known the prisoner as a working jeweller these seven months—he has occasionally dealt with me—he offered me a chain at Mr. Wright's public-house in the Walworth-road—I bought it of him for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him the Hemel-Hempstead bank-note, and he gave me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—this is the chain round, my neck.</p>

               <p>butcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thirteen months—before that I kept a butcher's shop in Walworth-road—I keep live stock as well as dead—I go to Smithfield every week—I deal in sheep and beasts—every salesman in the market knows me—I have been in the habit of taking cattle, and sheep, and pigs there for twenty-two years—I think I had seen the man before that I sold these pigs to—I never dealt with him—I think I should know him again—he is a short stout man, and fresh-coloured—I did not hear that this Hemel-Hempstead bank note had been stolen, till last Tuesday morning—I did not give infor<lb></lb>mation to the police of the sort of man I received the note of—there was nobody present when I sold the pigs that I knew—we went to a public-house, and he paid me—I have taken a Hemel-Hempstead bank note before—I know they are payable in Cornhill—I do not know that I have ever been there—I can pay them at any banking-house in Smithfield—they take a country note of any person they know—I did not ask the man I took it of any questions—I did not know the prisoner when I lived in Walworth-road—I am not related to him—I know him as a customer—I sent meat from Vauxhall-road to Walworth-road—it is about a mile—I send meat to the prisoner about once a fortnight or three weeks—I never bought jewellery of him before—I have been to his house—he represented himself as a working-jeweller—he asked me in the public-house if I would buy this chain—I gave the value for it—I never asked him for one—he suggested it to me before the bar at Mr. Wright's—I think Mr. Wright's son served me.</p>

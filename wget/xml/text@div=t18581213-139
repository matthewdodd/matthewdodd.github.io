                  </hi>. I am the niece of Mr. Austin Cullum; I assist him in his public-house, the "Tiger Cat," Princes-street, Deptford—on 1st November the prisoner came into our tap-room—he remained five or ten minutes; I am not aware how long—he did not order anything—when he went away I went in the tap-room—I missed a quart pot which had been sent in with some persons, who went in at the same time that the prisoner did—when I missed it, I followed the prisoner, he had not got out of the street—I asked him if he came out of that house—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I believe you have got a quart pot; if you have, give it me; if you have not, you had better come back"—he said, "No, I have not got any pot"—I said, "If you have not, come back to the house"—he found that I did not let him go—I had hold of his coat, and he gave me the pot out of his jacket; I identified it as ours—I have no doubt it was the one that was in the tap-room—there was no other in the tap-room—when I got the pot I took it home—the prisoner ran away.</p>

               <p>—the prisoner lived exactly at the back of my premises—I am a boot and shoemaker. On Saturday night, the 22nd of April, I went to bed, about twelve o'clock, and got up about half-past eight o'clock—I ob-served my shop had been stripped of the lead, about nine o'clock—it was a work-shop that runs from the back of my shop to a house that a <hi rend="italic">wake</hi> was held in on that Saturday night, in which house the prisoner was—there were marks on the bricks from my premises to the back of the premises that the prisoner lives in—the wash-house which is opposite his parlour window is tiled, and there were two tiles broken, which had fallen into the back yard—I thought the lead had been taken that way, and we went into the prisoner's back parlour, and found the lead under the bed—that was at No. 7, Southampton-row—he was apprehended that Sunday morning, about one o'clock—the lead was fitted to my roof—I am quite positive it is mine.</p>

I went with the prosecutor, and saw the marks of where the lead had been carried, apparently—that led us to the prisoner's house, and in the back parlour we found the lead concealed under the bed—I found the prisoner playing at cards, with seven or eight more—I brought him part of the way, and wanted him to go up Southampton-row—he would not, and collared me—I then took him to<lb></lb>wards the station, and met the inspector and an officer, who took him—I have fitted the lead—it exactly corresponds to the roof.</p>

I am a printer, carrying on business in Castle Street, Leicester Square—I have printed the balance sheets of the London District—the prisoner generally brought the manuscript to me—I printed the balance sheet for the quarter, from March to June, 1867—the copy was returned to the prisoner, at the office in Essex Street—I believe the printed copies were correct, according to the manuscript?

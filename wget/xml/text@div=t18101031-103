I felt the handkerchief drawing out of my pocket, he had got two thirds of the handkerchief out of my pocket. It is a silk handkerchief. When he found he was discovered by my asking him what he was about; he ran, and I immediately pursued him, and cried stop thief; in the wide part of Fleet-street, before you come to St. Dunstan's church, he turned back again, I caught hold of him; I never lost sight of him, nor was he ever ten yards from me. When I got hold of him I charged him with attempting to pick my pocket.</p>

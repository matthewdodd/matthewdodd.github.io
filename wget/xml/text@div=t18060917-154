             sworn. I am an officer of Worship-street, I told the prisoner my business was to search her house for stolen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170089"></xptr>property; for articles that Mrs. Cawthorn had been robbed of. I asked her if she had any such kind of articles in the house, she said no, I told her I should certainly search her house, she said I was welcome, for she had got no property belonging to Mrs. Cawthorn; I was going to open a closet, I saw she was very restless and wanting to put her hand into her pocket. I immediately said I shall search the right hand-pocket, I found nothing there, I searched the left hand pocket, I immediately took from there some ribbon and some sewing silk, there is more than ten yards of ribbon; I dare say there is twenty yards in the whole, and about one yard of lace; Mrs. Cawthorn looked at it and said it was her property, I informed her her daughter was in custody. She seemed very much alarmed, and said that her daughter had brought them; I took her in custody.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . I was pot-boy to Mr. Morrison. On the 22d of June, in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the pot-house, cleaning knives; I went towards the copper - he said to me, "What are you going about?" I said, "To boil and scower the pots;" he said I had better do it tomorrow; I said, "I shall do it to day;" he then said,"I have got a can of stout in the copper;" I asked where he got it; he said, "From the cellar;" I told my master, who told me to watch; I afterwards saw him sell five quarts of stout out of that can, to different people in the garden; he put the money into his pocket; I said, "You are carrying on a nice game;" he said "Yes; I mean to do more yet."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever quarrel with him? A. Never; he must have filled the can again, as it only holds four quarts; I went into the garden at eight o'clock at night, and saw him sell two pots out of it; I told my master, who saw him sell one pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never throw the slops into a can? A. No; it may be done by some people.</p>
               <p>WALTER MORRISON. The prisoner came to the bar in the evening, and had one pot of stout; I saw him take two into the garden - he had the key of the cellar, but should come to the bar for every thing.</p>

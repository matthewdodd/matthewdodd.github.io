                  </hi>. I keep a tobacco shop in Norfolk-street. The last witness is my partner—on the 26th of January the prisoner came for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—I gave it him—he threw me down a bad shilling—I went round and said I would try it at the threshold of the door—I found it was bad—I took hold of him, put him into the parlour, and sent for an officer—I received a sixpence on the 23rd of January from my partner, and another on the 24th—I kept them in my pocket by them<lb></lb>selves,</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 14.) On Wednesday, the 30th of November, I was on duty about half past eleven o'clock in the morning at a place called Whitehall, in St. Giles's. I went through a passage through a house into a paved yard, at the end of which was a ladder, which led to a sort of landing—I went up to the top, opened the door, went into the room, and saw the four prisoners there—the door was just ajar—when I opened it, I bolted it—when I went in Loveland was standing by the fire, and Seymour was sitting in a chair opposite the fire, without any shoes, stockings, or coat on, close against the fire—Green was sitting in a chair at a table, with his back towards the fire, mending a shoe, which he put on afterward—Spencer was standing against the window with his face towards the fire, about ten or eleven feet from it—the fire was on one side, and the window on the other—the room was about twelve feet by eleven—when I went into the room Loveland began to stir the fire—I ran up to him, caught hold of him, and said, "Halloo, what are you doing here?"—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120066"></xptr>
               <p>in my uniform—I pulled him away, and he dropped this piece of white metal on the floor, and put his foot on it—I did not see it till it dropped—I pushed him on one side, and picked it up—it was quite hot—I was ob<lb></lb>liged to put it out of one hand into the other—I put it into my pocket, and then looked on the mantelpiece, where I saw this mould, and alongside it, this piece of metal, which appears to have been coloured—the mould was wrapped in a rag—I then looked round the room, and picked up four more pieces of metal in different parts of the room, on the floor, near the fire-place—Green was sitting in a chair within about two feet of one of the pieces—I then turned down the bed, and in it found a clean shirt—I said, "Who does this belong to?"—Seymour (who I knew by the name of Dodman) said "It is mine"—while he was putting it on I went to the table where Green was sitting at work, and found these two pieces of metal, and two pieces of blue stone—I searched Spencer, but found nothing on him—I asked him where he lived—he said in Cleveland-street—I asked what brought him there—he said he had come with a message from Green's brother—I found on Loveland a pennypiece, four halfpence, and one sixpence, all good money; a shilling on Green, and nothing on Seymour—I then picked up the old shirt which Seymour had pulled of, and out of it dropped this cloth and five pieces of metal, imitating penny<lb></lb>pieces, and one piece of metal separate—he had the opportunity of wrap<lb></lb>ping them up in the shirt while I was searching the other prisoners—I said, "Well, Mr. Dodman, how do you account for this?"—he said, "Why, I am not obliged to say any thing that will hurt myself"—I said, "No, cer<lb></lb>tainly not; what you have to say you had better say to the Magistrate'—I said, "Now, my lads, you must all get ready, and go with me to Marylebone"—Dodman said, "Why, you are not going to take us all yourself, are you?"—I said "No, I have plenty more below waiting for you"—before this I had said to Green, "You seem to live here, perhaps you can account for these things being here?"—he said, "I shall say they were brought here"—I then tied them together with their own handker-chiefs, and took them to the police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to his Majesty's mint, and have been so many years. The first article produced is a piece of lead which has been cast in the mould I hold in my hand, which piece is intended to represent a current penny—it is not coloured, but it is cast in this plaster of Paris mould, and bears the impression of the two sides of a penny<lb></lb>piece—I have no doubt it has been used, from the appearance of it: and these five impressions have all been cast in it, by the spray—the mould has been broken, and the imperfection in the mould is visible in the cast—here is one, which appears to have had some attempt at colouring made on it, but very badly—this blue stone is sulphate of copper—I am not aware that it would give a coppery appearance to the lead—it would produce a copper colour on iron, but not on lead that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>(The Jury, upon applying the blue stone on the lead, found it did give the lead a coppery appearance—The Court ruled that this offence was not within the Statute; copper coin in a state of preparation not being men<lb></lb>tioned.)</p>

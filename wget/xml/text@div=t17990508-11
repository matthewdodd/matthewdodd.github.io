When I got to Hackney, the prisoner came up to the pay-table with the other men; Mr. Hayes asked me if I knew which was the man; I told him, yes, and Mr. Hayes called him; I asked him if he recollected me; he said, no; I asked him if he knew the tripe-shop in Mileend-road, and why he did not come and fetch the floor cloth away which he had left there; then he said he recollected me very well, and that he had taken them form his master, and never intended to fetch them away, that he was ashamed to come for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Are you a house-keeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was day-light, and consequently there was nothing at all suspicious in his conduct? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted if he had called again, you would have given him the floor-cloths? - A. I certainly should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No, I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. He wanted the floor-cloths to be put in a place where they would be exposed to the view of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080008"></xptr>every body; but you had not room for them there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. However, when you came to the pay-table, you saw him sitting among the other men, he recollected you, and said, he was ashamed to come to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, if he had come on the same day, or on the Monday, you would have given him the floor-cloth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not offer to sell it to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was there any thing in his behaviour to induce you to think that he was out of his senses? - A. Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER-DANIEL HAYES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What is the firm of your house? - A. Christopher-James Hayes, and Christopher-Daniel Hayes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that floor-cloth; was that manufactured by yourselves? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular about it? - A. Yes; in one corner of it there is my own name stamped; and, upon the other corner, in my own hand-writing, is the words "Spence, sold to Spence, of Walthamstow;" it was intended for him. but never delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it paid for? - A. No; it would have been his property when delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was the prisoner in your employ upon the 6th of April? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He had access to those places where these cloths were deposited, and might have stole them if he chose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Eight or nine pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was he in your service? - A. A grinder of colours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Had you ever any reason to suppose he was deranged in his intellects? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you never observe any sort of frantickness or odd conduct about him? - A. No, only when he got drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this floor-cloth taken from the warehouse in Fenchurch-street, or from the warehouse at Hackney? - A. From the warehouse at Hackney.</p>

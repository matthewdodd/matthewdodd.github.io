                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 714). On Saturday night, 19th August, I was in the George, Trinity Square, and tendered a sovereign for something I had—the landlord dropped it and it went into another compartment which I could not see into—I afterwards found a bonnet in that compartment—the landlord told me something and I went into the other compartment and spoke to a woman who was there—I received information and went to 11, Dales Place, Fleur-de-Lys Street, the same morning, knocked at the door, and a man opened it—I said "Is your wife at home?"—he said "No"—I watched till 2.30 a.m., when the prisoner came up the court—I said "Do you live here?"—she said "No, sir"—I said "What brings you here then?"—she said "I am going to the w.c."—I said "How do you know there is one here?"—she said "I have been many a time before"—I said "Where do you live?"—she said "12, George Yard"—I turned to the man who had opened the door and said "Do you known this woman?"—he said "No"—a constable then came up and said, in her presence "This is the woman that wears that shawl"—I said "Take her in charge"—going to the station she strongly denied being the person—the other woman said "This is the woman that picked up your sovereign, but don't say that I said so, or else I shall get killed—the prisoner said nothing then, but at the station she said, "I did not steal the man's sovereign, I only stooped down, I did not pick up any<lb></lb>thing."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the George in Trinity Square—on 19th August, about 12.15 in the night, I saw Lovell hand a sovereign to my wife, it slipped from her hand on the counter and rolled on the ground on the other side where the prisoner and her companion were sitting—they were the only persons in the compartment, and the prisoner said "I will pick it up, <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>, don't you trouble;" she picked it up, and immediately bolted out at the door with it—I actually saw her pick it up and am quite sure she is the woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Winsby, of Union-street, Middlesex-hospital. On the 14th of March, as I went down stain, I heard some one follow me—I turned, and saw the prisoner—I said, "What have you been doing in my room?"—she said, "I have been to Mrs. Spink"—I said there was no such person, and then she said Mrs. Jones—I said no such person lived there—I took her into the second-pair room, and she dropped a piece of old carpet—I looked at her again, and saw these clogs—I said, "They are mine"—"No," said she, "they are mine"—I asked her if she had any thing else, and then she took my little girl's pattens from her bundle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. This carpet was on the stairs—the clogs and pattens I never saw—I had been up stairs to a person, and knocked at the door, but they were not at home.</p>

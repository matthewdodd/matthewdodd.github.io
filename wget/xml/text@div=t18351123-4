                  </hi>. I am a police inspector, and live at No.17, York street, in the parish of Stepney, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Stebonheath, and rent the house. On Friday evening the 6th of November, I went home about half past eight o'clcok—I unlocked the door and let myself in—my wife and family were in the country at the time—I locked the door when I got in, and took the key out, and had scarcely been in doors half a minute before somebody came to the door, and gaven one knock—I did not answer the door—I heard the steps of a person go away dierctly from the door—I had not got out of the passage into the parlour before two persons came to the street door, and one of the two put a key into the lock—I had no light in the house at the time—I had not time to get one—when the key was put into the lock, one of the persons said to the other "Does it fit?" the other said, "Yes it is all right," and at that moment the door unlocked-the key was taken out after the door was unlocked—they pushed the door open two or three did not fasten it—they went away then and I had scarcely time to get from the pasage into the back parlour and change my coat, before two persons entered the front door—I had a fine frock coat on at the time, and I changed it for a strong one, expecting a struggle with them, when they did come in—they both came into passage, and one of the put a key into the door, insdie, and locked themselves in, leaving the key in the lock, so that nobody could come in from the outside—I was standing behind the back parlour door, and the prisoner passed me along the pasage into the Kitchen—the other stoped by the door in the passage—I was went out from the parlour and seized the prisoner in the kitchen he—appeared about to open the back door, and then the other unlocked the front door and made off—I found this key inside the lock—It is not my key, but it will unlock the door better ten my own key—It has ben filed apparently to fit the lock—soon after I seized the prisoner, he begged for mercy—I afterwards de<lb></lb>livered him to Charles Barown—he made a little resistance at first—I found</p>

               <p>a key on my kitchen mantel piece—It is a common key, and has been field, and some of the wards cut out—I do not know how it got there—I did not know the prisoner before, myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, I know Rice—I am not connected with the police now—I was once—I was going to call on Rice—I arrived at his house about half past eight o'clock—when I got near his house I observed him bringing the prisoner along, as if from his house—Rice gave him into custody while he went into my the house and while I hold him by the door something seemed to fall from him—I do not know what it was—I did not take it up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been down to Billingagate market on Friday afternoon to see what fish was coming there—I left about five o'clock and came towards shadwell, and into globe lane to go home I turned up the turning to go across the fields and saw prosecutor's door open—thinking it an improper time for it to be open, I pushed the door in and Rice followed me in, and took me.</p>

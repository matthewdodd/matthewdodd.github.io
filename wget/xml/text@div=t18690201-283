I am in the service of Mr. McCarthy, pawnbroker, 205, Caledonian Road—on the 19th December, the prisoner brought me a tankard to pledge—I examined it, and called his attention to the Hall-mark, saying that it was not so distinct as it usually was upon silver goods—he said, "That is on account of the finishing, after it has come from the hall"—I wished to test the tankard, by filing it at the bottom, but he objected, and said, "I cannot allow you to try it, because I shall have to take it in on Wednesday; if you try it in that way, I shall have to burnish it again"—being satisfied that the tankard was silver, I lent him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the prisoner giving me the name of James Baintree, Chapel Street.</p>

I have been a working man now for a great many years, and have had some thousands of ounces of silver through my hands. Owing to misfortune, I left my employers, and had no alternative then but to set up businees for myself, unfortunately, without friends. I took a shop, and could not meet the demands for rent, and, having a wife and five children. to support, I fell into arrears. I called upon Redgrave to know if he could do anything for me. I had a gold chain, which he pledged, and so paid a portion of the rent that was owing. The chain was wanted, and I began to be uneasy, when Redgrave said he had the means of making money, but that I should have his liberty in my hands. I told him he must take all the responsibility upon himself. He then manufactured a cup, and pledged it in Long Acre for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He afterwards made and plated other cups, and pawned them. One evening he asked me to pledge one, and I took it to dir. Morgan's. I had nothing to do with making the cups, or depositing the mark, taking the impression, or plating them. When I pledged the</p>

               <p>cup, I never thought of the consequences. Redgravo had the money. I hope you will take my case into your consideration, for I have a wife who is very ill, and five children who are totally unprovided for.</p>

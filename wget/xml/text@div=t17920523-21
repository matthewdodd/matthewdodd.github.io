               <p>I am a patrol; between three and four o'clock on the 29th of April, I saw two men coming across the brickfields; I went up towards them, thinking them suspicious people; I asked them what they had in the bag and they said a young child; I insisted on seeing what they had got; I put my hand into the bag, and pulled out a warm fowl; I brought him to the watch-house, and found a padlock in his breeches, and a bloody razor, with which he had cut one of the fowls heads off; the other man ran off; the fowls are not here, for I eat one myself, and I know they were dead, because all their heads were off.</p>

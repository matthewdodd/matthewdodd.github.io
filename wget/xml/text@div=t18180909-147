Windall alarmed me; I ran out of the back parlour, and overtook the prisoner and another woman, who had a basket, the prisoner had a bundle under her shawl, I insisted on seeing what was in it, she gave it to me, saying she had just found it. I found the articles stated in the indictment in it.</p>

            . On the 1st of August I was at my window, which is opposite to the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner, and a man, at his window. The man drew his righ thand from the window, and gave the prisoner something white - They went away together. I went over and told Mr. Hunter. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

My wife has been ten months out of her senses, and is sent home from Bedlam incureable: I had the prisoner to keep my house, and dress my victuals. She robb'd me of linen, woollen, silver, and pewter. On the 25th of April I was eating my breakfast, and looking in the closet for a bit of cheese, I missed some pewter plates: I asked the prisoner where they were. She told me they were in the wash house foul. I looked farther, and missed my cloaths, shirts, shifts, gowns, sheets, and several things not laid in the indictment. I asked her what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176205260005"></xptr> she had done with them. She told me she was indebted to two people; one in the borough, and the other in Red-lion-street, Whitechapel; and s he had pawned the things with

There were as many things that she had pawn'd as lay for 5 l. 1 s. 6 d. but the prosecutor would not prosecute her if he could help it, and have had the goods again for nothing. He said yesterday she had been his bedfellow for some time.</p>

When she was committed, I heard the prosecutor say he had lan with her for nine weeks. He told Justice Berry so; and that they had cohabited together as man and wife; and that he had promised her marriage, in case his old wife, who is delirious, was dead.</p>

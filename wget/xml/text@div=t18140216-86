            . I live at No. 18, Gibralter-row, Bethnal-green. I have known the prisoner from the beginning of last summer; she lived at No. 11, Thomas's-place, Crabtree-row.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dealings with her on the 20th of January - A. I had, on the evening of the 20th of January, I received of the prisoner three counterfeit shillings. I gave information to Armstrong on the morning of the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Armstrong told you, did you go to the prisoner - A. I did, and paid for them, and had the promise of half a dozen more the next day; she promised me six counterfeit shillings on the 22nd for three shillings. I communicated this to Armstrong, and before I went to her house Armstrong gave me three marked good shillings; I had no other money about me of any kind; the officers searched me. When I went to the prisoner's house I told her I had come for the six counterfeit shillings that she had promised; she put her hand to the table drawer, took out a bag, and out of that bag she gave me five counterfeit shillings, and two counterfeit sixpences; I gave her for them the three indentical shillings that Armstrong had furnished me with, and as soon as this transaction happened I took the counterfeit money out in my hand, and Bishop, the officer, took it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have not you had the misfortune to have two of your daughters convicted - A. One I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know where she got the bad money from - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She is now under sentence - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, do not you expect that she is to be pardoned if you convict this woman - A. I expect some little mercy; I am not promised such a thing; I do not depend upon any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not leave a parcel there of twenty bad shillings before - A. No.</p>

             both officers; I searched him; he had three penny-pieces and a farthing; I took it from him. I searched him all over; he had no money but three good shillings I had given him. I marked the three good shillings in a way that I should know them again, with an A very small; I gave them to Gobey in the presence of Bishop, and my son. I and the other two officers accompanied Gobey to the prisoner's house, No. 11, Thomas's-place. In my going along I bethought myself that I had not searched Gobey's mouth, I put my fingers in his mouth; he had no money in his mouth. We went to the house No. 11, Thomas's-place, Crabtree-row, Bethnal-green; I saw him go into the door, and waited until he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity to receive any money during the time he was going from the public-house to there - A. No, never. He had no counterfeit money about him when he went into the prisoner's house, and the instant he came out of the house he was seized by Bishop. We took Gobey then into the house with us. When I came into the kitchen the prisoner was sitting by the fireside; she turned her eyes when I went in. I heard something chink upon the hearth like a shilling; my son stooped, and picked up a shilling; he said, it is a good shilling.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160046"></xptr>He catched hold of her right hand. I heard him say here is the other two. When I came to see the three shillings I saw they were the three shillings that I had given to Gobey. Bishop searched the prisoner. I found this counterfeit money in this bag, as it is now, which is forty-three shillings and thirty-six sixpences in a cupboard; they are all counterfeits; some are fit for circulation, and some are not. I then asked her who lived there; she said, herself; her husband was at sea. She said, the goods were hers; she said, that Gobey had given her three good shillings for a debt that he had owed her some time.</p>

            . Q You were with Armstrong - A. I was; I was present also when Gobey was searched. I am quite certain he had no money whatever when he went away from the public-house, except the three good shillings given him by Armstrong. When Gobey came out of the prisoner's house I immediately took hold of his right hand, and took from his hand five shillings and two sixpences. These are them; they have been in my possession ever since. The moment Gobey came out of the house to the door I seized him, and pushed him into the room. I searched the prisoner; in her pocket I found twelve counterfeit shillings wrapped up in this dirty rag; they are fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any implements there for the purpose of making money - A. None. I found a box and a bag containing upwards of two pounds in silver. I asked Gobey in the presence of the prisoner, where he got the five bad shillings and the two bad sixpences; he said he bought them of the prisoner, he gave her three shillings for them. The prisoner made no reply to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you hear her say these things were left at her house by Gobey some time time before - A. I did not.</p>

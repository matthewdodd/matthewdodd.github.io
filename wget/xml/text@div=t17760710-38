(The cotton gown and the dimity which were found at the prisoner's brother's were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) The prisoner's father's apprentice-boy went with me to shew me where the prisoner's brother lived; his apprentice-girl informed the justice that the things had been pawned and taken out again and carried to the brother; both the boy and girl are kept back by the prisoner's father.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Mr. Peto, at Heston, about seven years. The fire at Cranford-bridge was on Wednesday night—I know the prisoner—he keeps a beer-shop on the Bath-road, about three quarters of a mile from Mr. Peto—John Tickner and I were there till he shut up his house—the prisoner knew in whose service I was at the time—Tickner was at work at Mr. Peto's—I do not know where he is now—when we left the house, Seeley came and asked if we know where we could get three or four trusses of hay—this was about half past ten o'clock—I told him I did not know that we did—he then said was not there any at our farm?—I told him I did not know that there was—Tickner said he thought there was—Tickner and I then went to the farm—when we got there, we went into the yard, and the door of the hay-place fronting the yard was locked—we went into the stable—the stable-door was not locked—there was a door led out of the hay-place into the stable, which was not locked—Tickner put his hand to it, and it was open—we took two trusses a-piece, and came out, down Mr. Peto's field, across the meadow, up</p>

               <p>Mr. Seeley's garden—he had told us he would leave the key in the stable-door, that we could put the hay in, and lock it, and out the key behind the post—we did so, and went home—we had had some beer of the prisoner that night—we did not pay for it—we left with an intention to pay on Saturday night—nothing was said about not paying for it—this hay was banded as other hay is—I observed nothing particular about the bands—there is a hay-binder, named Charles Marsh, on my master's premises—it is all bound by him—I never knew my master to have any for sale—on Thursday night, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner—he took me up in the loft, and the hay was shook up, and it appeared to me that other hay was shook up with it—it was not in trusses, as we had left it the night before—if it was, it was done over with other hay—the prisoner asked me if I thought it would do—I told him I did not know—nothing else passed—I came down, and Tickner and I came home—we were not together in the loft—he stopped down—Seeley told me to go up with him—we did nothing else that night—we went home, and went to our work the next day—we did not remain at Heston—we went to Shere in Surrey, our native home, in consequence of something we heard pass.</p>

            . I am quarter-master of the ship. On Sunday evening, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the cabin, and on Monday morning the watch was missed. The prisoner kept his hammock locked up which made me suspect him. He said, that any man who could find the watch should have a bottle of rum. On the Saturday following I was by the Royal Exchange, and saw the prisoner with a seal and key hanging to his trowsers; and as he ran up to me he tucked it in. I immediately fetched Rice the officer.</p>

            . On the 1st of April, I took the prisoner into custody, and found the watch on him. He behaved very bad to me; I was obliged to get assistance. I saw him draw the watch from his person, I took it from him. He said he found it in the gun-room.</p>

            . I live in Aliff-square, Essex-street, Whitechapel. I work at the leather-breeches trade. I have known the prisoner eight years. I met him in the Minories about twelve o'clock on Saturday week. He asked me to lend him a few shillings to pay for a watch which he had bought of a man, and who was with him. I saw the watch in the other man's hand. There were three of them together, the prisoner and two more. I lent him ten shillings, the other man gave him the watch, and the prisoner paid him some notes and some shillings. The watch looked like silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the man who sold him the watch since - A. No; on the Monday I heard the prisoner was apprehended. I did not go to ask him for the ten shillings, as I thought he would pay when he got clear.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money do you get - A. My husband allows me one pound a week for market money. I have four children. I did not see Rice, the officer, that day - it was about the middle of the day.</p>

The prisoner had several times been at my shop; after which we had missed some vierges; we having a suspicion of him laid a trap for him by counting what were in the box. I had counted them on his account on the third of this instant, but before he came on the 5th that number was altered; he came about seven in the morning under pretence of buying vierges as before. My servant called me down stairs; he had bolted him in, and said, there is the man that has got some of your vierges. Then I collared him, and said, you are the chap that has robbed me several times before (I believe I had lost a gross in a week.) He denied it boldly, so I sent for a constable. There were two dropped down under him, and one fell on the compter; that one I don't charge him with. We found a hole in his waistcoat pocket through which they must have passed, in the lining of which there were 15. (Produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

            . The prisoner came to my master's to buy some vierges about seven or eight o'clock the 5th of this month. I knew him before by his coming; he used to sell my master vierges; I shewed him some, and turned them out as usual on a paper for him to chuse; he said there were none of the height he wanted. Another person came into the shop that wanted some other things ; I went to serve him; the prisoner had got the paper in his hand to pour them into the box which he then held in his hand; I saw him pour some aside and shut his hand; I did not see him put them into his pocket; he was going out, but I bolted the door and called my master down. I had counted them over night, there were ten dozen and two in the box. I counted them in the box; at this time there were eight dozen and eight. My master sent for the constable, and he searched him; there were found 15 in the lining of his waistcoat pocket, two dropped on the floor, and one on the compter, which made up just the number.</p>

            . I am constable. I was sent for. I searched the prisoner and found 15 vierges in the lining of his waistcoat, two were found on the ground, and one on the compter. He had no money in his pockets to pay for any thing had he bought &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I used to make vierges for Mr. Welch. I had once made three dozen, and was coming along, having them in my waistcoat pocket; the bottom happened to come out, and I lost about two dozen; I gave them over for lost, and these are them.</p>
               <p>Welch. Those are not of the prisoner's making, they are made by one Ward; what I bought of the prisoner are quite of a different sort.</p>

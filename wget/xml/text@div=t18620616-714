On Monday, 19th May, about 8 in the morning, I was on duty in East-lane, Walworth—the prisoner Nye is a com-dealer at 28 in that street—I saw a van belonging to Mr. Aste in front of Nye's shop, delivering corn—it is a double-fronted shop—the prisoner Baker was in charge of the van—I saw six sacks delivered—Morgan took the corn from the van into the shop—Baker put the corn at the back of the van—the sacks were on the top of the van, what they call <hi rend="italic">riders</hi>—he gave them to Morgan, at the back part of the van, to carry into the shop—I saw no one but Baker in charge of the van—I saw Nye go into the shop just as the sacks were delivered—he stood aside a moment while they took the fifth sack in, to allow it to be taken in, and he then went into the shop, and Baker got off the van, and went into the shop, and spoke to him—Baker then got on the van and drove away—I followed the van about a quarter of a mile, and then hailed him—he went at a walking pace—when we got to West-street, I said, "I want to speak to you"—he said, "What about?"—I said, "Who gave you any order to leave corn at Mr. Nye's I where is your order?"—he said, "I have got no order"—I said, "Well, you will go to the station with me"—he said nothing to that—I do not think he was aware that I was following him until I spoke to him—I noticed him glance his eye over as they were unloading the corn—I was in uniform—I took him to the station, left Mr. Evans, a builder, in charge of the van, and went back to Nye's shop with two more constables—I saw Nye mixing up some oats in the corn-bin in the shop—I said, "Good morning, Mr. Nye"—he said, "Good morning"—I said, "I suppose you how what I want"—he said, "No"—I said, "These oats"—he said, "My man took them in; I know nothing about it "—I said, "Well, you must go to the station with me"—he did not say anything as to where he was when his man took them in, or give any reason for not knowing anything about</p>

(<hi rend="italic">For Nye.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know Nye before this day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have seen him on several occasions in passing, as I might see other shopkeepers—it might have been a day, or two or three days before, that I last saw him—he had his arms in the bin when I went back, and I supposed he was mixing the corn up—I have not mentioned that before, I was not asked, and did not think of it—I did not give my evidence to any one before giving it before the Magistrate—it was taken down by Mr. Wontner at his office, and before the Magistrate—I had a con<lb></lb>versation at Mr. Wontner's office—he took down my evidence after I was before the Magistrate—he simply asked me the nature of the case, and I told him—I did not mention to him about mixing the corn up—this is the first time I have thought of it—I stated at the police-court that I was thirty yards from Nye when I first saw him—I have measured the ground since, and find I ought to have said thirty feet—it was directly opposite the shop that I first saw him that morning, when the last two sacks were being delivered—I was then in the same posi<lb></lb>tion that I had been in when the others were delivered on the opposite side of the street—the van was directly opposite Nye's door, between me and his door—I saw Nye come from the direction of the Walworth-road—I could nee him plainly enough at his own door, because I went rather on one side and could see him standing on one side of the van—he stood on the footway whilst the last two sacks were being carried, and I stepped aside to see him—he was obliged to stand on one side when the fifth sack was going in—he was not standing in the doorway when he stepped aside I was standing at the tail part of the van—this is the first time I have named his stepping aside—I do not know that it is the first time of my thinking of it—the question has not been put to me before—I did not tell it to Mr. Wontner—I did not speak to Nye till the matter was over—I should think I was away about twenty minutes before I went back and found him in the shop; it might have been half an hour—there were only five sacks in the shop when I came back—six were delivered—I counted them as they were coming in—they were placed one on the top of another in the shop—they were full—four sacks had been delivered before Nye came up—I did not make any inquiry about the other sack when I found only five—the bins were all full—corn is a very hard thing to swear to—I think there was a little girl in the shop when I went back, who had come in for some article—the five sacks were all full—they are there now.</p>

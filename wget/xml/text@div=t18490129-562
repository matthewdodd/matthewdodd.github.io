                  </hi>. I keep the Royal George, at Tanner's-hill, Deptford—I have known the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years. On Thursday night, 21st Dec., about ten o'clock, he came into my house with another man, who was quite a stranger to me—the prisoner asked me for the change of a Bank of England 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I took it from his hand, looked at it, went to my desk, and changed it—I gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and five sovereigns—I said,</p>

               <p>"What name am I to put to this note, Kimber?"—he replied, "In the name of Harvey"—the other man was standing by him, and they both replied at the same time, looking at each other—I wrote that name on the back of the note, and I see it here now (<hi rend="italic">looking at the note</hi>)—the prisoner wrapped the sovereigns up in the note, and they both went into the tap-room—they staid there a short time, and left together—on the 23d I sent the note, by my son, to Mr. Peppercorn, for change, and he returned it to me on the 29th, stamped "Forged," as it is now—upon that I sent to the prisoner—he lived within twenty yards of me—he came directly—I showed him the note, and said, "Kimber, here is a pretty job you have got roe into; you have passed a forged note"—he said, "I see it is, I see it is; it is a very bad job indeed"—I said, "Do you know this man Harvey?"—he said he had seen him before, and that he was a plumber, living at the lower part of Deptford—I told him to go and find him, for I should hold him responsible for the note—he said, "I know it, and will pay it by instalments"—he went out to find Harvey, and came back in about an hour—he said that he bad been down to the lower part of Deptford, and could not find Harvey—I said, "Well, it is a bad job," and again repeated that I should hold him responsible—he said he knew it, and then left—he came again next morning, of his own accord, and said, "Well, Mr. Barton, what is to be done?"—I said, "What money can you raise, Kimber?"—he said he would go out and try what he could get—he went out, returned very shortly, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and agreed to pay the remainder at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week—he did not pay me anything beyond the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he was taken into custody that same evening—he it a maker of pattens and clogs, and is a sort of jobbing horse-dealer.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my father, and assist him in his business. On the evening of 21st Dec., about ten o'clock, I was there, when the prisoner came into the bar with another man, a stranger—the prisoner gave my father a note, and asked him for change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and five sovereigns—my father asked him what name he should put on the note, and they both answered together, "Harvey," and the other man said, "Harvey, a plumber, living at the lower part of Deptford"—they both said so—after changing the note they had one or two pints of porter, and then went into the tap-room for a few minutes—while my father was getting the change for the note I just peeped outside the door, just to see if there was any horse there that they were dealing for, to satisfy my curiosity, and I saw two men under the lamp, just outside the door—the prisoner said he had been looking at a horse for this Harvey; that was whilst my father was getting the change—after I came in again the two men from outside came in, went into the tap-room, and stopped there a few</p>

               <p>minutes, and then all four went out together—I cannot say whether they were all in company or not—I knew one of those two men; hit name is Martin, I believe, and he is a lodginghouse-keeper, in Mill-lane—I had seen him in the prisoner's company several times.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 38). On Saturday, 30th Dec, from information I received I went to Mr. Barton's, and received from him this note—it has the name of Harvey endorsed on it—it is No. 64505, dated London, 4th Oct., 1848—I afterwards went after the prisoner—I found him in his own house—I told him he was charged with having uttered to Mr. Barton a forged 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he said it was a bad job, and he was very sorry for it, but he did not utter it; it was not for himself; it was another man that was with him—I said, "Yours was the hand that uttered the note, and yours was the hand that received the change"—he then said, "It was not for myself; it was for a man of the name of Martin, a baker, living at the lower part of Deptford"—I am sure he said Martin—I asked if he knew the man—he said he had seen him before—I asked whether he could tell me where he lived—he said, "I have been trying to find him myself, but cannot"—I asked how he came in company with this man—he said that he had been called by a man in Deptford Broadway, and was asked by him if he would earn a bit of silver, which he said was for assisting him in the sale of a pony—I asked who the man was that was about selling the pony—he said, "It was a man that I have seen in Smithfield, but I do not know his name"—he said that the changing of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note was for the payment of the pony—I then said, "What remuneration were you to get for changing that note?"—he said, "I was to have 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I did have"—I did not mention the name of Harvey to him on that occasion—I believe I did at the station say that the name of Harvey appeared on the note instead of the name of Martin which he gave me, I believe that was all—he never mentioned the name of Harvey to me, not at the time he was apprehended; he did afterwards at the station say that it was Harvey, and not Martin, and I said, "I do not know what you meant, but you told me Martin"—he altered the name—after the first examination before the Magistrate I asked him who the other men were that were with him—he said there were no other men with him; the only person that was with him was the man Harvey—I said, "There were two other men outside the house, who came into the tap-room and joined you, and all four of you came away together"—he said there were no other men with him but the man whose note it was, nor were there any other men outside of the house, and that he had come away from the house with the one man only—I have searched through the whole of Deptford, and there is no person named Harvey, either a baker or plumber; nor is there any person named Martin a baker or plumber, but there is a man named Martin, whom I know to be a companion of the prisoner, who keeps a lodging-house for all sorts of travellers.</p>

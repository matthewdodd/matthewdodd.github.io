               <p>The Record of Underwood's Conviction was read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manning . In December 1736, I was robbed by Underwood of 2 Pair of Stockings; they were stolen out of my shop in Holborn. By Underwood's Directions I went to the Prisoner's House: She then lived in Black-Boy-Alley in Chick-Lane. I took her before Mr. Justice Poulson , about a Day or 2 after the Robbery was committed, and one Pair of my Stockings were taken off her Legs: but soon after this, she was admitted to Bail, and I never could find either the Prisoner or her Bail, until some little Time ago when her Bail came and told me she was in Custody, and that I must prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave Underwood 3 s. and 6 d. for the Stockings, and asked him if he had not found them, and said I would not buy them if he had stole them.</p>
               <p>Manning . Underwood was a Boy, about 14 Years of Age; I prosecuted him in January Sessions 1736, for stealing 2 Pair of Stockings. One Pair, which I took upon Him, and those which I found upon Her, were mine. She now says, she gave 3 s. and 6 d. for them; but when she was before the Justice, she said she gave but 1 s. and 6 d. and did not ask the Boy how he came by them. The Stockings cost me 4 Shillings.</p>

             , I was Constable at that Time, and took her up with a Warrant, on Account of these Stockings. They were taken off her Legs before the Justice; Mr. Manning swore to them, and she owned she had bought them of Underwood . I do not remember what she said she gave for them. <rs id="t17400416-6-verdict39" type="verdictDescription">

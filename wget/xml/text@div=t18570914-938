                  </hi>. I am an assistant warder at Millbank Prison. The pri<lb></lb>soner was a penal class convict in that prison—he was brought from Pen<lb></lb>tonville—I do not recollect the date when he was brought, but I recollect that I received him into the ward when he came—on 21st Aug. I was on duty at the chapel at Millbank—I was in charge of him that morning at the chapel—two warders go with the convicts when they go to the chapel—the convicts go in single file—one warder goes in front, and one at the end of the convicts—on 21st Aug., about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock, we left the chapel to return to the cells—you have to ascend a few steps from the chapel—Bevington went up first—a prisoner of the name of Learing fol<lb></lb>lowed—one of the name of Harris ought to have gone second after Learing—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a penal class prisoner in Millbank Prison. I was in the chapel on the morning that this matter occurred—the service was over about 9 o'clock, or half past—Bevington was the assistant warder there—he came out of the chapel first—I was first after him—Gorman ought to have been third, but he rushed past the prisoner Harris, and made himself second—he ought to have been behind Harris—he pushed past Harris, and got behind me—he followed behind me for about the space of fifty yards, then I came to a turning of the stairs—Bevington still continued before me—when we came to a corner of the stairs, Gorman gave me a push on one side, and ascended the stairs before me—that placed him next to the officer who was leading the penal class prisoners from chapel—we had to go along a passage by the side of the dormitory, but instead of keeping behind the officer in the ordinary way, a few yards before we came to the corner, he wheeled round in a kind of a half circle, and immediately drew from his left cuff something with his right hand—I supposed it to be a weapon of some sort, being rather bright at the point; he struck the officer with it in his right hand, on the right side of the face—it knocked the officer into the dormitory, and then he rushed down the stairs—I stopped immediately, and held up my hands and looked round to my officer, Mr. Wilkie, who was about two yards in the rear—Mr. Fletcher, the principal warder, came out of the dormitory, and rushed after (Gorman—I followed Fletcher—when I got down in the ward, I saw him standing in front of Gorman, asking him what he had done—he held out his two arms, and said he had done nothing and had nothing—Mr. Fletcher then sent him to his cell—(<hi rend="italic">knife produced</hi>)—I never had that knife in my hands before, but it appeared something like it, as I was a little way behind him—it was such a thing as that, as far as I saw—I did not see the knife found anywhere.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the principal warder at Millbank Prison. The prisoner was one of the penal class prisoners in that prison—on 21st Aug. I was in the dormitory at the time they were returning from chapel—the door of the dormitory leads into the passage along which we have to pass—if you were going to the dormitory from the chapel, you have to pass along one passage first, then to ascend some steps into another passage—the door of the dormitory is at the end of the passage, about six or eight yards from the angle, not more—after having turned round the angle, six or eight yards further on is the door of the dormitory—my attention was not drawn by any noise beyond the unlocking of the door; that was the signal that they were coming out of chapel, and I went to the door of the dormitory to meet them—Bevington was the first person I saw when I got to the door—he passed exactly in front of me, and nearly close to me, he staggered past me, but the side of his face that was injured was not next me, and I did not know whether he was taken suddenly ill or what; he passed me into the dormitory—I did not then see that he was wounded—there was only just room for me to pass between the officer and the prisoner; he was close to my right hand, and the officer close to my left—I should not think he was more than one yard from Bevington—I distinctly remember seeing two other penal class prisoners besides the prisoner, almost close up to him; they were all in a short space, the length of this Jury box—Gorman went in the direction of his ward after Bevington staggered; I asked him what he had been doing, or what was the matter; I looked towards the prisoner for an explanation; I am not sure whether he gave me any reply, but I think he said he had been doing nothing—he then passed me on his way to the ward, and I followed him—I went down two flights of stairs in going to the ward—there was an officer at the bottom of those stairs—I called to the officer to stop him; some suspicion crossed my mind, and I did not feel satisfied—he stopped at the end of the ward; I went down and laid hold of both his hands, and examined them, and took a superficial view of him; at that time I could see nothing about him—I questioned him again if he had been doing anything; he said he had not, and that he had nothing about him—I searched him thoroughly after that, and found nothing on him—I saw the warder Humphrey pick up the knife at the bottom of the stairs; he handed it to me immediately—he picked it up immediately underneath where the prisoner had to pass in going down to his ward—that was on the lower flight, where the wards are—he had not to pass where the knife was found, but I believe he went along the centre floor, and the knife was found on the bottom floor—a knife could have been dropped from the place where the prisoner passed to the place where it was picked up by Humphrey—when Humphrey brought me that knife, there was a small quantity of fresh blood on the handle,</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant warder in Millbank Prison.

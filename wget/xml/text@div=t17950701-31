            Who enquired for serjeant Cooke? - The men who took me. When serjeant Cooke came down stairs, he took me into a room on the left hand side, by the passage going in, and asked me if I would be a soldier? I told him that I would not, that I was an apprentice and desired my liberty; he told me if I would not be a soldier, he would be d-d if I should go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010067"></xptr>from there, for there he would keep me; I asked him for a pen and ink, to let me write, and he refused to let me have it; he took me up stairs into a back garret, where I was locked up; I was kept there till near the middle of the day on Sunday, and then he let me go down stairs into a room in the one pair of stairs; before the dusk of the evening he carried me up into the same room again, and locked me up again till Monday, on Monday he told me if I offered to make any resistance to what he was going to do, he would blow my brains out; he and another carried me to a place, which I suppose to be the office in Queen-square. I was ordered to stand up on some steps, and there was a gentleman sitting reading some news papers, and he asked me what my name was? Mr. Cooke made answer and said, William Harris; he said, have you got your bounty? and he said, here it is for him, and he put seven guineas into my hand; he took me back again to the Star and Gartor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nothing more pass there? - Yes, there was an old gentleman that was at the desk went on to read something to me, what it was I cannot tell you, I was so terrified. Then I was took back again by this Cooke, and him that came with me to the Star and Garter.</p>
               <p>Q. A soldier? - Yes. They took me up into the room in the one pair of stairs, and I staid there a little while, and he ordered me to come out and pull off my clothes, and put on some soldiers clothes; I put on the soldiers clothes, and laid my own down at my feet, as I pulled them off, and as I was stooping down to pick up my own clothes, he knocked me backward, and before I could get up again my clothes were gone, and the seven guineas that was in my pocket, that he had given me, and a guinea of my own.</p>

            Did you make a memorandum of it at the time? - Not at the time, till he was sworn in. Every morning after my breakfast I go down to the Star and Garter, to approve of the men that may be brought there as recruits; he was brought there by one Brown, he was to have ten guineas bounty, and three to be deducted for the clothes, knapsack and accoutrements; he was brought down stairs as usual, into the parlour before he was attested, he was brought into the parlour to me; I asked him, my lad, are you willing to go for a soldier? yes, says he, I am; says I, what trade are you? he told me he was a porter that he carried out small parcels; I asked him if he had been ill, for he looked rather as I thought weakley, and I made a cemical observation of him, I said he will make a very good man-midwife, for he has got very long fingers. Now, says I, you are perfectly willing to go into the Louth Volunteers? yes, says he, I am; says I, you are not an apprentice? no, says he, I am not; the consequence was, I told him to go up into the room along with the rest of the recruits; but prior to that, says I, will you like to leave any of the bounty in my hands; no, says he, I will have it all down now, very well, says I take him away; it is my duty to take them to the surgeon before he is sworn, to see if he is found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give direction that he should be taken to the surgeon? - Yes, but whether he was or was not I don't know. The next thing I heard was, that he had deserted.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all that that is the man that you spoke to? - If I had a doubt of him I should have a doubt of mo father, whom I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that oath was administered to that William Harris, whoever he was? - Most undoubtedly he was.(The attestation read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man answered to the name of William Harris or not? - Most undoubtedly, for he must write his name, William Harris, before I wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever suffer a serjeant or any other person whatever, to give in the name of the man who appears for them, and not let the man give in his own name? - I fit at my desk, at the corner, I call the recruit to me, if he can write his name I make him do it at the beginning of the attestation, if he cannot write his name, I make him make his mark, and I write under it, the mark of such a one; I never suffer a person to be attested whose name is wrote before he comes to the office; if his name is wrote I strike my pen through it, and make him write it over again.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman at the Star and Garter, Palace yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Shepberd. I had forgot to ask you one question, is the magistrate's signature J. Warner? - It is justice Warner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Bradley. Did you ever see that young man? - No, I cannot say that I did; to the best of my knowledge I don't think I know the man; I took a man that jumped over the wall, and I took him to serjeant Cooke, and asked serjeant Cooke, does this man belong to you? I took the man in the dark, I cannot be positive to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - I cannot positively say, it was on a Monday in May, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take more than one man in that situation? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only man you ever found in that situation, you took to serjeant Cooke, and delivered to him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was in May? - To the best of my knowledge I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the man that you took, was at all like the young man that stands by you? - He was a tall man, but being in the dark I could not see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. When you carried him to the Star and Garter, was there any light there? - I did not carry him into the parlour, I gave him up at the door to serjeant Cookes there were a couple of candles burning on the table in the parlour, and he took the man from me, and he said, I know the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you should not know the man again if you was to see him? - No, I cannot say I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor can you from a belief, say whether it was Smith or any other person? - It was a tallish man.</p>

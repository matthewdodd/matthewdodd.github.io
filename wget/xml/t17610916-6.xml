Some time after I saw the prisoner come down stairs with a bundle, tied up in her apron; I asked her who she wanted, and what she had in her apron; she said I had no business to enquire what she had in her apron; she had been up with the taylors, and brought a waistcoat of her master's to be mended. I asked her who her master was; she said, Mr. Williams. I looked into her apron, and there I found a waistcoat and brush, my property. Then she offered to down on her knees to ask pardon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Atkins, a lighterman, and live in John-street, Commercial-road, in the parish of Lambeth—we occupy the whole house. On Saturday, the 22nd of January, I went out about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, leaving my little girl, twelve years old, down in the kitchen—I locked the parlour-door, and left the key with her in the kitchen—I shut the street-door, and put the shutters to, but did not fasten them—I came back about six, and found the shut<lb></lb>ters open, and the bottom sash of the window thrown right up, so as to enable any one to get in—it was shut down when I had gone out—I knocked, and my little girl came to the door—I went in and missed the articles stated—I saw them again about nine the same evening, at Tower-street station—they are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 21.) On the evening of the 22nd of January, about a quarter to six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Cornwali-road Lambeth, about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's house, and coming in a direction from it—he had a bundle with him—I was about crossing over to him—he saw I was making up to him, and dropped the bundle, and walked on—I took him and the bundle—it contained this blanket, sheet, and counterpane, which I produce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had not got them—he took me about a hundred yards away from the things, which were lying on the ground. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No; not above twelve yards—there was a female standing near him by a gate, but I saw him for seven or eight yards before I crossed over—I was on the opposite side of the way, and suspecting him, made towards him, and he dropped the bundle by his side, close by the gateway of a doctor's shop—he did not attempt to run away—I went and took him, and then returned and got the bundle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He asked the woman if I had left them there, and she said I did not. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said to the woman, "You saw him drop these, of course," but she made no answer—I distinctly saw the bundle drop from the prisoner.</p>

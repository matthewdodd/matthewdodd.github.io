                  </hi>. I have been the master of a ship, but have retired, and live at 40, Trinity-grove, Mile-end—on 25th July, 1862, between 1 and 2 in the afternoon, I was in New Gravel-lane, Shadwell, and saw a crowd of fellows idling about, two of whom came and bustled against me—one ran against me and nearly knocked me down; the other snatched my watch and chain from my pocket and ran away—I have not seen it since—one of the men has been tried and convicted at Clerkenwell—I do not know that I could tell the prisoner's face, because he ran off immediately—I know him by his hair, and he had a long nose—I ran after him and sung out, "Stop thief!"</p>

I am a baker, of 12, Baker-street, Commercial-road—on 12th July, 1862, between 12 and 1 in the afternoon, I was passing along New Gravel-lane, and saw the prisoner and another man tossing—I looked at them for a little time, and saw the old gentleman come out of the back-gate of the London Docks—the man who has been convicted, spoke to the prisoner, and then they both ran up the road together in front of the prosecutor—the other man ran against him, and the prisoner took his watch from his fob pocket—I saw it in the prisoner's hand—a policeman came up and I told him—they ran away—I was taken to the police-station in January, and picked the prisoner out from four or five others—I am sure he is the man; I have seen him several times before.</p>

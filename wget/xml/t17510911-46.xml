               <p>Wellings Callcot. On the 22d of July I had been out a little way in the fields, and seeing a crowd in <placeName id="t17510911-46-crimeloc218">Upper Moor-fields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17510911-46-crimeloc218" type="placeName" value="Upper Moor-fields"></interp>

I had not stood five minutes, before a person tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me if I had not lost my handkerchief? I had had it in my hand a little time before. The person, who was a stranger to me, said, he'd shew me the person who took it, and directed me to the prisoner. I took and searched him, and found my handkerchief under his arm, next to his skin. [The handkerchief produced in court, and deposed to.] He said it was the first fault he had been guilty of, and hoped I'd forgive him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of William Reed, who is in partnership with Mr. Thomas Hatton, engravers and printers in King-street, Coventgarden—I am their servant. I engaged the prisoner as agent by commission—he began business with us on the 1st of March—he was to travel to get orders on commission—he was to have ten per cent, on all orders given him—on the 5th of August he came to the shop and gave orders for Trueman and Hanbury—we were to engrave a plate, and print two hundred cards—he said he had been to Trueman and Hanbury's—they were pleased with our design—they wished a drawing to be sent them according to his directions—he had had designs of ours in order to enable him to obtain orders—the drawing produced was accordingly prepared, and was delivered to him for their approval—he returned it, said they approved of it, and had agreed to have the plate engraved as per drawing and two hundred cards—the plate was ten guineas, and the cards ten guineas per hundred, which would be thirty guineas—the plate was completed—the goods were sent in on the 11th of December—in the meantime the prisoner received ten per cent, commission for the order—I saw Mr. Hatton pay him—I cannot say positively in what monies—there was some gold and silver—the prisoner was still in our service—on the same day as the goods were delivered to Messrs. Trueman he absconded—he requested they should be sent on that day, so that he might go to them himself—he never returned—before he went he borrowed some money of one of the firm.</p>

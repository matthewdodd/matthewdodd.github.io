               <p>THOMAS LIGHTFOOT. I apprehended the prisoners, and received the sixpence from Mrs. Wood, and another from Mr. Wood; I got a sixpence from Mason - they are all marked differently; I know one from the other - I asked the prisoners to turn their pockets out, and Mrs. Wood to search them, but she declined it; Lamb had 2d. and 4d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110079"></xptr>in halfpence, Walker had 1d. piece, and Deaton had two pieces of mutton - I found no sixpence on any of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. I have examined this money - the sixpence produced by Mason is counterfeit; the other two are likewise counterfeits, and I believe all three were cast in the same mould.</p>

I said, "There it is" - he stooped down and took it up.</p>
               <p>Deaton's Defence. Mrs. Wood refused the sixpence, and it was thrown away; she said, "I will show you the difference," and opened the till - Mr. Wood was called down; Mrs. Wood said she was a better judge of money than to have taken a bad one.</p>

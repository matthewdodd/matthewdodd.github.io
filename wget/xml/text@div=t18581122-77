                  </hi>. I live at 1, Price's-terrace, King Edward-street, Westminster-road. My family live in the next house, No. 2. About 6 o'clock on Sunday, 14th November, I went from No. 1 to No. 2, and while I was there I thought I heard a slight rumbling noise at No. 1. I returned to No. 1 at about 7 o'clock—a private door from the back garden leads into it—I went in by that door—I found that the back-door leading into the garden had been forcibly opened; the latch was destroyed—I ascended the kitchen stairs and heard a noise like the drawing of some boxes, or something of that kind, from under the bed—I went into the back-parlour and found the cheffonier doors wide open, the easy chair disturbed, a large cupboard opened, and all my papers disturbed and strewed about—a silver-edged piece of plate was removed from the sideboard where it had been standing, to another place—I still heard the noise upstairs—I went out to get assistance—I returned without any, and went on to the landing of No. 1—the noise upstairs still continued, and I called out, "You had better come down, I know you are there"—after trying to open the landing window, a man came down stairs; it was the prisoner Regan—he came down the landing by the street-door, where I was—he threw something at me, and tried to get away—I returned the compliment with a stick that I had—I had a lantern with me—I saw him most distinctly, and swear posi<lb></lb>tively to him—I only saw one person come down—I found that the front door was broken; the back door, and all the windows were open—the front door has a Bramah lock—the locks of both the front and back doors were forcibly brokep open by a crowbar. I missed a waistcoat, a cigar case, a scarf, and some spoons—I have since seen some of them—they would cost me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to replace—I am perfectly sure that the doors were all fast when I was in the house before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 172). On the evening of the 14th November, about 7 o'clock, I was on duty at the Cathedral in St. George's-road. From information I received I went to Price's-terraoe—I there saw a man come out of No. 1—it was the prisoner Attwood—I am sure he is the man—he came from the front door and called out "There he goes, there he goes!"—he ran away, and I went after him calling "Stop thief!" as loud as I could halloo—a hackney carriage attendant came up and stopped him—I did not lose sight of him until he was stopped—I suppose I was 10 or 12 yards from him when he was stopped—I kept him in view the whole time—I said, "I take you on suspicion of coming out of 1, Price's-terrace—he said, "Oh!"—that was all he said—he was so out of breath that I do not think he could say anything else—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a knife, a tobacco-stopper, and four lucifers. The inspector asked him whether there was any border on the scarf—he said, "No"—there appeared to have been a border on the scarf, or something, that had been cut off—I afterwards went to the house, 1, Price's-terrace. A crowbar was produced by <hi rend="italic">L</hi> 170—I did not see it found—I compared that crowbar with some marks on the back and front doors of No. 1, and they corresponded—I think the entrance had been made by the back door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hackney carriage attendant, No. 138.

On the 12th of February, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in for the purpose of begging charity; I had given him a waistcoat, a pair of trousers, a hat, and a shilling, three weeks before; I was engaged in serving a customer; he walked down the shop, and stood before the fire; while I was at the top of the shop I saw him walk up hastily, and he said he would call again as I was busy; I said I would attend to him directly, and asked what he wanted; he began to tell me a long tale of his distresses, and I saw under his lame arm a parcel, which I knew was my own; I took hold of him, and asked what it was; he said it was some thread and needles which he mended his clothes with - he did not wish me to see it, but I took hold of it, and it was my own.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

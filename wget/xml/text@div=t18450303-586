                  </hi>. I am a porter. On Thursday morning, the 20th of Feb., at half-past ten o'clock, I was passing Mr. Walton's shop, in Lud<lb></lb>gate-street, and heard money rattle on the ground, and something like glass fall, I turned round, looked at the shop window, and saw it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Christopher Walton, of Ludgate-street. It is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Gregory by St. Paul—he buys light gold and coins, and has a bowl in the window with light sovereigns in it—about half-past seven o'clock on the morning in question I put seventy-five sovereigns from a bag into the bowl—I counted them—there was also a bowl of guineas—I put them into the window about half-past eight—I was in the counting-house afterwards—I heard somebody open the shop door—I went out, and the prisoner was surrounded by persons at the shop window, who said in his hearing, "That is him who broke it, and there is another one run away"—I found a pane of glass broken, which was whole two minutes previous—I found the sovereign bowl upset, and the sovereigns all scattered about, some in the window, some on the cill, and some on the ground—I counted them, and there were four missing—I found a brick in the window, wrapped up in a piece of cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the City police. I saw Mr. Walton's window about three minutes before it was broken, and saw the prisoner with another against it—after I had passed I saw some persons running towards the shop—I went back, and found the window broken—these sovereigns on the ledge, and the prisoner in the shop—I took him into custody—he told me at the station that he broke the window with a piece of brick and cloth; that he got hold of the bowl, but his hand was so cold he could not hold it, or he should have had some of the sovereigns; that he did it to get money to get some clothes, for he could not get work.</p>

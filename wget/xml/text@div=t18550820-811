                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital. I saw the prisoner's wife when she was brought into the hospital—she was in a very weak state from loss of blood—there was a wound on the head, which bled rather profusely—it was a clean cut wound, not such a wound as could have been inflicted by this strap, but by some sharp cutting instrument—I think nails could not have made such a cut—there was no appearance of a bruise—the wound was to the membrane of the bone—I do not think it could have been done by a strap at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On 4th Aug. I left home at half past 5 o'clock in the morning to go to work; I returned home in the evening; I paid my rent, and walked up stairs; my room door was locked; I could not get in; I went into a person's room on the same floor, and waited till past 11 o'clock, when I left, thinking they wanted to go to bed; I went in search of my wife; I could not find her; I sat on the stairs, I did not like to force my door open; my wife did not come home till 11 o'clock the next night; she was tipsy, and as I sat on the stairs, she fell over me; she said, "Who the b——h—l are you?"—I said, "Don't make a noise, where have You been?" she unlocked the door; I went in and took off my jacket, and would have gone to bed, but she had stripped the bed of everything, even to the bolster; this strap hung on the bedpost; I laid down on the bed, and in a few minutes she took the strap and struck me five or six times, and said, "Get off the bed, you b——r?" I got off the bed, and took the strap; I struck her with it, and cut her head; she said, "That is what I wanted, now I will give you in charge."</p>

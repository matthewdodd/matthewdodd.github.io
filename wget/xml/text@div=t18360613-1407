On the morning of the 16th of May I was in Edgeware-road, about a quarter to two o'clock, I heard a noise on the roofs of some small shops there, and saw the prisoner lying on his belly on the roof of Mr. Dolman's shop, a carver and gilder—I called to him, and asked what he did there—he made no answer—I sprang my rattle—he then jumped off into a passage, into a garden, and over a wall, he was jumping over another wall, when I collared him, and asked what he did on the roof of the shop—he said, "For God's sake, give me my hat," but he had it on at the time—I gave him to another officer—on examining the roof where he laid, I found a quantity of lead cut from it,</p>

               <p>and standing in the garden at the corner of Winchester-row—I found this knife lying on the spot where the prisoner was lying—I came down and told him I must take him to the station-house—on the way I asked him what he was going to do with that lead—he said, "What lead?"—I said, "That lead," Pointing to the lead which the men were carrying—he made no answer—I said, "If you won't tell me, perhaps you will tell somebody else"—I asked where he lived—he said, in Rochester-row, Westminster, but at the station-house he told the inspector he lived in Stafford-row—I found on him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and odd, a knife, a comb, and a key—I have fitted the lead to the part of the roof stripped, and it exactly corresponds, and made up the quantity—there was 114lbs. of it.</p>

That it was for this Reason, (the Crimes of Forgery and Perjury being so frequent, the Error that flieth by Night, and the secret Transactions by which the Lives and Properties of every Man were in Danger) the Punishment which was extremely mild, was not thought adequate to the Crime, and therefore the Wisdom of the Legislature, thought fit by an Act of this present Majesty, to make this Offence Felony, without Benefit of Clergy.</p>
               <p>That this Law was to be in Force for five Years only, but before its Expiration, the good Effects of it were perceived, and it was therefore revived, and made perpetual, by another Act of the 9th of his present Majesty, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Act of the 2d of the King which made this Offence Felony, and the Act for the reviving and making the same perpetual, were read.</p>

Lee was not there when the Will was first brought; he came to account for the Error in it. I got the Executrix sworn before Doctor Chapman, and then I observed a Mistake of John at the Bottom, instead of Peter, upon which I applied to the Register's Clerk who told me that Error must be accounted for.

They went away that Time, and the next Day Dominick brought the other Prisoner Lee to me, - I can't tell whether Kelly was present then. I am certain Lee was, for I took particular Notice of him as he came into the Court. He pretended that his Name was Welch , and that he was one of the subscribing Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Council. Did he make any Affidavit that Night?</p>
               <p>Mr. Taverner. No; he seemed to be in Liquor, and I told him the Thing he came about was of a very serious Nature, therefore I would not draw an Affidavit for a Person in such a Condition. I appointed him to come some other Time, when he was perfectly sober, and I think the next Morning he came, and I took Instructions from him, and had him sworn to it. This is the Affidavit, he swore to it by the Name of Welch, and I have attested it.</p>

I told them, I had some Business with my Coal-Man at Billingsgate, and would walk so far with them. At their Desire I went with them as far as Tower Hill, and they attempted to go into the Ship, but there being some Company there, we came out again. We then went to the Tyger : that House was full of Soldiers, and therefore we adjourned from thence to the Three Crowns in Thames-street. We call'd for a Pot of Beer, and then Lee said to Fitzgerald, Dominick! you know what we come about! why don't you do that Thing? So I will, said Fitzgerald; upon which he took a Paper out of his Pocket , which I found to be a blank Sailor's Will. He filled up the Spaces, and made the Mark, and then James Lee signed it in the Name of Welch, and

Why, (said Lee) you may as well, for we received Money but last Week on such an Account as this; no Body can be a Sufferer, for this Money goes to the Chatham Chest , and the King never pays twice. I desired to be excused, and then Fitzgerald said, I am but a poor Man, and there is a good deal of Wages due to this Man, and if I knew that any Body would discover, I'd run a Knife into him.</p>

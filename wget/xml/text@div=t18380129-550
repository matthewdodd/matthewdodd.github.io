                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Cleveland-street, and am an attorney's clerk. On Saturday evening, the 6th of January, I went out on a visit, and came home on Sunday morning—having arrived at Oxford-street, I met the prisoner—she accosted me, and induced me to enter into conver—I sation with her at the corner of Berners-street, and while we were talking, I the seeing my trowsers pocket unbuttoned, thrust her hand in, and took out six sovereigns that were loose—there were nine, and she left three I—I know they were there, because I had made up my accounts in the evening, at about six o'clock—I was not drunk—I had been drinking, but I am certain the money was in my pocket—she ran away, but I took her at a short distance—I do not know whether she was searched, or whether she delivered the money to the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I met him—he asked me where I was going—I said I did not know, I had no lodgings to go to—he got into conversation, and said, "Will you take a walk as far as my house?"—I said, "I have no home nor lodgings"—he said, "If you will walk with me up here," which I did, and we got half a dozen doors up Berners-street—he stood and talked to me—he said, "I have but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., whatever I have I will give you"—we staid there a few minutes—he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put the money into my pocket, and while we were there the policeman came by, and saw us there—he passed by, and the prosecutor said, "You need not mind the policeman, he will not know but that I live here"—I then consented to what the prosecutor wished, and staid there ten minutes—he said, "What money have you got in your pocket?"—I said, "What makes you want to know?"—he said, "You have robbed me?"—I said, "If I have robbed you, give me in charge"—he said "Stop till the policeman comes, and I will"—I stopped, I suppose ten minutes, and then the policeman came—he said, "You are not going to run away"—I said, "No, and I will go to the policeman"—I did so, and said, "This gentleman accuses me of rob<lb></lb>bing him"—he wanted to know what money I had—I said, "You are wel<lb></lb>come to see, I don't know whether it is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and I gave it to the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 133.) About three o'clock on this morning I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor in Berners-street, in a public place—I cannot say what took place before—I saw them standing talking—I passed and looked at them—I went up to the corner of Castle-street and looked at them—on a sudden I saw the prisoner run away towards Oxford-street—the man ran after her and called "Police"—I went up—he said, "I give this woman into custody, she has robbed me of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. perhaps more; I cannot say till I look over my accounts"—the prisoner said, "What I have got is 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he gave me to have to do with me, and now he wants to swear I robbed him, I will give you all the money I have, which is the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he gave me"—she took out five sovereigns, a sixpence, and three farthings in copper money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Mr. Lucas had given me the money when the policeman first passed, then he went his round and came up Berners-street again, and I said "Here is the policeman, if you wish to give me in charge."</p>

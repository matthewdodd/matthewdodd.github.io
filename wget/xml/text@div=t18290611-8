I stopped the prisoner, seeing him put the handkerchief into his breast pocket - I collared him, and took it out; I had seen him turn down Field-lane, and collared him directly he came to my door - he was running very fast: Lewis claimed the handkerchief - I saw the other three found, which have not been claimed.</p>

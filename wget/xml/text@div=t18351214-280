                  </hi>. I live at the Green Man, at Ealing. On the 9th of October, I arrived at home between eight and nine o'clock—I pulled my watch out to see the time—the parlour clock was down, I went to wind it up, and I judge I laid the watch down on the table—I did not miss it till the next morning—this is it—there was a gold chain, two seals, and two gold keys—the prisoner Healey lodged at my house for four months—he had not been away till he was detected in Tottenham-court-road.</p>

On Friday afternoon, between four and five o'clock, the pri<lb></lb>soner Healey came to my shop, to offer me a glad watch—he said it cost him 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he wanted 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and said he was a decayed farmer, which made him want to sell it—In consequence of the price he asked, I was well convinced he did not know the value of it, and asked if he had any person who knew that it was his—he said he had a man at the door—he opened the door, and called in Saunders (but before that Healey said his name was Walker)—I told Saunders to come into my parlour, and asked him if he knew the other man had a gold watch—he said, "Yes, he found it in Oxford-road"—I went to Healey again, and said, "What, did you my you gave for it 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes, but there was a chain and seals to it, which made it come to that price"—he then fainted away—I took him in, and gave him a glass of water—he recovered, and I asked him if he could bring any other person—he said yes, and named a butcher—he went away after I had taken a description of his person, and brought a butcher—I took him into my parlour and he prevaricated—I said I should give them into custody—they all ran out of the shop—I ran, and brought them back.</p>

               <p>I am cellar-man to the prosecutor; I know nothing of the loss of the bottles. On the 27th of May, I was called upon by Justice Hyde's men to search some suspicious bottles, and in Lowther's house we found these two bottles, which I challenged as being marked exactly like ours, with an A. I think they were in the cellar, as far as there is a possibility of swearing to a mark, I can swear to this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Council. Is it possible at all to swear to them? - I do not know there is any other mark that is the same, it is an A.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that that bottle was ever in your house? - I can swear no more than to the mark.</p>
               <p>I believe Lowther is a dealer in bottles? - He keeps a bottle shop.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you used that mark? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any other mark? - There is no other mark.</p>

               <p>I recollect the prisoner Oates, I have seen him in my own shop, I live in No. 8, Charles-court, St. James's square, I recollect he brought me a few bottles, scale time past.</p>
               <p>When was that? - To the best of my recollection, it was about five or six months ago, I bought a few of him, my husband is a broker.</p>
               <p>Who did he use to come in company with? - By himself.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. I believe you are an accomplice? - Yes, as I was coming from the Prince of Wales's one day with the prisoner who was a carman, he stopped the cart on the way, and said take this prickle , and carry it to that court, and set it down at Jenniway's door, and do not mention a word, so I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose bottles were these? - We had carried some full bottles to the Prince of Wales's , they were my master's bottles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Did you look at them? - No, I did not pack them up.</p>

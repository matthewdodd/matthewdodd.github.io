               <p>ROBERT BARNETT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What business are you? - A. I am an apothecary and man-midwife, at Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.State what you know relating to that unfortunate woman? - A. On Tuesday the 24th of August, I saw a female infant, which I examined, to ascertain whether it was born dead or alive, and I gave my opinion on oath, before the Coroner, that it was born alive, and not above ten or twelve hours before, and been in the water about five hours; on Thursday the 26th, by the desire of the overfeers, I went to the house of the prisoner, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180071"></xptr>was in the room with her mother and little sister; I said, it was supposed that one of them had been delivered of a child, and asked where the child was; the mother said, it was no such thing, of something of that kind; upon which I asked her to let me examine her daughter, to convince the public whether it was so or not; her mother desired her to go up stairs with me, which she did, but resused to let me examine her; however, after some time, I did, and had every reason to think she had been delivered of a child, but as to saying to a day or so, it is out of my power, but that she had been recently delivered; I asked her where the child was; they made no answer, but the mother said, the prisoner had miscarried, about a week before, of a boy, but afterwards she said she did not know what it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The child found, was a female child? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively that the child you examined was born alive? - A. No, I do not, but to the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to be understood, that you have always said you believed the child was born alive? - A. Yes, I do, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so, clear as you are now? - A. I don't know any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not before the Magistrate entertain a doubt whether the child was born alive or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never entertained any doubt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is my duty to warn you a little of what you have said; you there said it was im-possible for you to say it was born alive? - A.I was asked whether, by opening the body, I could, or not, then say, it was born alive; I said, if it was opened, and I had the things of the child, and they floated; I said, that even from that, no gentleman of the faculty could swear it was born alive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to say now, po sitively, that you believe it was born alive? - A.I have every reason to believe it was; the question put to me before the Magistrate was, whether I could not swear positively; I said, no, it was out of the power of any gentleman to swear it; a child coming into the would may fetch a gasp that will expand the lungs equally the same as though it lived twelve hours, with regard to the apprearance of the child, it appeared not to have been born above ten or twelve hours.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the woman, are you enabled to form any opinion whether the had been delivered more than that time, or about that time? - A. No; I can form no opinion of that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I want to know what it is you do mean; when I read your deposition before the Alderman, I was led to suppose that it amounted to your idea, and to the best of your opinion; I understand you will not now swear it as a positive fact? - A. I cannot swear it as a positive fact, though I believe it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Where do you live? - A. In Nightingale-lane, Limehouse, and am one of the bearers of the parish: I picked up a female insant, vwhich I found in the River Thames after the tide had left it, and when I washed it, there appeared to be a blow on the right side of its head.</p>
               <p>JANE STEVENSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are a widow, I believe? - A. Yes, and live at No. 16, John-court, Limehouse, next door to the prisoner; between the houses there is only a lath and plaster partition, so that I can hear every word that passes: On the Saturday morning before the child was found, I went into the prisoner's to light my candle, and saw her in the apparent agony of labour, and very sick; I was sure she was pregnant, and expected it every day, and so did all the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. In the morning, in very strong labour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her next? - A. Not till she got better, on the Monday morning; she was sitting at the door with her brother's child in her arms; she sat all of a heap, so that I could well observe whether she was delivered, but I thought she had been; before I saw the child's body, I asked her to go with me, and see it; she said she would; I asked her again soon after, then she said her shoes were gone to be mended, and she could not go; I asked her mother to go, and she said she could not bear to see it.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are quite sure the was in the pains of labour on the a Saturday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her on Monday, she had been in labour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have no doubt but she was delivered on Saturday? - A. None at all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Where do you live? - A. I keep the house next door to the prisoner: On the Saturday night before the Tuesday on which the child was found, I went to-bed, and about half past four, I was awaked by a noise, which I thought was the noise of a young child; it was noon over, and presently I thought I heard something like a cackling, I thought it was the pigs, and went to sleep again; I did not see the prisoner till the Tuesday, when she seemed very low, and was washing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This noise, which you first thought was a child, was on Saturday night? - A. Yes; but I don't know when the was brought to-bed.</p>
               <p>- DALTON sworn. - I am a constable, and took the prisoner into custody; I asked her if she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180072"></xptr>had been guilty of it, she told me, when her mother came forward, she would tell the whole truth; I went back for her mother, but she had absconded; I told the prisoner, and she said, if I would hear her, she would confess; she said; she had a child that she was brought to bed with as she stood by the bed-side, on Saturday before the Tuesday when the child was found; that she put the child on one side, and after that she went and put it in the ditch at high water, where the tide flows in, but if her mother was found, she could tell better about it; I searched for her, and at last I found her locked up in a room in Catharine-wheel-alley, Whitechapel; the prisoner afterwards said that she threw it over the furthest bridge from her house, and that her mother had nothing to do with it; I asked her whether the child was alive or not; she said she could not tell, for she had a dimness come over her eyes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did she not say it was a male child? - A. She said it was, in the first instance, but afterwards she said she could not tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing respecting this matter? - A. I heard her tell Mr. Dalton she had been brought to-bed between six and seven o'clock on Saturday night; she did not say whether the child was alive or dead, or male or female.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you not hear her say whether the child was alive or dead? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is extraordinary you should hear her say first, that she was delivered of a dead-born child, for you have sworn that once before the Alderman? - A. I did not hear her say so, for I am rather deaf.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said taken down in writing? - A. I don't know; I was not there when it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not read over to you? - A. I did not hear any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not sign it? - A. I put a cross to something.</p>
               <p>Q. You there said you heard her declare she had been delivered by the bed-side of a dead-born child? - A. No; I did not say any thing about it; I never heard her say any thing about dead-born, or live-born.</p>

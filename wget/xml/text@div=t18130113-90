On the 17th of December, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked me if I wanted to buy any wood. I told him, I did not. He asked me then if I had got any such halfpence as he had in his hand. He told me if I had, he would give me a penny for it. I told him I did not want a penny for it, if I had any he should have it. I opened the till, and showed him one that was not thin enough. I shewed him the second and the third, they would not do. He reached his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130054"></xptr>over the counter, pretending to point to some halfpence that would do, and with that he put his hand in the drawer and clasped as many halfpence as he could, and put them in his pocket. I said, he had robbed me before my face. He said, he had not robbed me. He said he had twenty-two halfpence about him. He pulled the money out of his pocket, and shewed it me. I told him, I was sure he had robbed me, and asked him if he would let me look in his pockets. He would not. I tried to reach over the counter to feel his pockets; he dodged back, he would not let me. I went round the counter. He went to the door, and went out. He crossed the way, and run. I went to my neighbour, and told him of it. I shewed him the prisoner; he was running; and my neighbour pursued him. I am sure the prisoner is the boy that took the halfpence.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutrix, No. 1, Leader-street, I am a grocer. On the 7th of December, Mary Shearman came to my shop door, and informed me that she had been robbed. She pointed to the lad, and said, there he runs. The prisoner was then about sixty yards from my door. I pursued him. He turned the corner, and then I saw two. The other lad had on a blue coat. The prisoner a white one. The prisoner ran into a brick field. I got pretty near to him. I saw some people before; I called out, stop thief. He ran round by the heap of earth in the brick field; he made a bit of a stoop. I could only see his head as the earth was between him and me. I then ran round the contrary way, and caught him, and took him to

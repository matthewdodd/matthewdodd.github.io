               <p>Q. When did you lose these handkerchiefs. - A. On the 6th of October. I heard an outcry of Stop thief, I ran across the field that adjoins the garden; as soon as I got over the hedge I saw him in a garden adjoining my garden; I got up to him and collared him, I brought him back; he dropped the property before I got up to him, finding he was so closely pursued; I did not see him drop them, he dropped them before he got over the hedge. These are the handkerchiefs (producing them), two silk handkerchiefs and six cotton ones; they were not quite dry, they were hanging in the garden to dry. He said he was very sorry, he knew he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. He told you he had done wrong - so he had, he had no right to walk across this garden. - A. No, he wished to make it up with me, but the constable would not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a blacksmith. - A. Yes, I work adjoining this garden.</p>
               <p>Q. This property is not yours. - A. It is under my care, I am answerable for the property.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw it in his possession. - A. No, he dropt it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say that he dropt it, you never saw him drop it. - A. No, I never saw him drop it.</p>

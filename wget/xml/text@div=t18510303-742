                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Frederick Bennet. The prisoner was our apprentice—on 21st Feb. I gave him leave to go out—it was the anniversary dinner of the London Orphan Asylum, where he had been educated—I saw two parties waiting for him outside—he went to dress—I went to his room, and saw a parcel lying on his box, and said, "Whose parcel is this?"—he said, "It is mine"—I asked what it was—he said it was books—I said, "We will open it, and see what it is"—as I was going to open it, he said, "Oh, Sir, they are grocery," and I found this grocery (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is 1 1/2 lb. of currants, 2lbs. of sugar, 1 1/2 lb. of cocoa, 3/4 lb. of citron, 1 1/2 lb. of muscatels, 1/2 lb. of almonds, 5oz. of Spanish juice, and 5oz. of sugar-candy—I said, "This is a strange game you are carrying on"—he said he meant to pay for them—I said, "How could you pay for them when they are odd quantities?"—he made no answer—I gave him into custody—they are odd weights.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Trendall's service. On the evening of 21st Feb., while the prisoner was dressing, I went to call him, because I wanted to make the beds, and saw a brown-paper parcel on his box—two or three Sundays before that I saw him in the shop, with the scales in his hand—I said, "George, what are you about?"—he said, "He knows what I have got; I am going to take it to a friend's house"—he said Mr. Trendall knew it—I did not see what he had.</p>

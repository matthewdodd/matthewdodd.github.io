I asked him who they were for, and he said Sewell and Cross - I and William Jacombs let him have four pieces of ribbon, in half pieces; I made out the invoice in Sewell and Cross's name, and William Jacombs delivered him the goods which he took away with him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JACOMBS. I am a relation of Messrs. Jacombs. I was at their warehouse on the 29th of September. The prisoner came and asked to look at some pad ribbon - he selected one piece, and asked to look at some lustring ribbons, which I shewed him - he then asked the price of shaded pads, I told him, and he selected one piece; I asked who they were for - he said Sewell and Cross - he went away - the last witness was not there that day.</p>

            . On the 29th of September, I and Mr. Cross were both in town; but I gave the prisoner no orders to go to Messrs. Jacombs; he had lived with us ten or twelve months, and I had an excellent character with him - while he was with me he had been in the habit of going to Messrs. Jacombs with orders. Mr. Cross is not here.</p>

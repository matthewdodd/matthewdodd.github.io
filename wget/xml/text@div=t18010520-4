               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise or threat before he said that? - A. No; he said he had taken it to get his clothes out of pawn at different times; it was in his left-hand breeches pocket, part loose, and part in paper; I cannot swear to the gold, but from general appearance it is worth about 5l.</p>

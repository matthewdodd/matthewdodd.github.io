Gawler was in liquor at that time, and both were pretty much irritated, and by this, time were got into a violent passion; upon this last fall in that manner, Gawler rolled himself up, drew up his legs and groaned very much; I told the prisoner he had ruined him, and after looking at him I said I believe you have killed him; Wise and I then took him up and helped him out into the street; we carried him by putting our arms under his for fifty yards. At last we could not carry him, as he could not assist himself; he fell down; he said he was a dead man; we called a coach and took him home to his wife, Gawler did put himself in a posture of fighting when the coachman first spoke to him, but I did not see him strike the prisoner; indeed I saw no blows struck on either side.</p>

I am a collar-maker in Oxford-market; I was in company at the Blue Boar with the deceased and Travis; we parted near twelve o'clock; I said it was high time to go home, and went out; I paid for one of the two pots of beer we had between us three; Gawler the deceased went up, and asked what was to pay besides; the landlord said one pot; then said he, that is no more than three halfpence a piece; just at that instant, the prisoner and his company were coming out of the back room; they bid the deceased to stand out of the way, and said something about a three halfpenny reckoning, and treated them with contempt; Gawler then asked him what he had to do with their reckoning; the prisoner then asked if he resented it; Gawler said he did, and immediately they fell together by the ears, and they both rolled together; all this happened in the compass of half a minute; they both rose and both fell a second time; the coachman was the strongest, and so had Gawler undermost; they were going to get up; my Lord's porter interfered, and would not let Travis and I part them or take them up; the coachman was getting up; when he was halfway from him he drop'd down as if on purpose, and fell with his knees upon Gawler; upon which I told him that he used the deceased very ill; Gawler, immediately upon receiving this blow upon the bottom of his belly, drew himself up, and said he was a dead man; he lay for two minutes upon the tap room boards; he could not bear to be lifted up; I imagined he was shamming, or that he was not so bad as he pretended to be; in truth he could not bear to be lifted up; they got him and set him up; he could not fit upright; when they had got him up, and kept him up for ten minutes in the room, Travis and I led him out under the arms for about thirty or forty yards; he was not able to go any further; he lay down at a gentleman's steps and vomited; then we called a coach that was going by, and put him into the bottom of the coach; the door was not shut; his feet hung out; in that manner we conveyed him to his own house; the next day he was very bad.</p>

            . I am porter to my Lord Chancellor; I was at the Blue Boar with the prisoner; we were coming out of the Tap Room together; there was a dispute with the deceased, Wise, and Travis about the reckoning; the coachman was in liquor, and said why do you quarrel about the reckoning? the deceased answered, what business have you to interfere, and then asked the coachman if he had any notion of himself; the coachman said he had.</p>
               <p>Q. What was meant by that?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I understood it as a kind of a challenge; upon this the deceased put himself in a fighting posture, and gave the prisoner a blow upon the breast; the coachman at that time had not touched him; the prisoner returned the blow and then they closed; they got up and put themselves in a fighting posture the second time; and then the deceased came with his hands across and struck the coachman the first blow, which he returned, and they closed again; and then the coachman proved the strongest, and threw the deceased on the floor; perhaps he might go against the side of a table which is there, and that might hurt him. I am not certain whether he did or not; there was a table there; when the deceased lay down in this manner, he pulled the coachman down upon him; the landlord took him off; the deceased lay upon the floor moaning; the landlord shook him and desired him to get up; as there was no answer made, at last we all contributed to help him up; he stood there about two minutes, then he walked off in company with the other two men; I did not see the second rising, and the spring that the other said they saw him make upon the deceased.</p>

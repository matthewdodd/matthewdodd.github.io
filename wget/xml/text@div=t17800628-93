On the 6th of June, at about seven o'clock at night we saw a vast concourse of people coming down to Newgate; they halloo'd Newgate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280220"></xptr> a-hoy. The prisoner and some others came up to the great gate, down the Old Bailey; he swore a desperate oath that he would have the gates down; he either d - d his eyes, or d - d his blood he would have the gates down. Then they began at the gates, some with sledge hammers, and others with pick-axes; the prisoner had a large stick. I called to him because I had known him for some years; I said, Very well,

             the tripe man, I shall mark you in particular. I had known him six or seven years. Then he went towards Mr. Akerman's house.</p>
               <p>Was any mischief done to the gate or the hatch? - When they found they could not break the gate, they piled Mr. Akerman's goods up against it, and set them on fire.</p>
               <p>Was any thing done at the hatch before you went away? - Some of the stones, part of the side of the hatch, were broken away.</p>
               <p>You do not know then what was done to Mr. Akerman's house? - I saw the feathers fly; they had got some of Mr. Akerman's goods out, and they continued throwing them out; then they set them against the gate and set them on fire, and they would have burnt those gates down, but we kept throwing water against them to cool them, to keep the lead from melting, and letting the hinges out. Then Mr. Akerman's house was set on fire, that burnt into our fore lodge and into the chapel, and set the different wards on fire.</p>
               <p>Are you or not sure that the prisoner is the person of whom you have been speaking? - I am positive he is the person; I know him as well as I know my own brother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the favour of your lordship to ask the witness the questions I have here upon a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the paper be handed up to me and I will put the questions.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - About seven years.</p>

               <p>Had not you been in company with him some little time before the fire happened, in the Strand, and treated him with some punch? - I treated him with some milk punch, that was some months before; it was not in the Strand, it was in one of the bye-streets, near Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Would you have thought him from his former behaviour a likely man to be concerned in mobs of this kind? - I have known him some time; he has always been forward in any quarrels in the streets or mobs.</p>
               <p>At what hour were the keys of Newgate given up? - We never gave them up.</p>
               <p>When were they demanded? - About seven o'clock they demanded them.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there at the time when the keys were demanded? - He was one of the first who came up to the gate to demand their being opened.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the key? - I gave no key.</p>
               <p>You knew where the prisoner lived and might be found? - I did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Did not you know where he carried on his business and might be found? - I knew he lived in Westminster. I met him one morning accidentally as I was going towards Clare-market.</p>
               <p>How long after the 6th of June was it when you took him up? - I believe a week after.</p>
               <p>Was it not nine days after? - I think it was the 15th of June when I took him up.</p>
               <p>How came it to be so long before you apprehended him? - We were so busy that I had no time to look after him, I did not care to make any enquiry after him left he should get off. I knew we should find him.</p>
               <p>Were you looking for him when you met him in the Strand, or was it by accident? - I was going up into St. James's-market and met him by accident.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Westminster, or any of your friends and prevent any persons from offering bail for him? - Never.</p>
               <p>Or say a thousand pounds would not bail him? - No, he served me with notice of bail. I showed it my master, Mr. Akerman.</p>
               <p>When you took him up did not you know there was a reward offered? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you know of the king's proclamation? - I did not take him for the reward.</p>
               <p>Did not you know there was a reward promised? - I did not know that there was for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280221"></xptr>Did not you know there was a reward? - I had heard of it.</p>
               <p>Do you claim the reward? - No; I would not have any reward.</p>
               <p>Do you disclaim any reward? - I do; I do not want any reward.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you mention this man as one concerned in the riot? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You say you have known him five or six years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. It has already been proved that Mr. Akerman's house was demolished that night, I suppose I need not call the witnesses to prove that.</p>
               <p>Jury. No, there is no occasion.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>It is very unlikely that I should ask such a question of him when I knew no-body else but him in the jail. There are two other persons who remember my calling out to him though they did not know him.</p>

We stood together facing Mr. Akerman's house for, I believe, five minutes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280222"></xptr> then I missed him, but I met him again in about ten minutes after at the end of Fleet-market; I went away about a quarter after seven; I do not think I staid above a quarter of an hour in all.</p>

               <p>Had they begun to demolish Newgate when you came there? - They were thumping against the gate with a handspike; I came from Newgate-street, went down the Old Bailey, all along by Newgate, and met him again in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>What character has the prisoner borne since you knew him? - He lived servant with Mr. Smith, the tripe-man, in St. James's market; I know nothing bad of him, he is but a flight acquaintance of mine.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner very well; he lodges in the house of Mrs. Howell, where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Where is Mrs. Howell to-day? - She is now very ill in bed at home, and is not able to come here; she has attended this week, and last week too.</p>
               <p>Were you at home on the evening that Newgate was burnt? - I was.</p>
               <p>What time? - At eight in the evening, I came from work; the prisoner came home about a quarter after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect the time particularly? - Sometimes I work till eight, sometimes till half after eight; we have a clock upon the stairs, it was then a quarter after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner afterwards? - I did not see him, he went to his apartment; his room is on the same floor with mine.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether he came down again? - No, I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>How do you recollect that it was that particular night? - It was on the 6th of June. I am sure it was the night that Newgate was on fire, because I heard the people talk of it.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing particular that passed that evening after the prisoner came home? - I believe there might be a few words between him and his wife, as most people who are married often have, I know that case too much myself.</p>
               <p>Was it above or below? - I cannot say whether it was above or below; I know they had words that evening, about his wife being out at work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, of 38, King David Street—on 3rd February, about 7 p.m., the prisoners came to my shop—Brown said, "We have come from the Surrey Docks"—Watkins said that he belonged to the ship <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi>, which came from the Mediterranean with oil cake, and was lying in the Surrey Docks, and he had been four months on board as able seaman, that he had had one month's advance and three months' pay to take—he asked me to pay Brown and Much 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would pay me back on Thursday, when he was paid off—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was for bringing their clothes, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for expenses coming across the water—both the other prisoners said that they came from the Surrey Docks—I paid them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and Mrs. Mills paid them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after that Watkins said that he wanted some clothes, and asked me to let him have some—I gave him a guernsey, a pair of boots, and other things, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would pay me on Thursday when he was paid off—he went out and said he would come in half an hour—I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the two men upon the statement that he would pay me back when he was paid off; and I also parted with the clothes on the faith of that statement—he went out, leaving a bag of what one of them said were clothes—when they had gone I found it contained all kinds of rubbish, stones and rags—I afterwards gave Watkins in charge on Wednesday, the 5th—he said he did not know me, and that I had made a mistake in the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you take in lodgers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I am in the habit of giving persons commissions for bringing lodgers to my house—I only pay them with the consent of the sailors—I am near the docks, and men come from the ships to my house—there are men hanging about the docks who get persons to lodge in the houses—where they lodge they buy clothes—I give them board and lodging and clothing on credit till they get their wages—I always get paid for what they have—I was examined before the Magistrate—it is correct that Watkins and two other men came to my shop, and Watkins represented himself as a sailor from the ship <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi>—they all three came to the house—Much was carrying the bag—it was an ordinary sailor's bag—Watkins suggested that I should pay the men 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—that was not for commission, but for the porterage and expenses of coming across the water, on Watkins' statement that they had carried the bag to my house—I told them to call again for the other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Much and Brown came back for it in about an hour—Mrs. Mills paid them the money then—I know it was paid—it did not occur to me to look in the bag then—I give men whatever they ask—the sailors are responsible to me for the money.</p>

               <p>I live at the next door; I heard a noise; I went to the door, Mrs. Sheldon said this woman has robbed me; and I lifted up her cloak, and there was a hat and cloak under it, the prisoner was coming out of the house; I would not let her go, and she struck me several times; there she is. There was a linen gown and a marcella petticoat I saw in the prisoner's custody in her apron; and when she beat me, I took and I doubled her hands in her cloak, and I gave her a push, and made her drop the things; she said they were her own. The goods deposed to by the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Were they washed then? - No, my Lord, they have been washed since.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutrix. Did you see the things taken from her? - I saw the prisoner on the stairs, I asked her who she wanted, she said one Mrs. Wilson; I had a difficulty to pass her with the bundle, and being with child as she is, I spoke to her out of a civility, and said I hope you are not come to rob people? she said what she had was her own. And I saw a gown under her cloak.</p>

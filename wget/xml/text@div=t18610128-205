               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marney</hi>. When you came up to me, I asked you whether you had lost your coat, and you said "Yes," and that I had got it about me, and I offered for you to search me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I did not say you had it about you.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, High-street, Deptford, and am a boot and shoe maker—on the 9th, I was passing along High-street and saw a chaise standing at Mr. Mills' door, and Marney peeping through the window and watching the chaise narrowly, which induced me to watch him—he remained like that for two or three minutes, and then waved his hand across the road to Fuller—I saw Fuller go across and deliberately take something out of the chaise—I did not know what it was—I went into Mr. Mills', and spoke to the gentleman whom I saw standing there—I brought him to the chaise—I knew Marney in particular before—it is impossible for there to be any mistake with regard to Marney being one that I saw on that occasion—it was in the evening, between 7 and 8 o'clock—the High-street is lighted tolerably well there—I saw which way Marney went, and took the prosecutor down there—Marney was standing among a crowd of lads, and I picked him out—I said, "This is the man that knows something of your coat."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marney</hi>. When they came up, the man charged another boy with having taken the coat. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No—the boy did not cry at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>.<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything about your charging any other boy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw a small boy standing very close to Marney, very thickly dressed—I thought it was possible for Marney to have passed the coat, and I merely turned the lad round to see if the coat was there—I did not charge him as being concerned—I did not know Fuller by sight at all before; I have seen him in Deptford before—I did not know him by sight as well as Marney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fuller</hi>. When the constable took me into your shop, he asked you whether I was the other one with Marney? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes—I said, "I think he is"—when I was brought up before the Magistrate, I said I had a doubt on my mind; I said my first impression was, that you were rather taller than the other, and I wished to be positive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you feel more positive now than then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the fact of considering the thing over, makes me so; but I do not feel so satisfied as I do with regard to Marney.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fuller. Q.</hi> Where were you standing when I took the coat, as you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly opposite Mr. Mills'—I dare say it is seven or eight yard across the road—I saw your side face—I have seen you several times, selling things in Deptford.</p>

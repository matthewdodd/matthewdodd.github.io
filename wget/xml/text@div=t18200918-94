I had one hand on a cabbage to prevent it falling, and as I came against a stand the prisoner, Jacobs, rushed against me, pushed me against some baskets, and then put his arms round my body. As soon as I recovered myself a little I felt my watch go from my fob. Hemmings drove against me also with violence, as if he was in liquor. I felt my watch go, and saw it passed to Hemmings - I saw Jacobs hand it over to Hemmings; I immediately charged Hemmings with robbing me of my watch, as I saw it last in his possession, he said he had not got it - we secured them. I thought Connelly was one of the party, as he said he was an officer, and wanted to take one of them from me; he did not touch me or receive the watch.

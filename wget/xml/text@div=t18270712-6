On the 3d of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my lodgings, about a job which I wanted him to do, but he asked more than I could give him. I offered him something to drink; he took nothing, but went away - the instant he was gone I missed my watch, which I can swear was in the room when he came in, for I had just wound it up - he was not there above ten minutes; he lived a few doors off. I went to his house - I found him in bed, and told him I had lost my watch; he denied it, and said"Who was that man that stood behind me in the room?" there had been nobody there but him or I should have seen them - I left him, and went to Bow-street. I have not found the watch - it hung over my bedstead; he kept close to the bedstead all the time. I went to the cupboard to get him something to drink, my head was then turned away - I did not search his room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. J. ALLEY. Q. You had a job for him? A. Yes; some drawer handles to lacker - my room is on the first floor; it is not very small - there are other lodgers. I never said the watch was either on the bedstead or mantel-piece; I do not know

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of June; I had been looking for him before, but he was gone to a job in the country - he said he had come home on purpose to have this business settled, that he was uneasy about it, and had come to have himself righted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had no difficulty in finding him? A. No; his street-door was open; he had only been home half an hour. I have known him five or six years; he was a pretty fair character.</p>

            . I went with Bailey and found the prisoner up in a lodger's room, at dinner; he said "I know your business, I have come up to have myself righted, as it is preying on my mind."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I came down stairs I met a Life Guardsman, and stood aside to let him pass. I never said there was a man behind the door in the room - I had a job in the country, and went to it.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE YOUNG. I lodge at the prisoner's house, and remember the prosecutor coming there one night, between eight and nine o'clock. I was in the room - he charged the prisoner with stealing his watch; he at first said that it was on the bed, and then he was not sure whether it was on the bed or the mantel-piece - the prisoner's bed and both his rooms were searched; the prisoner afterwards went to the prosecutor's house, and when he came back he said he had been to know if they had found the watch; he remained at home till the Monday, and then went into the country.</p>

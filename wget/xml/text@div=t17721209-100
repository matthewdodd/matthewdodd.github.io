               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fox. Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who committed this robbery?</p>
               <p>Fox. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Alone?</p>
               <p>Fox. Curd was within a hundred yards of me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far within it?</p>
               <p>Fox. About that way?</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he concerned in it?</p>
               <p>Fox. No, I stopt that man in some fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day it was?</p>
               <p>Fox. No, not rightly?</p>
               <p>Q. You was along with Curd?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes; just before and just after, that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet that day?</p>
               <p>Fox. At the Three Jolly Butchers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body besides he and you?</p>
               <p>Fox. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go?</p>
               <p>Fox. We were together almost all day?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where towards Hackney?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes; we were going that way and I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Fox. At the end of a field I cannot say rightly; I was never that way before in my life. About ten minutes after I robbed the man, I met him again.</p>
               <p>Q. You went forward did you?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About a hundred yards you say?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you meet when you went forwards?</p>
               <p>Fox. The butcher; I clapped two pistols to his breast and demanded his money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take from him?</p>
               <p>Fox. I took four shillings and a bad sixpence; then I pulled the basket down from his head, and asked whether there was any money in it; he said no; I took a quarter of lamb out; I went about five or six yards, then I came back and took another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Fox. I went away; I met with Curd a little after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with him in the same place you left him?</p>
               <p>Fox. A little forwarder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he nearer to the man you robbed or farther?</p>

               <p>Fox. Farther.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant from the place where you robbed the man?</p>
               <p>Fox. About fifty or sixty yards, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him what you got?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you then?</p>
               <p>Fox. We both went together to the Three Jolly Butchers; then we went down to Curd's brother's at the Ferry, and had one quarter of lamb dressed for our suppers.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the money?</p>
               <p>Fox. I had it all; but I lent Curd a shilling: I lent it him.</p>
               <p>Q. So he had no share of the money?</p>
               <p>Fox. Yes he had part of it, that that I lent him.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you lend him?</p>
               <p>Fox. I lent him one shilling and a bad six-pence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You took four shillings and a bad six-pence, that was not quite a fair proportion; did you lend him no more, nor give him more?</p>
               <p>Fox. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You sunk part of it upon him then; did you tell him you had taken but three shillings from the man?</p>
               <p>Fox. I told him I had robbed a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how much you had taken?</p>
               <p>Fox. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had nothing at all do with it then?</p>
               <p>Fox. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you made a great mistake I see in your information, for there you charged this poor man with being concerned in all these robberies; that was quite a mistake was it not?</p>

               <p>Fox. Yes.</p>

               <p>Fox. I used to lend him one.</p>

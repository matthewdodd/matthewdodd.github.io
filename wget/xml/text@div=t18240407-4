On the 27th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, (which is part of the dwelling-house,) between the outer door, and the glass door, and remove a piece of green baize, which was put before a broken square of glass, he then put his hand into the window, and I saw him take hold of this piece of silk; he only got part of it out of the window, but moved it quite from the place where it had laid - he had not moved it more than a foot, but had entirely removed it. I went round by the side door, and on getting near him, I disturbed him - he ran away, and I after him, crying Stop thief! he was stopped without getting out of my sight. The silk is my masters', and the lowest value is 12 l. or 14 l. I can swear that it is worth 10 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW.

            How was it moved - A. It was pulled straight towards him. I am certain he quite moved the whole of it; whether it was all lifted up I cannot say, but he quite moved the whole of it from where it lay; it was above a yard from the window - his arm was half way within the window. I swear that no part of the silk remained on the spot it previously did - the highest end of it was out of the window. The partners reside in the house alternately, a fortnight each.</p>

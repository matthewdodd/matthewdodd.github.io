                  </hi>. I live in Lisson-grove, and am brother to George Streeter, a linen-draper. On Monday evening, the 29th of October, I missed a cloak from inside the shop—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is a cloak of ours, but whether it has been sold I cannot say—we missed one of this description, and answering the pattern—I had seen it safe in the morning.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody on Tuesday the 30th of October—I found the cloak on her, after I got to the station-house I asked where she got it—she said, "I bought the ticket of it of a girl," but she could not tell who she was, and said she</p>

The cloak was ray own—I bought the duplicate of it, and had only just got it out of pledge—I went into the house and left the cape, and when the people heard that the officer was coming to search, they went on hide it—I can bring a witness that, on Monday evening, I was in a female's company, and never left it—I told him I got it out of pawn, at Trail's, in Chapel-street—the policeman told the Magistrate that I had denied my name—I was in liquor. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

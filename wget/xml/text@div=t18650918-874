I am the prisoner's wife, and lived at No. 24, Baldwin-street, City-road—on Wednesday evening, between 10 and 11, I went home with him—he asked me if I would go to Queensland with him—I said if he had been a kind and affectionate husband, I might have gone—when we got home I was about to light a candle, and he came behind me—I thought he was going to kiss me—he threw me on the floor, and a struggle followed—I felt something like a knife about my throat—I screamed and ran down stairs—my landlady caught me in her arms in the passage—I have been married to the prisoner four years and seven months—two nights before this he said he should like to cut my throat, and his own after—on the night this happened I had been to my sister's house, and the prisoner called for me—he had been drinking, I believe—there was a young man Darned Barnett there—the prisoner had not said anything to me about him before—the prisoner had frequently ill-used me—on the Friday before, he punched me in the mouth, because I went home rather late.</p>

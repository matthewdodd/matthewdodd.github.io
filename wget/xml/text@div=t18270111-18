            . I am an officer. I took charge of Lord Dufferin's house by desire, and while there the male prisoner came; I asked who he was - he said he was brother of 
               <persName id="t18270111-18-person253">

            , and asked what was the matter; the female prisoner was at that time in custody - I told him Ann was in custody for robbing the house of some books; he was much alarmed, and went away. After that I went to his house, No. 72, Castle-street, Oxford-market - I said, "I understand you have got some property belonging to Lord Dufferin;" he said he had, and pointed to a bed, which was turned up, four chairs, and a round table - he said, "That is all I have got - I meant to have sent them home this morning, and have sent for a truck for that purpose;" I asked whose the carpet was which laid on the floor; he said that was Lord Dufferin's, but he had nothing else; I asked whose the curtains were which hung at the windows - he said they were Lord Dufferin's, and four looking-glasses, which were in the room, and the fire-irons and the fender; I sent for a truck, and took the things away - I left him there, but the Magistrate told me to apprehend him, and I went next morning to him, and said, "Mr. Lutman, I understand you are the husband of Ann;" he said he was, that they had been married four or five years, but she wished to keep it a secret.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. When did he come to the house? A. On Wednesday night, about ten o'clock; the woman had been three or four hours in custody. When I went to his house next morning I hired the truck which he had sent for before; he never absconded; he said Ann had ruined him, that she had brought the things there for his use, not that it was against his will; I know that they are man and wife now. When I went to his house on Friday a man named Dennis was present, who was afterwards discharged. I believe, as we were going away, a woman put her head into the parlour door, and spoke to him - Dennis was taken because he had been found in his lordship's house the night before the woman was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Phillips, of No. 1, John<lb></lb>son-street, Shadwell The prisoners lived with us about two months, and left without notice—on Saturday, 24th May, about 4 o'clock, I went out and fastened all the doors and windows, and put the key of the outer door into my pocket, leaving no one in the house—I returned at 12 o'clock the same night, and missed some blankets, and other articles, which I had left safe—I found the beading of the window in the middle of the room, any person could then get in, as the fastening caught in the beading—it was not a sash window—the door was open—this pair of blankets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—there is no mark on them, but they are in one; they have not been cut—here are some others, I know them also, and there was a sheet, but nothing has been found but the blankets.</p>

On this Saturday night, about 10 o'clock, he brought me two blankets, wrapped up in a coloured apron—I did not open them—he asked me if I would pledge them for him—I said, "No," and he went away, leaving them with me, and I gave them to the policeman on Monday.</p>

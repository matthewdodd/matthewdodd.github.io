                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Ruislip, in Middlesex. The prisoner lives next door to me, the houses do not adjoin—my orchard is between them—I had a hayfork; I saw it last on 3rd July, between 7 and 8 o'clock at night, when I left work—I left it in the orchard; I laid it down among other stuff—I went into my orchard about 7 or 8 o'clock next morn<lb></lb>ing and missed the fork—I wanted to use it, I had used it the evening before for hay making in the orchard—I had seen the prisoner on 3rd July—he came to my gate and asked me for a job of work; I did not give it to him—on the 13th the constable showed me the prongs of a fork which he had found.</p>

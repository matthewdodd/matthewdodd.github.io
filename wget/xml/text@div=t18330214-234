I know a man who went by the name of Shelly, he brought me these clothes, and I bought them for 2s.; the prisoner came in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and asked if a man had sold some clothes there - I said Yes, for 2s.; she said, I want them back, "and she threw down 2s.;" but I would not let her have them, as I thought the man had sold them to pay her the money.</p>

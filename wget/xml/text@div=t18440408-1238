                  </hi>. I am store-clerk at Messrs. John Letton's, Elliott, and others' brewery, at Pimlico. and was so in Aug., 1642—our regular men have certain wages, and when they are absent we employ the extra men—an allowance of wages is paid to the extra men, and the rest goes as a gra<lb></lb>tuity to the invalid—the prisoner was an extra man—I had employed him about fifteen months—I prepared a puncheon of porter and three barrels of ale, to be sent to Mr. Gillingham, of Norwood—while I had employed the prisoner I had sent him with ale and porter to our customers, and he received the money, and accounted to me—I made out the invoice, and banded it to Major, our salesman—this is it, and this is the receipt I made out, as usual—this other paper is a return note, to be signed by the customer, that the goods have been received—the prisoner should account to me for the money, or, in my absence, to Major—on the 6th of August be did not account to me for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received from Mr. Gillingham—I did not see him any more; from that day, till I saw him in the London Docks, on the 15th of March this year—he has never accounted to me for this money.</p>

Elliott, is that so?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How was it?"—he said, "I got too much to drink, I lost the money, and was ashamed to return."</p>

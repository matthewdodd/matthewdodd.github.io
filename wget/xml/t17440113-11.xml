               <p>Q. How came you to take so little for them?</p>
               <p>Clay. Why, those that buy these things always buy good bargains - we divided the money between us in Mrs. Wilson's room, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Wilson ask you how you came by them, or any questions about them?</p>
               <p>Clay. She did not ask any questions, because she knew how we came by them - we told her we were going to get some more things; she said take the dark lanthorn, and see what you can find - she has often bought things of us.</p>

               <p>Pris. Bailey. Was I with you when this robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Clay. You went along with me, and was there all the time; we bought a half-penny-worth of small beer at the chandlers shop in the alley.</p>
               <p>Bailey. Can you bring any body to prove what you swear against me?</p>
               <p>Clay . How should I, there's nobody but Mrs. Wilson who bought the goods of us knows any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Meager. How came you to get knowledge of this Clay?</p>

               <p>I lost two live pigs, on the 9th of December; I went out about eight o'clock in the morning, they were at home then; my boy used to clean them out, and let them on the Green; I did not return till nine in the evening; they were then missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far does he live from you? - A. Not above half a mile: the next day I went to his house, about twelve o'clock; I knocked at the door; his wife came to the door.</p>
               <p>We must not hear what passed between you and his wife. - A. I got a search warrant, and went with Griffith and Webb, and saw the pig hanging up whole, only the head off; that was the sow pig, and a quarter of the other; the sow pig was hanging in the garden, the other in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to judge whether it was your pig or not? - A. I believe that to be my pig, from the mark I subscribed before I went, that was a black mark on the loin.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it scalded? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of mark was it? - A. A black spot; I cannot swear positively to it; I believe it to be my pig.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Law's pig? - A. No: On the 9th of December, from eleven to one o'clock, I saw the prisoner and his son drive home two pigs; one was a very fine pig, but he drove them so fast, I could not observe; but the last pig was a sow pig, all white, but a black mark on its back; he drove them to his own house, on the 10th of December; Mr. Laws came down, and asked, whether I had seen any pigs, and I told him what I had seen.</p>

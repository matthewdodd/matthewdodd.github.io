               <p>Q. Do you know of his losing a cloth coat? - Yes; I had the brushing of it in the area on the 3d of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a gate to the area? - Yes; It was at the front of the house, My master's bell rung, and while I was gone up to answer it, and when I came back, the coat was gone; it was in the morning, about nine o'clock; I heard an alarm; I went up to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What alarm? - A pulling of the bell; I went out, and saw the coat in the custody of Mr. Croker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else? - Yes, Mr. Abchurch; Mr. Croker had got Joseph George, and Mr. Abchurch had got Stephen Barnett.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. You had never seen Barnett before? - No.</p>
               <p>-CROKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Tottenham-court-road; I am a constable of St. Pancras; I was informed of three suspicious persons in the neighbourhood. I was called out of my bed about half past six. In consequence of that alarm, I got up immediately, and I followed them, and I see Mr. Abchurch, and I shewed him the three persons, and told him my suspicions were of the two prisoners at the bar, two of these persons I believe, because I lost sight of them. Some time after I pursued, and ordered Abchurch to go before. I see them return back, and I see they were viewing the different areas. I went into a public house, and was not there above a minute before I heard that one had got into an area. I went out, and I observed George get out of the area of Mr. Ahmuty, with a coat. He saw me, and he dropped the coat immediately on the steps, and I ran to seize him directly. I was in the middle of the street, and he saw me drawing my cutlass from under my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it drawn out of its scabbard? - It was; he got out of the area, and ran for about two or three yards, I had my cutlass drawn, and I seized him, and I ordered a person to take up that coat, and bring it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Barnett in company? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner George. This prisoner was not along aside of me, I never see him before till he was tied to me. I had been along with my sister; Mr. Croker came up to me, and says, that is right enough, seize him, Mr. Croker had the coat under his arm.</p>

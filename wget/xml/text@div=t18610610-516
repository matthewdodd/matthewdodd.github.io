I am the wife of William John Pool, of 12, Lower Fenton-street, shoemaker—the prisoner lives at 29, Duke-street, St. George's-in-the-East—that is some distance from my house—I have been acquainted with her for eighteen months, previously to the 22d May—we have quarrelled on more than one occasion—on 21st May we had a quarrel and fought, at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I did not see her again till the 22d—about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was passing along Duke-street, St. George's-in-the-East, with Jane Bouten, another young woman, and I felt a stab in my shoulder—I had not seen the prisoner before that—I did not say anything to her then—I never saw her—I did not know which way she could have come—after I felt the stab I remembered no more till I found myself in a doctor's shop in Charles-street, and then my wounds were partly dressed—I did see her before I was insensible—I cannot say whether she had anything in her hand or not—I found afterwards that I had received seven wounds—I was very weak from loss of Blood.</p>

               <p>and pushed me on one side, and I thought she was pushing Mrs. Pool, but instead of that she was stabbing her—I saw her give her two Blows with the knife—I saw the knife at the second Blow—the prisoner said, "You B—y whore, I have got you now," and then she stabbed her again—that was after she had struck her in the shoulder—she stabbed her five times, I think, after that—at the fourth stab I saw the blood come from the back of her head, and the back of her neck—I did not see the prosecutrix so anything—she Bent her head down and prevented the knife going in the front of her neck, and put her arm up, and that is how she received the stab in the shoulder—she also received a stab in her hand—she then fell on the ground—I saw a man come up and pull the prisoner's arm back—when the pro<lb></lb>secutrix fell on the ground the prisoner was stabbing her, as she fell; she kept on stabbing her—she stabbed her once after she fell down—a person named McKenzie then came up—the prisoner was secured and the knife taken away—nobody screamed out—there was nobody near—I was as frightened as Mrs. Pool—I did not catch hold of the prisoner, I was too frightened—I caught hold of Mrs. Pool to try to save her from falling—she was then taken to a chemist's shop down Charles-street—that is all I know of the matter—the prosecutrix had not said or done anything at all to the prisoner before I saw these stabs—I am quite sure of that.</p>

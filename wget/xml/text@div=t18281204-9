I apprehended the prisoner at Mrs. Ross' house, on the 17th of November; Mrs. Ross said, in her presence, that she had lost a number of things, and suspected her - I asked the prisoner for her keys; she gave them to me, and I found the duplicate for the lace and handkerchief in her box - she said they were her own, and that a great many of the things in her box had been put there by mistake.</p>

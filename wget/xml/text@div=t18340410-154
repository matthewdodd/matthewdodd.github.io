             (police-constable S 25). On the morning of the 9th of April, about ten minutes before six o'clock, I saw the prisoner rolling a cask in Frederick-street - I went to the prosecutor; he looked and missed the cask - I then ran after the prisoner, and found him in Norton-street - I asked him where he got it - he said, "Out of Henry-street," - I said, he must go and take it back - he said he would not, but I might - I rolled it back, and took him to the station-house - he there said that he did it through want.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Paddington - a man asked me if I wanted a job - I said, "Yes" - he said, "Assist me in rolling this cask, and meet me at the New Church" - when the policeman stopped me, he said, "Will you go back, and take this cask?" - I said, "No; but I will assist you in taking it back" - which I did.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARNETT. There was no one with him - he was rolling it himself very fast.</p>

                  </hi>. I pleaded guilty last week to this charge of burglary—I know Markham and Gill—on Sunday, 7th August, before this burglary took place, I met Markham, about 12 o'clock, in Eyre Street, Brick Lane—he went with me to my house, 30, Lisbon Street, Cambridge Heath Road, Mile End—I told him I had some work in hand; but I was standing still for want of a pound to get my diamond out of pawn (I am a fancy toy maker)—I asked him if he thought he could lend me one; he paid he would see if he could—at 1 o'clock we went out down to the beer-shop kept by a man named Gayton—he stopped there till 3 o'clock, when the house closed—he came down there again in the evening—he said he would see if he could lend me one on Monday; that was the next day—he came again to the beer-shop on Monday, Gill with him—we stopped there a good part of the day, Gill, Hambleton, Markham, and myself—we were at Gayton's on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday—I can't say what time he came on the Monday, I had been to the Arcade in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and when I came back he had been waiting all the morning—Markham said if I met him at 7.45, outside the Red Lion public-house, on Tuesday evening, facing the Britannia Theatre, in Hozton, he would lend me the pound—I met him there on the Tuesday evening; Hambleton was with me, and Gill was with Markham—he then made some excuse; he told me that if I met him at 3.45, at the same place, on Wednesday evening, he would let me have it—I was with him about a quarter of an hour on the Tuesday evening—I met Markham and Gill on the Wednesday evening—Hambleton was with me—we did not go in the Red Lion, we went into several others—he did not give me the money then—Markham and Gill went away to get a pattern of some silk, to show a lodger of his, he said—they were gone about an hour—they came back together—they called us out of the public-house, and we went to the prosecutor's house—as we went along Markham told me that he occupied the house and rented it, that he had two lodgers, one was a tailor and the other was a glove dyer—before that he asked Hambleton if he would carry a bag full of things from his house to his friend's house, and be offered him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his trouble, and Hambleton agreed to it—when we got to the prosecutor's house Markham told Hambleton that he did not want him to carry them then, as a lodger and her sister were in the front room; he said he did not want them to see the things come out in the bag—he told us to wait at the corner of the street, but not to go into the public-house opposite—we waited some time, and Markham and Gill came out for some beer—Markham had a jug in his hand—as they passed they told us to wait there a little time longer—they came shortly after, and asked us into the house—as they came along with the beer they said "Come on," and me and Markham, Gill and Hambleton went into the passage together—Markhara told Hambleton he would find the bag behind the door, and to take it—Markham then handed me a screw<lb></lb>driver and a chisel; he told me to open the third drawer of the chest, as he wanted to get a cash-box out—I was in the passage; the room-door was open, and the chest stood in front of it—I said "No, Markham, I did not come here for that purpose, I will have nothing at all to do with it"—he told me to put the screw<lb></lb>driver and chisel in my pocket, and he said "I will come up and do it myself, you have got no steel in you"—Gill came up stairs shortly after that, whistling</p>

               <p>a tune called "Cliquot"—he asked me if I bad done it; I said "No, and I don't intend to do it"—he then went into the room, came out again, and went down stairs—a short time after that the prosecutor came up—I was standing in the passage—he collared me, and we had a struggle—Markham opened the door, and pushed me and the prosecutor into the street, and we both fell—when we got up the prosecutor handed me over to Markham, and he said to me "Slip your ooat and run away," and I did run stray—my hat was left in the passage—I was brought back shortly after-wards, and Markham and Gill said I was not the man—my hat was there in the passage—someone said "There is his hat," and Markham owned it—I don't know exactly what he said, he picked it up, and said it was his—I was taken to the House of Detention—Gill came to see me while I was there—I asked him what he meant by getting me into this scrape—he said "Never mind, we will get you off, we will come and swear you were not the party; but you had better subpœna us up, as it will save all sus<lb></lb>picion"—he said he could keep me while I was in prison, and that I should have a good Counsellor, and he would pay for it.</p>

I was tried and acquitted the other day upon this charge, in the name of Hambleton—on Sunday, 7th August, I went into a public-house to have a pint of half-and-half, and saw Markham and Gill in company with Willis—Willis told Markham I was a friend of his—we stopped there sometimes, and met again on Monday at the same house—on Tuesday Willis asked me to accompany him to the Red Lion to meet Markham, who had promised to lend him a sovereign to get a diamond circle out of pawn—we went there about 7.45, and saw Markham and Gill—we had something to drink—Markham went away and returned—he said to Willis "I can't let you have it to-night, but if you will be down here to-morrow night I will be sure to let you have it"—we had four glasses of port wine, which Markham paid for, and a quartern of gin at another place—on Wednesday night I went with Willis to the Red Lion, about 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoners—Markham asked if I would carry some things for him from his house to Gill's, and he would give me a half-crown for my trouble—I said "Yes"—he took me and Willis round to the prosecutor's house, and told us to stand at the corner of the street; that a lodger of his had a sister in the front parlour, and he did not want them to see the things come out of the place—he told us to stop at the corner of the street, but on no con<lb></lb>sideration to go into the public-house—after some time he came and took us into the house, and told me there was a bag behind the door, with some things in it, and he handed Willis a chisel and screw-driver, and told him to open a drawer, and he would find a cash-box—Willis said "No, Mark<lb></lb>ham, I want none of this for me," and he handed them back to Markham—Markham told him to put them in his pocket, and he would come up and do it himself—shortly after Gill came up whistling "Cliquot"—he did not say anything—the prosecutor came up shortly afterwards, and had a tussle with Willis—I believe Markham opened the door—he told me to run out into the street, or else I should not have quitted the premises—he shoved me, Willis, and the prosecutor out into the street, and told me to run—I was stopped, and brought back again—Markham said I was not the man; it</p>

WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many times have you learnt your evidence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty perhaps—I had no idea I was going there for a felonious purpose—I did nothing, more did Willis while he was in my company—he pleaded guilty to being on the premises, I believe—we were charged with burglary—I never touched anything, nor did Willis, that I saw—he was in my company all the time—I have been three times convicted—the first time was for picking pockets—I was not innocent of that; I got twelve months; that was in 1864—the next time was in 1868, for picking pockets—I got two years—and the third time was three months—that was previous to the two years in November, 1867—that was for picking pockets—those are not the only times I was tried—I was sent to a reformatory school in 1861, I believe, because my friends were not able to keep me—I was thirteen years old then—I was charged with having a row, with a drunken woman who had a bottle of gin in her possession—I suppose they charged me with stealing the gin, but I did not have it—I suppose it was charged as highway robbery—I was innocent—I was three years at a reformatory—when I came out I went to work, when I could get it—I came out in 1864, and it was in 1864 that I had the twelve months—I also had a month somewhere about 1867—that was for a row; an assault, you may call it—I mean to say I was perfectly innocent on this occasion, I did not intend to do anything wrong—I first became acquainted with Willis at the Militia barracks—I belong to the Second Tower Hamlets Militia—I believe I was in prison at the same time with him—the first time I met Markham was at the public-house, when Willis introduced me as a friend of his—I did not see anything of Gill before the Monday.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George, Hanover-square. I was at Park-street Chapel; the prosecutor's wife came, and said she wanted me to take a thief - I went with her up Oxford-street - she said she did not know the person, but she knew the coat; I told her to give me a signal, which she did, and I took the prisoner; I was immediately surrounded by a number of persons who sell Sunday newspapers, who insisted that I should let him go. I had not then made any charge against him, but I said, "If you resist my taking him, I will take you;" they then dispersed - I then asked the prisoner whose coat it was - he said, "Never you mind, it is mine." I said,"Have you taken it by mistake;" he said, "Never you mind;" but when we got to the watch-house he acknowledged it was not his - he was a little in liquor.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Q. Had she made any application to you prior to this A. No further than drinking tea with me and inviting me to renew the intercourse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Young by when any thing of this passed - A. No. She would not go out at this time, and I was obliged to go out and leave her in one of my rooms, and I locked up the warehouse, and went out; she would not come out; I staid out till eleven o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he not, again and again, spoke to you upon the subject of this marriage, and asked whether you could or could not recollect whether he was the person that was married at your church with this woman - A. He did ask me once, and but once, and I told him directly: I know you very well, but I do not know whether it was here, or it might be in Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. How often can you recollect that he has been at your parish vestry-room - A. Very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow it, or is it the custom for persons who are not your parishioners to come to your vestry-room - A. No; it is not; he never came at any period but it was about the business that this book concerns.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was it in all - A. I cannot say, it might be four or five times; he brought other gentlemen to look at the book.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago had he been before Christmas - A. I do not recollect, he was there before Christmas; he has been at my house two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a private acquaintance of yours - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come to your house for - A. He came to ask my daughter if I was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him yourself - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you see him at your house - A. He came to ask for the book to see the names in it; he never saw it at my house, but at the vestry.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before Christmas - A. Never before Christmas; the first time he came about the books; he applied to the Rev. Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever live at Birmingham - A. No, but I have been there repeatedly, several months together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his character at Birmingham at all - A. It is improper to say things of a man's character, which we do not know is true.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had not the honour of his private acquaintance at Birmingham - A. No; I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say he has come to your house for the purpose of making enquiries respecting the book, and that book not being at your house he has gone to the vestry to see it - A. This he has done four or five times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, shewing a paper to Mr. Thompson. Tell me whose hand-writing it is - A.

               <p>Q. So then your poor wife at Birmingham was upon her death-bed, and you travelled up to London, and met with the woman at the bar, and took a lodging, your poor wife requiring the solace of your duty, and you spending your time with a prostitute - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You got home to Birmingham, and when was it your poor wife died - A. The 3d of June, 1810.</p>

               <p>Q. Now I caution you that I will prove this - A. It is not my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you met this woman in the street first - A. No, I did not; I met her in St. Paul's Church.</p>
               <p>Q. What, talk to her in St. Paul's church - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your attachment to her take place in St. Paul's, where you first found her - A. I followed her home from St. Paul's church to No. 12, Fetter-lane. I had not been to that church to prayers, I had just come from a place of worship.</p>
               <p>Q. So coming from a place of worship you followed her home to Fetter-lane - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to her in the street - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. On Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What religion are you, for God's sake - A. I do not know any name I can give to my religion.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her or her sister first - A. Her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before your intimacy took place with her - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the intercourse take place with her - A. On the 25th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. In Fetter-lane, at her sister's house - A. I am not sure it was in Fetter-lane, I think they were removed to St. John's-street while I was in Birmingham. I lived with her there one month, and then went down to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I think you said you were very angry with her for having married in your name - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were shocked at her profligacy - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am a jeweller, I make imitable diamonds.</p>
               <p>Q. What, mock diamonds to cheat the world with - A. My warehouse is 53, Great Bartholomew-close, my manufactory is in Birmingham; I employ seven or eight working under my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. So then after this woman told you she had married in a fictitious name you took her down to Portsmouth with you - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you at Portsmouth took her to her own brother, and I tell you here he is, a respectable tradesman at Portsmouth as your wife, and requested that he would receive you as his brother-in-law - A. I suffered her to introduce me to her brother, and I kept up the delusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, did not you yourself say that you hoped he would have no objection to you as a brother-in-law - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live in that habitation as the husband of his sister - A. About ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Received as a brother-in-law - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Received the same at her mothers - A. We were not at all with the mother.</p>
               <p>Q. So that after you left Portsmouth you returned with this woman to London - A. I came to London, and went down to Birmingham, and left her at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came to London and took a room in Mitre-court - A. Yes, Mrs. Currie's, a fruiterers and oyster shop.</p>
               <p>Q. She fitted up a room - A. No, it was not fitted up at all, it was only took to deceive Mrs. Currie; I put a bed in it in order to deceive her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live with her as man and wife - A. I think till the 20th of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. She had a child afterwards and you thought it time to be off - A. I was two months at home on account of my wife's illness.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did his mother live - A. In Old-street, opposite of St. Luke's church.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were always ready and willing to pay for the maintainance of this poor orphan - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No action has been brought against you to compel you to pay - A. That was brought for the premises, the rent; for the old woman told me she would never take any rent of me, therefore she never made any demand; she made a demand of rent before the action was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you object to paying that demand - A. Yes, my lord, but my attorney paid part of that demand in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your attorney - A. Mr. Draper.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Draper was desired by Mr. Alley to go out of court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Mr. Harmer is here, I cannot ask him to go out of court. When were you first introduced to Mr. Draper - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Draper being desired by you to call upon the mother to propose that if she would forego the claim for the rent you would not prosecute her two daughters for a conspiracy - A. I did not; I did know of the conspiracy at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if ever Mr. Draper has said so he did it without your direction - A. Certainly, if he did it at all he did it without my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not hear that he went to the mother of these people with a warrant upon the indictment to take them in custody if they did not accede to the proposal, and forego the action - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190051"></xptr>never did hear so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the night they were taken in custody - A. Not the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever corresponded with the prisoner - A. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she often been with you - A. About four times.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been once to her and she four times to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever copy a letter for her to write - A. Never, nor any other document.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever dictate to her the form of any letter that he was to write - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to any body that you took care that she should not have your letters, but that you took care to manage well to have letters of her's - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you or have you not said that you took care that she should have no letters of yours to shew, or any thing to that effect - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor have not you said that you took care that you would have letters of hers - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You again deny it. Now I again caution you and tell you that I will call a witness to contradict you if you again deny it; have not you said that you took care to have her letters, but you took care she should have no writing of yours to produce - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever propose to her that she should write a letter to you declaring to you that she was not married to you, as your reason that it might save you from a prosecution for bigamy, because the thing was wispered about among your wife's friends - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand the question - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you have been subject to a prosecution if the fact had been so discovered - A. Assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me that you left London upon the 7th of August in the year 1810, and did not return for two weeks - A. I did not return till the 28th, I was not in town on the 9th or 10th.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you meet with two persons that went with you within ten miles of Birmingham. Are they here to-night - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first apply to them to come here to day - A. About a month back.</p>
               <p>Q. As a Birmingham man doing business, you went backwards and forwards continually - A. I came about four times a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually go yourself to enter your name or send any other for you, for the clerk to put it down, so that it will not appear in your own handwriting that you went down at that time - A. It will not.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had a friend that you wished to accommodate in the coach I suppose you would not object to enter his name as Thompson that he might be well accommodated - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never entered a name of Thompson for any of your friends for whom you took a place to go in the country - A. I have for my wife, not for any male friends. Yes, from Birmingham not from London; I had a servant that lived with me about six years, and her name was put down with mine when we came to London together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has she lived with since your wife's death - A. With Mr. Griffiths, a surgeon, No. 2, Tooth-place, Finsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has she lived, and with whom, since your wife's death - A. After I gave up house-keeping she went to live with her father; she lived with me after I gave up housekeeping till the month of August, and from that time till she came to live in London I had seen her two or three times: she went to see her father about seven or eight miles from Birmingham.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did she continue to live with her father - A. About a week, and then she went down to Sheers Hill in Staffordshire, about twenty-three miles from Birmingham; I understood she was there about a fortnight or three weeks or a month, then she came to Birmingham and waited my return, and then she came to London with me in September in the coach in a very ill state of health; she went the very same day to Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does she live now - A. In the very same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Now let me again caution you, do you know a person of the name of

               <p>Q. Had you given him your address before you left him - A. I am so perfectly well known in Birmingham that I might easily be found; he asked me if I recollected him, I said I did, and then the circumstance of our travelling together, whether he mentioned it first or me, I cannot recollect; it was five days after my wife's birth-day at Chelsea that I travelled with him, there was a particular circumstance that makes me remember.</p>

               <p>(The commission under the bankruptcy shewn the witness.)</p>
               <p>MR. MURRAY. I drew up these depositions and memorandums, I positively saw him write his name to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have a very strong opinion that the writing in this register-book is his hand-writing - A. I do, but I think he meant to disguise it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the letter T perfectly unlike his handwriting - A. He has made the T to differ in all the times he has wrote his name.</p>
               <p>Q. But as to the letter s, which is a blotted letter, is there any other letter which is like his - A. Then I do not think much like it; I think it is really his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether there is any other letters like his besides the s and n, is the i like - A. The i is not like exactly it is not so much like his general writing as I have seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the o like - A. I think it is like his general hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the h is like - A. I cannot speak to every letter</p>
               <p>Q. Is the n in John - A. The n, I do not think it is, neither are they alike here.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the h in Thompson like - A. No, I think it is, not as he usually writes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He signs almost different in every character - A. He certainly does</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the general character of the handwriting, do you believe it to be his hand-writing - A. I do believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Thursday, December the 12th, I had been in town, to Beech-street, I had been to partake of an annual dinner; coming home I was stopped at the corner of <placeName id="t17940115-47-crimeloc250">York-street, Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your watch? - I had examined my watch coming out of the Fountain, to see whether I had the glass side or the other side outward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take it away? - I see her hand something to the prisoner, and immediately I thought she had picked my pocket, I have not the least doubt but she did; I perceived her give something to the other woman, which she immediately ran off with, the prisoner was on the side in which the watch was kept, and when I stopped the prisoner she was by me, and the other woman was behind me; I am positive to the prisoner, for I took hold of her immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along, and this gentleman hallooed out for a watch, and he laid hold of me, and no woman was in company with me, nor any body else; coming along he laid hold of me; I had witnesses, they were here to day, but they are gone home now.</p>

On the 26th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at home; I went out of my shop up stairs (every thing was then safe), and remained there about a quarter of an hour-my son and family were all at home. I sent my son down for some bread - He called me; I went down to the shop and found the prisoner in custody there just on the threshold of my back-parlour door, which was then open.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you think they got in - A. The street-door comes into the passage - They must have come in at the door which leads out of the passage into the parlour; this door was padlocked and barred - They must have come through the parlour into the shop; the door between the shop and parlour was not shut. I took the prisoner to the watch-house. Four skeleton keys were found upon him. I returned to the shop, and found a bag with two waistcoats in it-the bag did not belong to me. Some florentine was taken out of the window, and put by the bag.</p>

There was opium and cheese on the quays, and in the warehouse, No. 3, there was bees wax. On the 19th of February last, I saw Warner come round the back of the warehouse and give Finaughty a mat in his hand; he throwed it in his cart. I asked Finaughty, what he had got in his cart; he said, it was nothing to me. I called Latter, the watchman, and then Finaughty throwed it out of the cart. The watchman opened the mat; this bag was rolled up in the mat; the bag contained this cheese, opium, and bees wax. There was bees wax in both the warehouses, and cheese and opium were on the quays.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the London Docks. I apprehended both the prisoners. I examined the mat when Finaughty put it out of the cart, and found the contents were opium, bees wax, and cheese. I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>Finaughty's Defence. I saw Warner coming along, I asked him if he had got a bit of old mat to give me; he fetched this, and I throwed it into the cart. Mr. Low asked me, what it was; I told him, it was an old mat. I did not know any thing was in it.</p>

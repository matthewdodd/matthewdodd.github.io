                  </hi>. I am a waiter, and live at 33, Exeter-street, Brompton—on the morning of 5th of this month, about 4 o'olock, I was standing near the pillars of Drury-lane Theatre—the prisoner Warren came up to me, and took my watch from my waistcoat pocket—it had a chain to it, fastened in my waistcoat—he broke the watch from the swivel and got it into his hand—I took him by the arm and took it away again—he then gave his arm a twist and got away—I followed him, and got about three yards, when Shea ran up against me and stopped me—he then pointed and told Warren to run down Lincoln's-court—I kept Shea and gave him in custody.</p>

A few minutes past 4 o'clock, on the morning of the 5th, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner Shea together in Russell-street—the prosecutor complained to me about having his watch stolen from his pocket—he said that the man who stole the watch had run away—I asked if he thought there was any other person concerned in it, and he said he thought Shea was, because when he was following the one that took the watch, Shea stopped him and told the other to run down Lincoln's-court—I went up to Shea, and he said he did not know anything about it—I then asked the prosecutor if he thought he had anything to do with it, and he said he thought so, and he would give him into my custody—I took him into custody—when I saw the watch, the swivel was broken—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

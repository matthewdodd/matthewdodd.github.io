                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Back-road, St. George's. I was at work at St. John-street, Sidney-square—Leach was foreman—I sent him two casks of cement at half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 7th of June—I received some information, and went to John-street—I missed a cask of cement—I had sent two that morning, and they both ought to have been there—I then went in search of Leach, and found him at the <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop in Charles-street, with Stokes—I called Leach out, and asked him to bring back the cement which he had taken away—he said he had taken nothing away—I said if he did not bring it back, I should give him and Stokes in charge—I met Squires, I told him, and gave Leach in his charge—I then sent Squires to the <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop for Stokes—Leach then said he had sold the cement to Nicholas for three pots of beer—Nicholas was at the <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop at that time—we proceeded to Nicholas's house, and at the back of his premises found the empty cask, which I identify by a mark on the bottom—it was one that I sent that morning by Leach—I did not see Nicholas till he was at the station—he said he knew nothing about it, and Stokes said he was innocent—I have seen some cement which I think was the same, but I would not swear to it—Leach and Stokes were very drunk—if Leach had been sober he would not have done it—he worked for my father many years.</p>

            ? - I know the house; I have been informed by the parish books that it was Mr. Turell paid the rates of the house.</p>
               <p>Where was this house situated? - In <placeName id="t17800628-75-crimeloc389">Wheeler-street, in the parish of Christ-Church, Spitalfields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17800628-75-crimeloc389" type="placeName" value="Wheeler-street, in the parish of Christ-Church, Spitalfields"></interp>

               <p>What night was it that house was attacked? - I cannot be very positive; it was one of the three days, I really thought it was on the Wednesday; it might be on the Monday because of the boys taking the things of the house to make a bonfire of on the birth day.</p>
               <p>What time of the day were they there? - I believe when they were there it was after church, it was between the hours of one and four.</p>
               <p>What time was you there? - Within that time; there were a great number of people there. I saw the prisoner with some more that I knew in the house, throwing out some of the things.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I did; he is an apprentice to Mr. Clayton, a velvet-weaver, who lives very near. I saw him particularly in the garret, and I saw a bedstead chucked out which rested in the gutter; the prisoner came out and stood on the right hand side of it, endeavouring to throw it over the coping of the building; he could not do it easily; he put his legs over it; I thought it would have brought him down; but he threw it over the coping, and then he flung himself back; the bedstead broke two of the pales. I saw several people endeavour to destroy the house.</p>
               <p>Was it destroyed? - The two-pair-of-stairs room was injured by a man with a mallet, who had a leather apron on. I should know him if I was to see him again; he endeavoured to throw out the frame of the window</p>
               <p>Was that done? - I believe it was not.</p>
               <p>Was any part of the house destroyed? - Part of it was injured; I am not come here to say the house was destroyed, but that I saw the prisoner aiding and abetting.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where was you? - In Quaker-street, about forty yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. How long was it before you gave any information against the prisoner? - I will not challenge my memory for a single day.</p>
               <p>Was he taken up upon your information? - He was.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the fact that you gave that information? - I would rather you apply to evidence.</p>
               <p>I would rather have it from you? - I do not choose to resolve that.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. I do not like this witness; as far as I am concerned, as counsel for the crown, I give up the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Court. It was I see the 20th of June before any information was given against the prisoner.</p>

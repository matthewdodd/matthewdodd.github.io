               <p>Did you understand from them, if they hired it for themselves, or for another person? - I asked him if he was the gentleman himself; he told me no, he was employed for a gentleman about one hundred and fifty miles off in the country; we came down together, the prisoner walked before me, and I observed the parlour-door that I left open was shut; it was locked, and the key gone, and the street door half shut and half open; I ran and shut the street door, and put my foot against it, and seized the prisoner by the collar, and told him he must give me an account of the other person that came along with him; at the same time I knocked with my heel for the little girl, and she came up, and he was beating me with this stick (produces one) on my head and my shoulders; then I took the stick from him, and with his fist he knocked all my teeth down; she came up, and saw me all in blood; I told her to call the people at the next door; she went out and left the door wide open, and the servants next door came in, and seized the prisoner; they were a man and maid servant, and the woman took the stick from me; the parlour door was broke open, and there was a white Marseilles quilted counterpane gone, and a great long cloak made of padusoy, and a pair of gloves, and a pocket book; the counterpane and long cloak were worth five pounds; I never saw the things since.</p>

               <p>(The stick produced and deposed to by Mrs. De Petron, being a bamboo with a loaded head.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg leave to ask two or three questions; whether on my entrance into the house, I did not, previous to that knock at the door, and she let me in; whether I treated her with any incivility, and did not behave with the greatest politeness, till we came down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether or not I had any acquaintance with the person that followed me in, and whether he did not pull off his hat in the passage, and hang it up in the passage; whether I ever spoke to him or he to me? next, which is the last favour, please to ask her whether I offered to strike her till she first assaulted me, by seizing me by the collar of the coat, and charging me with what I was perfectly innocent of? if I had time I could produce the gentleman that sent me there to enquire after a ready furnished house for six months.</p>
               <p>Court. The two men came in together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did both of them speak to you? - When they knocked at the door they asked if the house was to be let; they both went into the parlour, and said it was a pretty parlour; they both went up one pair and two pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080012"></xptr>stairs; only one spoke to me, the other never spoke a word to me.</p>
               <p>Did this man speak to the other at all? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did the other man go up stairs with you? - Yes; they both said it was a pretty parlour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I hope you will hear the truth: I had no intention, as I hope for mercy at a future day from my great Creator, of committing any violence or depredation whatever; I went with this only intion of enquiring what the rent might be, and to know how many rooms there might be on a floor, and what situation the house was in; with respect to the furniture, I never spoke to the man, nor had I any previous knowledge of him, nor did I speak to him in the place; I presumed from his following me in at the door, that he belonged to the house; not speaking to the gentlewoman that let me in, or to me; I neither took any thing, nor attempted to take any thing from the place, nor was it my intention; and further, the only reason of my striking that gentlewoman was in consequence of knowing the aukward predicament I stood in, being a returned convict, before the expiration of my time; and I did not know in what manner to extricate myself from her hands, she having her thumb through the button-hole of my coat; my only apprehension was, I thought I might be taken before a magistrate, and known by those sort of people who make a trade of living on human blood, and of detecting unhappy and unfortunate men for a reward.</p>

               <p>Mrs. De. Petron. The cloak was my own, and the counterpane belonged to a family that lodged last winter in our house.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. After what has passed at this trial, it is impossible for you to expect mercy on any terms whatever; upon the first case, though we could not help suspecting all that you said to the Jury was destitute of foundation; and the more so, because you shewed by your conduct, that you were very well practised in the arts of this place; not contented with slating facts which might be easily proved, you artfully laid by to throw in some suggestion after I had stated the case to the Jury; and you have done the same on this second trial; and it is now too apparent, that it will be injustice to the public, ever to suffer you to be at large again to commit such depredations on them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I humbly beg for mercy.</p>

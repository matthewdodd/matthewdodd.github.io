               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did the Minister ask if we were of age? A. No. If he considers it a clandestine marriage, he does, but you brought two witnesses with you, and it appeared a proper marriage.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Should you remember the woman if you saw her? A. Yes; she is in Court.</p>
               <p>MARY PHILLIPS. I lived with the prisoner as his wife, after our marriage, for twelve months; he made away with my clothes, and the tickets of my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What age were you? A. Twenty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was deceived by my first wife; we lived together some time, when she absconded to live<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110143"></xptr>with a man named Lacey; I was afterwards given to understand where they lived - I went and saw her, and proposed her return, but she rejected it; I then became acquainted with Mary Phillips, and she became my wife, and we lived comfortable for twelve months; I was then out of employ, which caused her to apply to the parish, and they made inquiries - it has been stated that I pawned her clothes, but they did not exceed 2l. in value; I was under age when I married my first wife, and my last wife was under age when I married her. I hope you will be as lenient as possible, as both the acts were committed without due consideration.</p>

I went into Piccadilly, and inside the railings I saw a piece of bread. I had had nothing to eat all day and went inside the railings to pick it up and saw the shillings in paper. I jumped over the rails with them and showed them to a young woman. A man was standing there also and I asked him to have some drink. He gave me his direction and said that if I met him there next morning and made myself tidy he would get me something to do. Had I known the money was bad I should not have told the policeman where I had passed the other.</p>

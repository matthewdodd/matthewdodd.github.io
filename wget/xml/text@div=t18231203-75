            . I live with Mrs. Hester. On the 25th of July, the prisoner rang the bell, and asked if my master was at home - I said No; he said he had brought two quarts of palm oil, to go into the country; he gave me a receipt out of his pocket-book, and said it came to 3 s. 6 d. I said Mrs. Hester was not at home, if he would call again - he said he could not, because he came from the Strand. I borrowed 3 s. 6 d. of the landlady, and paid him. I cannot read writing. I left the paper up stairs with the bottle. This was ten minutes before one o'clock; two children were in the room, but I remained with them. My mistress came home at one, and took up the same paper as he gave me. I saw the prisoner again on the day he was apprehended, and am sure of him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 31st of October, the prisoner came with a bottle of ink, as he said. I went down to him - he said he had brought a bottle of ink from some gentleman in Fenchurch-street; I opened the bottle, and found it was blacking and water. I gave him in charge. I had found this receipt on coming home on the 25th of July; it was under a jar on the table - I locked it up in my drawer, and did not give it to my husband till the examination; that produced is it. He returned it to me, and I have kept it ever since. We never dealt with Mr. Gardener.</p>

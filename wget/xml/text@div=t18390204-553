Clark brought me this cheque—I returned it to her—she afterwards brought it back to me requesting me to get it changed at the bank—it was dated 1838 when she brought it to me—I sent my son John with it to the bank of Howe and Smith, at Uxbridge—he returned with two £10 notes—in consequence of what he said, I went myself to the bank, returned the two £10 notes, and Mr. Smith gave me back the cheque—I found my name had been written on it—I returned to my house, went up stairs and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner—I told him I could not get the cheque changed, that the bank refused to change it—he said it was very strange, what were banks for but to change cheques—I said they know neither me nor the party to whom it was payable, and I should decline having any thing to do with it—he said he had no change—I drew his attention to its being dated 1838—he said that must be evidently a mistake of the person who drew the cheque—he then took a pen and altered the 8 to 9—I returned him the cheque—I called in a constable, and desired him to take him into custody if he went away without paying his bill, and he was taken—I recollect having seen him before, three or four years ago, by the name of Attwood—he did not mention any name on this occasion.</p>

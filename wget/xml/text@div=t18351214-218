                  </hi>. I am a salt-merchant and corn-dealer. This is a correct plan of my premises, (<hi rend="italic">looking at one,</hi>) which are No. 34, Wharf-road, City<lb></lb>basin—this accurately represents the prisoner's stable—there is an aperture in the wood work sufficient for me to get through—It is from two to three feet from the ground—this represents where my granary is—a person coming through the aperture could walk along, and get up to my granary—the aperture was in the prisoner's wall—I entered on my premises the beginning of August—I put corn into the granary on the 7th of August—on the 25th of November I missed the corn in question—It was in two bulks—I had the bulk measured—I thought there was from seven to ten quarters gone—It was Irish potato oats—they were hut and musty—I did not know M'Dougal at that time—I saw him that evening, and, in consequence of what passed, I saw the prisoner about seven or half-past seven o'clock, at his own house—I told him I heard that he had got the key of my granary of corn warehouse, and desired him to give it up to me—he said he had not got it, and never had it, and did not know any thing about it—I told him I had just heard it from M. Doug al, who was in the Macclesfield Arms, and if he would go over there with me to see him, face to face, I should be satisfied—as M. Dougal had told me he had given the key to him himself—he said he was willing to go, and I was welcome to search his house—we went together with the policeman to the Macclesfield Arms—we found M. Dou<lb></lb>gal there sitting in the parlour—I asked him to walk out into the street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183512140034"></xptr>
               <p>and asked him if he had given the prisoner the key of the warehouse, as he had represented to me before—he said he had given him the key—the prisoner denied it—M'Dougal said, "It was in the shed, by the side of your house, the week after Mr. Ashton took possession of his premises," and he said, "At the time I passed the key to you, requesting you would be kind enough to send it to Mr. Ashton, you took it in your hand, and turned the key in the door, either one way or other, I do not remember which, you turned it in the lock, and said, "It is a useful key, and might be useful for many purposes"—the prisoner said he never had it—I am sure he said so—M'Dougal said, "What I have stated is correct, and I will make an oath of it before any judge or magistrate who I am called before"—I then gave the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody—his pockets were searched at the station-house—he pulled a handful of oats out of his pocket—they were not my oats—the prisoner said, "These are the oats I have had in to-day from Tarling and Maides, and I have got no other sort of oats"—he then said the last time he saw the key of the warehouse it was behind the door of a shed, by the side of his house, under some plaster of Paris heads—he said nothing more about the key them—I and the policeman went to the prisoner's stable—I found six horses feeding there on oats, split beans, and clover chaff mixed up to<lb></lb>gether—I took a handful of chaff, beans, and oats, away—the policeman and I went to my shop, and separated the oats—I kept half myself, and gave half to the policeman—I have brought that sample with me—I have a sample of the oats from the bulk they were stolen from—I believe the oats found in the prisoner's stable to be the same as are in my bulk, be<lb></lb>cause they are musty—I tasted them as I came along by the dock—what he gave me from his pocket were new—these were old—the oats in his stable were the same kind as my Irish potato oats—I have been in the corn trade thirty-five years.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not say, on that occasion, that the first thing for you to do would be to go immediately to Keyton's premises, and make a thorough search? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No such observation at any time—he did not say the best plan would be to go to Keyton's immediately and make a thorough search—he did not propose it—I have no recollection of it—I swear positively it did not happen at any time—I have no knowledge of saying there was no occasion, as I was quite satisfied of what had been done, and there were others I suspected much more than Keyton—I will not swear I did not say so, it is so long ago—I cannot say that I did or did not—I believe I was not asked, I should say I would not go—I cannot say whether I was asked or not—I might be, and I might not—I I cannot say that I said so—the only doubt is if I was asked the ques<lb></lb>tion, I am sure I should not accept the offer—I had the things mis<lb></lb>sing, and suspected my other servants—I did not know who to suspect at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 25th of November I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, and heard him ask the prisoner for the key of his granary—the prisoner said he had not got it, and knew nothing about it—Ashton asked him to go with him to the Macclesfield Arms—the prisoner said he would go with him any where he liked; and we all three went over—Mr. Ashton called M'Dougal out, and asked him whether he did not give the prisoner the key of his granary—M'Dougal said he did—the prisoner said he did not—Ash ton then gave the prisoner into my custody—M'Dougal said he gave the prisoner the key as he was sitting on the end of a bench in a shed, and I do not remember any thing more—I asked him about the key of Mr. Ashton's granary—he said there was the key or a key belonging to Mr. Ashton's granary hanging behind the door in a shed under some heads—Mr. Ashton and I went to the shed, and saw some plaster of Paris heads, but found no key—M'Dougal went with us—I saw Ashton take a sample of oats from the prisoner's stable, and I have kept some myself—I have kept it safe ever since—here is a sample—I got it from the prisoner's pocket—here is a sample Mr. Ashton gave me—It is part of the sample I saw him find in the stable, and here is the sample from Mr. Ashton's bulk in his granary.</p>

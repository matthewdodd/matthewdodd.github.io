I consequence of information I received, I went on 15th Feb., in plain clothes, to the White Horse public house, Lee Bridge, in Kent, and concealed myself in a yard there, which commands a view of Harryman's premises—he is a carman and coal dealer, and removes goods—I saw him standing on that bridge, about twenty yards from his stable, at about half past 1 o'clock in the day—he appeared to be waiting for some one—I saw Smith stop with a cart opposite Harryman's stable door—he came as if from the country, and not over the bridge—he looked round, apparently for some one, and Harryman waved his hand—Smith was then looking towards him, and could see him—they were about twenty yards apart—Harryman waved his hand in the direction of his stable, and in the direction in which Smith was coming—the two roads an in different directions—they come down to a corner at the bridge, one runs from Maidstone, and the other from Blackheath—Smith had to pass Harry<lb></lb>man's stable, it was on his right hand as he came from Blackheath—I saw Smith a moment afterwards, take a sack of corn off his cart, and throw it over the wall of Harryman's premises—I went up and asked him what he had thrown over the wall—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Well, come with me, and we will see what you have thrown over"—I went through the stable with him into the back yard, and saw the sack lying under the wall, where I had seen it thrown over—I said, "What do you call this?"—he made no reply—I said, "How came you to throw this over?"—he said, "Harryman told me if I had any corn to spare to throw it over, and he would give me some beer for it"—the name of "White and Son" was on the sack—I am sure it was "White."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Brompton, in Middle<lb></lb>sex. Smith was my carman, and had charge of my horses and cart on 15th Feb.—I cannot say whether he had corn for feeding his hones that day, but he has many days—I do not serve him with it—this produced is the same mixture which we give our hones, and this is one of our sacks—it is turned inside out, and has the name of "White and Brothers, cement manufacturers," on it—we had some of their sacks—the men may not serve themselves with corn, if I do not do it—most likely my foreman in London served out this corn—he is not here—I never authorised Smith to give any corn away.</p>

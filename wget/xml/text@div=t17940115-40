               <p>I know the prisoner. I am Mr. Russle's servant, I was out after my pots, and I put these two pint pots on the area steps, at No. 24, in Queen-Ann-street West. As I was coming up the area steps again, I saw the prisoner, and asked him, what he did with these pint pots in his hand? he did not answer, but made off as fast as ever he could up Wimpole-street. I instantly went after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150103"></xptr>him, and caught hold of him, and I found these two pint pots on him; they are Mr. Boxall's, a publican, who is ill in bed; he heaved my master's into the high road, before I got up to him.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time did he live with Mr. Ruffle? - He never lived with Mr. Ruffle as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from whence he took these pots? - He took these two, that he threw away, from No. 24, in Queen-Ann-street West.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he get your master's pint pots? - Because I was getting of them in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Slack was the man that first stopped me, this man, he came up, and brought two pint pots in his hands that I knew nothing about.</p>

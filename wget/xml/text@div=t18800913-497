I am a labourer, and live in Macklin Street—on 26th August, about 6.30 a.m., I was in Covent Garden Market—I saw the prisoner hanging about—he asked me if I wanted to earn half a pint of beer—I said "Yes"—he asked me if I knew where Coleman was—I told him "Yes," and pointed it out—he gave me two tickets and two baskets to take, and said "Get 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the tickets were like these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am 28 years old—Mr. Coleman and Inspector Roots came after me about five minutes afterwards—I told the inspector, who spoke first, that I knew nothing about the tickets—I had not seen them before, nor the prisoner, in Covent Garden—I have never transacted business with the salesmen in Covent Garden—I am employed carrying things for people who come to the market, costermongers and others—I never took any baskets with tickets before—I believe it is the custom for salesmen to give tickets.</p>

I am a salesman, of Covent Garden Market—on 20th August Inspector Roots spoke to me—the following morning Edwards brought two baskets and two tickets—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is our custom to give tickets with the basket to the customer, who pays a shilling on it—on the return of the basket and the ticket we return the shilling which has been left on it—that is the custom amongst salesmen—after paying Edwards I and Roots followed him, because I had information that the tickets were forged, and I knew they were forged—I saw Roots speak to him—these two tickets produced are forgeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Roots first came to me on the Friday afternoon—I never saw Edwards before, to my knowledge—I had received similar tickets in the transaction of my business, but. not forged ones, except four that our firm received a fortnight before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 21st August I was in Covent Garden Market with Police-constable Chapman—Edwards was pointed out to me by Mr. Coleman—I spoke to him—he afterwards pointed out the prisoner—I then apprehended the prisoner, and told him he would be charged with uttering two forged tickets to Mr. Coleman, a salesman in Covent Garden Market—he said nothing—I took him to Bow Street Police-court—I searched him, and found on him a large number of tickets; 25 of them bore the mark of Coleman—the prisoner said "I found them in a pocket-book in the market this morning"—he had no pocket-book—he gave the name of Wilcocks, but refused his address and occupation.</p>

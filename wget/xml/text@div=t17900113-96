I found my watch was gone: I called for Mr. Holder, but he was gone; I followed him immediately: at that time I missed nothing but my watch. I went down stairs very much terrified and frightened: there was a woman took hold of my hand at the bottom of the stairs, and said, my dear, take care how you come down stairs; I was near falling down the cellar stairs: I went out at the street door and came into St. Giles's; and when I had got a little way I found the money was not at the bottom of my boot, and my boot was cut across with a knife: I have the boot in my pocket, but it has been sewed up: I had two pair of silk stockings on, and wearing no garters, the stockings hung down, and that made the money lodge: I went home and pulled off my boot, and found that the nine guineas and a half were gone, and the sixpence left at the bottom:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130093"></xptr>in December I heard of my watch at Mr. Keate's: from home I went back to this house, and took three watchmen; and Cook was not there; I searched for her, but could not find her till the 31st of December.</p>

               <p>Had not you been drinking? - I did not drink two glasses at the room; on the road from Woolwich, where I had been, I might drink a pint of wine, or a glass or two of gin, or a drop of punch.</p>

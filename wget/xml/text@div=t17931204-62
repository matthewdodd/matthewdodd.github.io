               <p>Prisoner. This woman gave me a shilling to carry the things and the man was there, and he said to me he would be glad if I would move his things under the arch way as they must both move together, after we had done moving the girl's things from the archway, then he came back and gave me a box, which is in his own place now, that is all that I had moved of his, I told him; then he told me that he would fetch an officer, I said fetch an officer, for I will not run away, take me up directly I will not quit the room, I know myself clear; nor I would not stir a peg from the room. He put his things under the arch way for fear of being seized for the rent.</p>

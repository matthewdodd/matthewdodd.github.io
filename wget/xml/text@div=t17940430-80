               <p>I was on board a ship a month, and in that time I received one pound-one shilling and six-pence(it was the Ocean, an East India-man) and I came up to town to receive my money, I came up on Sunday night, and on Monday morning I went and received it, it was the 3d of March; I went to the City Chambers; I went to the Jerusalem coffee house, to enquire where I should get this money, I lighted of Dillon, and he asked me if I wanted a ship? I told him I did, he said, I might go on board the King George if I pleased; I had received the money before this.</p>

What is Dillon? - I don't know, I never saw him before then, I went into the Jerusalem coffee house and enquired, and I went to go down to the City Chambers, and I passed this Dillon, and I was rather up to it; I was rather down upon it; I was rather up to his rig; and there I got my money, and there I light of this other fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dillon leave you? - I am not certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q.

It was that man next to Dillon (Holden) I told him I did, I asked him what ship he would recommend? he had a handful of shipping notes, and he gave me one, and told me to come along with him to the captain; and he was going down the street, and I said, here is a rendezvous here somewhere, O! says he, if I take you to a rendezvous I will suffer my head to be off; so he took me to a house in <placeName id="t17940430-80-crimeloc428">East Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Q. You went there with Dillon? - No, with Holden. They hauled me into a close parlour; Davis had the first hold of me, there he tumbled me down flat on the ground, and hawled me into the room on the floor.</p>

On the 19th of june, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to our office, to inquire if any parties had been from the Saving's Bank, inquiring if letters of administration had been taken out to the effects of John Collions, deccased—we said nobody had been there—he said he had been to the Saving's Basnk, and he understood that another party, a woman, calling herself the widow, would apply for letters of administration to John Collins—he said if she did so, it was of no use, as he had a will—we then told him we could not do any thing without seeing that will—he then left to bring it, and, in the afternoon of the same day, the woman called about the letters of adminstration—the prisoner came again on Saturday, the 20th, with a paper—we told him we could not do any thing with it at present, and he must call again on the Tuesday: he left it with us—he called again on the Tuesday, and had a person with him, calling himself the nephew of the deceased, Owen Collins—on the Monday, one of the clerks had to the Savings' Bank on other business, and brought away a pettion, which we examined with the will—this is the will which he gave me, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—we afterwards objected to obtain any probate to the will, in consequence of receiving information from Mr. Clarkson, the proctor—I communicated my suspicions about the will to Mr. Richard Jennings.</p>

               <p>policeman and the prisoner looked at the body—the prisoner opened Collin's mouth and eyes, to ascertain that he was dead—I did not know the prisoner before he came that day—I had seen him seventeen years ago, but at that time I did not recollect it—that was all he did, looking at the deceased and examing him—he gave no orders for the funeral—he said nothing about his having a will or being executor—I never heard a word about it—I know Owen Collins, by his coming to our place—he gave in his name as Owen Collins, but I know no more about him—the deceased was not on friendly terms with him, but quite the contrary—he did not wish him in his bed-room—he ordered him down stairs—he called me to turn him down stairs, and said he could not bear him in his sight—he said that on the Sunday, as he broke open his door on the Saturday night and frightened him, and he said so till the day of his death, that he could not bear the sight of him, and they were his last dying words—he had broken into his door on the Saturday night, and forced himself into the room—he broke the staple of the lock—I do not know a person named Kelly—I never saw him in my life—I have seen Griffiths here—I never saw her before I went before the Alderman—I know nothing of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a feather-dresser, and live at Kidderminster. I knew the deceased, John Collins; he worked in my service for above eight years—I often saw him write—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the will</hi>) to the best of my judgment and belief, this signature is not his writing; it is not his writing; it is a different style and character from his altogether—Eakley did not work with him all the time, but for about seven years—she came to him in about a year after he came to me—the deceased's name was John Collins; he always called himself so to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you judge that the signature to the will is not his writing, by comparing it with the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not at all; but because it is a dif<lb></lb>ferent character of writing quite—like this piece of paper—that is his writing; this is quite different fromk the writing on the will—I judge that the writing to the will is not his, by its being so unlike that paper—this is his hand-writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the London Provident Institution Savings' Bank, Bloomfield-street, Moorfields; Sir Thomas Baring is pre<lb></lb>sident, David Bevan, Esq. is one of the trustess. I know the prisoner, by his having applied to our Institution—his first aplication was, I believe, on Wednesday, the 17th of June; he came to make inquiry relativ to the account of John Collins—I cannot say whether any body was with him on the first application—he was told, any inquiry he had to make must be in writing, as he had not the deposit-book to produce—he afterwards came and presented this petition—this is the book of deposits of John Collins:—</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Petition read</hi>)—"Honoured Gentlemen, your humble applicant, Owen Collins, whose uncle, John Collins, deposited 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in your honourable Insti<lb></lb>tution about four or five weeks ago, and is since deceased—a woma, whom the said uncle has cohabited with, being in possession of the bank-book will not deliver it up—your applicant therefore most sincerely prays your kind advice and assistance for the recovery of the said funded property; and your humble applicant, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you the acting person at this Institution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On most occasions I am—I have no recollection of the person of the deceased, as he was never there but once, and then he merely paid me the cash—I am not able to say that it was not a woman who paid me the cash—the payment was all made at once, on the 28th of April—the prisoner came to our Bank on the 17th of June—I am not sure whether he was accompanied by another person; but when he made the tion, he was accompanied by the man who purported to be the nephew, Owen Collins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not his application, on the 17th, to stop the payment of the money to Eakley if she applied; he tell you the deceased had made a will? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say out; because we entered into no conversation with him—I cannot undertake to say whether he represented that another per<lb></lb>son had got the book, and if she applied to take out the money I was to stop it, as there was a will—I should say, he did not mention a will at all; because our time is so valuable, we enter into no conversation with parties who do no produce a book—I was the person who saw him—I told him a person had applied, who purported to be the wife, and most likely told him she had produced the book—I told him I had referred her Mr. Jennings, the proctor—I referred him to Mr. Jennings also—the woman had repre<lb></lb>sented herself to me as the wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it not be necessary, in the course of proceedings, for an affida<lb></lb>vit of that fact, or a certificate of the marriage, or for administration to be taken out before you paid the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it is at the option of the trustees to pay the money without administration; and we very sel<lb></lb>dom require a certificate of marriage—all we require is the production of the book and a certificate of the burial—on many occasions we take affida<lb></lb>vits or certificates of marriage—sometimes persons of respectbility come forward to vouch the fact, and then we do not require affidavits; we re<lb></lb>quire the production of the undertaker's account, and reference to re<lb></lb>spectable people—we take an undertaker's account in part of the evidence to prove the person is the person described—I am not aware of any further explantation with the prisoner on Wednesday or Friday—the moment the will was produced, we referred him to the proctor—I believe I gave him a card with Mr. Jennings' direction upon it—on the 16th of June, I stated if he had any application to make he must make it in writing, and on the Friday the explantion I have mentioned took place, and we referred him to Mr. Jennings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a proctor of Doctor's Commons. Cox is an articled clerk of my father's—I saw the prisoner—I cannot state the date exactly—it was respecting a wil from the Savings' Bank—Cox had, before that, made a communication to me—the prisoner produced this will to me—as well as I can recollect, Cox brought the will in to me—the prisoner was in the clerk's office—I believe I had him into my room—the wil was then produced, and I made inquiry of him respecting the execution of the will—(I have some difficulty in calling the order of</p>

               <p>the circumstances to my mind)—I suggested to him, that the attesting witnesses should attend at our office, to explain the circumstances—an ap<lb></lb>pointment was made for their attendance on the following day, I think—they did attend—I am not able to say the day—it was immediately after, and I think the next day, or the day but one after—a person, of the name of Kelly, and a female, named Griffiths, attended—they were the names they gave—the prisoner was them, I believe—I am not quite certain; I really cannot speak positively, for I saw the witnesses in my own room, each person by himself—if the prisoner was there, he was not in the room with them—in consequence of what they stated, I desired the prisoner to be sent to me, if he was there; or when he did come he was to be sent to me; and I saw him in company with Owen Collins—it was a continuation of the transaction—I made some inquiry of the prisoner—he said, he had attended the deceased, and, at the deceased's request, he prepared the will for him; and that the deceased had executed the will in the presence of the persons whose names appeared as attesting witnesses—he said the will was executed in a public-house in Clerkenwell, in the neighbourhood of the deceased's residence—I believe Mutton-hill is near Clerkenwell—Owen Collins was going to make some observation, and I stopped him—in consequence of the interview, I explained to the prisoner the oath it was necessary for him to take, as the executor—he declared that he was per<lb></lb>fectly able to take that oath conscientiously—I then directed the clerks, I think Cox, to prepare the necessary process for his being sworn as executor, and to use extreme caution—I do not think that was in the prisoner's presence—I should say, that a discussion took place with the prisoner as to the property—I found descrepanies in his statement, which induced me to be more particular—I only recollect that that was the result of the conversation—at first he stated, that the property exceeded the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but susequently he said it did not—I do not remember any other descrepancy; but in consequence of that, I was particular in the instructions I gave to my clerks—there is a difference in the stamp-duty, and savings' bank property is exonerated from stamps, where the property is under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the person's whole property does not exceed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if he deposited 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and has 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more beside, that renders him liable to the stamp; but if he has altogether less than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the stamp-duty is lower; his being a depositor gives him that privilege—I put a jurat to the will—I was not present, and do not know whether the oath was administered to the prisoner—this is the stamp-office affidavit; it has been sworn, I apprehend, as I believe this to be the signature of the surrogate—I was absent from the office when the prisoner and Owen Collins were given into custody—I was called on to give evidence about a week after—Mrs. Collins had not made any application to me in the mean time—she had previously.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not direct the parties to be taken into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: as far as I was individually concerned, the matter was going on as if the prisoner was the executor—this is not my prosecution—I saw the woman before I saw the prisoner—I saw her the day before I first saw the prisoner—I cannot tell when it was—she represented her<lb></lb>self as the widow of the party deceased—I instructed her to obtain a certificate of her marriage, and asked her where the was married—she told me (I think) at Kidderminster—she said she could obtain a certifi<lb></lb>cate, and promised to produce one, mentioning the expense to be an object, which I promised to assist her in—I told the prisoner when he came, that</p>

               <p>the woman had been, and represented herself as the widow; that she had been married at Kidderminster, and had promised to produce the certifi<lb></lb>cate; and he told me that the will he produced was the genuine willl—that Owen Collins was the nephew of the decesed, and that the woman was not his wife—I afterwards taxed the woman with having deceived me—whether she said she had stated what she did to get the money or not, I cannot say; but I think she did not—she said she was entitled to the money—I believe the will was in our possession when I first saw the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. In June last, I lived in Marmaduke-street, St. George, East. I have known the prisoner seventeen years, and have lived with him as his wife—I was married to him once—it was said that he had another wife living—I now live in Edward-street, Blackfriars-road—he was tried for bigamy for marrying me—I have not lived with him since that—I have seen him sometimes, but never to live with him—I saw a woman they said was his wife, produced in this court but it was not regu<lb></lb>larly produced, I think—I did not speak to him for five years afterwards he was only confined three months on account of his character—on the 6th of June, I went to the Two Brewers—it was the Saturday before Whitsunday—it</p>

               <p>was from between the hours of twelve, or one and three o'clock—from the hours of one till near upon three o'clock—until past two o'clock—it might be past one o'clock—I am not exactly paticular to a few minutes—it was between one and two o'clock—I never saw the deceased before that day, or since—I know Edmund Kelly—he was at the Two Brewers—it was soner was there—I saw a paper signed at the Two Brewers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who signed it first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> John Collins; they said that was his name, and Edmund Kelly next—he had known him some years, and I singed last—this "Sarah Griffiths" (<hi rend="italic">looking at the will</hi>) is my writing, and that is Kelly's and that is the man's calling himself John Collins—I saw nhim put his name to the paper—he stooped to do it—he leaned on the table, and did not sit down—the prisoner did not sign it—he read the Will—he never touched it after he read it—John Collins signed it first—Kelly and I next—I remember Friday, the 12th of June; I was not at the Two Brewers then; I was at home, at Marmaduker-street, till nearly two o'clock and from there went to Mr. Smith's, in the Borough—no paper ws sent for while I was at the Two Brewers—it was nearly written when I got there—I heard John Collins say that Owen Collins was his hephew—he said he wished him to be protected, for afriad of being made away with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was afraid of being made away with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> John Collins said he was afrid of being made away with; for he had fallen into very bad hands, and wished to get away from some woman who he was with—he said he was afriad of being <hi rend="italic">burked</hi>? that was the word he used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you at the Two Brewers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 5th, the evening previous to the Saturday, Owen Collins called with a person named Feeley, at my house, to know if Dominick Feeley (the prisoner) was there—he was there—it was as late as ten o'clock and he asked him if be would go and interfere on behalf of Owen Collins, on the morrow; to go and inter<lb></lb>fere, to take his property from the hand of this woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then Owen Collins asked Feeley if he go the following morning to interfere about his property being in the hand of this wo<lb></lb>man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there was another person with Owen Collins, of the name of Michacl Feeley—he was to interfere about John Collins's pro<lb></lb>perty, who was afraid of being made away with—he appointed to meet John Collins next day, at twelve o'clock—he went at twelve o'clock and met him; and asked me to be so good to come to him at the Two Brewers—I did not know what it was for, until I went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did you live with the prisoner as his wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A very little while—I do not think it was six months—it is seven years ago since I lived with him as his wife—I have seen him frequently since that time, but not to live with him—sometimes not for a months together, somntimes six weeks, and sometimes two three times a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In all that time did you know of his having an old friend called John or Patrick Collins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not acquainted with his acquaintances—I never heard the name, to my knowledge—I do not live in Marmaduke-street now—I have property of my own, and have lived on that since I have parted from the prisoner—I believe the prisoner lodged in Ray-street and sometimes in his own house, in Gloucester-street, Commercial-road—he was at my house when Owenn Collins and Michael Feeley came to ask for him—Michael Feeley is the prisoner's brother, and he married my sister,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you were to talk from Commercial-road to Mutton-hill without knowing what for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had other husiness to do—I was going to see</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170029"></xptr>
               <p>a friend at the west-enjd of the town, in Carburton-street—they did not come to fetch me to go to Mutton-hill—the prisoner asked me to call, as he was going there—he did not tell me for what—he had not been staying with me, he had been there above half-an-hour, I suppose—he was not going to stop there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the appointment made for you to come? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He called on me next morning, at ten o'clock, and asked me—Kelly went with me to Mutton-hill—I went to Kelly's house to see his wife she was an invalid—I got there at half-past twelve: I think it is in Currier's-court, London-wall; it was all in my road—I believe it was half-past one whe I got to the public-house on Mutton-hill—I think it was between one and two—I did not stop twently-mintes there—the will was nearly done when I got there—I knew the prisoner's writning at the time I lived with him—this will is hand-writing (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this "John Collins," at the bottom, is not like his hand-writing—this ius John Collins' writing; it is not at all like the prisoner's writing he never wrote it; in my judgement, it is no like his writing—I believe this petition to be the prisoner's hand-writing; it looks like it—this name of "Owen Collins," at the bottom, looks like his writing; but I cannot say: if I was struck to death, I believe it to be his—I came with Kelly to the house—whether Kelly went out when I did, I cannot say—he came to the door—I did not go away with him—he came out at the door, but did not go my way—whether he went in again, I cannot say—I did not see the landlord of the house—I did not see Owen Collins there—there was the prisoner and John Collins, as they said, and Kelly, and myself—I did not see any body else—no paper was sent for while I was there—there was a man back<lb></lb>wards and forwards at the door, but he never came in—I sopke to a female outside, but not it the room—I went and asked for her, and she conducted meto a place a tlittle way out of the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was the day the will was executed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As I hope to see my Maker, it was—I was never there on any other occasion inmy life—oh! I called there on the Saturday following, the 20th</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What kind of man John Collins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A littleish man; a little dark complexion, rather sallow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you call there for on the Saturday following? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Feeley called on me, and said ther was a great demur, and I called on Mr. Jennings and he was perfectly satisfied at the time—Kelly said he was going into the country, and if I would go to the Two Brewers, he had something he would sell me; and I went—there was an observation about picture, and things in the room—that was the only time I was ther, excep when the will was executed—it was after I saw Mr. Jennings that I went to the Two Brewers—the prisoner went with me, also Kelly, and Owen Collins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Ppray, are you at all acquainted with the Court of the Old Bailey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly—I was tried here—I do not know how long ago—I cannot exactly tell—a person had put something into my basket—I really do not know how long it is ago—it was since I was married to the prisoner, and since I parted from him—I was confined for three years; it was for steal<lb></lb>ing two small glasses, the value of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—they were put into my basket—my senteance was not seven years transportation, mitigated to three years'—I was never in the prison—it is very hard to ask me that—I am ex<lb></lb>tremely sorry you should ask me that—I am not come to tell a story?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was you not sentenced to Seven Years' transportation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You</p>

               <p>may say as long as you please; I will not contradiet you—I dare say, I could have the best of characters—the first people in the kingdom come to these misfotunes—I was no theif—fthey sent me to the Penitentiary for four years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Describe Collins' person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was a little man, and sallow—I did not look at him much—he looked very sallow, and was not a young man—he leaned on the table to sign the doucement, and then sat down, and begged and prayed of the prisoner to see to his property—he said he had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his box, and money in the Bank, and wished it to be taken care of—he wanted to make it to Dominick Feeley; but he said no, he would have nothing to do withit; it would be expensive to have an attor<lb></lb>ney, and the only thing he wished him to do was to make a will—he sat facing the table—I only observed one window to the room.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">BARTON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant,</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">G.</hi>) On the 11th of June, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to me at the station-house, and made a representation to me about one Collins, of Lamb-court, and I acompained him to Lamb-court, and after that to the doctor, who was said to have attended him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 201). I am stationed at Walthamstow—on the evening of 6th June, about 9 o'clock, I saw an altercation between the prisoner and Parker, who said "This man has taken some things out of my shop"—the prisoner said "Let me go, I will pay you for them—Parker said "I shan't let you go till I get the things"—I took a bundle of wood from under his coat, and took him to the station, searched him, and found a packet of tea in the inside pocket of his coat, a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bundle of firewood, and some potatoes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I read the charge to him, and he said "Mr. Parker, I will pay you for the things."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Albert Parker, of Walthamstow, a general shop keeper—on 6th June, about 8. 45, my husband called me; I went into the shop in about a minute, and saw him outside the shop, struggling with the prisoner—my husband said he had stolen some potatoes and wood—I said to the prisoner "Give the things up"—he said "I have got nothing"—I asked him again, and he said "I have got nothing, mistress"—a constable came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not say "I have got nothing of yours"—he came to visit us occasionally—he was smoking a pipe at our house the night before—he has dealt at our place since he has been at that house, which is, perhaps, two months—his wife comes there, and he frequently takes home the things to her—his wife paid me once for things which he took away without my seeing him do so—I did not see his dog on this occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The article he bought and afterwards paid for, was a half<lb></lb>pound of bacon—I do not know of any contract between my husband and his wife for the supply of potatoes and wood.</p>

                  </hi>. On this night, about 8.45, I saw the prisoner coming towards the shop, followed by a little girl, who asked for a bundle of wood; I served her, and going round the counter to get a candle, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner take a bundle of wood, and put it in his pocket and walk out—he said to the girl "That is nice bacon you have there, I will have a rasher right along, but I have not got the money to pay for it, I will pay when my wifes comes home"—as I was cutting the bacon, I saw him go towards the window, put his hand there, and put something in his pocket—he said "Make it just half-a-pound," and I saw him put his hand into a basket and take some potatoes; he whistled to his dog and went away—the potatoes were about 2 yards from the egg-basket—I do not know why he did not wait for the bacon—I went after him, after calling my wife—I said, "I saw you put some things in your pocket; you have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="1873060900053"></xptr>
               <p>got some potatoes and wood, and I think some eggs"—he strongly denied it a great many times, and I struggled with him—I know of no con<lb></lb>tract between his wife and me for the supply of wood and potatoes—I do not know of his taking wood away before—at the station I saw the wood and tea taken from him; it was tea which he took from the window, which I thought was eggs; the packets lay close to the eggs—I gave him no authority to take away the tea—he said at the station "I will pay for them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever trust him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I believe my wife has let his wife have things on credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was going to trust him with the bacon—I did not speak to him, because I was watching him, and was going to tax him with it—I was going to charge him as a thief, but I should not have given him in charge for stealing a bundle of wood—I did not believe him to be a thief, because we were on the most friendly terms, but when he went away and left the bacon, I thought he was a thief—he went out and whistled after his dog, and when I saw him run out I thought he was going to steal my wood and potatoes—I knew who he was, but he had said nothing about the things—he has smoked once at my place, but not with me, I do not smoke—I have known him a month or six weeks, and his wife a little longer—she has a little property—she has been an occasional customer—the prisoner seems rather a strange man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He took his key and struggled to get into his house, but I would not let him; I got him back about 40 yards before he was given in custody—I did not know of his having the tea till he was searched—I have never trusted him—I never knew him go to the window and take a packet of tea.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he go out after his dog? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but that was his mode to take these things home—I never knew him take a bundle of wood—he has not bought wood of me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I have given him credit once or twice, but I always have to see what people take in order to book it—the wood stands in front of the counter—if he had said "Mrs. Parker, I will take a couple of bundles of wood," I should book them to him—he would not have to reach very far to help himself to the tea, and the potatoes are sold by weight—tea is sold by the packet—it would be impossible to lift the wood without being seen.</p>

On my going up Back Hill, at Mr. Page's shop, I discovered some shoes for sale, I fetched my father to ascertain whether they were our goods, we went into Mr. Page's shop, and by the advice of Mr. Page we waited a little while, he said the man had been there before, and most likely would come again. On the 14th of October Mr. Page came to me between eight and nine in the evening, he informed me, that the man was at his shop, pledging or selling a pair of shoes; I immediately went with Mr. Page to his house, where I discovered old Shipley. I took him in custody, and by the assistance of a watchman he was taken to the watch-house. On Sunday morning I, accompanied with Mr. Adkins, went to Shipley's lodgings, there I found two pair of my shoes, we took up young Shipley and asked him where he got the shoes, he said he got them from

We went and apprehended Carter at his uncle's at Peckham; we told him we should search his father's lodgings; we asked him if there was any property there, he said there was in his box and some of it had been stolen for two years ago, and that he had been in the habit of stealing from that time through the instigation of old Shipley and young Shipley; they were continually pleading poverty, saying he had got a good opportunity, if he would bring them they would dispose of them. In the evening Furneaux, the other apprentice, came home, we asked him about it; he denied it at first, he afterwards said he had frequently seen Carter give the shoes to the Shipley's, and that he once about three months ago took two or three pair of shoes and gave them Shipleys.</p>

               <p>Mr. PAGE.

                  </hi>. I live at Southall, and am a corn-dealer and coal-merchant—I am also agent for the Ruabon Coal Company—the prisoner was in my service as an odd man—he occasionally carried coals out to my customers—on his being paid for them it was his duty to pay the money either to me or to my daughters—I did not receive half-a-crown on 28th October, from Mr. James—the prisoner supplied a sack of coals to Mr. Grace without ray right or authority—they were taken with my horse and cart on Saturday, the 27th—he had no right to take those coals at all—if he was paid for them it was his duty to pay that money back to me—I have not received any money for them; I am quite sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again that day? - I did not; my mistress was out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that shilling that he gave you? - I laid it down very curiously in the till, and I wrapped it up in a bit of paper till she came in. About the 3d of September the prisoner came in again, between three and four or four and five, I cannot positively say, and asked for a glass of Hollands, and he gave me a shilling; it was a plain one; I refused it because I thought it was a bad one, and he gave me another, which was a crooked one, and that I gave change for; I have got it here; I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the first shilling? - I gave it him back.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after that? - The woman came in as usual about five minutes afterwards; my master came out to me about the time the woman came in, and he went after the prisoner immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. On the 3d of September the prisoner gave you a plain one? - He did; I thought it was a bad one.</p>

I followed him, took him, and charged a constable with him; I see him at the corner of Paternoster-row; there I see him and collared him, and ordered a corman to follow me. I asked him if there was not a lady waiting for him at that house? he said he knew no lady; and when he was brought back they did not know one another at all.

               <p>Q. You produce three shillings; where did you get them from? - From the bar maid. We had suspicion of some utterers of bad money using the house, from the vast quantity of bad silver that kept creeping into the till.</p>

               <p>I was present when Mr. French took the prisoner by the collar; I am servant to Mr. Batterworth, on Holborn-bridge. The prisoner was leaning on the post, by the corner of Paternoster-row; there was another with me. Mr. French comes up and says, I want you two to assist me to take a thief; Ithought he was only joking, but I see him pass by, and seize the prisoner by the collar, and led him towards his own house; and as the prisoner was going, he put his right hand into his right hand breeches pocket, and he threw away a quantity of silver into the kennel. I kept my eye on it, and went to it immediately, and kneeled down, and picked up a shilling, which here it is. One of Mr. French's servants put his hand into the water, and he found two shillings; that shilling I picked up I marked, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You always said they were shillings that he threw out of his hands? - It was white, and it appeared to me to be silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the justice that the prisoner threw away silver? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say before the magistrate that you see the prisoner throw away something, but what it was you could not tell? - Please your Worship I do not recollect it.</p>

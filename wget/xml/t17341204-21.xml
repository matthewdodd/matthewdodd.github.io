The Prisoner threw the Drink about the House and dropt some of the Money. There was a Guinea and a half that I saw. John, says I, take care of your Money. Ay, says he, for if I lose it I must work it out. The Boy went out, and I suppose went to the Woman that had lost the Money, for she came with a Constable and charged the Prisoner. She owned the Bag, and asked him how he came by it. He said then that he found it in Mr. Woolaston's Entry where he had been at work; but when he was carry'd before the Justice he said he found it in a Dung-Cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 35, Blackfriars-road, in the parish of Christchurch. On 14th Feb. I was awoke about three or half-past three o'clock in the morning by a noise as of people breaking into the house—I dressed myself, went down stairs, and called my young man, and on going down stairs I heard the noise of people leaving the house—I found the panels of the door leading to the kitchen broken—I also found the kitchen-shutters had been broken, the iron bar taken down, and the window open—I afterwards saw both the prisoners in custody at the station—I picked up I this screw-driver on the kitchen stairs—I have since seen the spoons, and can swear to them—one of them has my initials on it—they were in daily use.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Hemming. I put up the kitchen-shutters overnight on 13th Feb., and made all fast at half-past eight o'clock, and fastened the kitchen-door a little after 12—I was the last person that left the kitchen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 120). Early in the morning of 14th Feb. I was in Collingwood-street, Blackfriars-road, and heard some one on the roof of Mr. Hemming's back kitchen—I saw Williams come in a direction from there to some boards where I was standing—I laid hold of his collar—I sprang my rattle, and called for a light, which was brought by another constable—I then got over the fence, and found both the prisoners in a shed in the adjoining premises—Williams had no shoes on—he asked me to allow him to find them—he got them from near the boards where he was going to make his escape—they were then taken to the station—I found some pieces of the panel of the kitchen-door by the boards, and a lucifer-box on the kitchen-table—on searching Williams at the station he had some matches in his pocket—I saw some marks on the panel of the door which corresponded with the screw-driver produced.</p>

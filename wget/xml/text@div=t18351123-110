                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Cox, a butcher, of Copenhagen-street. On the 12th of November, the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to the shop—he asked for a piece of salt beef—I said there was none in the shop; would any thing else do—he said he would rather have a bit of salt beef—I went into the cellar for it; and when I came up, he was gone—two steels were afterwards missed from the shop; one was my hus<lb></lb>band's and one the foreman's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the foreman. I missed my steel when I came back from the slaughter-house—I had hung it on the knuckle of a sheep, in the shop, the night before—while was in the slaughter-house, the prisoner came to me, and offered to sell me a <hi rend="italic">sideing</hi>-knife—I said I did not like to buy things so—he said he was a broken-down butcher, and was selling off his things, to buy a dog and a cart—I bought the knife of him for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I came home, my master said he could not find his steel—I said he might use mine, but my own steel could not be found; and I then found it was my own knife, which I had bought of the prisoner.</p>

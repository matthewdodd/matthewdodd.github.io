                  </hi> I live at 18, Duke-street, Portland-place, and let lodgings there—just upon 1 o'clock in the morning of 2d November, I went to bed—I had previously seen the door quite safe—when going to bed I heard a key put into the door; the door was very quietly opened, and some one went stealthily along the passage, passed through the back door to the yard, and crossed the yard to the closet; opened that door, making a creaking noise; they then came out across the yard, and then returned to the closet, and shut the door—I listened some time—I thought it was a lodger—after waiting some time I thought it strange and went out to see who it was—I called out, "Who is there?"—a very gruff voice said, "Jack "—I said, "Who is Jack? what is your name?"—he said, "Jack"—that was all I could get—I tried to pull the door open but resistance was made inside—I made two or three pulls and at last I got it open, and then I saw the prisoner standing in a crouching position as if he were going to pounce upon anybody—I asked him what he wanted there—I dragged him out, sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—I hold him till the constable came—I saw the constable search him, and take from him a bag with some keys—the prisoner dropped a key on the mat—I saw that key tried, and found that it opened the door—I know nothing of the prisoner—nothing was taken.</p>

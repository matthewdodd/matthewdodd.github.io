On the 30th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went out and locked the house up - one of the windows might have been left open to the air in. I returned about five, and found the neighbours round the house. A window was open, and also a door which had been unlocked inside - the house stands alone. I missed this property, which was all safe when I went out. Different articles in the house were moved and had marks of sooty fingers.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. On the day of the robbery I met the prisoner, who was dressed as a chimney-sweeper. I saw him look over the bank of a field opposite the prosecutor's house - he said,</p>
               <p>"I will get it now if I can." I went to see what it was. He went to the garden door and knocked at the front door - two other sweeps were with him. He asked me if I belonged to the house? I said No. He then said,</p>
               <p>"What are you looking at?" I went and told my mother. I saw him brought out of the house in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I live next door but one to Milburn. On the 30th of June I was cleaning the first-floor window; my father was passing, and said he believed some one was breaking into Milburn's house. I went, and found the garden-gate broken open - I also saw a window open. My father being lame, told me to get in at the window - I got in, and he stood outside. I saw the house had been rifled, and searched two rooms. I thought I heard a noise in the third room, went in, and heard a noise in the chimney. I called my father; he went to see that the person did not get out at the top. I put my hands up, laid hold of his leg, and pulled him down - it was the prisoner - I brought him out to my father through a door, which was open - he was secured. The drawers were open, and sooty marks on the linen.</p>

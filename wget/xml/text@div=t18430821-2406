                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Anderson, and live in Old-street. My husband is an engineer—I carry on a lace and fancy business. I engaged the prisoner on the 29th of April, 1842, to sell my goods—when he received the money he was to bring it to me—I was to allow him 7 1/2 per cent. on the money he brought in—among other customers, he mentioned to me the name of a Mr. Jay, of Regent-street—he had goods from me at va<lb></lb>rious times, which he said were for Mr. Jay—in the beginning of Sept. he said that Mr. Jay wanted credit—his goods had been sold for cash before—I consented to let him have three months' credit—there were more goods than usual went to Mr. Jay at the beginning of this year, but I did not get the money that I expected, and I told the prisoner I would go to Mr. Jay—he said he would rather I should go, as he had asked so repeatedly for the money, and Mr. Jay had made so many excuses, that he could not pay it, that it was very irksome to him to ask any more for it—my solicitor wrote first to Mr. Jay, and then in June I applied to Mr. Jay—on that day the pri<lb></lb>soner came, and I asked if he had brought any money from Mr. Jay—he said, No, Mr. Jay was going into the country, where he had some houses, and he should receive the rent for them, and he was to go on Monday for the money—I saw no more of the prisoner till he was taken into custody—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Jay, of Regent-street—we had bugle goods from the prisoner from time to time—I never heard of Mrs. Anderson—on the 12th of January I paid the prisoner 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for these goods by a check—on the 9th of February I paid him 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 10th, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not in June make any application to me for money—I did not tell him I was going into the country where I had some houses, and I would endeavour to get some money—he always had his money—at first we used to pay him every time, and then we took more, and took a monthly account—he had his money every time he called for it.</p>

               <p>"Madam, I am very sorry that I have not been able to let you have any money these last few days, and the more so as the whole of the goods I have had of you for the last six or seven months were for a shop I have taken on my own account, in which I have lost so much money that I have been obliged to give it up a fortnight since. The whole of the money I have paid you during that time was what I bad taken in the shop—I have frequently been obliged to sell the goods at considerably less than cash price, on purpose to get some money for you, hoping to be able to keep it up till the latter end of next month, when I shall have some money, as I am then going to be married to a young lady at Gravesend, who will be of age then, and I shall have some property to receive, &amp;c."</p>

T." on this one, and here is a fault in this one—these boards have worm-holes in them, and are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this type is just what we missed from our lot, and is the same sort we have—here are two different sorts mixed together—I do not suppose that two printers in London have the same type.</p>

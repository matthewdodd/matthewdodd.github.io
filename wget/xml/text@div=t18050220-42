Yes, I examined them on Monday, and found one opened, I suppose for the use of the horses, the other remained untied; the foreman marked the sack on the Tuesday following, by my desire, in my presence; the other sack was decreased, but it should have been consumed by the horses on Friday evening; I directed the foreman to watch after the whole of the men were gone, and on Saturday I ordered the prisoner into custody.</p>

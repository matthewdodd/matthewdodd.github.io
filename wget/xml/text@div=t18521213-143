                  </hi>. I am foreman of the gravel-pits on the turnpike road at Leyton. On 20th Nov., at a quarter past 4 o'clock, I locked up six shovels and four picks—I went on 22nd, at 7 o'clock in the morning—the locks were broken off, and I missed two short shovels—I found them the same day at a pawnbroker's, at Stratford.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Bressy, a pawnbroker, at Stratford. On Saturday, 20th Nov., a person brought two shovels—I took them in pawn, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave them to the last witness—I believe the prisoner is the man who brought them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you came to the shop with the witness, did not you say you could not swear to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said the only doubt I had was, I had seen other men that night; but every time I have seen you since, confirms me in the opinion that you are the man—I told Mr. Franks that I had no doubt that you were the man; that I had seen several men that Saturday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185212130087"></xptr>
               <p>night, but that was the man I could fix on as the man that pawned the shovels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not state it was at 6 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stated so at first, but I came to recollect after that it could not be later than twenty minutes past 5 o'clock—I said it could not be later than half past 5 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I said I had a witness to prove where I was at 6 o'clock, at half past 5 o'clock, and at 5 o'clock, and did you not then state it was 5 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that it might have been a quarter past; but it must be between that and twenty minutes—I remember the lads were down at tea at the time, and it could not have been more than from twenty minutes to half past 5 o'clock—I go down first to tea, but on Saturday we have tea a quarter of an hour before 5 o'clock to get it all over by half past 5 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 189). I took the prisoner on 25th Nov., I told him what for, he said he knew nothing about it, he had not been at Stratford that afternoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">WM. RENNETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you give him in custody on Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not consider that I had a right, because the pawnbroker would not state that he was the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">W. J. LAW</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Rennett coming with the pri<lb></lb>soner to you on the Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said the prisoner was to all appear<lb></lb>ance the man—I had no doubt about it, but he had not precisely the same dress that he had on Saturday—there was another man pawned one shovel about the same time, but that man has since redeemed it—I do not remember that any man but that man and the prisoner pawned shovels that night—I had some doubt about the prisoner on Monday, on account of his dress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> At 5 o'clock I was at work above a quarter of a mile from this shed where the tools were; I had to come by the shed to come home; I asked my child how long her mother had been gone to Strat<lb></lb>ford; she said half an hour; I said, "I will go and get a pint of beer;" I went and stopped till half past 6 o'clock; I then went home from the Plough and Harrow; I was not near Stratford the whole night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">HADDINGTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you search the prisoner, or his house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know whether he had any duplicate; but he was aware of it, and he would have destroyed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">LAW</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the man dressed on the Saturday evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had a short smock frock on, and an old coat over it—on the Monday he was dressed as he is now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM JOLLY</hi>. I am a labouring man, and live at Harrow-green, Ley<lb></lb>tonstone. The prisoner lives within ten or a dozen houses of me—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 20th Nov., he was at work with me on the road, about four or five hundred yards from the shed where the shovels were—we both left work at 5 o'clock that evening; we went together, I to my home, and he to his—I turned to the left, and he went straight on—I live new him, but there is a wide green parts us—I had to go four or five hundred yards; he had to go about one hundred yards further than me down the Stratford-road—we had been at work near the Bell, at Leytonstone—I saw him again about half an hour afterwards at the Thatched House at Holloway-down, about half a mile from where he lives, and about a mile from Stratford—he was there with me from half past 5 till ten minutes past 6 o'clock—we then returned home together, and I saw him no more till Monday—I received my wages about half past 8 o'clock on Friday morning, and he received his wages—he had been working, only part of the week—the road where I parted from him</p>

               <p>would not take him near the shed—that stands fifty or sixty yards from the road—we leave off work at dark—I should say the Thatched House is quite a mile from Stratford—it was half past 5 o'clock when I went into the Thatched House—I saw the clock—I had not agreed to meet him there; I was going to Stratford to meet my wife, and he asked me to drink—I went in and stopped a few minutes, and then, as I thought my wife was gone home without me, I returned home—the place where we were working is a mile and a half or rather more from Stratford—a man must walk very quick to get from where I left the prisoner to Stratford, and back to the Thatched House in half an hour; I did not ask him where he had spent that half hour.</p>

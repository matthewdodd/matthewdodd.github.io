The second count is framed on the Bailee Act, and turns upon a rather different view of the facts, viz., that it was the duty of the prisoner, supposing the cheque not to be met, to return the warrants to Messrs. Hubbard, the unpaid vendors, he being their bailee for that purpose.</hi>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">I very much doubt whether you can make anything of that—the bailee in the Act of Parliament, must mean a real actual bailee, and not a person who becomes bailee by reason of a supposed custom, although you may for certain purposes call him bailee. I do not think the notion of it being hit duty to return the warrants would make him a bailee. It is of extreme importance that the transactions of commerce, if they are real transactions, should not be subse-quently turned into larceny</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON CHANNELL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">on the point</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">My brother Channell agrees with me most distinctly upon this point, that the vendor had a right to insist upon cash, he was not bound to take cash, but taking a crossed cheque it was entirely his own fault that time was given to the prisoner to enable him to do what he has done, and I think it would have been the same thing supposing instead of giving a crossed cheque he had given a bill payable two days after-wards; in reality a crossed cheque is a cheque payable the next day, the taking of that crossed cheque was the vendors' own faulty and I think he cannot turn it into a stealing; he has taken that which he was not bound to take, he hat voluntarily altered the contract and given a credit to the prisoner which he was not bound to give. I don't think I can consider that a felony or leave a case of that sort to the Jury. I want as distinctly as I can to let this be understood, that if a person who is entitled to cash, instead of that takes an instrument which necessarily postpones the payment, he by his own act gives the party a control over the property which he would not have had if he had held to the bargain as he had a right to do; he in fact by so doing gives up both property and possession. My brother Channell very much agrees with me in the doctrine that you ought as little as possible to introduce indictments for felony or foist pretences into what are really and truly matters of sale and purchase. If this man was in the habit of buying and selling and trading in this way, as hat been opened, although he may become a fraudulent trader, you cannot suddenly make him a felon; for instance, if a man is dealing in plated articles, and he represents an article to be of one quality and it turns out to be of another, it would be monstrous to say that that man is to be indicted for obtaining either money or goods under false pretences—where a shop is actually opened for the express purpose of carrying on matters of that sort or where a man goes on Change for the first time expressly to do some act of that kind, then I think a different consideration might obtain, although it would not then of necessity be 6 felony. It seems to me that the answer to this charge of stealing is this, that it is all your own fault; you (the prosecutors) take an instrument which gives to the prisoner a credit which you were not bound to give, and giving him that credit he had lawfully during that time the possession and the right of property on account of the sale. I think the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.</hi>

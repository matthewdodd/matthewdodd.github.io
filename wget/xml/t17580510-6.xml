               <p>William More. On the 30th of April last I lost a guinea and a shilling out of my box, upon inquiry I found the prisoner had changed a guinea in Hedge-lane. I went to the woman named Nugent, she said it was a little man that brought it and she should know him again. I took up the prisoner having a suspicion of him, and he confessed that he took the guinea out of my box.</p>

            . Two men came into my house and had some beer, they asked me to change a guinea, I changed it, the day following the prosecutor and another man came and asked me if I had changed a guinea the day before, I said I had, and shewed them seven guineas all I had, they took one and said that was it, and gave me another for it. I can't say the prisoner was one of them.</p>

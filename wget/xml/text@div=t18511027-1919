                  </hi>. I am groom to a gentleman at Norwich. On 2nd Oct. I had been up to London to Grosvenor-square, and on that night, about 10 o'clock, I was going along the Strand, where I saw a theatre open and went in—I was afterwards making my way towards Shored itch Station, and near the Post-office I met the prisoners, and asked them the way—I had never been in London before—it was then about 12—they said they would show me the way, and we all three went into a passage close by—while there, Brown put her band into my trowsers-pocket and took out my money, which was one sovereign, two shillings, a sixpence, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece—Prosser was standing close by, and Brown handed her something, saying, "Here is the key," or "Take the key"—my pocket was turned half out—they then wanted me to go into a house and treat them, and I went with them, because I wanted to detain them till I could see an officer—we came out of the public-house again, and they went away into a dark yard—I told them to come back again, and I would take them into a nice house where I would treat them—I then saw an officer, and gave them in charge.</p>

On 3rd Oct, about half-past 2 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoners together at the corner of Type-street, Chiswell-street—the prosecutor said he should give Brown into custody for robbing and the other for receiving—the prisoners said they had not robbed him—I took them to Moor-lane station.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I was in Hanway-street, Oxford-street, at ten minutes before eight o'clock in the morning of the 12th of June - I saw the prisoner going towards Tottenham-court-road - he had a drab coat swung on his shoulder - I saw there was something heavy in it - I stopped him, and it was this piece of linen - I gave him to the policeman - he said he gave 2l. 10s. for it, to a man in Covent-garden.</p>

             (police-constable E 100). I received the prisoner in charge - I found on him a half-sovereign, and 3s. 2Â½d. - he refused to give his address; but said he bought the cloth, in Covent-garden market, of a hawker, at 2s. a yard - we inquired and found the owner.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at No. 11, Webb-square, Shoreditch. I was in Covent-garden market, and saw the prisoner purchase a piece of cloth very much like this - I was coming up, and heard the pedlar or hawker say, "Here take it with you" - the prisoner was coming away; he returned and took it, and paid 2l. 10s. for it - this was soon after seven o'clock on the morning of the 12th of June.</p>

I am kept as a labourer to go out with goods; my master is Mr. Turner, of No. 11, Webb-square - he works in the willow bonnet trade - I assist in the work - I go to work at all times; sometimes at three o'clock in the morning, sometimes at five or six - I sometimes go through Covent-garden to go to Hammersmith, and call on the customers - this was on a Thursday morning - I have known the prisoner all his life - I worked for his father - I did not meet him that morning by appointment - he is a <rs id="t18340703-181-deflabel1011" type="occupation">smith</rs>

               <p>MR. CRISP. I gave 3s. a yard for this linen - the piece is worth 3l. 15s.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. After taking Eliza Wright into custody, I went up stairs to search her box, in the presence of Mrs. Borras—I found this letter in it, and several other letters—in conse<lb></lb>quence of which, I went to Trafalgar-street, Walworth-road, and found the prisoner there in bed, about twelve o'clock at night—his mother showed</p>

               <p>me to his bed-room—I asked him if he knew Eliza Wright, who lived servant to Mr. Borras, a stationer, at Newington—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you any of Mr. Borras's property here, has she brought any?"—he said "No "—I told him to get up, for I should take him into custody, and search his room—when he got up, I said, "I have some letters in my pocket, which I found in her box"—he said, "Well, I was only carrying on courtship with her, and was going to get married to her"—I showed him the letters, and he said they were his handwriting, and she had supplied him with the paper to write them on, and she was always bothering him to write to her—I was going to search his box—he said, "You will find all right here"—at the bottom of his box I found this satin tinted note-paper concealed under the other things—I saw Mrs. Borras take down two pictures from the room—I searched the cupboard, and found a package sealed up in the cupboard, and in that was a toilet-bottle, a pair of pumps, a needle<lb></lb>case, a small pocket-book, a pen-case, a silver toothpick and case, a card<lb></lb>case, another pocket-book, two books, and a shell—I should think them worth more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were sealed up with wax, in brown paper.</p>

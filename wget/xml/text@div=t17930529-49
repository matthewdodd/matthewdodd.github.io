            , the person that I was standing with told me my room door was broke open; I told him how could that be when I had locked the door and was sitting on the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you locked the door? - I had, and was fitting on the key and when I got up, and went and looked at the door I saw this man that stands now at the bar, I found my door quite wide open, the place where the lock goes in was a little thrust, but a very trifling, and the lock half went back, the prisoner was standing just at the opening of the door, as if standing to keep it open within the room, I asked him what he wanted and then he dropped the petticoat from his hand, and told me he wanted Mrs. Wilson, and asked is there such a person in your house? I told him no; do you know such a person? no; I catched hold of him by the collar, and told him he was a liar, he wanted my clothes; when I had him by the collar I fell down the stairs, whether he tripped me up, or I slipped down, I cannot say, but here is a piece of pocket and a piece of the flap of his coat which I tore off; then, sir, when the pocket tore off and the piece of the coat, he ran away from me; I got up in a moment and ran after him, I went across the way after him and across the Church-yard, and I lost sight of him by going up a little court, up which I did not follow him for I did not know but what there was a thoroughfare in it; I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man, it was a dimity petticoat that he had hold of.</p>
               <p>Q. I see there are other articles in the indictment; what have you to say about them? - They were all dirty linen left by one corner of the bed, I had left them not above ten minutes before I found the prisoner, and when I returned and went into the room I found them off, on the ground in the middle of the room, rather behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were removed? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what may be the value of the two cotton gowns? - I think about thirty shillings, the linen shift about five shillings it was new, it was never worn, the dimity waistcoat about eight shillings, the linen apron two shillings, the muslin handkerchief eighteen-pence, the cloth waistcoat two shillings, and the linen shirt four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of these things are old? - They were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gimp spinner, in the prisoner's employment. On Monday, 7th Feb., he sent for me, and I went to him at No. 5, Mare Street, Bethnal Green Road—when I got into the warehouse, he said that he had two parcels which he wished to get rid of for a few weeks, and wanted me to take them away—I asked him where to; he said, anywhere, so long as I took them out of his house for a few weeks—he showed me the outside of the parcel; it was wrapped in a thick sack—I never saw the inside—I did not take them away then, because it was Sunday, and I would not be seen to carry a parcel through the streets on any account on Sunday—he asked me to have a cup of tea with him, and I did so—he asked me whether I would come soon on Monday morning and take them out of the house before any one came on the premises; I made no reply—I went at 8 o'clock, being my usual time to go to work, and as soon as the door was open, my master, who was in bed, called out, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I wish you would take <hi rend="italic">them</hi> parcels out of the house as quick as possible"—his wife, who opened the door to me, told roe to come into the room they call the warehouse, and gave me a bag to put them in—I held it, and she put the two parcels in—they were the same two parcels I had seen in the warehouse—he told me he had weighed them—I did not know where to take them, so I took them to my own house for safety, as he wanted them returned in a few weeks in the same state as I took them away—on the Friday following, I was at his premises between 8 and 9 o'clock at night, he came out of his shed, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom, Tom</hi>, I want you"—I went into the warehouse, and he ordered me to take a half bag of furniture patterns out of his house immediately—I understood him to say that Mr. Walmsley would send somebody to search his premises; he said that in the presence of Mr. Gardner, his partner—he told me, if I saw any one watching me carrying them, I was to dodge them from one corner to another—I told him if anyoue stopped me carrying them I should be locked up; he replied, "Never mind, I will get you off"—I took the patterns to my sister's at first—he told me when I had got rid of them to come and tell him where I had taken them—I went and told him I had taken these patterns to my sister's, being the nearest place; and he ordered me to take them to my own place for safety, and I did so—in a few days, he ordered me to bring the patterns home—I did so, accord<lb></lb>ing to his orders, leaving the two parcels at my house—I took them to my sister's on the Thursday, and removed them to his house on the Monday fol<lb></lb>lowing—afew days afterwards, I asked him whether I should bring the two parcels home; he replied, "No, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>; I want you to let them remain at your place a little longer, as I do not know whether Mr. Walmsley will send some one to search my place"—he told me that after everything was <hi rend="italic">dropped</hi>, he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk and trimming manufacturer, of No. 12, King Street, Cheapside. I have bought goods of the prisoner for many years—Ihave examined this silk, it is worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have missed such silk from my stock—I identify this as mine from the quality and general appear<lb></lb>ance, and likewise by the thread by which it is tied by the dyer—I can speak confidently to about one half of this, and the rest is similar to what I use, and which I buy in town—the colour of one sort is a bad, thick, muddy dye, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050102"></xptr>
               <p>I recognized it directly—Hicks came to me on the 25th and showed me these two bundles of silk—I gave him some directions, and communicated with the police—I never sold silk in my life in this state; I sell thrown silk, but not dyed silk—the first thing the prisoner said was, that he had bought it, and had got an invoice at home, and could show it to us, if we would go down with him, but he said he wished to have a private interview—I and he went into a room up stairs, and I asked him to tell me where he got the silk from, and if he would, I would take no farther proceedings, as I should be quite satisfied—he asked me not to expose the affair—I will not be certain whether that was before I said that I would not take proceedings if he told me some<lb></lb>thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How is it you are able to say that these particular bundles of silk are yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am confident they are mine from the dye, and from the dyers' thread and mark by which he recognizes the names of the various makers who he dyes for; it is a three-cord cotton you will find it tied with—I do not know any other dyer who uses that—my dyers dye for other people, and they may supply goods for other people—this is not a very common colour, and I have missed that particular shade of colour; the dyer that did that particular colour does not dye for any other individual; it is the same with other colours—a score of people may have silk like this, but not tied up as this is with the same cord—the dyer might not dye some for another person at the same time—this thread shows that this was dyed for me; I do not say that no other dyer uses it, but you will find a knot in the middle of the thread (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—for one individual they put one knot, for another two, for another three—I do not say that mine always comes with one knot, but there is one knot on the string—I have known the prisoner a great many years, and never suspected him in the least—this silk must be wound on bobbins to be used.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packer and calenderer, in partnership with Mr. Pellatt. This cheque belonged to an estate to which I was assignee—the prisoner was employed in our warehouse for about two years—I got this cheque from Mr. Brand, clerk to Messrs. Masterman—it was drawn by me on Messrs. Masterman and Co., but had never been made use of—it was filled up in mistake, and left in a drawer in, my iron safe, always un<lb></lb>der lock and key—I suppose I lost it from there about the 22nd of July—in consequence of having lost it, and seeing it again, an officer was sent for, and we went and searched the prisoner's lodgings—a key was found in his pocket, which would open a desk in which the key of the iron safe was kept—but that would not open the drawer in which this cheque was—that must have been picked—how the cheque was taken from that drawer I cannot tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers in the banking-house of Messrs. Masterman, in Nicholas-lane. On the 18th of July, about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner brought this cheque to me, dated the 6th of July, 1833—being dated so long back, I called on Mr. Watts, and when the prisoner came again I said to him, "You did not call again about that cheque"—he said, "No, it was a mistake," and I gave him in custody—this is the cheque—I am sore he is the person who brought it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When he called again did he not say it was a wrong cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I understood him it was a mistake—this is my deposi<lb></lb>tion—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I dare say he did say it was a wrong cheque, but I attached the same meaning to that as a mistake—I asked him if he had spoken to Mr. Watts, and he told me had not.</p>

               <p>I am the watchman. In the morning of the 27th of March, at three o'clock, I had great reason to suspect that some one was in the cellar by a little dog laying, which I had been informed, had been seen on other suspicious occasions; I waited about half an hour, and saw the prisoner come out of the cellar, I could not seize him till he had crossed the way, when I did, being at the first about six yards distant: I brought him back to the cellar window, which I found open, I immediately knocked at the door, and the landlady came down; I immediately took the prisoner to the watch-house, and delivered him up to a constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Whitewood. You did not see this cellar window fastened that night? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see it was fast? - I heard my husband fasten and bolt it.</p>

               <p>I was not in the place, and was the opposite side of the way near Red Lion-square; I was examined and stripped myself, and nothing was found upon me.</p>

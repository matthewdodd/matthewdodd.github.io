                  </hi>. I am shopman to George Frederick Lambert, pawnbroker, Old-street, St. Luke's. At half-past ten o'clock, on the night of the 24th of Feb., I was at the shop door—we had a stand there, on which we keep goods for sale—I heard a noise at one of the stalls—I went round, and saw the prisoner run from the shutters by which the stand is inclosed, to a van—I hallooed out, and he ran from the van—I laid hold of him directly he came from under the van—he dropped the mortice chisel, and pulled some putty knives and a bevel out of his pocket, and held them in his hand—I took them from him—I asked what he did there—he said, "What do you want?"—I picked them up—I had seen them on the stand about a quarter of an hour before—they are my master's.</p>

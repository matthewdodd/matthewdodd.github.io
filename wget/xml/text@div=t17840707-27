               <p>I was informed by my niece that I was robbed on the 19th of June, about six in the morning, then I went into the back kitchen, and missed the watch and case from the shelf, chain, seal, and key, I was informed that a young woman came out of my garden in a green petticoat, flowered bedgown, and a black hat, I made enquiry, I had information that she was gone towards London, and I went on the road and overtook the prisoner, I am quite positive of her, I took her into custody, and took the watch out of her lap; when I stopped her I told her she had robbed me of my property; she made answer and said, for God's sake, do not hurt me, for when I took it away I did not know what to do with it, the devil was so busy with me; I told her I was very sorry for her.</p>
               <p>Were these things hid in her lap? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you kept these things ever since? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar before? - I saw her at my uncle's back yard in the morning of the 19th of June, about six, she had an old hat on, and a green petticoat, and a light linen bedgown.</p>
               <p>Was it light? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure it was the prisoner? - Yes, I am very sure of it, for she stood staring up at the window a great while at me.</p>
               <p>Where was you at that time? - I was in my back room.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I saw the prosecutor the over night, I was standing in the street, he asked me what I stood there for, I said I was looking for work; says he, Marm, that is a very odd place to look for work; says he, you had better come along home with me, I will give you your supper, and you shall have a bed for nothing; he then asked me to sit up all night, I desired him to let me sit quiet, he began wrangling with me, and he said I have nothing to give you, but you shall stop till I give you money; the next morning he told me his wife was dead, and he had a little girl which was in bed (he is a shoe-maker) says he, if I go out of my shop before my little girl comes down, for God's sake take care she does not see you, and I went out about six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there any truth in this part of the story? - I never saw her till I took her with the property upon her, I never saw her in the days of my life upon the oath that I have taken.</p>

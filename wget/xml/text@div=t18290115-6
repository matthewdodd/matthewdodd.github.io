I have known the prisoner many years; about the 3d or 4th of November he called on me, and asked if I could tell him of a house and shop to let in the general line; I told him I thought he did not want a shop as he had before called on me in a similar way in consequence of an advertisment - he accounted for his not coming forward before about a shop, on account of his father's death; I said I had a shop to dispose of - he asked the terms; I gave him the address, he went and looked at it, and returned to me the same day, saying, he thought it just the thing he was in want of; I mentioned 40l. as the price of the shop and fixtures - he then proposed to give a bill of exchange for that amount, which I objected to in the first instance; he said the bill was as good as money - that his cousin, who was to be the acceptor, was a very respectable merchant, residing in the City, in Cateaton-street, and said his name was

             the bill, and he took it away, and brought it back with an acceptance on it; I gave him the balance, which was 10l. - this is the bill (looking at it), this acceptance was on it when he brought it back - I gave him 10l. in cash, and gave him possession of the premises a few days after, according to agreement: when he brought the bill back, he said, "Here is the bill;" I said, "Is it accepted? you are quite sure it is your cousin's acceptance, the party who you took me to see on Saturday in Cateaton-street?" - he said it was. I paid the bill away to William Hall of Judd-street a few days before it was due- it was only drawn at one month; I have endorsed it, and the prisoner also endorsed it - I wrote his name, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150007"></xptr>his request, as he could not see to write, and he made a mark: I believe he is not accustomed to write, but puts his mark. The bill became due on the 11th of December, and on that morning Cotterell came to me with a message; I took him with me to Mr. Hall, and afterwards went with Cotterell and Hall's son in search of the prisoner - he came to us at a public-house; we were desired just to step in there and he would come to us with the money; he came up to me and said, "Have you got the bill?" I said, "I have not, I paid it to Mr. Hall, and he has sent his son with the bill;" he said, "I have not the money at the present moment, but I shall have it in half an hour - I am going to receive 94l." I told him he had better speak to Hall's son, who had got the bill, and I believe he told him he would come down in half an hour and take it up - that he had got to go as far as Covent-garden for the money; I went to Hall again about one or two o'clock, and found it was not taken up - it was returned to me, and I presented it at

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you since got possession of your premises? A.

               <p>Q. Do not you know that he has been blind from his birth? A. He could see the money when he took it off my counter; he is near-sighted, but not blind - he is not led about. I wrote the direction on the bill, as well as the body; I received it from Hall on the 11th, when it was due, and gave it to the officer at Hatton-garden, it was given up to me yesterday. The prisoner was apprehended about a week after it became due - he lived in the house from the time I gave him possession till he was taken; he told me it was an understanding between him and his cousin, that if he could get any business for that amount, he would give him his acceptance: I only went to his cousin's once before the bill was drawn - I did not entertain any suspicion when I asked if it were his cousin's acceptance; I had inquired and considered Mr. Hunter's acceptance good.</p>

            . I have a warehouse in Cateaton-street - my father's sister married the prisoner's father; she died childless, and there was a second marriage- I have known the prisoner many years; the acceptance on this bill is not my hand-writing - I never authorized him to accept it in my name, When Morley presented the bill, I really was so staggered, I hardly knew what I said; I saw the embarrassing situation I was in, and declined giving any answer - I had told the prisoner if I saw he had an opportunity of setting up in the world, I might assist him, and I should have assisted him; I had not told him if he took any premises I would accept for the amount - I have told him at various times I would help him; I, in conjunction with others, was to assist him - I did not send any message to Morley that I was sorry I was not in the way - I did not know he had called.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has the prisoner been blind from his birth? A. He is not blind; he can neither read nor write: he can just grope about the street - he has not been educated, except in music; he was under Mr. Parkes, a blind musician: he has but one eye - any one would think him blind; he bore a good character - I have assisted him materially at times: he knows nothing at all about negociating bills - he may know what a bill of exchange is; I should not think he knew of three days' grace being given on bills; I believe he expected my assistance if he could get a shop - he formerly had to draw a bill, and was so ignorant I was obliged to draw it for him.</p>

            . I live at No. 112, St. John-street. About the beginning of November the prisoner applied to me to write his name across a bill, as he was blind, or nearly blind - I am sure he said his name; I am confident of it: I asked what I should write - he said, "Accepted,

            ;" (looking at the bill) this is my hand-writing - I have written something for him before: I asked him to put his mark to this bill - he said he would do that in the presence of the person he paid it to; at the same time saying it would not be taken without he put his mark in the presence of the person he gave it to; he left the shop - he said he was a neighbour up above, and would be a customer to me - he was very much obliged to me for my kindness, and wished me a good morning; this was at Hoxton, in Middlesex - I was in the service of my master, who has a shop there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often had you seen him before? A. Only once, about four days before; I did not think this an odd request, as he appeared extremely deficient in sight - I did not doubt his being the person he represented.</p>

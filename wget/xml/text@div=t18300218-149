               <p>THOMAS WEBB. On the 8th of February I was coming off the steps of the <placeName id="t18300218-149-crimeloc836">London tavern</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Did you see your watch go? A. No; it was about ten o'clock at night; there was a good light - I had been at a dinner; we sat down about four o'clock - I was sober - it was the licensed victualler's dinner - there were a great many persons; there were four or five turning off the steps, and the moment I turned, these persons rushed round me, and the watch was taken; I know I had it; as I came along I had my hand on the seals - when the rush was made I recoiled, supposing I was the intruder - the prisoner was secured struggling across the street, and I was then sensible the watch was gone; I followed and secured him; the watch was taken up and lodged in the hands of Mr. Bleadon.</p>

            . I was coming out of the London tavern with the witness - we turned to go to Cornhill; there was a tremendous rush, and the prisoner seized the watch, and took it out; I saw him do it, and seized him; he struggled across the road, but I still held him, and never left him till we got to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say there was a rush, and you seized the prisoner? A. Yes; he darted between the carriages; I was upon him all the time, and seized him in a moment; I swear he is the person.</p>

            . I was coming out of the tavern at ten o'clock in the evening, and was talking to my friend; I saw the prisoner come up to him, and saw his hand, but did not see any thing in it; he ran - I ran, and seized him by the handkerchief; he got his hand up, and said I should throttle him; but I got hold of his handkerchief and his thumb, and he could not get from me - he danced about like an eel, and was most resolute; I am quite positive he is the person - he never escaped.</p>

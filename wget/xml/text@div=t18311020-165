            . I am the wife of Charles Evans - we live in Charlotte-street, Hope-town. On the 12th of September Kindrick brought the cane of work to our house, and the next day he brought the other articles; I was to make him a harness, and get it entered by half-past one o'clock, on the 14th, and he was to come for it - at two or half-past two, I was down stairs, and heard a knock at the door; I went up, and saw the prisoner - he said he had come for his father's work, whose name was Kindrick; I asked him what it was - he said one thousand one hundred, three double, on six lambs, and that the reed had come just before noon, which was the time Kindrick had left it - I got the work, asked him again what it was, and he told me again; it was impossible he could have known the right quantity unless he had been told - he took off his hat, and took a handkerchief out; he said that handkerchief would cover it, and that would do - he went away, and took the work with him; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200065"></xptr>thought it was his father, as he said - I had never seen the prisoner before, but I took such notice of his person that I am sure he is the same; I described him at the Police-station - I saw him again on the Saturday following, and knew him in a moment.</p>

             for a horse and mare, and gave him three guineas to boot, it was the 3d of November, he told me he bought the horse of a gentleman at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Where did you first hear of any suspicion that this horse was stolen? - I met the prosecutor when I was going to Hockley, he challenged the horse, I was surprised to hear it was his property, it was a great loss to me.</p>
               <p>Have you known Smith before? - I knew his friend before, and I knew him about four years back.</p>
               <p>Where did you swap this horse? - At Hockley, the landlord was by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This swap was made publicly? - Yes, the landlord was present, the young man told he was out of place and dealt for himself.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you quite sure that this is your horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any particular marks? - He had a blaze down his face, and four white heels, and he was hurt by the collar in the top of his neck, and he was blind of one eye.</p>
               <p>Court. Then with these blemishes he must be a good horse to be worth ten pounds, was he a cart horse? - Yes, he was worth ten pounds; I am sure it was my horse, I have no doubt of that.</p>

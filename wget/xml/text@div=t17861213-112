               <p>You saw nobody but Mrs. Mason? - No; we knocked at the next door, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130125"></xptr> after we had done so, about a minute or two the door of Mrs. Mason was opened; I rushed into the back yard; I heard somebody was getting over the wall, I could not see whether it was man or woman; I immediately run to the next door, and I heard a woman cry, lord there is a man in the house! I said to the woman, open the door, we are officers; she immediately opened the door, and I went into the yard, and saw the prisoner Stevens; I seized him, there was a large quantity of property spread about the yard; here is the cuff of a gown the same as one that was lost; I found this tea spoon in the yard afterwards, the prisoner said, he would go very quietly with me; as soon as we came out on Saffron-hill, there were near a dozen of men that struck at Weaver; I saw them knock him down, endeavouring to rescue the prisoner from me, but Stevens did not do that himself; after I had secured him, I put him into New Prison, and searched him; I found in his breeches pocket six guineas and a half; in the cuff of his coat I took out a small piece of coin; I said, George, what is this? he said, it was a threepence; I saw it was a fourpence; I went back to the yard again, and found a picklock key, which key I tried at the prosecutor's door when double locked, and it opened it in the presence of the prosecutor; I then went to the house of Mrs. Mason, and searched and found three gowns and the rest of the things I have here; I took her in custody; and brought the things away; I did not know that a person of that description lived there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Mason was examined before the Magistrate? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did she say about Stevens when she was first examined? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember that she said this, that the prisoner Stevens knew nothing about the things that you had found; that she declared on her oath that he was innocent; and that if they should swear to him it would be taking away his life wrongfully? - I do not recollect that; though I would not venture to say she did not; I believe she was up three times; I think she said the first time she did not know how they came there.</p>
               <p>At that time she did not say any thing against him? - No.</p>
               <p>She was brought up a second time? - Yes, the second time she said, that Stevens was one.</p>
               <p>How long had she laid in custody? - Five days.</p>
               <p>The Jew gentleman was already a witness? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What have you to say about this robbery at Mr. Harrison's house of linen and wearing apparel about a gown? - I was going past Hall's, I saw Day; I asked for the old woman; at the same time I asked her if she had any thing to sell; she said, yes, I have silk a gown by commission; I asked the price; she asked me a guinea; at last I bought it for fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130126"></xptr>Was it a new one? - No, not new fashioned.</p>
               <p>Was it worth no more? - No more; I buy it to get something by: I opened the door to go about my business, and an officer stopped me; he asked me, what have you there.</p>
               <p>(The gown deposed to by Mrs. Harrison.)</p>
               <p>Harrison. I have had it about three or four years; I did not buy it new; I gave forty-five shillings for it.</p>
               <p>What may the value of it be now? - It is worth two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much did you give for that? - Fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>And so then they napped you, and swore they would hang you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And I dare say they will fulfil their prophecy by you one day or other.</p>
               <p>(The tea spoon deposed to by Mrs. Harrison.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. It has my mark upon it; I have another that corresponds to it.</p>

               <p>Are you a married woman? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to buy these things? - These things the prisoners Stevens, and Robinson and Andrews, otherwise Anderson, brought into my house on Sunday se'night, in the evening, about eight o'clock; they brought them to me to buy.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in clothes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you usually buy and sell clothes on Sunday? - No, my Lord, I did not buy any before, nor I did not buy these, but I should have bought them if I had not been deterred by the officer; for before I could make the bargain the officers came.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to ask where they got them? - No.</p>
               <p>That would have been a dangerous question I suppose? - I never bought any thing before of them; they have bought things at my shop.</p>
               <p>What sort of a shop do you keep? - A clothes shop, otherwise a sale shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You deal wonderfully in alias's, how many names have you besides Mason? - No, more.</p>
               <p>Have you always told the same story? - I have.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is as true as any thing else you have been saying? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe they were wicked enough, these officers that disturbed you, to take you to the Justice's? - They took me there; I told the Justice as near as I could.</p>
               <p>Then you was examined the second time, and you told him the same story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, the first and second time did not you say that Stevens knew nothing of the matter? - I said no such thing; I never swore any such thing neither on the first or second examination.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. Lucy? - Yes.</p>
               <p> Lucy She said, if Stevens did not bring them there, she did not know how they came? - I did not say that; I did not know Stevens; I said, that the first time that Stevens was in my house, I did not know that he brought the property.</p>
               <p>They did bring it? - I told the Justice that at the first examination.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall lay every word that she says out of the case.</p>

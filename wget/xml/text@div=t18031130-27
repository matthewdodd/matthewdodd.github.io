             sworn. - I am a constable: On the 9th of November I was on duty; I had seen the prisoner for an hour or two, I had seen him make several attempts; I followed him up Ludgate-hill; I saw him follow this young man; he put his hand first to his left and then to his right-hand pocket; I saw him take the book out of the young man's pocket; I took him by the collar, and told him, I had been watching him for two hours before; I took him to Giltspur-street Compter; going to the Alderman, he told me he would give me two guineas to tell the Alderman I picked it off the ground.</p>
               <p>(Produces the book and the two guineas,)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not begin the conversation with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing said by you about being turned up? - A. No; I suppose since last Wednesday I have not had less than twenty of his friends at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - A. Six years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since you were in custody? - A. Any man might be taken up for an innocent affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never turn King's evidence against a prisoner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know - Were you never committed by a Magistrate, and afterwards gave evidence here? - A. Upon my oath never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor at Clerkenwell? - A. Never in no Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been taken up? - A. Yes; I was taken up upon a charge of buying a note.</p>
               <p>Q. A two hundred pound Bank-note? - A. Yes, and you were my Counsel; the Lord Mayor discharged me, knowing it was a wrong thing; that is the only time I ever was in custody in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the prisoner's two guineas? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I know the prisoner, and I know Levy; I saw him when he was taking him from the Compter to Guildhall to be examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you? - A. A publican at Mile-end; as they were going along, Levy said to the prisoner, you may give me what you like, I can do the trick; then we went into a public-house, and had something to drink, I believe a glass of brandy a piece, and I saw some money pass from the prisoner to the constable; I understood he was to give him part then, and part when he got to Guildhall. I have known the prisoner a twelvemonth; he was a pork-butcher in Golden-lane till within these three months; he bears a very honest character.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you? - A. I keep the George, in Pelham-street, Mile-end New Town; I kept the Stationers Arms, in St. John-street, before that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

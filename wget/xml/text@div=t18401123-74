                  </hi>. I live in Saffron-court, Safffron-hill; the prisoner and her husband live in Onslow-street. On the 8th of November I was there—there was a fight between me and her husband—we were both drunk—the prisoner came to his assistance, and scratched my face—I turned round and struck her in the eye, and gave her a black eye—the landlord came up and sent for a policeman; and when he came I put my hand to my face, and found it was bloody, and there was a wound in it—I do not know who gave me that wound—I saw the prisoner strike me in the face, then draw her band back and put it behind her, and the policeman took a knife out of her hand—it was two or three minutes after I gave her the black eye that I found I was wounded—I went to Greville-street Hospital—the surgeon told me to bathe my face in hot water and come to him next day at one o'clock, which I did—he exa<lb></lb>mined the cheek, and the cut was through it—it got well in four or five days—I did not call her any names.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went up to the room—the fight was over then—about a minute and a half after I entered the room I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor in the left cheek, and put her hand be<lb></lb>hind her, and then I saw the blood gush from his cheek—I took this dinner-knife out of her hand—I did not see her take it up—there was a table partly between her and the prosecutor—I saw her stick him with the knife—she struck him back-handed with the point first—she did not appear intoxicated—she had a black eye.</p>

Q.</hi> Did it appear a violent blow that she had received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Her eye was much swollen—I stood close by her when she gave the stab—there was great confusion in the room—the landlord had called me in to take the prosecutor into custody—I had not seized the prosecutor—she struck the blow while I was speaking to him.</p>

I live at 91, Broad-street, Ratcliffe, and am a ste<lb></lb>vedore—about half-past 1 in the morning of 28th July, I was walking through Whitecross-street—I had been to see my wife at the infirmary—she was at the point of death—I saw three men standing by the railway-arch; I passed them on my left, and was immediately seized, and knocked backwards—I sung out for the police; they crashed my lips together, and rifled my pockets—one of the men took 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my right trousers pocket—I begged them to give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back to get the children a bit of bread the next day, but no mercy was shown—the prisoners are two of the men who attacked me—Clift put his hand into my pocket—the third man I could not swear to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140064"></xptr>
               <p>—they ran away in different directions—I started after Clift—a policeman came up, and I pointed Clift out to him—I am quite satisfied the prisoners are the men—I saw Kelley taken immediately afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 135). On the morning of 28th July I was on duty in George-street, Katcliffe, and heard a cry of "Police," and saw Clift running past the end of the court—I said, "You need not run, Clift"—I also saw another roan named Haley there, and two women—I saw the prosecutor at the end of the street—he said, "They have knocked me down, and robbed me"—I said, "Which of them?"—he pointed to Clift, and said, "That is the man who rifled my pockets"—I put my hand on the other one's shoulder, and said, "Did this man do anything?"—he said, "I can't swear to him"—I took Clift in custody—Policeman 303 then came up—I said something to him—he went away, and after the lapse of a few minutes he returned with Kelley, and the prosecutor said, "That is the other man"—they were then taken to the station—on Clift was found 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and on Kelley 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

On this night my attention was attracted by some voices—I went to the place, and saw the last witness holding Clift—I them ran up the street with the prosecutor, and down the Commercial-road—I turned my light on, and saw Kelley sitting on a door<lb></lb>step—he said, "Do you want me?"—the prosecutor came up, and said, "That is one"—I said, "I must do my duty; you will have to go with me to the station."</p>

I asked the policeman if he wanted me; he said, 'Yes, I must do my duty,' and he locked me up." <hi rend="italic">Cliffs statement</hi>: "I was drinking last Friday evening in Nash's public-house; after coming out of that I went into another public-house, and then to George-court—I heard a disturbance, and saw some men running down; I stepped out of their way, and the policeman came down and took me in charge. The policeman then asked the prosecutor if I had done anything; he said I had rifled his pockets, and then said I had put my band on his mouth, and he took me to the station."</p>

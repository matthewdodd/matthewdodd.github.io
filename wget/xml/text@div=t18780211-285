                  </hi>. I am a master mariner of the brig Ward—on 23rd January the prisoner was engaged as seaman—I instructed the mate what to do and left the ship—I afterwards asked the prisoner what was the matter with him—he said "Nothing"—I called the mate to explain—the mate said the prisoner would not work—that was in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner said "You a b—flaming liar"—the mate was going towards him, and I went towards the mate—the prisoner stabbed me on the hand, and was coming a second time, when the mate seized him and took this pricker from him, which is used for splicing small ropes.</p>

I am mate of the Ward—I gave the prisoner orders to scrape the mast-head—it was rainy, windy, and showery about 3.30, but before the shower came on the men came below—the prisoner said it was cold—he did not disobey me, but it took him till 11 o'clock to get there, and he was down again at 11. 30—the master returned later in the day and I told him about it—he said to the prisoner "What is the matter with you?"—the prisoner said "Nothing"—the master called me out of the cabin and said "This man says there is nothing the matter with him"—I told him about it—the prisoner said I was a b—liar,</p>
               <p>and took this pricker in his hand and struck the captain—he was coming a second time, when I struck him on his hand and seized the pricker—we had not ill-used the prisoner, and were on good terms win him—the captain fainted twice in the surgery.</p>

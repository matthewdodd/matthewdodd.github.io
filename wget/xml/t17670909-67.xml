               <p>Q. At what distance was you?</p>
               <p>S. Tyler. I was, I suppose, twenty or thirty yards from the child; I am no great judge of measurement; I screamed out; I cannot be positive what I said; I saw the wheel go over the child's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body driving the cart?</p>
               <p>S. Tyler. I saw none but the man in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the cart was he?</p>
               <p>S. Tyler. He was towards the head of the cart; his back was towards me, and his face towards the horses; he was standing; I was greatly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090056"></xptr> frighted, and went home and saw no more of it; I do not know who the driver was; there was a turning; I stood between the turning and the child; the cart came out from a parcel of buildings, about five yards from where I stood.</p>

               <p>A. Watson. No, it was all done in an instant; I went to see the child; a woman took it up; its head fell down; it was killed on the spot; that man that called out was farther off than we were.</p>

I was standing at my own door at the time, about four houses from the child; I saw the child lie under the second horse, and the wheel go over its head; I heard somebody call woh, but do not know who it was; I screamed out myself; then the wheel was just at the child's head; the driver, when he was about two houses beyond the child, turned round and wrung his hands, and seemed very sorry.</p>

            . I am a sawyer; I was sitting upon some timber about twenty yards from the child; I saw the cart coming along, and the child coming from the opposite corner towards me; the man endeavoured to turn his horses to the right, to shun a hole; the child passed the first horse, the second knocked it down with his knee, by the wheel pitching in the hole, and the near wheel went over its head; I had not power nor time to alarm the prisoner; he went away with his cart about 50 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mend his pace?</p>
               <p>Haynes. His pace was rather mending; I am not quite clear whether the horses were in a trot; I called to him, he did not stop; I ran after, and stopped the horses, and desired him to get down, and asked him if he knew what he had done; he made me no answer; the child might have been saved, had not the second horse been out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a whip?</p>
               <p>Haynes. No, not as I saw; he was delivered into the constable's custody, and I went to my work.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the prisoner had been on the side of the horses as he ought to have been, could he not have stopped the horses?</p>
               <p>Haynes. Yes, and have saved the child's life.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a male or a female child?</p>
               <p>New. It was a female child; the prisoner wrung his hands, and said, how shall I face that infant in another world; if my life would pay for it, I would freely give it; it was a neighbour's child.</p>

On Thursday, the 19th of November, I came down stairs and found the prisoner in the shop, in my son's custody. I asked what was the matter? He said, in the prisoner's hearing, that two men came into the shop; one of them asked what he would charge for dressing an old hat. The prisoner stood behind his companion, where the bags of fur were. He concealed a bag of fur, and walked out of the shop with it. My son said he ran after him, and brought him in with the fur. The prisoner said nothing to it. I took him in charge, and sent my son for an officer, who took him to the watch-house. The bag was covered with dirt, as if it had fallen in the dirt. It was worth 3 l. 15 s. - I had paid that for it that morning. I knew the bag by the mark. They are all marked the same way.</p>

            . I live with my father. On the 19th of November, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop with another man, who pulled off his hat and asked what I should charge for dressing it? I said one shilling. He asked several questions. While we were in conversation the prisoner walked out of the shop. He had a loose great coat over his left arm. I missed the fur immediately. I saw it there when they came in. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner crossing the road; his companion ran to the door with me, and called out</p>

               <p>"Jem!" two or three times. I overtook the prisoner in the middle of the road, crossing towards a street nearly opposite. I collared him, and asked him for the fur. He said he had none. I said I was sure he had, and was going to lift up his coat, and he immediately dropped it. It was concealed under his coat. I picked it up and took it into the shop, with him. Nobody but him and his companion had been in the shop. I am certain he is the man. My father was called down. I told him what had passed. I sent for a constable, who took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any soap on the 23d of January - A. Yes. I was from home at the time. I returned home about six in the evening. There was a quantity of soap then missing, about twenty-two pounds out of the same box that I had assisted in packing it up in the morning. It was sold, but not delivered. It was packed up for the purpose of being sent off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it before that day - A. Yes. I put it up myself principally, or assisted in putting it up, in the morning, about ten o'clock. I went from home about eleven o'clock. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the soap - A. The quantity that was brought into our house was about eighteen pounds. We value it at seventeen shillings.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. On Saturday, the 23d of January, I saw the two prisoners in company with another walking about the door of Mr. Picard's shop, (it was about a quarter before six), and knowing them, I watched them. The prisoner, Thompson, went in, and stopped in about five minutes; the other two stood on the steps of the door. Thompson came out and crossed the road. The other two followed close behind. Perkins said, go it, here are two pigs. (The thieves call the officers pigs.) I pursued them, and caught Thompson with the bundle of soap in his arms. He threw the soap down, and endeavoured to get from me. I took him back to Mr. Pickard's shop. I gathered up the soap. I had my brother with me; he was running after the other men. When I got the soap back to the shop I tied it up tight, and took Thompson and put him in security. We then took him and the soap to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you shew the soap at the shop - A. To Mr. Morgan. He said, Mr. Pickard packed it up, and he should come down to the office. Mr. Pickard came to the office and owned the soap.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him come out of the shop, did you observe whether he had anything with him or not - A. He had a bundle in his arms when he came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same parcel that he threw from him - A. Yes. I was not thirty yards from him all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the soap - A. I was ordered to take care of it, and I have had it in my custody ever since. This is it.</p>
               <p>

            . I was with the last witness. I saw the prisoners; there was a third in company with them; they were walking near Mr. Pickard's door. In the course of a few minutes I saw Thompson enter the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop - A. There was no person in the shop as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a shop where they expose their goods to sale - A. Yes, it is. He was in a few minutes; he came out again with a parcel in his arms, and crossed the road. He had something tied up in a blue apron, which he carried in a bundle before him the other two followed him. I observed Perkins to speak, and he and the other ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said - A. No. I pursued the two that run, but I lost them. When I lost them I returned back to my brother, and found him scuffling with the prisoner, Thompson. They were in the road. I assisted my brother. The soap was then laying on the pavement. I took up the soap, and carried it back to Mr. Pickard's. My brother took the prisoner back. Mr. Morgan said it was his soap, and pointed out the chest where he said it was taken from. He was then taken to Bow-street, and the soap was delivered to my brother.</p>

            . Who was it that gathered the soap up - A. I do not know. The soap was on the pavement, whether I gathered it up, or my brother, I cannot say. The man was tustling with me to get from me. I had got hold of him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that soap, and see whether it is your soap - A. I have no doubt but it was our soap. There is no particular mark on the soap. I have not a doubt in my own mind but it is the same soap that I had packed up. When it was brought back I was not at home. I was soon after. The soap was taken from an open chest in the shop, with a cloth over it. The cloth might easily be removed.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. I was coming down Tottenham-court-road on the left hand side, I saw that bundle lay; I picked it up. Mr. Collier came and stopped me. He asked me what I had got. I said, soap. He said, I must come back with him. He said he saw me take it out of the shop. I know nothing of Perkins.</p>
               <p>Perkin's Defence. I know nothing of that man. I was at my work at the time.</p>

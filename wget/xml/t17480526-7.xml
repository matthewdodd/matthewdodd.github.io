            . Last Monday, between two and three in the afternoon, the Prisoner came to my husband's shop in Harp-Alley; he is a broker; my husband's coat and waistcoat were brought down to be brushed, and were laid upon a bedstead, and the Prisoner stole them. I did not see her take them, but I saw my man take them from her in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she come into your shop for?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I can't tell; she was not gone from the door, and my man brought her into the shop again, and called me up before he took his hands off her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself ?</p>

            . I live with William Atkinson I I was coming from dinner, and saw the Prisoner at the door stooping down. I thought she was tying her garter, and I turned my head on one side for two or three minutes; I turned about again, and asked her, whether she wanted to buy any thing? And seeing she had something, I asked her what she had got there? She said she had only picked up two or three rags; but she had got my master's coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she then?</p>
               <p>Crab. She was upon the threshold of the door, and I took them from her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say further?</p>
               <p>Crab. She said she had found them at the door; I had brought them down to brush them, and had laid them upon a bedstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said there are some things here, and if they belong to you take them; and Mrs. Atkinson fell upon me like a mad dog.</p>

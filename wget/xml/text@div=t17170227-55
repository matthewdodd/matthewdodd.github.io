And several other Witness deposed, he still persisted in giving affronting Language, and told the Prisoner, if he was an Officer, he had Sixpence to drink with him; but if he was not, he would see him out. The Prisoner told him, that he was a saucy Fellow, and, because he was a Soldier, thought he might take the liberty to abuse People. The Deceased told the Prisoner again, if he was an Officer, he had Sixpeace to drink with him; but if he was not, he would see him out. The Prisoner told him, if he would go to the Plough and Horrow in St. Martin's Lane, he might be informed what he was but desired him to go his Way, and he would go his; or if he would go there, that he might go on one side of the Way, and he on the other; and so the Prisoner went on, and the Deceased followed him to the Rails, and pushed him through, and struck him with his Sword undrawn, bidding him. If he were an Officer, draw, and shew him that he could handle his Sword. That the Deaceased drew his Sword, struck at the Prisoner, and cut his Hand before he drew; that than the Prisoner retreated back and did draw, having no other Way to decide himself from being cut to Pieces. Several Evidences deposed, that the Deceased cut at the Prisoner, laying on with great Violence and Fury, as thou' he were knocking down an Ox, and the Prisoner warding off the Blow with his Sword. now and them at the Deceased and the Duplicate was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171702270008"></xptr> very sharp on both sides, the Prisoner receiving several Cuts, till at length he gave him the Wound of which he fell; and that then the Deased stood full, and the Prisoner walked softly away; Persons wing him, he went back, being told the Deceased was dead, and looking upon him, said, he was very sorry, enting he had been so unfortunate, de their to find a Constable, and surrendred himself. There were some few Evidences, who gave an Account something different as to Circumstances, in Favour of the Deceased; but a far greater Number, and many of good Reputation agreed, that had not the Prisoner so defended himself; he must in all Probability have undergone the same Fate from the Fury of his Adversary.

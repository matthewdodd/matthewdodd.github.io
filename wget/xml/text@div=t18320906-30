On the 17th of August I saw Brennan come out of the hay-loft with a bundle; he went along the leads over the coach-house, and dropped it into a piece of vacant ground at the end of the stable - he then went back, came out of the stable door, and walked down the row; he went back, and then I lost sight of him.</p>

             (Police-constable C 85). On the 30th of August I was in St. James'-park; Brennan was pointed out to me - I told him he was my prisoner - in going through the park he said, "What am I to do?" I took him to the station, showed him the bundle, and said, "You are charged with stealing this;" he said, "I know it;" it was in a handkerchief, which he said was his; I said he should have it at the trial - I had seen the bundle thrown over the fence of the vacant space where it had been dropped on the 17th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening - Shepherd got over the fence, and threw it over; Davis took it up, and walked away with it - the lowest part of the fence is about six feet high; no one could look over it, but there were vacancies through which persons might have looked; I took Davis with the bundle - I said, "What is this?" he said, "I don't know; I picked it up - if I had looked at it I should have taken it to the coachman;" I did not see Brennan then.</p>

            . I am in the service of the Earl of Clarendon. This is his property; it had been safe just before - Brennan had been three or four months in the service of the Earl; we sometimes go to the place where these things were thrown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been five months out of employ - I took the articles through distress; I did not take them off the premises - I threw them into a place where I was sure the coachman's wife would find them; I meant to pawn them for a shilling or two for support, and when I got employ I would have returned them; the Earl of Clarendon has been a kind friend to me for ten years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a very good character.</p>

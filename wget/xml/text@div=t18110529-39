On the 8th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, the two prisoners came into my shop and enquired for some handkerchiefs; I shewed them a quantity of silk handkerchiefs, after looking at them a long time they purchased this one, Fonseca paid for it. Jose then enquired for some black silk handkerchiefs, they purchased one of them; they then enquired for some stockings, and while I was gone to a distant part of the shop to get the stockings, my apprentice, who had been watching them, gave me some information. In consequence of that I sent him for an officer, and when the officer came he took Fonseca's hat off. We found two parcels of black silk handkerchiefs therein, five in one, and seven in the other. Jose was searched, I believe nothing was found upon him, I had taken them handkerchiefs out of the box to shew them to the prisoners.</p>

On the 8th of April, in the evening, I saw the two prisoners come into the shop, my master shewed them some handkerchiefs, they purchased a coloured one. I was watching them, and while my master was shewing them some black ones, I observed a piece of black silk handkerchiefs' between Jose's knee and the counter, and another piece on the floor. They then asked my master to shew them some stockings, and while he was gone for them Fonseca stooped down and put both pieces in his hat, and then put his hat on his head; I then informed my master, and master sent me for an officer.</p>

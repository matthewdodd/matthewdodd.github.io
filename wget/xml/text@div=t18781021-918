On 28th May I was on duty in High Street, Slough, with Sharpe, and saw the prisoner Harding driving a dung cart with two black horses, and half a load of hay, from Burnham towards London—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—there is a very awkward corner there—I asked Sharpeto turn his light on, which he did, and kept it on about a minute and a half—the horses tried twice to turn at Church Street, but were pulled back both times—Harding called out "<hi rend="italic">Come hither way</hi>" and smacked his whip—that is a common expression to horses in those parts—I next saw Harding outside Lambeth Police-court on 28th August, and afterwards saw him inside in the dock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Thresher, of 31, Caledonian Road, a baker's assistant—on 13th September, about 10.45, I bade my friend Mrs. Little "Good-night!" in the New Road—the prisoner passed us, and said "If I had a knife I would cut her b——guts out"—my friend said "Does she mean me or you?"—I said "I don't know"—when I got to the corner of Tonbridge Street she must have been hid somewhere; she said "You have locked my friend up," and gave me a blow in my eye, and knocked me off the pavement into the road, and I became insensible—when I came to I tried to get my hands to my head, and found my clothes all over my head—I missed my purse, with a half sovereign and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, also a pencil-case, and my hair, which was worth 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was torn from my head—I told a policeman, and described the prisoner—I lost a great deal of blood, and am not well now, something is the matter with my stomach, but whether she kicked me I do not know—I was examined by a doctor—the prisoner lodged with me three or four years ago, and I am positive of her—I identified her at the station at 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew her quite well for years—she lodged in my house, 160, Ossulston Street, not quite a week—it is a confectioner's and milk shop—it is not a brothel, and she is not a prostitute—her husband is a musician, and she took the room—her husband did not come to complain that it was a brothel—I never kept a brothel, only a coffee-shop; ladies and gentlemen have slept there—I do not know who they were—I have had six months for an assault—I do not know that the prisoner is a prostitute—she did not owe me a half-crown on that night—my friend was Mrs. Little, of Great Portland Street, where I have done washing—I live with my husband—we had had a pot of porter between three of us for supper—I had bad tea at my friend's house—I have not got my <hi rend="italic">chignon</hi> back—I have never seen it—I know Mr. Lewis, a shoemaker, of the Pentonville Road—a person in his shop has not given it back to me, or told me any<lb></lb>thing about it—the doctor saw the mark on my eyebrow, and bruises about my body—I undressed before him—I told the policeman that the prisoner had lodged with me—I did not tell him her name, I did not know it—I have nodded to her, but I did not do so this night—I have never spoken to her in the three years, only nodded—I had the six months for an assault on the wife of a tradesman who made a complaint against me for keeping a brothel—I had eight months.</p>

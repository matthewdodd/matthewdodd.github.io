                  </hi>. I keep a farm at Lambton, in Middlesex—the prisoner was my carter—when he goes to Covent-garden market I allow him a truss of hay for his horses, but nothing beside—he had no authority to take chaff or corn—I had forbidden that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mrs. Rogers—the prisoner was allowed one truss of hay when he went to Covent-garden market—he had no right to take away more—this looks like my mistress's hay—I would not swear to it—it is such as I allowed the prisoner to take for his horses—I was not there when this was taken away, but I missed one truss out of the loft—I did not give him any chaff or corn—he had no right to take any corn or chaff—this mixture is just the same that we allow.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the Hounslow-road, with a cart drawn by three horses—I stopped him and asked what he had got—he said some hay and chaff for his horses—I found 65lbs. of hay tied by the side of the cart with a rope, 58lbs. on the cart, and a sack containing three bushels of mixture.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Enfield House, Tottenham—I am super<lb></lb>intendent to Messrs. Beck and Pollitzer, of Brooks's Wharf, of which they were managers for Mr. Robert Warner, they were also proprietors or occupiers of Upper Brooks's Wharf, next to it-this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced) (marked A A</hi>) is a correct plan of the premises of Brooks's Wharf, the ware-house is—divided into three blocks, marked here A B and C; those are bonded warehouses—the part behind is not bonded—the bonded part extends to the basement, but does not include the boiler room, that is below ground, underneath the archway-A and C consist of seven floors and a basement, and B of six floors on the land side, and five on the river side—there is a communication between A and C on all the floors across B, by an opening, which is closed by iron doors, which slide to—there are two doors on each floor, and there is an opening of about 4 feet between each door—the doors do not meet, they overlap each other, so as to form a double protection against fire—there are three openings on each floor between B and A, which are not protected by iron doors, that is so all the way up there are small arches, but no doors—the access from the outside is by a staircase, through C, it is an opening into the loading area; that staircase runs right up to the top in C—there is no communication to B, except through C by the iron doors-you have to go through C and B to get to A up that staircase; there is no other staircase—there is no staircase in A only to the ground floor—It is called the ground floor, but it is about 6 feet above the ground, and therefore it necessitates a staircase up to it-the boiler room is underneath the archway, there is a communication with that from the outside-when the door in C is fastened there is no access to the premises, except to the ground floor of A, and that would be locked at the same time by the Customs authorities—there are four engines, two of which are in C, one in B and one in A—there' are two boilers below, which com<lb></lb>municate</p>

               <p>with the engines on the second floor—the engines are enclosed in engine boxes, they are Nos. I and 4 in C-No. I is at the back, and No. 4 in front-No. 3 is in B at the loophole, facing the river, No. 2 is in A by the loophole at the side, looking towards Southwark Bridge—the steam communication runs through the first floor to those engines—there is a stop cock by which the steam can be shut off on the first floor; that shuts off communication with all the engines, but it must be turned off in the engine boxes as well—there is a stop cock to each pipe in each engine box on the first floor, when that is shut off, no steam gets to the engine—It is not necessary to turn it off at the engine box, but we always turn <hi rend="italic">it</hi> down as an extra precaution-at the time in question in the basement and ground floor of C, wines and spirits were stored-B has no ground floor—the second floor is the Colonial floor-on the first floor were teas; on the second floor straw boards, in bundles, bales of gunny, hydraulically pressed, with four or five iron bands round each bale, some cases of mother-of-pearl shells, and one case of gum benzoin; those were all in C and on the third floor, and all above there was nothing but tea-on the first floor of B there was tea, on the second floor, pressed packed bales of gunny and lac dye in wooden cases, and on all floors above that, nothing but tea—In the basement and ground floor of A, were currants and raisins, bales of gunny, and a few bags and cases of sundry goods: on the first floor, tea; on the second floor, coffee in casks; and on the third floor, and all above, tea—the case of gum benzoni was <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the front engine bos, No. 4—It is there now, as shown in this photograph, marked A E; I have seen it there since the fire, it is an ordinary wooden packing case lined with tin and bound together by nails—the prisoner was the engineer; his duties were in the boiler house and in the four engine boxes on the second floor—he had an assistant named Buckle—It was the prisoner's duty to see whenever the engines required any oil—he started the engines from the boiler house, by a verbal signal from above-that was Howe's duty, he worked the cranes; he worked any one that was required we seldom required all at once—the prisoner's duty would take him to the engine box once in the course of an hour, I should think, to see that the machinery was working easily—If the crane was not working he would not be required to go there at all—he kept his fitting tools in the boiler house; he would take them up as he wanted them-his hours were from 8 a.m., until the cranes ceased working, which was generally at 4-on Thursday, 15th June, there was only one crane at work, that was No. 3 in B, and that stopped work about 2 o'clock-after that he would do any small repairs that might be wanted in the boiler house-his duties would not take him upstairs in the ordinary course—I saw him between 1 and 2 o'clock that day in the boiler house—I told him there was a leakage of steam in the basement. of C warehouse, and told him to repair it—he said "I understand you are going to get another engineer and you had better get him to do it;" and as he was leaving he said "I shall serve you out in a private sort of way"—hat was all that passed—I saw no more of him before the fire, I returned to the warehouse; my duties lead me all over the place—I was away at the time the warehouse was closed that day—I did not see it until after the fire had broken out; Coombes the foreman and Buckle told me of it—I was then standing in High Timber Street at a few minutes to 5 o'clock—I went down to the wharf by the archway and saw smoke in dense volumes coming from a window in C warehouse, facing the loading area—I immedi<lb></lb>ately went under the archway down to the river, and saw smoke and flame</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180048"></xptr>
               <p>issuing out of B warehouse loop-hole in the second story—I then came back and saw smoke issuing out of B warehouse on the land side, out of the second floor loop-hole-after I had seen the smoke issuing out of the window of C, and before I went to B, I sent Coombes the foreman off for the fire engine, and went over to Messrs. Beck &amp; Pollitzer and informed them of the fire—it was not more than five minutes between seeing the smoke from C and seeing the flame from B front—I stayed on the premises—the engines came down with Captain Shaw—the fire spread very rapidly from the first; it was burning all night-about 8 o'clock I was in High Timber Street and saw the prisoner and his wife, he seemed to me partly intoxicated—he was coming down towards the wharf from the west end of High Timber Street—he said to me "A nice mess you have made of it now"—I took no notice but passed on to Upper Brook's Wharf, that is the adjoining premises—I saw him again between 11 and 12 o'clock just behind the office, he seemed intoxicated and rather quarelsome—I told him to leave, that he was not wanted there; there were several persons there, some of them strangers, Coombes was one of them—I spoke to the lot generally—he left and I saw no more of him that night-next day the fire burnt on and caught Upper Brook's Wharf and burnt that out-the floors all fell in, except the first and second floors in B, they were left-two or three days afterwards I went in and saw the gunny cloths, the bales were burnt at the edges and about 4 inches into the stuff; that applies to all that I saw, every bale was more or less burnt at the edge—the cases of lac dye were broken by the action of the fire and the contents scattered about; the engine box was destroyed—I did not at that time observe the condition of the floor of the engine box-about three weeks or a month after that I noticed that the floor was charred; the fire seemed to have run along by the bales, as represented on this photograph, it extended for about 6 feet round the base of the pile of gunny bags; there was a space of 3 or 4 inches between the charring and the gunny bags—there were marks as if the flooring had been burnt in a line, starting from the engine box near the doorway; it was thicker and wider at that end—the floor of the engine box itself did not seemed charred—I first noticed the gum benzoin three weeks or a month after the fire, I found it intact—Isaw the straw boards a few days after the fire, they were burnt at the edges; the cases containing the mother-of-pearl shells were partly burnt, the shells were left; about three weeks before the fire I was present at a conversation between the prisoner and Collins; the prisoned said to him "You accuse me of stealing tea, do you?"-Collins said "I have not, but if I did, perhaps I should not be far wrong "—the prisoner then struck him two blows—I told him I could not tolerate that conduct, I should have to report it to the firm—he said nothing in reply to that—I did report it, and in consequence we advertised for another engineer-we had persons come in answer to that advertisement—I did not give the prisoner any official intimation of that—It was the duty of Howe and Attfield to close the iron doors; if Howe was working the crane Attfield would have had to do it himself, at other times they would assist each other, just as they liked-that applied to all the iron doors except on the second floor, that was the duty of Coombes, the foreman, because colonial goods were stored in that floor, and he was in charge of that floor; it was his duty to close those doors or see them closed as soon as we were going to shut up—they would commence at a few minutes to 4 o'clock, there was no fixed time, 4 o'clock was the time for the people to go away-we have to pay for overtime if the warehouse <hi rend="italic">is</hi> not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180049"></xptr>
               <p>shut by 4 o'clock—I only know about the closing of the doors on this day from what has been told me since—I saw them on the Saturday after the fire-this photograph (A B) represents the condition in which they were then-on the fourth floor the doors were open, on the second floor they were half open, and on the first floor they were wide open; they were all wide open except on the second floor—I have often seen the doors. being closed, they run easily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am rather young for the position I occupy there—I am twenty-two years of age—I have been there about five years, the pri<lb></lb>soner has been there seven years, during the time of the present owners, and their predecessors—he did not behave impertinently to me on the occasion of the row with Collins—he accused Collins of stealing tea, I did not inquire into the matter-Collins accused him first, I am sure of that I had reason to be dissatisfied with Coombes, in consequence of missing some sultanas-his wages were to have been raised, and in consequence of miss<lb></lb>ing the sultanas they were not raised—I think that was about a week previous to the altercation with Collins—I have no recollection of the prisoner having said that some of the men were a d——set of theives and the firm should know of it—I will not swear he did not say so in my pre<lb></lb>sence, but I have no recollection of it—I did not say anything before the Magistrate about the floor being burnt in a particular way—I was examined three times, there were five or six hearings—I did not discover it, it was pointed out to me—the prisoner would bring up the oil to oil the engines in a small can from the boiler-house, he would not have a can for each engine box, he would only have one for the whole—the chain of the crank would have to be greased—I believe the engines had ceased to work at 2 o'clock on this day, I could not swear it positively, but as far as my memory goes they did—I do not understand anything about the engineering department—I don't know what "packing "the engine means—I know that it cannot be done while the engine is at work, it is to stop a leakage; in order to do that, the prisoner would have to go to the engine box while the engine was not at work—there is a tool used by him called a spanner—I don't know that on that day he left the spanner in one of the engine boxes; the materials kept in the warehouse are entered in a book called the housing book, it is here, it is kept by one of the clerks in the office—the store room is at the corner of the yard, next to the office near High Timber Street—there is a store room on the second floor in C, that contained hessian (which is a kind of gunny stuff used for packing canvass), rope, and string, paper bags and old tea lead—the hessian would be in rolls, it is a kind of canvass made of jute—there was no quantity of it in the B warehouse, there was some on the ground floor, I don't think there was any on the second floor, I would not swear it-Palmer was the sampler, he is here, he was under fore<lb></lb>man to Coombes-a man named Frost was gatekeeper; there was no gate for him to keep, he kept the entrance to the wharf, to keep strangers out; he is here-Thomas Wallis was a casual labourer taken on when required, I could not say whether he was employed on the day of the fire; the labour books are here and can be referred to; I could not swear as to the men who were employed that day—I am perfectly well acquainted with the iron doors and their working; they were never locked, they work on wheels, they do not require more than one man to move them; one man can move them easily, I have moved them myself; there are two doors, one on either side of the wall, one pulls one way and one the other, they cover each other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180050"></xptr>
               <p>when closed—It may have been seven or eight weeks before the fire that I saw them closed, they were working properly then-Robins, the carpenter, would see to their repair—the first time that I knew of the doors being open was two days after the fire-Attfield had charge of the gas all over the premises—there are two meters, one in the basement of A and one in the basement of C, and there is gas all over the premises, all over A, B, and C, on every floor; there is only a gas jet on one staircase, that is the one lead<lb></lb>ing to the first floor of C—there are gas jets on every floor—it was Attfield's duty to report to Cook that the gas was out—the only complaint I am aware of about the gas was that one jet was left in the office one night, about two years ago; I have not known of any other—there was gas in the store-room at what is called the watchman's box which was not properly connected with the main, that was a fraud on the company, but I did not know of it till four or five days ago; the prisoner never mentioned it to me—the prisoner came daily to the premises after the fire, up to 23rd June, he showed no anxiety to leave—It is the duty of the man who shuts the doors to see that there is no one on the premises—I never heard of a tea chest taking fire from a jet of gas—I have never heard of the doors being left open—It was in Buckle's presence that the prisoner said he would serve me out in a pri<lb></lb>vate sort of way-to the best of my belief it was a few minutes after 5 o'clock when I discovered the smoke, I could not fix the time-this matter was in<lb></lb>quired into before the prisoner was given into custody; the inquiry was con<lb></lb>ducted by Mr. Beck and myself; I took down the men's answers, Mr. Beck asked some questions and so did I-we did not examine all the men who were on the premises the day of the fire-Thomas Wallis was not working on a crane that day, not according to this labour book; it is kept by different foremen, that day it was kept by Brown, under the superintendence of Coombes, he is not here—I could not say of my own personal knowledge that Wallis was not there that day-according to the labour books Thomas Daley was not there that day—the wages are paid according to these books; I have not got the wages book here-this book contains simply the names of the casual extra men; the wages book is a copy of this—the casual men are paid daily.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Brooks' Wharf was originally in the occupation of Messrs. Cousins Renshaw and I was in their employ—I became superintendent last November, I had worked my way up from a clerk—the gas jet was in the office outside the bonded warehouse, and was connected directly with a pipe leading to the main and not through the meter, I did not know that until inquiry was made about it at the Mansion House, I was told of it by Buckle that morning; since that it has been set right—the distance from the outer office is nearly 200 feet—the store room on the second floor in C is practically untouched by the fire—the gas jet that was left burning in the office was some two years ago; that was inside the bonded warehouses, I did not see it buring; the police made a report and wrote to us on the sub<lb></lb>ject—I had not seen the charring of the floor in B when I was examined before the Magistrate; it was not examined until after the committal-the leakage of steam that I complained of on the afternoon of the 15th was in the basement of C.</p>

               <p>second floor, and all the floors above—I bad not to look after the machinery, only just to turn the steam off when we had done—there were three cranes in front and one at the back-on 15th June, I was at work at crane No. 3, in B on the river side; that was the only steam crane that was at work that day; there were hand cranes—I left off working the crane at 2 o'clock-first, I had to shut off the steam in the engine box in case of accident, that was my duty—I am quite sure I did that; I then went to the first floor and shut off the steam there—It was my duty, in conjunction with Attfield, to close all the doors communicating between C and B, with the exception of the doors on the first floor, a foreman named Bass does that, and it is Coombes' duty to close those on the second floor-on the afternoon of the 15th, at 3.45, I was at the door leading onto the stairs on the second floor in C, it is a wooden door, opening directly on to the stairs; it is never closed—I saw the prisoner coming from No. 3 engine box through the iron doors on the second floor, he came towards me, and went downstairs, he passed me, I went upstairs to the third floor, and he went down—I told him I had turned off the steam—he said "All right!"—I closed the iron doors on the third floor, and then went to the fourth floor and closed the iron doors there; they would not go quite close, because they were rather out of re<lb></lb>pair on the third floor, they were all right on the fourth and fifth, I went up and closed them-on the fifth I found three men at work on a hand crane dropping goods down, I know one of them was James—I then returned to the second floor and there found Robins, I helped him in getting a board out of a stack of deals, they were just inside the store room in C; they were kept thereto mend chests of tea, or anything that was required—It was then from about 3.55 to 4 o'clock-while doing that, I saw the prisoner again, he came upstairs on the second floor through the doorway, and went in the direction of No. I engine box in C, by the loop hole—I could see the engine box from where I was; I could not tell whether he went into it or not, you could not see the door open, it was just round the corner, he went in that direction—I remained there about two minutes after he had passed me—I then saw him come out of No. I engine box and go into No. 4 on the same floor fronting the river-Robins and I then left that floor, leaving him there Robins went downstairs, and I went up to the top floor—I there found Attfield doing some work, I waited till he had finished; he was wiping out the hand crane that they had been using in the day—he and I then closed the iron doors on the top floor, they worked on rollers; they did not work very well, they were rather out of repair, the stones had dropped along where the wheels ran-we could not get them quite close together; one would go close, and the other would not, because the stone had dropped on one side—I am sure we closed them as far as they would go—I and Attfield then went down to the fifth floor, and closed the doors there; they closed easily and properly—I saw the three men out of that floor, and followed them downstairs, and they went out-as far as I know, I left everything safe upstairs—there was no smell of fire—It was about 4.15 when I got to the bottom of the stairs—In coming down, I did not go into the second floor, it is not my duty to go there-on, my way down, I turned out three gas burners, one on the stairs, between the ground floor and the first floor, one in the delivery office, and one in the Customs locker office, opposite the delivery office on the first floor in C—there was no other gas alight, I am quite sure—there had not been any gas burners lighted in the ware-house that day; I am able to say that-after putting out the jets, I turned</p>

               <p>off the warehouse meter, that is behind the door, just as you enter the ware-house from the yard, just inside the bonded door into C-that is not the meter for all the three warehouses—there is one in the basement on each side, one for C and one for A; half B is supplied through A, and half through C—I did not turn off both meters, only the one in C—I am quite sure that I turned off that and the jets securely and properly—I did not see the other meter turned off by Attfield, but the locker did—I did not smell any gas escaping—I went out at the bonded doors—I then went into the office to get the keys to lock the door; I was away about three minutes-Attfield went to turn the gas out on the other side, and down in the basement; that left the passage clear; when I came back, I did not close the doors directly, because Mr. Wickham Jones, a representative of the firm, and Mr. Cooke, the foreman, stood talking outside two or three minutes, and then went into the offioe, and remained there about five minutes; I remained at the door, Attfield had rejoined me at that time, and remained with me—I had got the keys-Croker, the Custom's locker, was with me-we three remained there till Mr. Jones and Cooke came out of the office inside the bonded part, and the doors were then all finally closed and locked; there are two doors, and the Custom's locker put his padlock on and locked them I hung the keys up in the office, in their proper place; the locker took his keys with him—It was 4.25 when I had completed—I then went home by train to Snaresbrook—I heard nothing about the fire until 6 o'clock next morning-(<hi rend="italic">looking at photograph A D</hi>) I see the iron doors as they appear here; that was not the condition in which I left them, or anything like it—I cannot say whether they could have got into that condition without being purposely moved back; they would not move by their own weight; they could not fall back unless they were touched-about three weeks before the fire, I heard the prisoner say on two occasions that "When I go, all the b-lot shall go"—It was not said to me, but to other persons as I passed—I don't know how it arose—I did not hear what led to it—I don't re<lb></lb>member to whom he was talking—I don't know of any engineers calling at the premises.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I passed down at 4.15 there was no smell or sign of fire whatever—I did not smell any paraffin or anything of the kind-when I saw the prisoner in the first engine box on the second floor it was 3.55, I saw him coming from the direction of the engine box No. 3 in B at 3.45; there is only that one engine box in that floor; I did not see him go into it—the upper portion of the engine boxes are of glass and the lower portion of wood, about half of each; you could see anybody inside the box—I saw him go in the direction of No. 4 box, I did not see him come out—I stopped up on the top floor until the men had done working the crane, that would be rather better than 4.10, I then came down-at that time everything was safe-Coombes was not one of the men working the crane, he was foreman, he was not there; they were three ordinary working men—I can't tell what time they went off the premises—they went down to work in the yard after I left; they left the building, it was locked up at 4.15—I was away at 4.25—nobody could get out at the door after that, they could through the loop holes, they could manage to get down by means of the guide rope—I was away for three minutes getting the keys; that was after 4.15 and before 4.25—there was nobody downstairs in the basement that I am aware of the watchman's box is up at the top of the yard—I got the keys from the office-Brown, a clerk to Coombes, the foreman, was in the office-any person</p>

               <p>coming out during the three minutes, would have to pass by Brown if they went off the premises altogether-with the exception of that three minutes I was outside with Attfield, and must have seen anybody that passed out—I did not see the prisoner after 4 o'clock when I left him on the second floor—I saw Croker put the locks on at 4.25, the same time as me—I looked at my watch when I left, I always do—I said before the Magistrate "I left the premises at 4.25, if there had been any fire in the engine boxes I believe I should have smelt it," I say the same now—I also said "It is not an unusual thing for an engineer to go into the engine boxes when they are not at work," that is so—It was not unusual for the prisoner to go and wipe the engines over and get them ready for work next morning—If the prisoner was out of the premises at 4.25 he must have come out. before me—there was gas in the boiler room, I don't know whether that gas was supplied by the meters it might be supplied from the warehouse meters or from the main—I don't know at what hour it was left burning there, or whether it was burning or not—I don't remember any complaints being made in the time of Cousins &amp; Reushaw about my having left the doors open, there were none-Mr. Renshaw gave me a week's notice, but not on that account, it was for mis<lb></lb>taking tallies of tea in landing—he used to come at 8 o'clock in the morning before me—he did not come eighteen months before and find five sets of the iron doors open; he made no complaints to me and I heard of none-the doors have been repaired, I could not say when, they have been repaired in the present owner's time; some of them were out of repair at the time of the fire-each door would have to be separately closed—there would be fourteen doors altogether to be opened.</p>

I live at 2, High Timber Street, Thames Street-at the time of the fire I was in the employ of Mr. Warner—I assisted the prisoner generally, and also acted as watchman after the premises were closed; it was my duty when they were closed to look round and see that all was right—I was on duty as watchman from 4 till 8 o'clock, then there was a night watchman-on Thursday afternoon, 15th June, I was assisting the prisoner in the boiler room-about 10.30 that morning he went out—I saw him when I returned from dinner between 12 and 1 o'clock, and I told him that there had been a man after his situation; I don't think he took much notice of it-at 3.30 I saw him in the boiler room and toldhim again "There are one or two men after your place"—he said "I will go up and see them"—he went up—I don't know whether he spoke to anybody or not-steam was not up then—I think I turned No. 3 crane on about 9 or 8.30 in the morning—I did not turn it off, only from the main engine room—I can't say when I ceased feeding the boilers, I was not there all day, the steam was off when I went down and told him about the man calling; the fire was out—there are two boilers—the prisoner went up once or twice at 3.30, I don't think he was absent more than ten minutes or quarter of an hour, I could not say for certain—he came back about 3.50 or 3.45—he went up again leaving me in the boiler room—he showed me how to undo the nuts of some tubes in the boilers—I think that was about 4 o'clock—he did not say where he was going, he had nothing with him that I know of, no tools, or can, or anything in his hand that I am aware of—I don't know that anything wanted to be done, no further than going up to see that everything was right, he generally did that of an evening, to see that the engines were all turned off before he went away—he was absent twenty minutes I should think, I can't say to a minute, or five minutes, it may have been a little more or less—he then came back to me in the boiler room and asked me if I would have a glass of ale—I said yes; that was the habit after work, and we went up the yard together, he took off his jacket and put on his coat—It was about 4.30, as near as I can say, when we went up the yard-we went to the King's Head and Lamb in Thames Street and had a glass of ale, and as we came out again I saw the prisoner's wife coming along Thames Street, and we went in again and bad another glass of ale-we were in the public-house, I should think, a quarter of an hour—I then left and came away—I was looking up at the G ware-house next the stores, when the boy Eade came up and spoke to me, and I went through the archway on to the quay as far as the water's edge and looked up in the direction of the second floor of B warehouse and saw smoke coming from the loop hole of B-that was about 4.50-on seeing the smoke I ran and gave the alarm to Mr. Moore, he was at the top, turning round to come down the yard from the office—I then went up into Thames Street and gave the alarm to the police; that did not take me a minute—I went back to the quay and saw Palmer beckoning and calling to the float to come; I did not see it come, I went up the yard again, and after that I and the gate<lb></lb>keeper kept the people back from coming down-about 8.30 that evening I saw the prisoner, I did not speak to him or hear him say anything-about</p>

I am foreman of the Salvage Corps, and act as wharf inspector for the insurance companies-on 25th May I took storage at Brooks' Wharf—I have got with me my notes of the contents of the three ware-houses, A, B, and C, which were burnt down-on the second floor of A and B there was coffee, gunny cloth in compressed bales, and lac dye—In C straw<lb></lb>board, bales of gunny cloth, gum, and there was a small place used as a tackle room where they kept stores; that was the whole—I could not tell how much gum there was, I do not go into that, only the classification of the goods; all those goods are non—Inflammable; the insurance offices, as a rule, take. them at a low rate, they do not consider that there is danger in them—there "was tea on all the upper floors, that is generally taken at a low rate, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> according to the construction of the building-Brooks' Wharf is one of the lowest on the water side, because it is kept in good order and well regulated—It would have been better if it had been in three divisions and not so high—A and B is one distinct warehouse—I went to the fire, I followed Captain Shaw—I attempted to gain-access to the building—got there shortly after 5 o'clock—I tried to break the locks off with my axe and Captain Shaw called for a pickaxe—I was not able to get in more than about half a dozen 'steps up the C staircase, I could see that for any practical purpose it was useless, it was impossible to get further in consequence of the smoke—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am in command of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, and have been since the formation of the brigade in 1866, and previously under the old regime—I have had plenty of experience of fires in this city, large and small—I was not well acquainted with Brooks' Wharf before the fire, I was acquainted with it externally, but not internally-on the afternoon of 15th June I was at Watling Street at 5.11—I received the alarm—I at once proceeded to Brooks' Wharf with a party of men and an engine, I got there in three or four minutes—there was smoke coming out of the colonial floor, the second floor, and from the windows of the floor above it, on the street front-we came down Thames Street and passed under the arch in D warehouse, going to the loading area—I did not see any flame at first—I think there was no smoke below the second floor when I arrived, and certainly no flame—I proceeded to the door of the staircase of C, that was burst open, and I went in as far as to stand for a moment on the colonial floor—the smoke was very dense, it was impossible to. remain there-smoke was issuing from the doors of on the second floor—I did not get to the door of the colonial floor, the smoke was too thick, I only got up to the top step of the stairs, and stood for a moment there, and then came down—there was no smoke issuing from the lower levels as I went up—the density of the smoke at the door of the second floor indicated that the smoke was not able to escape through the roof and was beating downwards; it also indicated a very considerable amount of flame in some part of the centre of the building, which was invisible at the time from the density of the smoke; it indicated a very severe fire raging in some part of the premises—the glass was just beginning to break in the upper windows over the second floor; that indicated very great heat and that the flames were approaching the windows—I then returned into the loading area-at that time perhaps two engines were at work and one floating engine—I was not able to get the hose inside the ware-house at that time on account of the density of the smoke, which was then beating still further downwards—the fire burnt with great rapidity and fury—all that could be done at first was to bring the water to play on the out<lb></lb>side—I was not able to get the hose inside until after the roof fell through, that must have been two hours after, I should think; it was ultimately arrested at the second floor, it did not burn below that point—the second floor in B remains now, the others all fell through—I have observed the second floor in B by the loophole where the engine box stood, as depicted in this photograph; it does not exactly represent it as it is now, but as it was after the fire; no material alteration had been made in the premises when this photograph was taken-part of the floor within the wooden partition which divided off the engine box was considerably charred, and outside in the passage, which was between some bales of goods, there was the appearance of some liquid, as if some inflammable liquid must have passed along it and burnt to a certain extent into the flooring-while we were preparing to break open the door of the staircase of C, I went to the opening in front of the loading area at the river side, where one of my engines was just getting to work, and I saw smoke pouring out of the win<lb></lb>dow</p>

               <p>close by the engine box of which we have been speaking; there was also some flame coming out there and of such a colour as to indicate the presence of a very severe fire in its vicinity; that was in fact the first actual flame I saw in connection with this fire—there was no flame issuing from any other aperature at that moment—the flame I saw. was coming from the window where I afterwards found the charred floor—I know as a rule the character of flame arising from different substances; it was very difficult to say in this case what the substance was, the smoke was very thick, it certainly raised the presumption in my mind of the presence of some oil or grease, or fatty substance; that was what I thought at the time-spirit would not make such a dense smoke, and the colour would be quite different; it would be very much brighter, not so lurid—I am not quite sure that it is exactly safe to go upon this presumption as to colour, because these liquids seldom burn without something else burning with them, and spirit fire will sometimes make very dense smoke when burning with other things, but not alone—I have examined the floor since the stock was cleared off, and I have seen that some inflammable liquid must have passed along the floor in the space between the bales of goods marked on the photograph and other bales to the left, and it had burnt to a considerable extent into the floor, it runs round from about where the door of the engine box would be, about in a line with the flooring boards, they were not such burns as would be caused by materials falling from above, they were such as would be caused by a flame of thick oil or' melting grease—I should say it would take fifteen or twenty minutes to burn before it would eat into the wood, a good deal would depend upon the nature of the substance; melting grease would be very much slower than mineral oil—I should be inclined to think it was melting grease that did that particular injury, or oil that had been standing along time and was not very liquid—It was impossible to avoid the con<lb></lb>clusion that some very 'slowly running inflammable liquid had passed over that part of the floor in the early stage of the fire—I think some of the flame out of the window may have come from the inside of the engine box; that indicated that some of the liquid must have got out there also—the liquid did not flow much in the direction of the gunny bags, it began by the door of the engine box and passed away to the left, as shown in the photograph—the outside of the gunny bags was charred—I was not able to get within the building so as to examine it properly for some days; it was left in charge of my men—I could then form a judgment as to one place in which the fire originated, but I think it probable there may have been several fires together—the engine box is the one place of which I speak—assuming the stock to be as it has been represented, I think it is very dif-ficult to suppose that the fire could have spread so rapidly unless the place had been lighted in several places together—the engine box No. I in C was destroyed, if there was one, there is none there now-considering the materials described as stored in the warehouse, it is very improbable that a fire could accidentally arise; of course it is not impossible, but it is very improbable—I should say such materials would not burn rapidly; the wooden tea cases would certainly burn, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> not rapidly—I observed the iron doors when I got on the premises; they were fully open from the colonial floor up, and on the colonial floor they were about half open—the fire would not open them; they were buckled out a little from the heat—If the iron doors had been closed it would very much have retarded the pro<lb></lb>gress of the fire, and I think it very probable we could have got from C Into B warehouse.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think it quite possible and probable that the place may have been set on fire in four or five different places—I think it very probable that the floor of an engine box used for eight years would be con<lb></lb>siderably moistened or saturated with oil—the running marks I saw on the floor might be caused by grease used for the crane pulleys, if in large quantity, but not the ordinary quantity used for such purposes; if there had been a store of oil that would account for it—If there had been a large quantity of grease, say half a ton, kept in the box, that" would account for the condition of the floor—It presented the appearance of having been run over by a very large quantity of liquid-what I saw inside the engine box I think would be accounted for by the oil having soaked into the floor, or by small quantities of oil from the oil feeders—I did not give any evidence before the Magistrate as to this floor, it bad not been cleared at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There would be a good deal of smoke on setting fire to grease or oil, and smell—there are a great many fires that we are unable to trace the cause of, and return as "Cause unknown."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>)., On 28th June I received a warrant and went to the Rainbow public-house, in Queen Street, Ratcliff, in company with Sergeant Moss, I there saw the prisoner-Moss read the warrant to him—he said "Yes, I know about it, it is a bad job; I left about 4 o'clock and went with Buckle and my wife to the public-house at the top of the yard, we had some ale, I then left with my wife and went straight home by rail, getting home about 6 o'clock, I had not been in-long before a Mr. Smith, who keeps a shop, came in and said 'There is a fire in Thames Street close to your wharf,' and I went with my wife and Mr. Smith to the fire"-that was all—I took him to the station.</p>

My duties took me on the different floors—I had no duty to perform with regard to the engines—I am able to say that the floor was not charred before the fire, I could not say that I paid parti<lb></lb>cular attention to it—In the case of the prisoner wanting oil or grease for the engines we should give him an order for it, it would be given in the office by one of the clerks, he would get the oil and charge it in the books; we have not found the order book since the fire—I could tell by the help of the invoices what quantity would come in in the course of a month or two—the invoices are not here, I can get them-Buckle can probably tell-no smoking was allowed on the premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). We used common engine oil for the engines, nothing else, most of it was kept down in the boiler room—some times we used to keep a little can which we called an oil feeder, about as large as this testament; we used to keep that in the engine box, not one in each box, we used to leave it in the box we were last in-we filled it when it was wanted—I can't say how often, some times in three or four days or a week, according to how many cranes were used-we oil them about every half hour or hour when they are in full working order-we have no stock of oil up in the floors-we keep a two or three gallon can down in the boiler room, from which we supplied the feeders-both the prisoner and I did the oiling, it all depends, if I am left there alone I do it—the two-gallon can is replenished when empty—I could not say what quantity of oil there was on the premises at the time of the fire; it never exceeded the two gallons-we did not use two gallons in three weeks, I could not say how much we used, when it was empty I used to tell the prisoner, and he would tell me to go to the</p>

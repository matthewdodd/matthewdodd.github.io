                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant M</hi>). On Saturday night, 4th August, or Sunday morning, I was on duty in White Street, Borough—there is a court called Collier's Rents there, and through that a court called St. George's Square, which consists of six houses, three on each side—it is occupied mostly by the lower class of Irish—in consequence of what I heard I went to a court which was at the back of this court, and heard voices as if persons were quarrelling and fighting—I was in uniform—I went down the place, and found a number of the inhabitants fighting and making a great disturbance, both in Collier's Rents and St. George's Square—it is a place where there is always a special man on duty, and constables do not go down there singly—Martin was the special constable on duty there that night, and Dale was on the beat—I found them there—the people seemed to be fighting in different lots; it was a kind of free fight; we term them faction fights—Mrs. Regan, the prisoner's mother, came up to me, and said "For God's sake, sergeant, put a stop to this disturbance, or there will be murder done;" at the same time I heard Timothy Regan, the prisoner's brother, call out from a first-floor window "Stand on one side, old woman, while I knock the b—'s brains out"—I saw him throw from the window a stone ginger-beer bottle, with very great force—it struck my left shoulder—it bounced up about 2 feet or 3 feet into the air, and then dropped on the pavement—it entirely disabled my left arm, I could not use it—the woman stepped on one side when he called out—she said "Oh, he has broken the sergeant's arm; he does not live in that house, he has only run in there to avoid the police"—I called <hi rend="italic">M</hi> 232, and we went into the house, he first, I following—the stairs were very steep and narrow—there are three floors, but only three rooms; I believe there are no back ones—when I was half way up the stairs, Timothy Regan rushed out of the front room, passed 232, and seemed to jump right down to avoid his catching hold of him—as he came past me I seized him with my right hand, but he was going with such force down the stairs that he dragged me headlong down, and him too—we both fell at the foot of the stairs; I fell on my left side—Regan jumped up much quicker than I could, and got away—Martin followed him—Dale was in the court close by the door—I heard a man's voice call out "Look out, policeman!"—I turned my eye round, and saw the prisoner—I had known her for very nearly two years by sight—she was close behind ma, and had an instrument in her hand, which looked like a lathrender's hammer, raised above my head—before I could get away from her she struck me a</p>

               <p>blow right on my shoulder, a dull heavy blow—she aimed at my head, but I ducked my head, and the blow came on my shoulder—it seemed to send a pain up into my head—my eyes flashed, and it seemed to knock me almost insensible for a moment—she struck me again twice after that very quickly on the back, one blow just at the back of my shoulder, and the other close by the corner of the bladebone—the third blow appeared to stick in my clothes—she could not get it out—she had to jerk it twice to get it out—I attempted to seize her, but she ran into the passage and up the stairs of the same house from which the ginger-beer bottle was thrown—I followed her into the passage, and about halfway up the stairs, but I became so faint from loss of blood that I went down again—she ran up stairs straight into the same room that she came out of—I went out into Collier's Bents, and met Dale—I made a complaint to him, and described the woman who had assaulted me—the blood was pouring down me between my shirt and skin and down the legs of my trousers, and you could track the blood right up into the Borough—I was cut right through two coats, my great uniform coat and another coat under that, and my shirt—I became nearly insensible, and was taken to the hospital—I remained there until the following Wednesday—I was then taken to my own house, and put under the care of the divisional surgeon—erysipelas came on, and I was confined to my bed for nine weeks—I have not recovered yet—the prisoner was brought to the hospital about half an hour after I was there, and I recognised her directly—I had a good look at her face, and I knew her so well previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in Collier's Rents before to the prisoner's brother, when he has been making a disturbance there several times—I can't say the number of the house, but I think it is No. 1—it was out of that window the bottle was thrown at me; from the first-floor window—I was suffering a great deal of pain when I went into the house from the injury to my shoulder—the fall did not hurt me much more—I felt numbed—I should say not more than one or two minutes elapsed from the time Martin passed me to go after Regan and my getting outside the door—there was no one near the door when I went out but the prisoner—she was about a yard from the door—I was standing still looking round the court when I heard the exclamation, "Look out, policeman!"—there is a lamp at the end of the court; it may be 12 yards from the door, possibly, at the entrance of the court—that was about 12.30, as near as possible—when I first went up the court, I dare say there were fifty people altogether in the square and the rents together—I should say about thirty in the square—they seemed to be all in a heap, fighting and striking anyhow—I have seen that sort of thing there before—there were very few in the square when I was struck by the prisoner—they were retreating towards Collier's Rents<lb></lb>men and women were fighting, and children amongst them—I believe the prisoner had been employed at Mr. Leving's, the furriers, for a long time—I told Martin that I had been stabbed with a chopper—it was like a little hatchet on one side and a hammer on the other—I believe the prisoner lives at No. 1 with her husband, and the Regans also live in that house—I don't know in what rooms.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I came out of the house and the prisoner attacked me, there were, very few persons in the square—there might possibly have been half a dozen, but they were nowhere near us; they were up towards the top of the square—there was plenty of light from the lamp to see her</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 232). I was on special duty on this occasion—Dale called me, and I proceeded with him up Collier's Rents to St. George's Square—I saw several of the Irish inhabitants quarrelling and fighting—Regan was there, and seemed to be the ringleader—I was in uniform—I went to lay hold of him, and he escaped into his mother's house, and almost immediately afterwards appeared at the first-floor window—he commenced using very bad language, and threw a piece of crockery-ware at me; I think it was a jug—it struck me on the breast, but did not hurt me—it fell on the pavement and broke—while I was endeavouring to quell the disturbance, Sergeant Woods came up; I saw a woman speaking to him—Regan at the window got a ginger-beer bottle, and exclaimed "Stand on one side, old woman; let me knock the b—brains out," and he threw the bottle and struck the sergeant—I saw him stagger against the wall—he called to me, and we went into the house—I went up stairs first on to the landing of the first floor, and saw Regan at the entrance of the room door; he had a poker or a piece of iron in his hand—he lifted it up as if to strike me, and I struck him with my staff—he then rushed past me, and jumped down the stairs—the sergeant was half-way up, and laid hold of him, and they both went to the bottom together—I saw the prisoner and a man I supposed to be her husband up stairs in the room that Regan came from—I Knew him by sight for some time—I ran down stairs, and pursued Regan; he was up on his feet in an instant and off—I pursued him through Collier's Rents, but lost sight of him—I then returned, and, at the entrance of Angel Place, I met the sergeant bleeding from two wounds in the back—he made a statement to me—t toot him to the hospital, and Dale returned to the court—I have never seen Regan since that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He does not live in the square; he lives in Collier's Rents with some woman—when I first went into the square I should imagine there were about eight or nine persons there fighting—there were more than that there, some fighting and some looking on—Regan was fighting, I think, with a man; but they were so mixed up together that really I could not tell—I did not go after him till the sergeant was struck—I saw him at the top of the stairs with a piece of iron in his hand—there was a candle-light in the room—I don't think there was a fire—I was out of the House directly after him—there were some people round the door, not a great many, more than a dozen, men and women.</p>

I was on duty on this Sunday morning by Collier's Rents, and seeing this disturbance I went to fetch Martin, who was on special duty, to help me—we then went to St. George's Square, and saw a number of the inhabitants fighting together—Timothy Regan was taking an active part in it—I have known him before—Martin tried to take hold of him to take him into custody, and he went in No. 1 and fastened the door—the prisoner's father and mother live in that house, and his sister too, I think, and the prisoner and her husband—we tried to disperse the people—I saw Regan throw something from the window—I did not see whether it hit Martin—about that time Sergeant Woods came up—I saw Mrs. Regan speak to him, and heard Regan call out "Stand aside, old woman, I will knock the b—brains out," and he immediately threw the ginger-beer bottle, which took the sergeant in the left arm near the shoulder—the sergeant and Martin went into the house—I remained at the door—I saw</p>

               <p>them go up stairs, and shortly afterwards I saw Regan and the sergeant tumble down stairs together—Regan came out—I went towards him to take him, but some one took me by the shoulder, put their legs between mine, and threw me over on my back—when I got up I saw the prisoner—she came down stairs behind the sergeant towards the sergeant—I and Martin followed Regan, but he escaped—I afterwards returned, and found the sergeant just coming out of the square bleeding and very weak—he made a complaint to me and gave me a description—I have known the prisoner for the last five years—I am quite certain she is the woman I saw coming down stairs towards the sergeant—I went back to the square with Webb, another constable, and went to No. 1—we found the door fastened—I heard a noise as of talking inside, and I called out—finding they would not admit me, I broke open the door, and on the ground floor I found the prisoner and some half-dozen others, her mother, her sister, and her husband amongst them—before I said anything the prisoner said "I did not touch one of the policemen"—I said "I shall take you into custody for stabbing the sergeant"—the said "I did not do it, I was in bed at the time"—she had got no dress on, merely her skirts and no boots—I took her out of the house—as we were passing by Angel Court a number of persons were there, and she turned round and said to them "For God's sake, don't let them take me, they will kill me before they get me out of the court"—we took her to the station—she was afterwards taken to the hospital and shown to the sergeant, and he identified her as the woman who struck him—she denied it, and said "If I get twenty years for it, I did not do it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Magistrate—I mentioned then that the prisoner said "I did not touch one of the policemen"—I am sure that was before I spoke to her—I did not mention her observation on the way to the station—I recollected it afterwards—I said there might be twenty people in the court not three or four paces from the sergeant—they would be at least twenty paces from him, nearly at the end of the court—there were as many as twenty people about the door and round the door when Martin came out, but they all followed him—Woods had not got up from the floor then—he got up scarcely a minute afterwards—I searched the house but could not find any weapon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, St. George's Square—about 11 o'clock on this Saturday night I was sitting smoking my pipe with Mr. Regan in the ground-floor room, and he was mending a pair of drawers at the same time—about 12.30, or from that to 1 o'clock, Timothy Regan rushed in, and three or four others with him, and went up stairs where the prisoner and her husband were—he shut the door when he came in, and bolted it—I can't say that I had heard any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on in the court before that—then the police came, and broke the door open, and rushed up stairs after <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan—the police were there about ten minutes, or it might be a little less, and <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan ran down, and the police after him—I was in the parlour all this time—when the police came in the prisoner came down in her nightgown and petticoat, and she says to me "<hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Downs, "she says, "they will break all my little bits of things;" "Hold your tongue," says I, "they will break nothing "—she stayed in there till the police ran out after <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan, and then she said "They will kill my poor brother," and out she ran with nothing on her feet, and her father followed her, and came back with her in about ten minutes—she had not a thing in her hand; no weapon of any kind—she came back into the parlour, and stayed there about half-an-hour with her husband, till the police came back and kicked the door in, relation of the Regans—he was not one of the men that ran up stairs with <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan—I don't know how he came there—I believe he is the husband of the prisoner's sister, by what I hear; I don't know his name—the front door had been broken before; it was the front room door that they kicked in the second time; the other door was out in the yard, broken all to pieces—when the police came back, they said "Open the door"—they had their staves up, and came in and said to the prisoner "You are the woman we want," and took her away.</p>

               <p>no relation—I am a waterside labourer—I remained in the room all the time till about 2 o'clock—I never heard any fighting outside—what first attracted my attention was Timothy Regan running indoors, and several others following him, a lot of <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>—I could not tell you their names—I should think there was about four of them—Buckley was one, the husband of the prisoner's sister—I know <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan—he is no friend of mine—I only know him by sight—I don't know what he is—I did not see anything that occurred at the window—I heard nothing up stairs, I heard a noise up stairs—I saw two policemen go up stairs, they burst open the door and rushed up—I did not see <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan with a poker, or anything in his hand—I saw him come down stairs and run out—I saw one of the policeman fall against the stairs—I could not swear that <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan upset him—the prisoner came down before <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan ran out—it was after the police went out that she said "They will kill my poor brother"—she was not very angry—she was in the ground-floor room when she said that—she went out into the court directly afterwards, and I lost sight of her—I did hot go outside the door—Mrs. Regan was there up stairs—I believe I had seen her in the parlour about a quarter of an hour before—she was sitting down there with us—she left when the police came—she was out when the fighting was going on—I expect she went out to fetch her daughter in or to look after her son—I don't know where she went—there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on at the time that I know of—the kitchen was very nearly full when the police came back, I could not tell you the names—I did not hear at that time that the sergeant had been wounded—there was the prisoner and her husband, Mr. Regan, and Buckley there, and others—I did not know the police were outside till they forced in the door—it was not my place to open the door—I did not know then that anybody had been wounded.—I had not heard it; I swear that.</p>

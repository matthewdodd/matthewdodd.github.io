I went out on the 23d of June and left the prisoner in care of my little child, and returned the 9th of August; the next day she brought a tablecloth of another person to be used at table. I ask'd her why she did not bring one of our own. She said she had put them in pawn, having no money, and had been to a relation of mine and could get none. I left her two guineas when I went out. She was to have seven shillings per week, and my brother deliver'd to her eleven shillings. I looked about and missed several things. Two days after I sent her to my lady Cardagan's with a bill.</p>

I then missed two table spoons and a pair of tea tongs. She left me a letter on the table, in which she told me she intended to leave London. I found the spoons and tea tongs afterwards at a pawnbroker's shop. When I took her up she confessed she took them, and told me where she had pawn'd them.</p>

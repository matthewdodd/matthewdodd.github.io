I have only three halfpence, and cannot pay"—she gave me back the rum, and I broke the florin in two, and let her go—I watched, and she joined Sale, I think it was, about 150 yards off—I missed her a few minutes, and then saw her with him—I followed them and overtook them about 300 yards from the house—they stood talking together at the end of Bonner-street and Green-street—they separated about fifty yards down William-street—Sale then stopped while West went into the Lion, when she got in, he went right opposite the house—before I got to the house West came out—I then went in, and Mr. Shaw showed me a bad florin—Mr. Shaw sent Ellis out with me—I pointed Sale out to Ellis—I overtook West, tapped her on the shoulder, and said, "You passed a bad florin to me just now, and said you had no money but three halfpence, and now you have just passed another one"—she said that a gentleman had just given it to her—I took her to Mr. Shaw's, and charged her—she gave Mr. Shaw some change, and a bottle with some liquor in it—Ellis came in while I was there without Sale—but in consequence of something, I saw, he went out again, and returned with Sale, who I gave into custody—I handed two out of the three pieces of the florin to the constable—I told Sale that he had been in West's</p>

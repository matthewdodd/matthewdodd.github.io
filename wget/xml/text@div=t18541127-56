                  </hi>. I was an engineer on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Adelaide</hi>, on her return from Melbourne to England—Captain Henderson was the captain—I believe the prisoners were shipped on board at Melbourne—two of them were seamen; Parkes was an officer—the vessel left Van Diemen's Land on 8th June, and arrived in the Downs in Oct.—Parkes was not an officer then, he had been disrated—I knew John Chapman; he was third mate of the <hi rend="italic">Adelaide</hi>—on 20th Oct. I saw Chapman lying on the deck, and Brazell and Smith were standing over his head, and about a dozen other men were at some distance off—I did not see Parkes at that time—while Chapman was lying on the deck I saw Brazell give him one kick on the head—after I saw him kicked I turned and spoke to Mr. Kinnear—I said, "They have got Chapman down, and are kicking him"—I looked round again, and Chapman was on his feet, and blood was coming trickling down his brow when he came aft—as near as I can remember the kick was on the right side of the head—the blood appeared to come in that direction—Kinnear went in the direction where Chapman was, but Chapman was on his feet, before he got there.</p>

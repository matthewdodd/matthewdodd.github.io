I keep a shop in John-street, Waterloo-road, Lam<lb></lb>beth—William Fewkes is my son—he absented himself from me on the 6th of January, and I lost five sovereigns, two half-sovereings, two half-crowns, and three shillings, from a box in my kitchen—my three girls slept in the bed in the kitchen, and the prisoner slept at the foot of it in a chair—the box was broken open—it had been safe at eleven o'clock the night before—I gave notice at the police-station—I went to Greenwich, and when I came back, a boy told me that my son and Connorton had been seen to<lb></lb>gether—I went to Connorton's father on the Sunday morning after—I Connorton there—he said he had seen my boy, and that he had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Did he tell you where he got it?"—he said, "Yes, he said he took it from you"—I said, "Where did you get those new boots you have on?"—he said, "I bought them, and I got the money honestly"—I gave him in charge—he told the inspector that this was all he bad out of the money—the Magistrate could not commit him till I took my son, and when I found my son, I took Connorton again.</p>

                  </hi>. I cart hay to town for Mr. W. Shepherd, of Great Warley, in Essex. I was in town on Thursday, June the 30th—I came with straw that day—I had some money of my master's about me, which I brought up to pay for things—I met the prisoner Leeds at a little after nine o'clock in the morning, as I was going up Whitechapel—I had got to town about eight o'clock—she asked me if I would go home with her—I asked her where it was—she said, "Just up the street"—I went home with her—I asked if she had any man at home—she said, no, she had got a room of her own—she took me up three pairs of stairs—she went in the room, and closed the door—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she</p>

I ran after him, and she after me—she called to him to throw the pot at my head, and knock me down—I got out of the house—I had got my master's money all safe, in the front of my shirt—I told the policeman of this, but they were gone—they were taken the next morning in bed, I believe—I am sure they are the same persons.</p>

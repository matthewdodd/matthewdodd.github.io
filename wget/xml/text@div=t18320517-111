            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I placed three reams and a half of paper in the shop on the 27th of April. On the morning of the 28th of April, Webb the prisoner, came in, and asked for a sheet of paper - I served him, and while I did that another man, whom I cannot recollect, came in; he produced one of Arnold's stone ink-bottles, and I supplied him with some ink, which I poured into his bottle - I saw such a bottle in the officer's custody; when the two men were gone an officer came in, and produced to me a ream of paper, which had a number and weight marked on it, similar to one of the reams which had been in the shop, and it was the same make; it was not opened - I did not miss a ream from the shop; I called the man up - my name is signed to this deposition.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is Webb the man who came into the shop? A. I am not sure of him, and the other man I do not know at all - I continued in the shop till the officer came; I did not see any thing taken, nor did I miss any property - I do not know, of my own knowledge, whether this paper was safe when they came in; they came about half-past nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JONES. I am journeyman to the prosecutor, I laid out three reams and a half of paper in his shop, and when the officer brought in one ream I missed one of them - I have no doubt this is one of those I laid out; it has the same marks, the same date and officer's name, and is the same progressive number within two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where had it been? A.Almost opposite the door inside the shop - I believe the lad was in the shop; I had left him there - here is the stamp on the paper, and the number of the mill; each mill has a different number - the progressive number on this is 2857, and the next we have is 2860; the other two might have been sold perhaps.</p>

            . I am ward-beadle of Queenhithe. -On the morning of the 28th of April I saw the three prisoners at the bottom of Bread-street-hill, about fifty yards from the prosecutor's - one of them had a bag, which appeared at that time empty; they moved off towards the prosecutor's premises; I saw Benson, the ward-beadle, coming up the hill - I called his attention to the circumstance; I remained at the hill, and saw Webb and Davis running up the hill again as fast as they could; I think this was not five minutes after I had seen the three together - I followed them up the hill and brought them back to the Horse and Dossiter - I there found the other officer with Wenman, the bag, and this paper; it was then about half-past nine o'clock - I had seen them looking about in company for nearly a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they not in custody at nine o'clock? A. No; I was not out at nine - I do not know which of them had the bag, but I can swear to their persons; I was about four houses from them, and was watching them.</p>

            . I am ward-beadle of Vintry, and live in Upper Thames-street.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had lost sight of them? A. Yes, after they had turned the corner of Bread-street-hill; whether one or more had been engaged in taking this I cannot tell - when I took Wenman he said two young men gave it to him.</p>

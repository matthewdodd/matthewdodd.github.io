            . I am a broker, and live at No. 1, New Tothill-street. On Saturday evening, a little before six o'clock, I was sitting on a table in front of my shop, and saw the prisoner run by me, towards Mrs. Gulliver's, and in a few minutes after I heard a noise with some boys playing, and saw the prisoner standing by Mrs. Gulliver's door - I saw him present his arm, saw the pistol flash, and heard the report; it was pointed towards Mrs. Gulliver's door - he then ran down the street by me, putting the pistol into his side pocket - I thought it was not worth while to stop him, and that he had merely fired to frighten the boys; I heard no more till eight o'clock, when Mrs. Gulliver's daughter stated the case to my wife - I went, and described the prisoner to Mrs. Gulliver, as she did not know who he was at the time; she said, "Well then, that is the man who lives next door;" I went next door with her - the prisoner was not at home; I went to the Police-station, informed Lowry, the inspector, and next morning I went with a Policeman to the prisoner's house - the Policeman knocked at the door, somebody asked who was there; the officer spoke in a sort of woman's voice, and the prisoner opened the door - the Policeman asked where he was last evening; he said his landlord had told him somebody had been after him, and said he was irritated in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170087"></xptr>his mind and did not know where he was; the officer asked where his pistol was - he said it was on the chair; he made towards the chair; the officer put him aside, away from the chair, and under a waistcoat on the chair were two pistols, which were both loaded, and both cocked - he directly demanded the officer's warrant to take him into custody; the officer told him he did not want a warrant to take him on a charge of that kind - he said, "I suppose I must go with you then;" after that I went and took the ball out of the door, and we found at his lodgings a bullet mould, some copper caps, gunpowder, and a leaden inkstand, which had been cut up for making the bullets - I compared the bullet in the door with the mould; it answers to it, and fits the pistol - I have seen the prisoner pass my door at times.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Shaw- his evidence is correct; I found in all three bullets, besides those in the pistols - he asked for my warrant; I said I had no occasion for one - he said, "Well, if you must take me, you must; the fact is, the people have troubled me very much next door, and I did not know what I was doing;" I did not know him before - I have made enquiry, and cannot find that he has been doing any thing lately; but, by a letter found on him, I understand he belongs to a respectable family.</p>
               <p>MRS. GULLIVER re-examined. Nobody was in my house to give him any annoyance; there was nobody in my house but my daughter, (who is thirty years old,) myself, and an old lady; my house was kept very quiet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. I do not know whether he talked to you about witches in your kitchen? -A. No; but I heard him say, before the Magistrate, that he had been troubled very much for four years by witches, noises, and sorcery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have had great noises in my head for the last four years, and my brains used to go round, and heat like streams of fire; and as I passed by the houses in the street, flashes used to come by my head; and, moreover, I think I am allied to the Royal Family - I have received great homage, when I was young, from people in carriages, and I suppose they took me to be an illegitimate son of the Duke of York; but my mother was not the celebrated Mrs. Clarke - when I went to Paris I was under the necessity of changing my name; I received similar homage at Paris, and military homage from the soldiers - I have been given to understand I was a descendant of George Rex, who lived at Combe and Delafield's brewing manufactory; I consider myself entitled to the dukedom of Lancaster - when I was at Hicklow, a lady came, very much like my grandfather; I think she was a child of Queen Caroline, the wife of George the Third - she came into the court-yard, and questioned the ostler about letting me have a horse, which he promised, and when I went into the yard, spurred, &amp;c. he said I must not have it; whether it was in consequence of the saddle I do not know, for my grandfather was a saddler - she went up the stairs of the next house, and from that night I heard the noise; but, the night after that, I saw a great flame, which scorched my body; and ever since that lady talked to me I have had a heat over my head; she was talking to me with others through the wall some time - she said my equipage would be ready soon, and I should go to town, and these Royal personages should be looked after; after that I went to shave myself, and as most people make faces when they save - I had the door open - a gentleman and lady came in, and hurt me tremendously; when I went down to dine there was a chair vacant - I understand it was for Prince Leopold; I dined, but no lady came, nor any equipage - I returned to my chamber, after stopping some time, and they left; I concluded that lady was the cause of the heat in my head, and I have had it ever since.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. This letter (looking at it) is his hand-writing - I received it from him from Paris; my father and mother are dead -I have received other letters of the same description from him; he has laboured under a delusion about witches and wizards ever since I have corresponded with him.</p>
               <p>The letter being read gave a long and incoherent account of the prisoner's connexion with wizards, and the influence they had over him, and a long history of gipseys, &amp;c.; it bore the Paris post-mark of May, 1829.</p>
               <p>MR. McMURDO. I am surgeon of Newgate. I have endeavoured to ascertain the state of the prisoner's mind since he has been in Newgate, and consider him insane during the whole period he has been here - I have conversed with him on a great many subjects, and on every subject he left that impression on my mind.</p>

            . I was the prisoner's landlord at this time - I have heard him speak about witches; he repeatedly said he was tormented with witches - he told me he fired this shot; that he did it, intending to be taken, that the public might know his troubles concerning these witches.</p>

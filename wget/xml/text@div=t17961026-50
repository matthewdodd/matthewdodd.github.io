On Saturday, the 15th of this month, I was drinking with the two prisoners at a public-house close to Whitehall; I had an acquaintance with me that knew them, and treated them; and this man said, if I would stand the value of about a pot of beer he would pay me again, and I did, it might be about eleven o'clock in the morning, and we kept company together till near five or six in the evening, and then I wished to go home to my apartments, and I paid for two pots of beer in Great Queen-street, and had change for a guinea, and they told me they knew of a decent place where there were two beds, and I might sleep comfortably, just by; I refused it, and after they saw me get change for this guinea, they told me I should not go, but should stop with them, and they insisted I should go with them, and I should be taken good care of; and one took me by one arm, and the other by the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk at this time? - A. I was not drunk at all, I might be rather the worse for liquor; they took me from thence to another house, and Stopford went to see for the lodgings; Stopford came in very soon after, and said he had got the lodgings, and then he desired me to pay for what we had had, and we would go to bed, and I paid for two pots of hot; I went with them, and a woman stood at the door with a light in her hand, and I was to sleep with one of them, and my acquaintance with the other, his name was Hancock, and then she lit Stopford and me into a little back room, and she went away; I undressed expecting Stopford to do the same, I fixed my breeches under the pillow, and Stopford says, damn you, you bugger, I have done you, have I, and ran down stairs as fast as he could, and then Lavery followed him down as fast as he could, I could see him between the two doors; then I threw up the sash to call the watch; a woman immediately, from the next room, called out, you bloody bugger, what do you do there, do you want to rob the house, how came you there; after this, the woman came in and threw my clothes into the passage, and said, if I did not get out directly she would throw my bloody melt down the stairs; finding myself in that state, I was glad to take my clothes in my hand, and go down stairs; when I got into the street, I called the watch. I lost out of my breeches-pocket, a guinea and a half in gold, eight shillings and sixpence in silver, my pocket-book, and my deputation belonging the Custom-house, and my new hat, which cost me half-a-guinea a few days before; when the watchman came, Lavery brought me the breeches, and said, here, take these, damn you, and don't say you were robbed here, or I will kick you up and down the street; the money was not in the breeches; the watchman asked me what was the matter; I told him I was robbed; Lavery came up, and I insisted upon the watchman taking charge of him, which he did, and took him to St. Giles's watch-house; and the other was taken up on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lavery. Q. Was it not your own proposal to go for a lodging? - A. No, it was not; I begged to go home, but when he saw me get change I could not get rid of him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HENRY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, I apprehended Lavery; I was calling the hour of mine, I found the prosecutor partly naked.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260045"></xptr>Q. Did you see Lavery give him the breeches? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lavery. Q.Did not I go quietly to the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not I searched? - A. Yes; and nothing found upon him but two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Stopford's defence. As I was going off guard, I met with this man and his comrade, and my comrade drinking together, and they asked me to drink with them, and we drank five pots, and we went to several houses, and had three or four pots a piece; he wished to have a lodging, and I got one, and when they saw it was four men, they would not let us sleep there, but said, their beds were for men and women, and they turned us out, and used us very ill, I did not take his things.</p>
               <p>Lavery's defence. I was never in the room with the prosecutor.</p>

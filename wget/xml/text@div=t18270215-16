            . I am a surgeon of Hanwell. On the 14th of January I was first called to attend the deceased at Hanwell; he was in the service of the prisoner, who lives at Hanwell, and is a <rs id="t18270215-16-deflabel82" type="occupation">chimney-sweeper</rs>

I was called in again on the 27th of January, about eight o'clock in the morning, and sent a message for them to put him into a hot-bath immediately, as they said he was in a fit; I went down in about half an hour and found him dead; there were no external marks of injury perceivable; I considered him, on the Saturday, to have died from apoplexy, which I then thought might have been occasioned by the wound he received on the 13th of January, and on the 30th of I was present when his head was opened.</p>

            . I live at Hanwell. The deceased was at my house on Monday morning, the 22d of January, a quarter before nine o'clock; he came and asked if I would have my chimney swept; I said No, it was too cold; I had not sent for any body to sweep my chimney - I knew he was in the prisoner's service; he asked me to give him a piece of bread and butter - I cut him a thick slice, and stood him by the fire to eat it; his master came and asked if he was there, and before I could speak he collared him, knocked him down, and beat him violently with a stick, which was rather thicker than my middle finger - he struck him over the loins and shoulders; and when he was knocked down, the left side of his head came against the wall; there was a sooty mark on the wall where his head had been; the child then went out - he laid hold of him by the collar and dashed him on the grating in front of my door; the poor boy cried, but said nothing; he struck him four or five times after he went out of the house, and struck him while he was on the ground; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150011"></xptr>poor child ran home; he repeated the blows till the stick broke, and I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long was he in your house? A. He might have been there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; you said something about "How long you have been gone," and hit him - he fell on his side in front of my house; his head did not touch the grating.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness, and live next door to Darben - Long came to my house about nine o'clock, on the 22d of January, and asked if I wanted my chimney swept; I had not sent for him; I said, No; he remained in my house about ten minutes warming himself, and then went to Darben's; in about ten minutes, I was up-stairs, and heard a noise; I looked out of the window and saw him laying on the grating; he got up, and the prisoner beat him down, as far as the cage, across the back with a stick.</p>
               <p>MR. G. J. R. J. DICKENSON. I am a surgeon, and live at Ealing. On the Tuesday after this boy died, I, Mr. Evans and Mr. Hutchinson examined his body; I opened his head, and on removing the scalp there was a mark of extravasation over the right temple bone, on the pericranium, another over the frontal bone, another at the back part of the head, inclining to the right - on removing the skull-cap there was a corresponding mark with that on the right temple bone within the scull; the whole brain was gorged with blood, and the frontal stylus ruptured; and in the ventricles there was a larger quantity of serum than there should naturally be; there was no appearance of disease whatever in the body; I attribute his death decidedly to the rupture of the frontal stylus; a blow, however inflicted, might occasion that, but the injury was decidedly very recently inflicted; his fall from the chimney could have nothing to do with it; he could not have lived an hour after the injury, nor could he have died on Saturday from the injury received on the Monday, or there would have been a very different appearance on the brain; his death could not have been occasioned by either of the transactions mentioned; I understand he swept three chimneys on the morning he died, and the injury must have been subsequent to that, for this is a very large vessel that was ruptured; he was a poor half-starved boy, as we found from dissection, and his vessels would not go on very actively.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. I was present on the 30th of January, and agree with Mr. Dickenson's statement; I attribute his death to the rupture of the stylus, which could not have been occasioned by either of the circumstances mentioned- when I saw him on Saturday he appeared to have been dead about half an hour.</p>

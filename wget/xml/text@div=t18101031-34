            . I am a servant to Mr. Jarman; on the 11th of October my master sent me to Bishop Stortford in Hertfordshire, to look after the horse; I met Mr. Dalby, a horse dealer, between Sapworth and Bishop Stortford; the prisoner was in company with him. Mr. Dalby asked me how I came there; I told him we had lost the brown horse, and I was coming to speak to him, to see if I could find him. Mr. Dalby said, it was of no use my going any further; to turn back; the prisoner asked me whose horse it was; I said Mr. Jarman's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Yes, he had lived some years near Newington. The prisoner said, you know me; I said yes, I know you. Mr. Dalby and I and the prisoner came a little way along the road as we expected; Mr. Dalby turned his head, the prisoner was gone; he had left his horse that he was riding before on the road; Mr. Dalby and I turned back towards the way the prisoner was gone; we proceeded into a field over a gate, where we supposed he had gone. Mr. Dalby found the prisoner in the field where he expected, a little way from the hedge, in the ditch; it was a bushy place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you he was endeavouring to conceal himself - A. Yes; Mr. Dalby called me; I went and assisted in bringing him down the field. He said, I have done the crime, and I must suffer for it; then we took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see your master's horse - A. I saw the horse on the Saturday afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I never saw him before the 11th of October; on the 11th of October I saw the prisoner; I am sure it is the man. On the 10th of October I slept at Harlow town; on the 11th I saw the prisoner at Sapworth, about six o'clock in the morning; he was walking and leading a brown horse; about two hundred yards before I overtook him, he turned under a shed where there was a rack and manger, as if he was going to feed the horse. I said, my friend, are you going to the fair with this horse; he said yes; I said, where did you bring this horse from; he said Rumford, it is my brother's; his name is Cook, he keeps a few cows, and draws the milk about with this horse; he has lately gone blind, and is shy when the lamps are lit; he will not stand still, he runs back. I asked him to pull the horse from under the shed; he did; he asked fourteen guineas for the horse; I asked him to run the horse; I could not cough him; I thanked him for the look of the horse; I went on. The horse was sold at Bishop Stortford fair to Wright; before I saw the prisoner there he sold the horse to Wright, a man that I hired to take care of my horses; Wright tied the horse up with mine; a gentleman asked the price of the horse; I sold him to Mr. Gutheridge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Wright bought the horse for you, did not he - A. He bought him and paid for it; before I saw him I sold the horse to Mr. Gutheridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness Redwood, coming to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the conversation pass that Redwood said - A. Yes; he was riding upon a mare then; after he had sold this horse he purchased a mare, and was riding upon that; I found the prisoner in the ditch among the bushes a Redwood has described; he left the horse in the road; I went into two or three fields before I found him. When Mr. Jarman saw the horse he claimed it; that is the horse that Wright bought, and I afterwards sold to Mr. Gutheridge. Mr. Jarman and I went down on the 11th, and Gutheridge gave it up.</p>

I had it a year and a half; I have no doubt in the world of its being my horse; I lost the horse on the Thursday; I saw it the day before; it is a cart-horse; I gave forty pounds for him a year and a half ago; I value him at twenty pounds.</p>

The Prosecutor deposed, that as she was going along in Bow Church-Yard, the Prisoner came up to her and pull'd off her Pocket, upon which she cry'd out, and a Gentleman followed the Prisoner, and a Coachman jumping off his Coach-Box apprehended him. The Pocket was not found upon him; the Coachman who apprehended the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171805300004"></xptr> Prisoner was not there, and the Prosecutor was cautious of swearing positively he was the Person that took her Pocket, it being dark; but said, by his person she did verily believe him to be the same. The Prisoner pleaded that he had been drinking, and was going along, and hearing a Cry of Stop Thief, ran to see what was the Matter, and so was apprehended by the Coachman. This pretence and the Gentlewoman's Cautiousness availed him so that the Jury <rs id="t17180530-18-verdict87" type="verdictDescription">

            . I was in Western-street on that night; I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor following him. I attempted to stop him, and he made a blow at me. He ran a few yards farther, and stopped another man of the name of Bess, who keeps a shoe-shop in that place. He laid hold of him, and said,"Here he is; here he is. I told you I would have him(looking at the prosecutor)." I am sure the prisoner is the man who I tried to stop. Mr. Bess was running the other way; I am sure he was not the man who the prosecutor was pursuing.</p>

I saw some persons running, and I followed them, and got up to the prisoner at the same time Mr. Rorke did. The prisoner was laying hold of another man, saying, "Here he is; I have got him." I searched the prisoner, and found a watch and a bad three shilling piece on him. I saw him running, and take hold of another man who was not running.</p>

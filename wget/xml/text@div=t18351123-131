                  </hi>. I am second mate of a vessel, at Woolwich-yard, in his Majesty's service, On the 21st of November, I went in a boat called a <hi rend="italic">launch,</hi> from Woolwich to Deptford creek—I had eleven persons in the boat including myself—William Gritten, the deceased, was on board—Daniel Kingsworth was the leading man in the boat—the crew consisted of seafaring men—Crawley's wharf is on the way from Woolwich to Deptford—when we got abreast of that wharf, six men were rowing our launch—Gritten was steering with the oar. not with a rudder—our boat was one of considerable weight and strength—between seven and eight tons burthen—I observed several colliers on the Greenwich side—they were a cable's length from us—I pulled the after oar, and had my back towrds the vessels coming down the river, and could not see—while I was rowing, I turned round, and saw a steam-vessel coming down—It was about a quarter past ten o'clock in the morning—I remember calling to the steersman to keep the boat set to the northward, as that would be the</p>

               <p>better way—at that time the steamer was about three times her own length from us—the stecrsman did not immediately obey my directions, but hesi<lb></lb>tated—Daniel Kingsworth immediately took hold of the oar, in order to sweep to the north immediately—he did not take it out of his hand—I waved my land to the man on the starboard paddle-box, and called to him to keep to the southward—I did not see him take any notice at all—Kingsworth told us all to give way, meaning to pull hard to the northward—that was done immediately—the steamer Kept approaching us very fast indeed, and then ran on board out boat—she struck about two feet before the <hi rend="italic">after-thwart,</hi> on the larboard side—that is, across the gunwale, about six feet from the stern—the boat went down immediately—I don't know whether the men in the boat were silent before this, for I was calling out myself, and my voice drowned their voices—If they did, I heard none but my own—there is a neck of land in the river where this happened—we were above the point of land, and every thing was clear in our way except the steamer—our boat was about a cable's length from the land—It went down about two cables' length from the neck of land—the steamer could have seen our boat a considerable way off—the point of land would not keep her from seeing us—she was coming down, and we were abreast of Crawley's wharf—we had cleared the point—we could not see the steamer till we had cleared the point, and the steamer could not see us—It was flood tide—we were going with the tide, and she was coming against tide—she was going at little better than half her speed—at the time she struck us she was going six or seven knots an hour—she sould go eleven knots with her full speed—the first thing I observed after rising from under the paddle-wheel which I was thrown under, was their lowering a boat to assist us—I recol<lb></lb>lect seeing a man in the bow of the boat that was being lowered—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the dead body of Gritten, at the coroner's inquest—If he had steered to the northward, as I told him, the vessel would not have come athwart us—we should have gone in shore.</p>

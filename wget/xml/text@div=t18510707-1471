               <p>salesman, in Newgate-market. On 28th June the prisoner came to me, in a butcher's blue frock, and asked for two dead lambs, in the name of Appleton—we have a customer of that name—I pointed them out to him—I do not know what he did with them—he went away, and I have not seen them since—I did not miss them till they were sent for by Mr. Appleton's man, whom I knew—I afterwards went into Newgate-street and saw the prisoner there, dressed differently to what he was when he came to me—I spoke to him about the lambs, and he hesitated, and said he supposed they had gone wrong—he said there were two pigs, and he had no pigs of me at all—he walked away—I followed him down Newgate-street, and he said, "Don't follow and insult me like that."</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him take the lambs away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; no one else was with him—I did not see anybody go away with him—I have known him a good many years—I have heard one or two trifling things against him, but I do not know them to be the fact—I have heard that he was charged, seventeen years ago, with murder, because a big man struck him, and he struck him again, and killed him—he was acquitted—that was introduced before the Alderman, but not by me—I delivered two pigs that day to a Mr. Coram—I should not know the man who took them away—this is my signature to this deposition (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was read over to me before I signed it—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, stated that the prisoner came with another man</hi>)—he did not come with some other man who came after the pigs—no other man came with him about the lambs—I swear that other man did not take the lamb away—(<hi rend="italic">the deposition stated "there were two of them together; the other one took them; the prisoner helped him on with them; I did not deliver two pigs to the man with him; I did not see him take the pigs away; I was busy at the time</hi> ")—I saw neither pigs nor lambs taken—I swore before the Magistrate that the prisoner helped the other man up with them, because they generally do when two come together—I swear the pri<lb></lb>soner is the man who came for the lambs—I may have said I thought I had made a mistake—the other man was outside, at Guildhall, and ran away—I did not make any statement to the Magistrate about him.</p>

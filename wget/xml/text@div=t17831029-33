               <p>Mr. RUNNINGTON Council for the Prosecution thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>You will favor me with your attention, as council on the part of this prosecution, and gentlemen, the offence with which the prisoners stand charged, is for feloniously stealing nine promisory notes, each of the value of ten pounds, and a bill of exchange of the value of above two hundred pounds; it behoves me likewise to state to you gentlemen, that this is an offence created by act of parliament, for until the reign of King George II. the stealing of instruments of this complection was not felony; the facts I have to state to you, are simply of this description: Messrs. Cotton and Gooch, who live at Yarmouth, were in possession of certain bank notes, nine of which are stated in the indictment, and a bill of exchange, all payable in London, those nine promisory notes, and this bill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290100"></xptr> of exchange they remitted, as was their usual custom, through the medium of the Yarmouth coach, on the 22d day of January last; the remittance was made in the usual way by a parcel directed to Mr. Lee, in London, he being their agent and correspondent in this town.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of January, I am given to understand, about the hour of four in the afternoon, the Yarmouth coach arrived, and from every circumstance attending that conveyance on the 22d and 23d of January, there is every reason to apprehend and firmly to believe that this parcel arrived safely at the Green Dragon inn, in Bishopsgate, that being the inn where this coach usually puts up in this town: arriving at this inn, Mr. Lee who had had two informations of the parcel as early as he could, he made very diligent inquiry for the parcel, but it was not forthcoming, and he soon found it had been stolen, but was ignorant how it had been stolen; the parties themselves likewise remained ignorant of the truth of the transaction till the month of August last: in the month of August, this matter having slept from January till that month, they received information from a party, who, I am very ready to confess, is not of very immaculate description, but they received information sufficient for them to be active and enquiring about the felony that had been committed on these promissory notes; they were given to understand that this parcel with the notes had come into the possession of the prisoners at the bar, and, I am sorry to remark to you, Gentlemen, that the unhappy men at the bar, are, as stated to me, brothers; that they are sons to a man who is book-keeper to the Green Dragon inn; and a fact which I am now to state to you, is simply this; that on the 23d of January, these young men, the prisoners at the bar, sent for one Barnett, the party to whom I just alluded, and sending for him, he was in company at that time with one Hart, and which Hart I am likewise very ready to confess is not of that correct line of conduct that I could wish him to be; Hart going to Barnett, Barnett was given to understand, that the Jordans wanted to speak to him.</p>
               <p>The Jordans, I understand, are the unhappy men at the bar, and that what they wanted with him was a matter of private concern; it was therefore intimated that it ought not to be communicated in the presence of a third person.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Barnet on this hinted that Hart was a friend of his; on that they immediately, or at least one of them, applied to Barnet, producing the notes now in question, and desiring him to get those notes paid, offering at the same time to him a very considerable inducement to the amount of 100 l. for the purpose of getting the cash. Barnet, of whatever address he might be in circumstances of this sort I know not, but he thought proper at the moment to make application to Hart the witness. All this, you see, Gentlemen, was in the presence of both the prisoners at the bar, and of Hart the witness. Hart, I understand, accepted this part of the business: he took the nine notes of ten pounds each; he took the bill of exchange of 200 l. and undertook, at the same time, to get cash upon them all.</p>
               <p>The nine notes, which were payable on demand, were upon the 24th day of January sent to the banker's house in London, the house of Messrs. Bevan and Co. in Lombard-street, and were there paid. The moment the money was received, it was given by Hart to Barnet, and by Barnet to the prisoners at the bar, in the presence of Hart, and for which I understand Barnet received a compensation upon the nine notes of thirty or thirty-five guineas.</p>
               <p>You will now, Gentlemen, entertain of the conduct of Hart, I am very well convinced, no very favourable opinion; but if he should appear to you and to the learned Judge upon the Bench in the light of an accomplice, you will recollect, Gentlemen, that he will at the most only be an accomplice after the fact was committed, notwithstanding what may have been his former conduct; and you will at least bear one thing in your minds and recollections, that in all transactions of this description, were it not for the communications of men under these bad habits and tempers of mind, very few individuals would be brought to this bar, and very few public crimes would be brought to public punishment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if the evidence of Hart should require corroboration, it is stated to me that his evidence can be corroborated by the evidence of a woman who was present at the time, when the information was given to Barnet to attend the persons of the prisoners at the bar, and who was likewise present at the time that the money was paid. If this evidence should satisfy you, I am apprehensive the fact will be sufficiently corroborated; but if you have a doubt of the evidence, if you think Hart unworthy of your attention, you will pay it no attention, and this prosecution must drop to the ground. But if, from the whole complexion of the case, you are satisfied there is some criminality in the defendants<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290103"></xptr> you will call on them to shew how these notes were received; and if they do by evidence to your satisfaction prove themselves guiltless of the charge, independent of the evidence of this woman and Hart, much, to be sure, may not then rest upon their evidence. But I am instructed to say that that there are two other witnesses to be produced, not incorrect in their conduct, and altogether unknowing of any part of the transaction: they will not, I confess, go to the great line of the prosecution, but they will go to some of the minute parts of it. I have the evidence of the porter whom Hart procured to receive the money of the bankers, and who received the money upon the nine promissory notes at the banking house, and paid that money to Hart. I have likewise another witness of a similar description, who took the 200 l. bill of exchange, meaning to get it for payment; but not being conversant in business, and it being only for acceptance, the bill was stopped.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if upon the whole of this case you are satisfied in your own minds and consciences that the prisoners at the bar are guilty, you will discharge your duty and your consciences, and find them so: if, on the other hand, you think the evidence doubtful, if you think it ought not to be received, you will then exercise the other part of your conduct, and acquit them.</p>
               <p>(The witnesses examined apart at the request of the prisoner's council.)</p>

               <p>Who was it directed to? - Mr. Lee, I made an entry of it in the way-bill, I speak now with certainty from my memory.</p>

               <p>You did not make any entry of what it contained? - No, only a small paper parcel.</p>
               <p>And you forwarded it in the usual way? - Yes.</p>

               <p>In what way? - In the way such parcels are generally put in the coach.</p>

               <p>I am one of the proprietors of the Yarmouth coach, I live at Braintree, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290104"></xptr> is on this side Bury, it stops there to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the coach coming to Braintree on the 23d of January last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect on that day any parcel being in that coach, directed to Mr. Lee of London? - Yes, Sir, very well, I took notice of the parcel, and read the directions, it was a small parcel, but whether it was brown or whitish brown paper, I can-recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you it in your hand? - I had, I took it up, and read the directions.</p>
               <p>After you had taken it up, to whom did you deliver it? - I laid it down upo n the rest of the parcels that lay in the yard, and I told the man who was loading the coach to be very particular in it, for I believed it to be a parcel of value.</p>
               <p>What might induce you to think that a parcel of value? - We frequently have those parcels from Mess. Gouch and Cotton to Mr. Lee; Mr. Lee was then I believe a banker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Being a parcel of value, as you thought, you laid it down on the other parcels that were in the yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the way that you do with parcels of value? - Yes, the man was putting them in the coach.</p>
               <p>How many parcels were left behind that day? - Ten or eleven, but never a paper parcel.</p>
               <p>The others I hope were not parcels of value? - The coachman made a mistake, he unloaded his boot, and he left the guard to unload the remainder.</p>
               <p>Whether this parcel contained bank papers or any other papers, you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>Or whether any thing had been taken out you do not know? - No, this is not one of the parcels that was left behind.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - By seeing the parcels in the way-bill.</p>
               <p>Then you only speak by the way-bill; but supposing any body had come in and taken one out of the yard, did not you think it very odd that these gentlemen should keep you from your proper due, by paying for this as a parcel of no value? - They commonly did so; they run the hazard.</p>
               <p>Who re-loaded the coach? - The guard did; he alone was the person that re-loaded the coach, not the coachman. We change horses sometimes, but not coaches. It stops no where to breakfast near town; they breakfast at Braintree, and come to London to dinner.</p>
               <p>Who had you in the coach that day? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How many had you? - Five from Braintree in the inside of the coach.</p>
               <p>What became of them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Nor where the parcel was put? - I was informed by the guard it was put in the seat of the coach.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any parcel directed for Mr. Lee? - Yes, vastly well; I took it out of one coach, and put it into the other: I put it into the seat of the coach. It was a small parcel, as broad as my hand, inclosed in whitish-brown paper, directed for Mr. Lee: I saw no other parcel directed for him. My master came into the yard, and took up the parcel, and gave it to me, and said, Bob, take care of this, it comes to my friend Lee, and is of consequence. I put it in the fore seat of the coach, at the near corner, and came with the coach. We stopped first at the Angel at Rumford, to change horses; but nobody got out.</p>
               <p>Court. Could the coach seats be opened without all the passengers got out? - No: I came with the coach to London.</p>

The coachman that drove there was coming to London: this man took some parcels out of the boot of the coach, and he bid me unload the coach. He took out five or six parcels. I suspected he had got every thing out. I never looked into the boot.</p>
               <p>Who were the people in the coach that day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was not there a woman in the coach? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect whether there was a woman in the coach, or whether they were all men; that you do not know: Did you set any body down at Houndsditch? - Yes, a young woman; we took her up, and set her down at Houndsditch; she was an outside passenger. I do not recollect there was a woman in the coach.</p>

               <p>How long have you been guard to this coach? - Ever since the first of last September was a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, now, in which seat of the coach you happened to put this parcel? - In the fore seat, next the horses.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the directions of any other parcels that came to the coach that day? - No; I have no business to look at the parcels: I should not have had any particular knowledge of that, if it had not been for my master.</p>

             is son to the book-keeper: I saw him take them, and more than that, I saw him looking over the directions of the small parcels at the warehouse door, as I was taking my money of the passengers.</p>
               <p>When did you miss the parcel in question? - As soon as ever I went into the warehouse, our book-keeper said here is a paper parcel missing, and I am afraid it is something of value.</p>
               <p>(The way-bill produced and read.)</p>
               <p>"A parcel directed to Mr. Lee, and one paper parcel directed to No. 10, and to take 1 s." - and the parcel was missing.</p>
               <p>Court. I see here are 9, 10, and 11 missing? - I came from Bury that morning, and I was obliged to come all the way to London; I desired the guard to unload the coach while I went home, and I took out five articles to put down in the weigh-bill: the guard thought I had unloaded the whole boot. When we first called them over, those three were missing.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. Did the other parcels arrive at any time? - They came by our coach the next morning, and all right.</p>
               <p>This parcel did not come, directed to Mr. Lee? - If it was put into the coach it came: I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. In what manner is the way-bill made out when the things are loaded? - We always call them over as we take them into the coach; the book-keeper makes out the bill, and numbers the parcels.</p>
               <p>Are the parcels numbered when they are booked, or when they are loaded? - When they are booked.</p>
               <p>When you load the coach, do you call them over by the number, and load them by the number; as thus, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, regularly? - Yes, that is our usual way.</p>
               <p>Are not the numbers that stand next to one another in the way-bill, loaded next to one another in the coach? - That is according to the size of them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290106"></xptr>Court. Then the number in the waybill is taken from the book, and not as they put them into the coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Because the three numbers that follow one another appear all to be missing: of what kind is your coach-seat? - The seat turns up after the cushion is taken off: there is a flap like a box-lid; it is not locked; we only lay the cushion over it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what number of passengers you carried up from Braintree? - Five from Braintree, and one at Mr. Wood's, which made six. I do not remember any getting out, but one at a time. I had never less than four in the coach at one time.</p>
               <p>Then the coach-seat could not be lifted up so as to put a hand in without the knowledge of all the people in the coach? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You never saw the parcel? - No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Have you any knowledge to whom you paid that note? - To a porter, but his person I do not recollect (The bill of exchange produced). This bill was presented about three days before it was due, by a porter, a very suspicious looking person, we told him to bring it the day it was due; it was then brought by another porter, he was asked who he received it for, he said he received it for a gentleman at Old Lloyd's Coffee-house, a clerk was sent with the porter to Old Lloyd's Coffee-house, when he came there the gentleman was gone, upon which the bill was brought back, and it remained at our house till Mr. Cotton came for it, who was one of the partners; this was after we were informed that these bills had been lost.</p>

             is guilty of this crime he deserves a severe punishment, if he is not guilty, it is a wicked combination of the most profligate people, to charge an innocent man with the crime of which they have been guilty of themselves.</p>

You have had a very narrow escape on the present occasion, the evidence was extremely strong, and the Jury have founded their opinion on the total discredit they gave to the witnesses: I hope and trust, the whole charge has been totally false and malicious: But if you have in your own mind any consciousness to the contrary, this day's business will be warning to you.</p>

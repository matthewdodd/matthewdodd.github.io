            . Q. Did you lose a great coat on the 10th of December last - A. Yes. The prisoner, on the 9th came to my landlady, and enquired for a lodging. He went to bed about eight o'clock, on the 9th, in the same room with me, but in another bed. He got up the next morning about six o'clock; I got up a few minutes before seven o'clock. I returned to breakfast about eight o'clock, and I missed my great coat from off the bed. The prisoner told me that he had pawned my coat at Islington. I went to his mother's on the Sunday, and there the prisoner gave me the duplicate. The constable took him in custody. The pisoner owned to me that he did the robbery.</p>

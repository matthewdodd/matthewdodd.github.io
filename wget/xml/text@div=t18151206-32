            . I live in Short street. On the 28th of October, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was going home to <placeName id="t18151206-32-crimeloc179">St. George's turnpike in the East</placeName>

I was going along the back lane, and I saw the prisoner running very fast at the other side of the way. He crossed the street, stepped up to me, trod on my foot, and said, halloo! and then snatched my watch out of my pocket. I then sang out stop thief, and he was immediately stopped by a young man; he was not got five yards before he was stopped; I went up to them; it was a little dark, but it was opposite to a butcher's shop, where he ran against me, and there was plenty of candle-light; when I came up to him, I knew him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were you sober - A. I was sober, I had not left my work five minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he was sober how he came to give the watchman a shilling for seeing him home - A. I did not give any shilling.</p>

            . I was in Back lane, on this night; the first thing I heard was a cry of stop thief! I turned round, and saw the prisoner running; I stood where I was, until he came up to me; he ran against a man, and knocked me down into Mr. Tyler's shop,; that man was some distance from me. The prisoner crossed the road, and I crossed the road at the same time, and caught him in my arms when I caught him, he twisted me round, and something dropped from him; I heard something fall, but I did not see it. A young man stooped and picked it up; he afterwards produced a watch, and gave that watch to the patrole; I do not know the young man. I saw Ryners come up in a minute or two afterwards, and when he came up he said, thet that was the man who robbed him; the watch was shwen to him in the house. The prisoner did not say anything. There were a great number of persons assembled, and the patrole and others had hold of his collar. The prosecutor was not in liquor at the time,</p>

The prosecutor saw that watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060019"></xptr>and claimed it, and he was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I was officer of the night, for that night. The prisoner was given into my charge and I received this watch (producing it,) from the patrole. The reason the watchmen went with the prosecutor was, to find out where he lived, for he wanted to have done with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along, and seeing people running, I ran too, and then this gentleman stopped me, and the prosecutor said it was I that robbed him.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, in going over the evidence to the Jury, informed them, that if they should be of opinion that the prisoner ran against the prosecutor, and trod on his toe, in order that he might give himself an opportunity of the more imperceptibly completing his purpose, that would in law be sufficient force to constitute a Highway robbery.</p>

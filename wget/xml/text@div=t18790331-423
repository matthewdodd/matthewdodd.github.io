I am a member of the firm of Arnati and Harrison, of 11 and 12, Great Tower Street, City—we are agents of the Belgian Steamer the Baron Osy—I produce a bill of lading dated 23rd August, 1878, referring to 100 bags of wheat meal—it is consigned to M. Jackson and Co., and endorsed first by M. Jackson and Co., then delivered to M. B. Tate, undersigned B. D. Buhler, 64, Hop Exchange, signed M. B. Tate—it then holds our stamped release to the ship to deliver the goods—if the goods are not claimed we have a lighter in attendance on the ship, and all goods not claimed wo put into it on what is understood at the Custom House as a captain's entry; they were not claimed, and consequently were put into a Custom House lighter—they were landed there—we do not warehouse them, we merely land them on the quay—the bill of lading was left with us against an order on Custom House Quay for the goods—I gave this order in exchange for the bill of lading and payment of freight charges—the order authorises the wharfinger to deliver the goods to the holder of it.</p>

I am medical officer of health of the City of London—I received a sample order marked "G" from Mr. Alexander on 30th or 31st December last for the purpose of analysis—I went with Inspector Payne to the Custom House and got the sample myself from Bull Quay—I got it from the bags marked "HG"—I analysed that sample—it consisted almost entirely of sulphate of lime, plaster-of Paris—I ascertained by direct chemical microscopical examination that there was no organic substance of</p>

               <p>any kind, no farina—I also compared it microscopically with the appearance of the common plaster-of-Paris, which I got at a neighbouring builder's, and the result was as I have stated, that it consisted of sulphate of lime—I then obtained the ash by incineration, and found it was 78.6 per cent of the whole substance, the normal weight of the ash of flour being about 7-10ths or 8-10ths of 1 per cent.—it was entirely conclusive that it was not meal—I also checked that experiment by what is termed "Barker's test" a chloroform test—by that test, if there is any organic matter it floats at the top, if mineral it sinks to the bottom, leaving the supernatant fluid perfectly pure and clear and pellucid—in this case nothing floated, it sank to the bottom as if metallic—in addition to sulphate of lime there was a white earth, commonly called white clay—I had a small portion of stuff submitted to me by Mr. Alexander, which had been tried to be converted into bread, and it was nothing more than lumps of plastor-of-Paris—subsequently to that I obtained from the inspector two loaves made by a French baker, Mr. Gandais, of Dean Street, Soho—I also tested the plastic nature of the material by making with it an animal's head—there was flour or meal in the loaves.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have not got the samples that I analysed here—on touching flour with your linger it is perfectly smooth; this was practically gritty, not quite gritty—I should not say that any one taking a portion of the bulk would directly find that it was not flour; I have said that the feel of it by the finger would almost determine that it was a mineral and not an organic matter; I will not unsay that, I wish to qualify it—Mr. Otto Hainer did not act with me in making the analysis; no one assisted with me; there was no check on my analysis that I know of—I checked every process by a subsequent test—Mr. Hainer is undoubtedly a perfectly scientific gentleman—I have not the pleasure of knowing Dr. Hassall—my attention has never been called to the sise used to stiffen paper—I know nothing of the export value of flour—I have not certified that a Mr. Chit<lb></lb>tenden sold 1 ton of this very mixture to paper-makers at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton; I know it now for the first time—I have not seen Mr. Buhler's books.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> An inexperienced person not in the habit of analysing or testing matter would not be able to say whether it was flour or not simply by the touch—two samples of a mixture like this from the same bulk would not differ very much as to the quantity of the component parts—they would to a certain extent—I made two previous analyses of this for Mr. Alexander, and the results were singularly conclusive, the difference being only one figure in the second place of decimals in the three analyses—I do not consider it quite pure plaster-of-Paris—if what was mixed with it was white clay, as I presume it was, it would be of less value than the plaster-of-Paris, and it would be worth less as a mixture.</p>

Arnati and Harrison and I obtained a release from them from Custom House Quay—I deposited that order at Custom House Quay, and paid all charges due on it up to that time—I submitted the sample of real flour which Buhler gave me to my buyers, and sold on that sample—as soon as the vessel arrived I passed my order to the buyers—they went down and examined it, and finding what it was they rejected it—they brought me up a sample, a bagful; I examined it, and quite agreed with them—I then wrote to Buhler, and afterwards went and saw him—I told him that the 100 bags of flour, or representing flour, wag nothing but a lot of ground chalk or plaster-of-Paris, that the sale had been repudiated in consequence, and I wished to have nothing more to do with it, and demanded back my charges—I took the sample that had been brought back by my customers and showed it to him, and left a part of it with him; that was on 26th August, the same day my buyer had refused it, within half an hour afterwards—he said that he himself had been deceived, that he knew nothing of it, that he had advanced, I think he said about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and that he should take proceedings against the party who had misrepresented the matter to him—he paid me my charges immediately—he did not at all dispute the fact of its being plaster-of-Paris or chalk; he did not seem to know anything more about it, he accepted my statement—I handed him this retransfer order (H) transferring the 100 sacks from myself to him—I saw him again I think about three week afterwards, at the Hop Exchange, I was in com<lb></lb>pany with Mr. Cohnhoff—I asked him how it was that he had made use of my order after I had told him what the stuff was in the sacks, in order to get an advance from Messrs. Barker and Co.; I expressed myself annoyed at his having done so—he replied "I have not done anything of the sort, if it has been done, it has been done by some one without my consent"—I then explained to him that I had seen Messrs. Barker and Co., at the invitation of Mr. Cohnhoff, their agent, and they had told me that an order had been presented to them with my name on it, asking for an advance on 100 bags of flour; that I asked who by, and they told me the order had been presented to them by a Mr. Natzler—Buhler then said "If Natzler has shown them a sample of pure flour, he has done it on his own responsibility"—I think the matter then virtually ended—he did not explain how the transfer order which I had given him got into Natzler's hands.</p>

Steitz and Co., I can highly recommend to you. He has some business to propose to you which may suit your bank. Yours faithfully, B. D. Buhler." I knew Buhler slightly previous to that—Steitz told me that he had been to his banker's, the Imperial Bank, with a view of getting an advance upon a quantity of flour, meal—he said "meal," and he showed me a delivery order that he had written in favour of the manager of the Imperial Bank, hat he was told that they did not advance on that class of securities, and he came to me with that letter of introduction to see if he could get the advance from my bank—I told him that the Anglo-Belgian Bank was not doing any business—it was just before the liquidation—he then told me that he was in some difficulty, having a bill to meet that day, that he had been disap<lb></lb>pointed in getting money in, and that the refusal of the Imperial Bank to make the advance had put him in some perplexity—after some little con<lb></lb>versation, as I felt rather sorry for him, I asked him what was the least amount he could do with to tide him over the difficulty—he first asked 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Steitz, Steitz and Co."—I must have mentioned Mr. Dale's name before this—I happened to have a circular of his on my desk which I had received some days before, and that suggested his name—Steitz asked me how long the examination would take—I said "I cannot tell, it will depend on Mr. Dale's engagements, but to expedite matters, as you seem to be in a hurry, you may take my letter authoris<lb></lb>ing Mr. Dale to make the examination, to Mr. Dale yourself"—he did not produce this transfer order (H)—I never saw it till I saw it at the Mansion House—I don't know that he produced any transfer order to me—he must have given Mr. Dale a sampling order—he did not give me a document that day describing the stuff as meal—he came next day, Mr. Fowler was present during part of the interview—I can't tell whether he saw the word "meal" here—during the conversation Mr. Fowler said "Why is this described as meal?"—that was on the first day—Steitz said, "Those people on the other side are probably un<lb></lb>acquainted with English, and they use the word meal because the German word stands for meal, or flour"—I asked him on the first occasion what bis business was—he said he was a wholesale toy merchant—I asked how he became possessed of this meal—he said it had been deposited with him by a person who was a debtor to him, and he had the depositor's authority to raise money on it—I said "Why does not the debtor sell this and pay you?"—he shrugged his shoulders, and made a gesture—I did not ask him who the depositor was—he did not say whether it was Buhler or no—he came twice next day—I saw Mr. Dale before he came the second time—the first time he asked if I had received Mr. Dale's report—I said I had not, and he went away—when he came again I agreed to advance him the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he signed this agreement, and gave me this delivery order (H), and I gave him a cheque for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which he gave me a promissory note—the condition of the agreement was that the money was to be repaid on 28th December, and in default of payment I should be at liberty to sell the security—Mr. Dale's report was verbal—subsequently Steitz came and gave me permission to sell at once—I gave Mr. Blaisher, a commission agent, an order to take out a sack in the name of Mr. Gandais, and he afterwards brought me some specimens of bread that had been made—I don't remember the date—I then called on Steitz and asked him for an explanation—I cannot fix the date of that; I should say it was about eighteen or twenty days after I had made the advance—I called several times with<lb></lb>out being able to see him—when I did see him I was very angry, and 1 used some very strong language—I produced the samples to him and said, "It is an atrocious swindle; who is behind you in this matter?"—he</p>

               <p>declined to say; he quibbled a little and said that he would see his friend George Lewis before he gave up the name of the parties from whom he got the flour—I said, "Is Mr. Buhler in this matter?"—he fenced with the * question; he did not answer it—he said that he had not long been in England, and he would see his friend George Lewis and be guided by his advice—I said, "Do so, by all means"—he afterwards came to me at Putney, 1 was confined at home by indisposition—he said he had seen Mr. Lewis, who had told him to give up the name of the gentleman from whom he had this stuff, and that it was Mr. Buhler—he came to me again with a solicitor's clerk and offered me the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the amount of the advance, which I declined to take—on January 2nd I saw Buhler at his office,; before that I had reported the matter to Dr. Saunders—I went to him with a specimen—I had had his report when Steitz came and offered me the money, and before I saw Buhler—I wrote to Buhler before Christmas, and he replied that he was going out of town, and would not be back till the beginning of January—when I saw him I said that I had waited till then because I wanted to hear hit ex<lb></lb>planation, as I conceived the matter was a swindle or worse—at first he said he knew nothing about it, and then he said that he had never authorised Steitz to come and offer the stuff to me—I believe he said that he intended Steitz to produce some bills to the bank for discount; that Steitz had applied to him for a loan which he was not in a position to make, but having this stuff there he had given it him with liberty to raise money on it, instead of advancing cask, but the object of his introduction to me was with a view of the bank discounting some bills—I did not ask him how the meal got into his hands; he showed me a bill of Jackson's; he said that he had himself been deceived, and he showed me a day-book referring to some sales, and so forth—he also showed me this agreement, signed on 11th December, between Steitz and himself for the division of the proceeds of the sale of this stuff; I am not sure whether the asterisk and the foot-note were there at the time. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Mr. B. D. Buhler. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your order on Custom House Quay for 80 bags, supposed to be meal (<hi rend="italic">a mixture</hi>), which I received in trust for sale for you, and shall render you cash account directly after the sale.") Buhler said "As I could not sell it myself I thought somebody else might"—he was very indignant with Steitz, and said he was disposed to take proceedings against him for abusing his name and his introduction—he said, "I am not going to pay this money"—, I stopped him and said, "Don't talk to me about paying; because I have not spoken about it, and I am not going to allow you to talk to me on the subject, inas much as I have taken steps to bring the parties to justice, and I only wanted to see you to give you a chance of giving an explanation"—I then turned my back on him and walked out—I think I know Buhler's writing; I believe this to be hist (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "August 26, 1878. From Buhler to Messrs. M. Jackson and Co. I have inspected the flour for which I advanced you 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and find the sample you submitted to me is entirely different from the bulk; indeed, the latter is no flour at all, but plaster-of-Paris.

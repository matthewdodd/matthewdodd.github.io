                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road—the prisoner, Francis Chamberlain, was my shopman. On the 6th of January, I saw him give his father a brass fender, and my attention was called to the articles stated, which I missed—I went to the house of the elder prisoner at half-past ten o'clock that night—I knocked at the door—he was in bed—I rung the bell—he kept me waiting some time at the door—at last he came—I then said, "Oh, Mr. Chamberlain, I have called for a brass fender, if you please—he looked at me some time but said nothing—I said again that I had come for a brass fender—he denied having one—he then asked me in and said, "How is this, where is Fran<lb></lb>cis?"—Isaid, "Never mind, I want a brass fender, a pair of trowsers, and a piece of cotton, which you have had away from my house to<lb></lb>night, and I won't lose sight of you till I have them"—he said they were not there—he then said, "Come along up stairs, and I will see about it"—he took me up and down two or three different times—I said, "It is no use running about in this manner, if you don't give me my property directly I will smash one of the windows and call for a policeman"—he said, "Don't do that, there is no occasion for that, I will give them you"—he then took me down stairs into a back yard and I said, "There is your fender, take it"—I</p>

               <p>saw the carpet lying down by it, and I said, "This is my carpet, I shall take it"—he said, "Take it, if you dare, it belongs to my landlady"—I said, "I am your landlord, it is my carpet, and I shall take it"—I was not his landlord—I then said, "I now want a pair of trowsers, and a piece of cotton"—he took me into a room, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them at me, and said, "There is your trowsers, and there is your cotton"—I had two policemen waiting outside—I called them in, and wished them to call the landlady down, and ask her if the carpet was hers—the prisoner said, "You need not do that, it is not hers"—the policeman found this coat, waistcoat, and hearth-rag, which are mine—the prisoner dared me to touch the coat and waistcoat, and said they were made for his son some time before—he threatened to knock me down—I looked at the sleeve, and showed him my private mark—hethen turned quite pale—the rug was found in the coal-hole—the landlord showed it to me, and said it did not belong to him—the younger prisoner had no means of conveying the things there—the elder prisoner must have come to my shop and received them—I had called the yonnger prisoner into my parlour that evening and said, "Francis, I have a ques<lb></lb>tion to ask of you, what property have you given your father of mine to<lb></lb>night?"—hesaid, "I will tell you, sir, and I hope you will forgive me"—he then said, "I gave him a brass fender to-night"—I said, "You have given him more than that to-night, Francis, and it is no use telling me a story"—he then said, "Well then, I will tell you, sir, and I hope you will forgive me"—I said, "I can't forgive you, I have been robbed so much, I can't afford it"—he then said, "Well, I am very sorry, I don't care about any thing else only for my father, he is innocent, but I have given him a pair of trowsers and a piece of cotton"—I then said, "It is not all the property you have given your father of mine, and I shall give you in charge, and go and search your father's house"—I had him taken, and then went to his father's.</p>

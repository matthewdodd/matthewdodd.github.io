            . I live with my father, in Greystoke-place, Fetter-lane. On the night of the 27th of August, about twelve o'clock, I was in my bed room, and heard some person walking up and down; I asked my mother if I should put out the candle - she said, "Not yet;" I saw a man trying to get the padlock off Ward's door; I saw the padlock in his hand after he had got it off, and then he went towards Cursitor-street; when he had been gone about five minutes the watchman came down - I told him somebody had taken off the padlock; I described his dress to the watchman, and in two or three minutes the prisoner came back again from Fetter-lane; I am sure it was the same man as I had seen before, and that it was the prisoner - I did not see his face, but his person; his dress and figure appeared to be the same; the watchman took hold of him just as he passed the gate, and asked if he was the man - I said Yes, and he secured him; I did not see him do anything.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not several persons on the spot when the prisoner came back? A. He was disturbed by several persons passing and repassing, while he was getting it off; it is in a kind of court - the watchman was waiting for him round the corner; I was at the first floor front window - it was about ten minutes past twelve o'clock, and rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You only know that the man had the same dress? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Moon told me a man had taken the padlock, and described his dress; another watchman met me, and heard the description as well - he said the lock was gone; I went round my beat, covered my light, and secreted myself about ten yards from the place, and in about ten minutes saw the prisoner come from Fetter-lane; when he came up to me I went and asked what he was about - he said he was going home; I said, "You have been here before to-night" - he said not; I said, "Have you not taken that lock off?" he said No - Moon called from the window, "That is the man;" I took him, and found a chisel on him, but no padlock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is he not a carpenter? A. Yes; he was dressed in a flannel jacket: when I took him to the watch-house I went to see if the chisel corresponded with the marks on the door, and did not hear him give his address, nor have I heard him give his address.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You left him conversing in the watch-house? A. Yes. It was a common carpenter's chisel, and corresponed with the marks on the door; I think he had passed the door for a yard or two, when I met him - he did not stop at it; I do not know whether he saw me - there was a gas-light within eight yards of the door, which would enable Moon to see him; I had not seen him there before; the court is about sixty yards long, and has two gas-lights.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you he was a carpenter? A. He did - I will swear he did not give his right address that night.</p>

            . I am Mr. Ward's foreman. I locked the premises up on the night of the 27th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The chisel is part of my tools, which I daily use. I met George Brady at twelve o'clock; we spent the day together; I saw him home to Joiner's-row, he being a little drunk, and was coming that way home - as I entered Graystoke-place I saw a lot of watchman surrounding the bars; when I got up one of them said,"Where are you going?" I hesitated, thinking he had no right to ask me - he said a person of my description had attempted to break open those premises; I immediately told him who I was and where I lived, and went to the watch-house without hesitation; I said my name was John Williams, thinking it a very trivial offence; I told them my right direction - he went to try the chisel; I am told one larger or smaller would fit the place. As to my not giving my right direction, it is false - before I was taken to the Compter I said my name was Sackett, when I thought it was likely to be serious.</p>

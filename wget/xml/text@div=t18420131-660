                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Kensington—the prisoner Payne is my nephew, and has been living with me about seven months. On the 24th of December I left town for a few days, leaving five sovereigns behind a glass case—I returned on Wednesday the 28th, and missed the money—my nephew absented himself on the 5th of January—I found him next day, and I questioned him about taking the money—he said he had not taken it—the policeman was passing by at the moment, and I told him to question him—I thought he might get it from him if he was guilty —I said to my nephew, "Now James, tell me candidly, whether you know any thing of this money?"—he said, "I do not," and burst out crying—I then promised him forgiveness.</p>

               <p>me he had been robbed of five sovereigns, and that the boy had absented him<lb></lb>self the night before, which gave him strong suspicion that it was him who took the money—I said, "Very well, I will tell the sergeant to come down"—he said, "You come in and see him"—I went in—Payne saw his uncle call my attention to him—I asked if he knew anything of the money—he said "No"—I did not promise him forgiveness, I only questioned bun—I afterwards apprehended Swain at his father's house in Sutton-street—I told him, that Payne had said, he gave him the five sovereigns—he aid that Payne gave him part of the money to buy pistols and pies with, that he had bought four pistols, the first was a horse pistol, which be gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, that he burst that in firing it off, that he then went and bought three more, one he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, and the other two 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then took Spokes into custody, and told him that Payne had said, he and Swain had the five sovereigns—I did not say what five sovereigns—I said it was Mr. Rhodes's money—he then said, that he had part of the money, and that be went with Swain to buy the first pistol, the horse pistol, and that Swain went and bought the other three himself—he said that of his own accord—I had got Swain with me at the time—he said that in Swain's presence, and Spokes was present when I was talking to Swain—it was when they were both together, going to the station with me—I then asked Spokes what he had done with the pistols—he said they had been out shooting with them that day, and they were all three covered up with clay in Addison-road field, and all three loaded, and that Swain hid them there—I took them to the station, and Spokes went with me to the field—I found the pistols there, all three loaded with powder and shot—neither Swain nor Spokes said where the money came from—they said they had part of it from Payne, that Payne brought it and gave it to them—-they did not tell me whose money it was—they both said they knew it was Mr. Rhodes's money.</p>

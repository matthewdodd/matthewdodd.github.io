                  </hi>. I live at Barking. I was aroused by my wife about one o'clock in the night of <hi rend="italic">Boxing-night</hi>, after I had been in bed about three-quarters of an hour—I listened and heard a noise down stairs—I got up and went down, with a stick in my hand—I saw the shape of a man <hi rend="italic">bolting</hi> out of the sitting-room into a little washhouse, and trying to escape from the window—I <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> after him, and laid hold of his foot—he drove me against the side of the window-cill and made me let <hi rend="italic">go</hi> of him—he then jumped out—I jumped out after him, (naked as I was; I had nothing on but my shirt,) and caught him before he had got up the court—a policeman was close by, and be came and took him—it was the prisoner, I never lost sight of him—I went back to my house, and from a closet in the sitting-room missed a piece of pie<lb></lb>crust,</p>

               <p>which I had left there when I went to bed—there was nothing hut the crust and gravy—the crust was found outside the window out of which the prisoner escaped—he must have entered by the washhouse-window—it hat no particular fastening to it, but I had closed it up properly, as usual—there is no door to the washhouse.</p>

Cullington gave the prisoner into my custody, about twenty or thirty yards from the washhouse-window—the pri-soner had no cap on, and I found it about two yards from the washhouse-window, along with the pie-crust—I searched him, but found nothing on him—some of the things in the washhouse had been moved and turned bottom upwards—I found that some one had tried to enter the next house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of John Delliston, and live in Dorset-street. On the 5th of March I was in the New-road with a basket—I set it down to rest, and the prisoner came up to me—I had never seen her before—she wanted me to have some beer—I said I did not like beer—she asked me to have some bread and cheese—I said I did not want any—she then put her pot down and took up my basket—there were four sheets in it and a pair of drawers—she unpinned the wrapper, and put the drawers between her legs and one sheet under her arm—I called a gentleman who was coming by, and he stopped her—the policeman took my basket to the office—I told him that the prisoner had the drawers between her legs, and she slipped them into the basket again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I asked where you were going, you said to John-street; I said I was going that way should I carry the basket; you said, "Yes, if you please"; I took one side of it, and you had the other—I said "If you will take my loaf I will take the basket." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, you snatched the basket and said, "O let us carry it"—you undid the wrapper, put your hand under<lb></lb>neath and took these things out—they did not fall out.</p>

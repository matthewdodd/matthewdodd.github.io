               <p>I am a brass founder in Shoe-lane; I manufactured for Mr. Nubley this brass bow, and this that is called a back for a sword, they are both for swords; from the 14th to the 26th of November I sent near two hundred weight, and on the 26th thirty-nine pound weight of that two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these articles again? - Monday was se'ennight, I bought them of one Cockran, who is now in court, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I bought them among eighty-six pounds weight, and picked this out of the whole body of what I bought, papered it up and carried them to the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that they are such things as you manufactured for Mr. Nubley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any other person manufacture such things? - I am not sure, but I am sure they were made in our manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these sort of things common with other founders as well as your's? - Not that I know of, but if they did their patterns may not be exactly like them.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you be so good to look at these articles, and tell us where you had them from? - From the house of Mr. Botten. I am confident there are not such sword hilts made in this country, they were made for the first regiment of guards, and I made the whole of the core; with respect to this heel plate, it was made for the Prince of Wales, cast by one Barnet, in Cock-lane, about six years, and when the gun came to be stocked, this heel plate would not fit, and it has laid by in the warehouse ever since; the prisoner was employed at this time in my warehouse where these things lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me where he was employed on the 14th of November? - He had been employed all the week in the court. My house was much damaged in the riots in August last, and my house was repairing, and this man came to assist the other man that was constantly employed in the warehouse, and in the course of being there he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed about the premises on the 28th of November? - He certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your warehouse to old Hannah's? - That is joining in the court to my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Then by any possibility could these things have got into old Hannah's house at the time of the fire? - No, they were never removed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mrs. Story after this information? - I went immediately to Mr. Bottens to look over the brass myself, and in looking over it I found this half moon cross, which is for a Turkish cymeter, with this pattern pommell to cast from. This is a pattern that was made for the first regiment of foot guards, for the serjeants, for to cast from, and was never used but for that regiment; it has been broke since it was stolen out of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mrs. Story? - The following day about two or three o'clock, I went to her own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, in consequence of any thing you communicated to her, come to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080199"></xptr>your premises? - Yes, she did, and when she came there I called all the men up into the dining room, Mr. Kirby was there, there was about twenty-five or thirty men; she said it was none of them there. It then struck me that it might be the carpenters; the carpenters were coming out of Mrs. Hannah's house, and I desired this man, as being employed there, to come in. He seemed to have an objection, but the other man that was with him asked him, and he came in; then I called Mrs. Story down, and she pitched on him; there were three or four with him of his partners as they call them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - No, he did not say a word.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please your worship and gentlemen of the jury, I was at work next door to this gentleman's for some time, and my partner was at work some days for Mr. Nubley. On Monday, about half past eight o'clock, my partner came down to me and asked me, if I would lend him an hand to move a partition? according I went and took my hand saw in my hand, a chissel, and a hammer. I was there about two hours and a half assisting him; after I had done I took up my tools, went down stairs again, and then went to my own work, and was never in Mr. Nubley's house before nor since.</p>
               <p>Court to Nubley. When can you swear to seeing these things? - I can swear to seeing this box on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the morning following I came down, and I had a basket and a few tools in my basket, then I went to the shop and my partner was not there, then I went home again, and went to the shop again, and coming down to the shop I met my partner, and he told me he had been there and could not find me, and I knew no more of it till about twelve o'clock, when Mr. Nubley took me up. I was only two hours and a half at work at Mr. Nubley's, and my partner was there all the while, and I went up in my shirt sleeves, and went down with my shirt sleeves, and that gentleman was there all the time assisting me to move the partition himself, and his porter was there all the time himself.</p>

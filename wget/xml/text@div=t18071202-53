I cannot recollect the day of the month; I was coming along, the woman stopped me and asked me where I was going, I told her home; I asked her to let me have connection with her, I went up Plough-yard, I turned down with her again; I missed my pocket book and the pound note that was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your pocket book again. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it. - A. A pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not drop it. - A. Yes, because I had my hand in my pocket when I went up the yard with her; when I came down I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped some time. - A. Yes, I stopped the value of five minutes, and then I missed my pocket book; I am sure I did not drop it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. No, I was a little in liquor, but I was not so much gone but what I knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before. - A. I never saw her before to my knowledge; I gave charge of her and took her to the watchhouse, when I found I had lost my note. The pound note was found upon her, but not the pocket book. The officer sent me out to look for the pocket book; I could not find it any where.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her. - A. Three pence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>- SWAIN. I am the constable of the night; as soon as this woman was brought in I sent one of the watchmen and the prosecutor out to look for the pocket book; I searched the woman, I found a one pound note in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the note before you found it. - A. No; before I shewed him the note I asked him whether it was a clean note or a dirty one; he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020041"></xptr>thought it was a cleanish one; it turned out to be a tolerable clean note; the woman at first said it was a note that she had received from her husband for his wages, of Mr. Rhodes; however it came out afterwards that she had no husband.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I deny ever saying that I had a husband, I never had a husband.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear to the number nor the date of the note, I only know it by the black on the note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out, I met a man that I had a child by him, he gave me a pound note and five shillings; if I had taken that young man's money I should not have surrendered myself up to the watchman; I never saw his pocket book nor the pound note.</p>

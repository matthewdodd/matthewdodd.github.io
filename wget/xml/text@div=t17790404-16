               <p>I am a revenue officer belonging to his majesty's customs. I met the prisoner between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the 8th of March, with something in his hand; he beckoned to a coach; he came from Thames-street, and Mr. M'Culluck, who was with me, said to me, Jack, what do you think they are? I said, I think they are lace. He said, he would go and see what they were. The man rested them on the seat of the coach; we went up to the coach, got in it, and bid the coachman drive to Justice Sherwood's; we opened it at the justice's, and there were ten guineas worth of halfpence; we left them with

Accordingly, I took them to pieces, got a coach and put them in, and drove them down to Justice Sherwood's office. The prisoner was brought in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you find any die? - Yes; (five dies produced) I found about a guineas worth of these cut out blanks, lying about the cellar, all blanks. I found some left in the garret, among some saw-dust and oil. I found a parcel of copper they were cut out of, and the prisoner acknowledges he has lived there five or six months.</p>

I then knew he was a coiner. The next time I saw him was before Justice Sherwood, charged with coining; (the fly produced) they are very large; the press and fly, I suppose, are eight hundred weight; they may be used in other trades as well as coining; but there were no other implements of any trade found there but what I brought here; that is a cutting press.</p>

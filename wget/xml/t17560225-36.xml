The prisoner came into my house on the 20th of January, about six in the evening; I was asleep; but happening to awake, I ask'd her what she wanted. She said nothing at all; then I said you are soon served and went to dose again. She open'd a door and took a pewter dish off the sink, and went out; the girl stop'd her and call'd out master, master. I jump'd up, and ran out; she was got out of the house and the girl kept fast hold of her. I ran and took the dish from under the prisoner's left-arm. She said it was the first time she had been guilty of such a fact.</p>

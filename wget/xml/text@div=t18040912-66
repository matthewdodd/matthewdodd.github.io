               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. No, I never saw him before in my life, before the constable took him out of his house; we had another man taken up first, that Mr. Bond acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you lost it? - A. Between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it again? - A. Yes, it was brought me to buy by another man.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it Mr. Brown that went with you to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes, Mr. Brown, the younger, took me to the prisoner's house; the pipe was brought by another man to Mr. Brown's house for sale, and there it was taken; the other man was stopped, and he impeached the prisoner, and by his information I went to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the prisoner's house, what passed? - A. He was there at work; I told him he was wanted to go with me; he said what was the matter; I said, I cannot say, nothing; he went with me to the watch-house; the other man said, the prisoner at the bar gave him the pipe to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. What has become of the other man? - A. We cannot find him; he was bound over to appear by Mr. Bond, but he does not appear.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Brown.) Then all that you know of the prisoner being concerned in it, is from the information of the man that was stopped with the pipe? - A. Yes.</p>

On the morning of 3rd April I was on duty in Chandos Street—I saw Dixon standing there, in front of the shop that was broken open—Savine was standing on the pavement, with another boy—I asked Dixon what he was doing there—he said he was waiting for his master, who was coming from the country—I asked him if he knew the other two, and he said "No"—I went round my beat, and came back in about twenty-five minutes, and I saw the three in conversation in front of the shop—they ran away—I could not swear to Savine, but I am quite clear as to Dixon.</p>

I was on duty in Lincoln's Inn Fields on the morning of 3rd April—about 5 o'clock I saw the two prisoners and another man, not in custody, pass along the west side of Lincoln's Inn Fields—I followed them, on account of their appearance and what they were carrying—as I got near to them, Dixon, who was walking in front, started and ran away—I walked quickly, and Savine, who was carrying a sack with this deed-box inside, and other articles, threw the sack down, and ran away also—the man who was not apprehended was carrying a rifle, with two coats folded round it—he threw that down as I came near him, kicked me in the knee, which stopped my running—I pursued them to Red Lion Square, where I lost them—I afterwards took the things to New Street Station—I was sent for on the morning of the 14th, when I saw the two prisoners amongst six or eight others, and immediately identified them—from what I found inside the sack I found where the things came from, and I went to Mr. Poole's place, and examined it—I found a constable in charge of the front door—the back door was broken open, and this instrument lying close by—it corresponded with the marks on the wood—the hasp and lock were broken off.</p>

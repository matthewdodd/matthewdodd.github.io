I had four one-pound notes and a two-pound note in my chest, on board our ship. On my going to my chest, at about two o'clock, I found every thing was moved round, and not in the way in which I had left it in the morning; I missed three one-pound notes, and I told the mate, and he called all hands up, between four and five in the afternoon; they all came up, except the prisoner, who went forward, in the cooking-room. He was desired to come up, and after some reluctance, he did. They all took off their clothes, and he kept his waistcoat on 'till the last. I said he had something in his left hand, and he said he had not. The mate opened his hand, and there was a one-pound note, which I will swear I put into my chest the night before; it was No. 17,208. We never found the other two.</p>

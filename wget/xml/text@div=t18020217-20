               <p>Q. Was the taper lighted? - A. No, it was out; then I had him secured by two watchmen; after we secured him, we found the parlour door bolted within side; we broke open the parlour door, and found Samuel Smith lying on his belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Smith before? - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it either of the prisoners? - A. Yes, we had him secured.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that none of the upholsterer's men had been there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a new house that your master had hired, he had never slept in it? - A. Yes, he had, for two or three years.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine the rest of the house to see that all was fast? - A. Yes; we examined every part of the house, and found it barred and safe.</p>

I was standing at my door, about a quarter before nine o'clock, and heard the rattles spring; I ran immediately, and they had just got the door open; I went into the passage, and found the parlour door fast; the last witness broke it open; when I went in, I found the prisoner Smith lying flat upon his face on the carpet; he pretended to be asleep, and wanted to know where he was; he said, he thought it was a public-house, and came in there to have something to drink; I took him to the watch-house, and there searched-him; we found nothing upon him but some cords, and the other prisoner, Brown, a screw-driver.</p>

            (To Channer.) Was there not a quantity of plate on the side-board in the parlour which might have been easily conveyed away if these persons had meant to commit a felony? - A. Yes, it might.</p>

            Half a dozen table-spoons, half a dozen desert-spoons, a gravy-spoon, a silver cheese-knife, a pair of salts, and a pair of plated candlesticks.</p>

            No, it was all locked up.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. We had been to Paddington, and made rather too free with drink; when we came to this house, Brown fell down; I got him up, and observed to him that the door was open, and we went in to lie down, to get the better of the drink; we did not go in for the purpose of plundering the house, and I hope the respectable witnesses your Lordship will hear presently will do away that prejudice.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I can say no more; that is exactly the truth; the witnesses have said that the matches were found at my feet, but they were not found till after I was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. The matches were taken to the watch-house with him.</p>
               <p>Chanson. I found the matches immediately, while the watchman had him by the collar; I took up the matches and the wax taper, and put them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called three witnesses each, who gave them a good character.</p>

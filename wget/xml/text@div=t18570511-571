                  </hi>. I am independent; I live in Oldington Square, Brompton. I was in Leadenhall Street on 30th April, about half past 11 o'clock in the morning, coming towards Gracechurch Street—I felt a pull at my pocket—I put my hand there, and my handkerchief was gone—I turned, and saw the prisoner within a few yards of me, and no one else near me—he was just crossing, and when I looked at him he began to run—I followed him—he went across, and turned round a wagon, and I saw him with my handkerchief in his hand—he was trying to force it on a little boy who was holding some placards—the boy refused his attempt to put it into his pocket—after running round the wagon two or three times, the prisoner went away—I ran and seized him—I got my handkerchief either from him or from the other boy; I think from him—I kept tight hold of his collar till the policeman came, and I gave him in charge—he said it was not him that took the handkerchief, it was another boy that took it—I said, "You rascal, you have taken my handkerchief—he said, "It was not me; it was another boy; "but he said afterwards, "Pray forgive me"—I took him back to the little boy, who said, "He wanted to give me the handkerchief."</p>

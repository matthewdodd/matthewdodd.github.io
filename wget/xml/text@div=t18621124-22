                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living at 31, Red Cross-square, Jewin-street—at ten minutes past 5, on the evening of 10th of this month, I was in Bishopsgate-street with my wife and a friend—I was going to help my friend into an omnibus which was passing—I put out my hands just to make a little room for her to get into the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, when I felt a <hi rend="italic">pinch</hi> on my side where my watch was—the prisoner was in front of me and he said, "What are you doing, pushing my hat off?"—I said, "Bother your hat; you have taken my watch"—my watch was gone—it was broken off at the swivel—I had it safe a minute before—there were several females round close by—the watch was worth fifty shillings.</p>

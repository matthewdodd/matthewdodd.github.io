                  </hi>. I am the son of Dorothy Angas. I am a quaker—she lives at Hayes, in Kent, and is nearly eighty-seven years old—I am a miller, and live with her—on the 8th of January last, late at night, or early in the morning of the 9th, we lost a horse, and a set of har<lb></lb>ness, out of the stable—this harness and names I know to be my mother's—I picked it out of a great deal more at Pye's house.</p>

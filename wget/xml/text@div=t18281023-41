            . I am one of the City patrol. -On Monday evening, the 20th of October, about ten minutes to seven o'clock, I and Lovel were in St. Maryaxe, and saw the prisoner, alone, with this trunk on his shoulder; I crossed over, and asked where he was going with it - he said to Mr. or Miss Mitchell, No. 23; he did not recollect the name of the lane, but it was close by, and he would show me where it was; I followed him into Houndsditch - he crossed over towards Catler-street; I then took hold of the box, and said he must go with me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230029"></xptr>to the Mansion-house; he said a lady had given it to him to carry at Irongate - he then ran away; I took care of the trunk while Lovel pursued, and brought him to the Mansion-house: I have no doubt of his person. - Copas described the contents of the box before she saw it - the direction was then torn off.</p>

            . I was with Wiltshire, and saw the prisoner with the box - he said he was going to Mr. Mitchell's, at No. 23, in a lane below; I asked where the name was - he said he did not know, but would show me - that the box was given to him by a lady, in a public-house on Tower-hill, near Tower-stairs: he did not know the sign, but there was a large three before the door - there is such a house exactly opposite Tower-stairs: I asked where the lady was - he said he did not know: he went on - we both took hold of the box; he slipped it from his shoulder, and ran away - I pursued; he ran into a court, which is no thoroughfare, and I took him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am carman to the prosecutor's brother. I received the packages into the cart at Tower-wharf - they were secured behind with a rope; I had three bags besides: I drove to Piccadilly, and when I got there I only had five packages - I was riding in the cart all the way: I drove down two or three places, into Thames-street, took up some other packages, and went towards Tower-hill again. The prisoner is a stranger to me; I gave nobody leave to come into the cart - a person might reach over the rope and get the box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was jobbing about Billingsgate, as a porter, and at a quarter to seven o'clock a lady came and said she would give me 2s. 6d. to carry this box to Mitchell's, No. 23, Petticoat-lane, and when the officers came I forgot the name of the lane for a minute; I ran away, as I did not like to he taken to a watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

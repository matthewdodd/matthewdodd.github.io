At half -past five o'clock in the evening of chirstmas-day, I saw a light in the back bed-room next door, occupation by Mr. Roberts willin, to whose son my daughter is married—I went in and told charles willin that there was a light in his father's house—knowing they were out, he went into the street, and I went into the back-yard, and the person in the house came down and unbolted the back-door, and two men came into the yard—I said, "Is that you, willin? meaning my son-in-law's brother—I asked the second time, and one of them said, "yes"—I knew it was not his voice—I went in again, and met charles Willin coming out at the back door—I said it was not his brother, and he went to the front street-door and pushed it—the door was opened inside by the prisoner—he did not came out—he was seized by the collar and taken</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Robert Willin; we live at No. 4, Chat<lb></lb>ham-row. I left my home with my husband on Christmas-day—I bolted the back-door top and bottom—all the doors and windows were shut and locked by myself—we came back at two o'clock in the morning—the house was all in confusion—the pillows were moved—the table was turned over and at the further end of the room, and the candle and candlestick thrown down, and some matches had been brought there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You fastened the door? Yes, I am quite confident of that—we left home at half-past twelve o'clock—we had a good way to go—there are two rooms at the back of my house—the window that looks into my yard is my kitchen-window—that is near the palings where my friend looked over—a person could not get in at that window—there is a shutter there, and that was bolted when I came home, the same as I left it—the one-pair baek window had not been opened—that had a good fastening, which the policeman can prove—no part of the house was broken at all—I did not lose anything.</p>

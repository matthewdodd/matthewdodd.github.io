On Wednesday, the 30th of March, the prisoner came to me at the store-room, and delivered me this paper; I received it, and read it aloud "Shirt and stockings?" - the prisoner said, Yes; I then delivered him a shirt and a pair of stockings, and put the paper on a file which I keep; no one has access to it but myself - I entered the order in a book kept for the purpose, and which I have here; I entered it the same day, - I took the paper off the file, and gave it to Mr. Twilly, or he took it off, in my presence, but this file remained in my presence the whole time; I copied the paper, and have some recollection of this particular paper - I first had occasion to believe that there was something wrong, on the same evening or the following one, when I showed it to Mr. Twilly; the file had not been disturbed - I had had it safe from the time I gave the prisoner these things till I showed it to the governor - no one had touched it.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Where did you keep the file? A. In the store-room, which was invariably locked, and never opened but by me.</p>

            . This paper is not my writing - I am assistant-overseer, and was so on the 30th of March last; I entered on my office in May, 1830, and have been in the daily order of issuing such orders on the matron and Mr. Twilly, on account of the parish - if this order had been genuine Mrs. Bailey would have been bound to comply with it, if it had been in my hand-writing - if an application had been made to me, and I had thought the party required such relief, I should have issued such orders, but this is not my writing, nor written by my authority; I did not authorize the prisoner to apply for such articles, nor for any thing that day; in my judgment, this does not bear any resemblance to my hand-writing, but Mr. Sergeant Sellon thought it did; I am assistant-overseer for the parishes of St. Giles in the Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury, united for the support of the poor; there is no other person of the name of Tucker who issues such orders.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Are there other overseers? A. Yes. but they are not in the habit of issuing such orders; my eldest son is nine years old - paupers never apply for relief except at the office - no person, to my knowledge, has ever signed one of these papers but myself - here is the book which contains my authority to Act as overseer; here are the minutes of the proceedings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the hand-writing of the chairman? A. Yes, it is the hand-writing of the Reverend Mr. Tyler, to the proceedings of the vestry - (read.)</p>

               <p>I have in consequence of this acted ever since - I have no other appointment in writing: I was then called in. and informed of the decision by the chairman, Mr. Tyler - the next meeting was held on the 15th of May, when the minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed, and signed by the chairman.</p>

The prosecutor treated us with a glass of liquor; going home we met a dragoon we knew, and the prosecutor met his friend; when the prosecutor was in our room he was sick, he laid back on the bed, he challenged the soldier with stealing a pound-note; the dragoon knocked him down. When we made the bed we found the watch; Withers said she would keep the watch for the prosecutor. If he had come for the watch he would have had it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Trafalgar-place, Wandsworth New-town—on 4th December, I went to a milk-shop in Snow-fields to find a person of the name of Smith—I was taken from there by two females to the Ship and Shovel—I saw the prisoner there—one female said to me, "Here is Mr. Smith"—I said to him, "Do you know Mr. Smith?"—he said, "I do not know such a name; catch hold, old fellow, and drink, what do you want with Mr. Smith?"—I said, "As you don't know the person, of course you don't want to know my business"—he said, "Never mind"—I said, "It is of no consequence; Mr. Smith obtained a van of me, and I hold a bill against him, but the party that he brought to put his name to the bill tells me that Smith gave him a sovereign to do it, and he would do it for any man every day in the week, as he had no money to lose"—the prisoner then said,. "Why the b——y old van that Smith had was not half so good as the cart he left behind"—I said directly, "You told me, just now, that you did not know a party of the name of Smith at all; I am aware that I fell into the hands of swindlers, and if I do not get the money for that bill I shall take</p>

               <p>proceedings against you"—he beckoned me over the bar; I supposed he was going into the parlour to settle it, but at the moment a door was opened in the passage, and he gave me a blow—I fell down backwards and called" Murder!" and "Police!"—I was taken home; my doctor attended me from that time until the 12th—on that day I went with Sergeant Howe to a coffee-house in Duke-street—I went in and saw the two females that took me to the Ship and Shovel, and the prisoner was behind the bar—one said, "Here is the old man"—the prisoner got up and walked into a little room, and I followed in—he said to me, "What is your pleasure?"—I said, "I beg your pardon, do you not remember knocking me down at the Ship and Shovel?"—he said, "Is that all you require?"—I said, "That is all"—he then gave me a tremendous kick and blow in the back—his son came and "bonneted "my hat over my eyes, and then kicked me and shoved me bodily into the street—I was taken home by Sergeant Howe—he had remained outside while I went in; he could not see what was going on—I was attended by my medical man, Mr. William H. Day—it is not true that I had made use of bad language to the women; I am quite a different man—I am not capable of doing work now and never shall be any more, I am sorry to say—I have neither been able to dress myself or undress myself since—I went to my solicitor on the subject, and on driving home I ran against the long pole of a timber dray, and my cart turned over and I was upset.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you fall out of your pony-cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I was taken to St. Thomas's Hospital in my four-wheeled phaeton—I was not discharged on the 15th of May cured—no man had better health than I had before meeting with this assault—I was suffering from dislocation of the clavicle and injury to the back—when I went to the Ship and Shovel I found the prisoner, not Smith—I was not with the women all the time—they took me from 84, Snow-fields there—I did not behave rudely to them—I never behaved rudely to a lady in my life—I do not consider they are ladies—I did not have some gin and beer; I had some ale—I won't swear there was not some gin in it; I was as sober as I am now—I took a glass; I do not know that I took more than one glass—I did not begin to pull the women about—the prisoner did not take me by the collar, and did not threaten to turn me out if I persisted in such beastly behaviour to the women—I did not say I was not so when sober but that perhaps the liquor had made me forget myself.</p>

               <p>Wandsworth—I was called in on 13th December, to examine the last witness's back—I found a great pain at the shoulder, over the blade-bone, and there was a great deal of swelling—when the tumefaction and the inflammation had subsided, I detected a transverse fracture of the scapula—I found also injury to, and inflammation of, the spine—that was about the 17th of December—I should say he will never be able to do another day's work—either a blow or a fall would break the scapula—it must have been violent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would a kick on the posteriors be likely to break the clavicle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, no; not if the kick were ever so hard—the accident would be just as likely to occur from a fall from a gig—they were just the bruises and effects that a fall would produce—they might happen from a fall from a carriage or low cart—I do not know anything about what he suffered from when he went to the hospital; I only know from the 13th of December and following days—I am not speaking of a dislocation of the clavicle, but a fracture—there is a great difficulty in old age for it to unite, because there is not matter thrown out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JEFFRIES</hi>. I went with the prosecutor on the 4th of December to the prisoner—when we got there, he was introduced as Mr. Day, the landlord—Mr. Edgeley said, "I am come concerning a van"—the prisoner said, "I know nothing about it myself; but never mind, old chap, we will have a drink of beer"—we had a drop of beer, and a drop of gin—then the prisoner called Mr. Edgeley, and beckoned to him—in less than half a second, I heard him call out "Murder!" and "Police! "—he was, I may say, sober—I picked him up—he seemed very bad indeed—I did not see the prisoner hit him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SERGEANT HOWE</hi>. I went, on 12th December, to a coffee-house in Duke-street, and I saw the prosecutor go in—after he had gone in about three quarters of a minute, I saw two females sitting, and a man standing on the left-hand side—I saw the prisoner rise up from the right-hand side and motion to Edgeley to follow him, which he did—half a minute after, I saw him being pushed out by the prisoner—he was struck several times coming through the shop—one man had hold of his left arm; whether it was the prisoner's son or not, I cannot say, but I should know him again—Edgeley was crying "Murder!"—I ran across the road, and he wished to give the prisoner into custody—I did not take him—I thought it would be better to take other proceedings, than to take a man from his own house—I went home with Edgeley—he complained very much all the way home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see him struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I was then at the roadside—I saw the women there—I do not think they could see better than I could, because the window is right down to the street—they could see quite as well.</p>

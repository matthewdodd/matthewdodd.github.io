            . I live in Short's-gardens. I was in the public-house - I saw the prisoner put her right arm round the prosecutor's neck, and attempt to kiss him; she then put her left hand into his trousers pocket, and took out the purse - she took one half-crown out of it, and called for half a pint of gin: she kept the purse in her hand - the landlady drew half a pint of gin; the prisoner went out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160057"></xptr>and came in again in about two minutes - she then threw the purse down behind the prosecutor; I took it up, and gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I give you the half-crown, and ask if there was any more in it, and you said No? A. No- I and the prosecutor had a pint of beer, but I had no money from her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you saw her take the purse, how came you not to take her? A. I did, my Lord - she came back into the house, and I went for the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Moore came for me; this is the purse, which I took off the counter - they would not serve her with the gin, as they had seen her take the money from the purse; she committed a violent assault on the prosecutor - he bled all night, through the bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked me to drink with him, which I did; I do not know what I did, as I was intoxicated.</p>

               <p>JOHN KENT. I had not seen any thing pass between her and the prosecutor; I know she carries loads in the market - I have seen her with three or four children.</p>

I heard a hook fall, my wife said there goes the bullock's head, I ran and saw the prisoner with the head before him, with his arms clasped round it. I over took him, I suppose, at about fifty yards distance, I laid hold of him and brought him back, I told him the head was not his, he did not buy it; he acknowledged it was not. It was an whole head with a tongue, killed the same afternoon.</p>

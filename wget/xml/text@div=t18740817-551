                  </hi>. I am a merchant commission agent, having offices at 19 and 20, Walbrook—on the 22nd May the prisoner came to me there, under the introduction of a gentleman with whom I have some business transactions, wishing to obtain an advance of money—a bill was produced, and having suffered from discounting bills in former years—I refused point blank to discount it—the point of the conversation was, that he wanted an advance of money, and the purport of my reply was, that I would not do it on that bill—he then urged his position as being the occupier or pos<lb></lb>sessor of these premises in 15, Crooked Lane, and that he only wanted a small advance on the bill, say 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then called my clerk, and said "Go down with this man, and if you are satisfied that what he says is cor<lb></lb>rect, then come back and let me know"—the prisoner went away with Mr. Martin, my clerk, who subsequently returned to my office, and stated that there was evidence of a large amount of stuff in his cellars, and I be<lb></lb>lieve the words were, that it was equal to ten times the amount that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170058"></xptr>
               <p>wanted—I gave the prisoner a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that cheque was afterwards returned to me paid—I next saw the prisoner on 2nd June, and made him another advance at his request—at the time I made those advances,.1 had not the remotest idea that he was not the proprietor of 15, Crooked Lane—I made the advances on the belief that he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I really don't know myself what a merchant commission agent is—I am so described in the lease of my premises—my business is making advances on real securities, and raising loans for those in want of them—what is vulgarly called a money lender—if a person offers good secu<lb></lb>rity, and good interest, we advance the amount required—the amount of security would not depend upon the interest at all—Mr. Martin is my clerk, and he writes letters for me—sometimes I see them and sometimes I do not—I wrote this letter on 22nd May—I was particular in having that written, because I wanted it placed beyond the possibility of doubt that I had not discounted the bill, that it was a loan—I ordered some wine from the prisoner, and he supplied it—it was a verbal order—I don't know whether the wine came from that office—I had no transactions with the prisoner till this advance—that was the first time I saw him to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The wine I had from him was a dozen, which he brought to my house in a cab—I believed he was a wine merchant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Le Guay, at Walbrook—I saw the prisoner there on 22nd May, and Mr. Le Guay directed me to go down to his place at Crooked Lane—he said when could I go, and I said I would go at once, and I went with the prisoner—I was to go and look at the place, and see what it was like, and so forth—when we got to 13, Crooked Lane I went into a little office—the prisoner said it was not much of a place to ask people into, and he thought of moving to other offices, or if he stopped where he was he should have it boarded and painted over, to make it look a little smarter—I said "If you are doing any trade at all, you had better stop where you are, I think"—he said he was doing a nice, comfortable trade, and thank God all the stuff in the place was paid for—he asked me to have a glass of sherry, and I did—we walked to the end of the cellar—he turned the gas up, and showed me what was in the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I walked with him from Mr. Le Guay's premises—he preceded me by a few seconds or half a minute down the stairs—I did not notice the name of Tilley over the door—I know it is there now—I did not notice it at first, because wine merchant's names are written small—I should think the name is two inches long—I have seen Mr. Tilley in those cellars several times, and I have had a glass of wine once or twice with him—I don't swear that he was not there on the first occasion that I went in with the prisoner—it might have been Mr. Tilley who brought me the glass of wine—I did not notice who it was—I will swear I did not go into the cellars before the defendant, and have the wine before he came—it was on a subsequent occasion that I saw Mr. Tilley, and had a glass of wine with him—I have been in the cellar three times—I gave a little order myself, but that was on 13th July, long after—I wanted some old Irish whiskey—the order was not sent to the cellar—it would have been sent in five minutes, but the prisoner happened to come into the office, and I said "You have just come in time to save me a penny," and I gave him the letter I had written—I have written one other letter to the defendant, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170059"></xptr>
               <p>I took that to the cellar myself—if the bill had been paid, these proceedings would not have been taken, because we should have had to give him a balance—we have been anxious to get the bill paid—I wrote to the de<lb></lb>fendant on the very day it was due, because he had promised he would bring the money himself the day before—he was not threatened with criminal proceedings before the bill was due—I told him there would be a row, and I also said there would be fireworks let off on Monday—I presented the bill as a matter of course.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine dealer at 15, Crooked Lane—I rent the office and cellars there, and have done so since October last—the stock in those cellars is mine—no one but myself has any interest in the office or the stock in those premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have known the defendant twelve or eighteen months—he has been to my cellars a great many times, and has made himself familiar there—he was there as a customer, nothing else—he used to be in business himself, and of course he had customers, and I sold to him for him to sell to his customers—I allowed him ray wine at a certain price for him to serve his customers—he dealt with me—persons who had been his customers before used to come and see him in those cellars, and they would transact business with the wine I had sold to the defendant—that "was the case with Mr. Martin—I have seen him in my cellars two or three times—he did not buy any whiskey of me—I know he bought a dozen of wine from the defendant—that was not my wine—I know that he served a gallon of whiskey, but it did not come from me—he would sell for a little bit more than he would buy from me—he did not assist in my business—I did not want any assistance—I bought two casks of wine from him, but I paid him for it—I believe the claret that went to Mr. Le Guay was brought to my cellar because I had not that class of wine, and I permitted him to bring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I allowed him to bring orders and customers to me—all the wine in the cellar I had bought and paid for myself.</p>

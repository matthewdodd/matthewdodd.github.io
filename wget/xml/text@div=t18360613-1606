I am the wife of Nicholas Station—he is alive, but does not live with me—on the 26th of May I saw the prisoner on the stairs of the public-house, putting my things into his pocket—I asked him what business he had with them—he said he had no business with them, and he did not intend to take them away—I had left them safe on the bad in the room</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker of 12, Parry-street, Lambeth—on Saturday morning, 25th December, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in Parliament-street going home—a female came up and asked me to accompany her, which I declined—she asked me if I would treat her to a glass of drink—I said, "No"—she said, "If you will go into King-street over the way, you can get some coffee there or anything else you like to drink"—I said "No; I am not going out of my way, I am going to Cannon-row and over Westminster-bridge, and I might get some coffee there"—she walked by my side, and just as I turned into Cannon-row, a person seized me violently by the throat from behind, pulled my neck back, thrust his knee into my back, and held me in that position, suffocating me for the time, while the female, who was in front of me, rifled my pockets—I am confident it was a man's grasp—I thrust my right hand into the female's mouth and held her bottom jaw as tightly as possible, and she cried out two or three times, "Take your hand out of my mouth"—the person behind me released my hand from her, and that enabled me to call out "Police" several times—I was thrown down, and the person knelt on my throat while the woman rifled my pockets—they tore my clothes—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my waistcoat; it is torn all across from this pocket where my watch was, attached to this ribbon which I have on now—I had 5 half-sovereigns in a little bag, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—that was left safe in my breeches pocket—there was a lamp three yards facing me—the policeman came up, and my watch fell from my pocket and hung by the guard, which it could not have done if my waistcoat had not been torn—I was holding my waistcoat at the time of the struggle—I am confident that the woman rifled my pockets, but cannot say whether the man assisted her—he</p>

On this night I was on duty in Cannon-row—about twenty minutes past 12 I heard a cry of "Police"—I went towards the spot as fast as I could, and saw the prisoner on top of the prosecutor in a corner—I was then about fourteen yards from them—as soon as the prisoner caught sight of me he ran away, but I never lost sight of him, and took him in Parliament-street—he had no hat or cap on—he resisted a little and said that he would not go with me; but I took him back to the spot, and the prosecutor, who was there, gave me this cap—there was a woman there when I first saw them lying on the pavement with the prosecutor, but I did not see her when I got back—the prosecutor was very excited, but was perfectly sober.</p>

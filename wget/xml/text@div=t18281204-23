            . I received the prisoner at the office, but I cannot say when - he was in charge on another offence; I found these three keys, this knife, and this cloth on him - one of the keys opens the prosecutors' private door; I opened it with it, and there is a communication from that door to the shop - the prisoner told me he had no residence, but slept at nightly lodgings; I ascertained that he lived with a woman - I went to her and found his lodging, and there I found this buckle.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutors. On the 30th of October I heard some one open our private-door - I went down and saw some one like the prisoner; I asked who he wanted - he ran out and shut the door; I cannot say the prisoner was the man, but it was like him; on the 5th of November I heard some noise at the door again, but the lock was down, and they could not open it - I went to the door, and saw the prisoner; I asked what he wanted - he said"I did not do any thing;" we open that door with a latch-key like this one - I have no doubt but this would open it.(Buckle produced and sworn to.)</p>

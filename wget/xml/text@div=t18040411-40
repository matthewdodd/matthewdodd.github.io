               <p>Prisoner Flaherty's defence. I was coming home from my hard day's labour, I met with Ms. Langford; she asked me if my landlady bought things; she said she had lost a bed and a bolster; I had bought a rump bone, I went for a peck of coals; when I came back again, my landlady said where is the woman that was speaking to you; I told her she was gone home for what I knew; with that she told me I should not light the fire till I told her where the woman was gone; she took me to Bow-street, the Magistrate said, he wondered she had the impudence of coming there, as she had been convicted of buying stolen goods, and was six months in prison for it; my landlady came in the morning and caught us both in bed; she then said I will take a book-oath, I will not hurt you if you will satisfy me for what money I have spent; she went to all the linen-drapers to see if the calico belonged to any of them; I bought it at Rag-fair; you can buy pieces of calico in Rag-fair, of three yards for sixpence; she charged me with the calico belonging to a Gentleman in Holborn; I insisted on letting the Gentleman see the calico; they said she was a wicked woman, and fairly forced her out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Langford's defence. As I was going down Drury-lane, I met Mrs. Flaherty, I told her I had been robbed of my bed and bolster; she told me to go to the pawnbrokers, and her landlady bought such things; you can enquire if she has such things to sell; she told me to stop at the door till she carried the rump-bone up stairs; when she came down, she said, I will not go in now; I do not think any body is at home; we went into a public-house and had a pint of beer, and I never saw Mrs. Flaherty till past eleven o'clock at night; I was in bed, and when she came to me she said, my landlady says she will put me in the watch-house; in the morning, this woman came to me, and seized us both in bed; she said, I am very glad I have found you here; very well, said I, if you think I have got any thing, you are very welcome to search; she found nothing; no gowns, nor patchwork, nor pieces, I ever saw.</p>

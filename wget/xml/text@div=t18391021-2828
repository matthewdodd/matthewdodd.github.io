                  </hi>. I am a horse-dealer, and lodge in Queen-street, Seven Dials. I have known the prisoner eight or ten months, by his coming to lodge there—I have been to St. Petersburgh, and he told me he had been at St. Petersburgh and Moscow—he spoke the Russian language—he said he knew me at St. Petersburgh—he left the lodging—he came on the 15th of October, and proposed to sleep there—I went to bed about half-past eight o'clock, leaving him in the house—after I had been in bed some time, M'Donald came in and awoke me, and I missed my coat, waistcoat, and trowsers from the head of my bed—M'Donald brought my trowsers and waistcoat back again in about ten minutes, but I have never seen coat again—I saw the prisoner at the police-office, and said to him, "You took all my clothes, you took my coat, you had better tell me what you did with it"—he said, "Mr. Carr, I was so intoxicated, I cannot tell what I made of your coat.

                  </hi>. I am servant at the house where the prosecutor lodged. I have seen the prisoner with Carr occasionally—he came on the 15th of October—Carr went up to bed between eight and nine o'clock—the prisoner followed directly after him—I went up about three quarters of an hour after—four besides myself slept in the room—I had a bed to myself—I was going to bed, and found the prisoner in my bed—I awoke bin, and asked what he was doing there—he said, "It is all right"—I said there was no room for him there, he was to be with Can?—I shewed him into the next room, where Carr was—there was a spare bed in that room—I asked him if his lodging was paid for—he said it was right—I went down and found it was not paid for, came up, and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he gave me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a pint of beer—the light went out in the room, and I went to get a light—he then made a rush out of the room, and I after him—he dropped the waistcoat and trowsers on the lauding, and ran down stairs and got away—I cannot say whether he had toy thing else in his possession—he rolled about so much, I was afraid he would break his neck down stairs—he was completely dressed—I missed a pair of sheets off another man's bed, belonging to Mr. Southgate, the owner of the house, which I have since seen in Pipe's possession—the pri<lb></lb>soner had his clothes on when he was in my bed, and his shoes also—I thought he was drunk.</p>

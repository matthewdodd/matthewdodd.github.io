               <p>Q. Did you find them again?</p>
               <p>Maidley. I found the silk gown under her petticoat , as she was going out of the house, and found the scarlet gown upon her back the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend it her?</p>
               <p>Maidley . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any cloak, or any thing to hide it?</p>
               <p>Maidley . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor?</p>
               <p>Maidley. She was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the silk gown under her petticoat, did you know that the camblet gown was gone?</p>
               <p>Maidley. No; but when I found it upon her back, she pulled it off and gave it to me directly.</p>

            . My sister lost two gowns, and the Prisoner was very ready to deliver them back again; for she cried, and said she was heartily sorry for what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known her?</p>
               <p>Maidley. About five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a sober woman?</p>
               <p>Maidley. She is not apt to drink much.</p>
               <p>Q. What is she?</p>
               <p>Maidley. She is in the millenery business, but she has made away with her cloaths, and she cannot get employment in the milliners shops till she can get her cloaths again. I was present with my sister when the scarlet gown was found upon the Prisoner's back; but she was very much in liquor, and had behaved very well before this, and I believe she did not know what she did when she took them.</p>

               <p>When was this? - On Saturday the 29th of April; when I got up to Denmark-street I saw the prisoner about an hundred yards off, walking by the side of the gentleman, whom Forbes described, to have taken the bundle from him. The person whom Forbes described looked back, seeing me without a hat I imagine he had some suspicion. I drew back out of the road that they could not see me; they carried the bundle that it could not be seen by any body that was behind them. I walked on slowly after them; they got about three parts up the road before I got up to them. I stopped them and desired Joseph Davis to let me look at his bundle. I looked at it and said, I would swear it was my master's property. I took it from him and he ran away directly; I called out</p>

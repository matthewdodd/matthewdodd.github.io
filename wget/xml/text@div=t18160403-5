I got up and I found the window broken, and one of the panes of glass was broken, and a square piece cut out of one of the shutters. It was between three and four in the morning when I got up. I examined to see if any thing was gone out of the shop, and I missed two pieces of sarcenet, five silk handkerchiefs, four silk shawls of various patterns. We found some more articles in the area which had been taken out. I shut up the shop myself on the night of the 11th; I shut it up about eight in the evening; nothing was broken; I went to bed about eleven o'clock. The value of the things was ten pounds, or there abouts; I I have seen some of them again at the office. I had seen the prisoner Coker before; he was in my shop on the Thursday before; he came in and asked me to sell him a waistcoat and a coat; I sold him a waistcoat for ten shillings; he bid me pat it by, and he would call again, but he never called again after that.

There was a gentleman coming by of the name of Davis, and I asked him to be so good as to take them to the watch-house for me. He was Davis, the ward beadle. I told him I had another person run down Honndsditch whom I wanted to follow. That was Coker; I followed him and apprehended him in Swan-street, pretty near the bottom. I brought him back again into the Minories, and there I met Ann Moore running down the Minories as fast as she could. She did not see me, and ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030008"></xptr>into my arms; I told her she must go along with me, and she exclaimed, for God's sake, let me go. I took her then to the pawnbroker's shop with Coker. I asked the pawnbroker if he had given her any money, and he said no. I saw a shawl lying on the counter, and asked for it. The pawnbroker said that that was the shawl that she came to pledge. I told him, I knew it was; she heard that, and did not deny it. I then took and tied Coker and her together, and took them to the watch-house where the other two were, and after I had been there about a minute, I opened the door and saw my partner, John Ray, and called him in. He came in, and I asked him to search the two women, and I searched the two men. I asked them a great many questions, where they lodged; and both of them said they lodged where they could; one night with one girl, and another night with another, and so on. In searching Coker, I found the key of his apartment, as it afterwards turned out to be, in his pocket. In searching the other man, I found a key in his possession, which unlocks his sister's door, but not his own. I should state to you that I found this silk handkerchief, (producing it) not hemed, round Coker's neck, which is the property of the prosecutor, I likewise found another silk handkerchief in his hat. I am not sure whether there was one or more in his hat. I found on

The turnkey refused; then I said I would take the dog to White-chapel, or that way, and lose it. We then took it to Whitechapel, and in Wingfield-street he stopped at some old bones; we waited there a little time, and then we ordered him to go home, and he did so, and we followed him. He went into a little court off Wentworth-street, he went up one pair of stairs, and into the first room, and when we went into the room, there was Henley's sister. Her name is Mary, she seemed very much frightened. I searched the premises and found two silk handkerchiefs, and one silk shawl. In a box just by, I found two pieces of silk. (producing them) There are three pieces now, because they had cut a piece off from one of them. I then asked the girl if she knew where Coker lived, and she went and shewed us Coker's lodging. She took us up one pair of stairs in a house, a little way up Wingfield-street. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out the key I got from Coker and unlocked the door. There I found between the bed and the sacking, two silk handkerchiefs, and one silk shawl, and this tea-pot; but there is no owner for the tea-pot. I found nothing else.

            . (Sister to the prisoner of that name.) I lodge at the Baker and Basket, in Middlesex-street; Elizabeth Henley lodged in a court in George-yard;

             lodged there. I went to my sisters on the 12th of March, I went on the Tuesday to see her; the prisoner Morris was there; he was lying down on the bed; he had his clothes on; it was between ten and eleven in the morning; Coker came there with Ann Moore; they had came together to my sister's room. I saw them go out all together; they took something with them; they took a shawl with them, I believe; I believe they also took some handkerchiefs; but I am not sure. I remember the officers coming and searching the room; that was my sister's room they searched; they found part of the things which they have produced. I was in my sister's room when they came.</p>

               <p>Morris's Defence. I am guilty of having these things; but know nothing of their being stolen. I worked in the West India Docks, and I was going down George-street, and I saw a bag which contained those articles, and I took them up into Coker's room, and the pick-lock key and the iron crow were in it.</p>

               <p>Coker's Defence. About half past six, as near as I can guess, this man came up with a bag, and said he had just picked it up, and it had these things in it, with the crow bar and pick-lock keys, and being short of money, I asked 
               <persName id="t18160403-5-person126">
                  Ann

             to pledge the shawl; but the women are innocent.</p>

               <p>Henley's Defence. There was nothing covered up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030009"></xptr>at all in my room, because I did not know they were stolen.</p>

               <p>Moore's Defence. This young man, Coker, asked to pledge this shawl, and I thought it no harm, and I went. I did not know but they were honestly come by.</p>

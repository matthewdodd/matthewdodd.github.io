             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am clerk to the prothonotaries in the Court of Common Pleas in the Inner Temple, the records are in the care of Mr. Sherwood and myself, we have access to them whenever it is necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of May last as you were going out of the office did you observe any thing. - A. I observed the prisoner at the bar standing on a stool looking into the cupboard; he had removed the stool from the other side of the office, I told him it was very impudent of him being in that situation, he told me he was looking for a piece of waste paper, I desired him to go out of the office, and come there no more, he begged pardon and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine either of the closets, thereabouts. - A. I did not, it happened in the course of my business I examined the secondaries office, I found two shelves intirely stripped of the records.</p>
               <p>- WELLS sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am clerk to Mr. Loddington, one of the secondaries of the office in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you at any time seen the prisoner in that office. - A. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. At either of these times was your attention attracted by any noise that you heard. - A. Particularly so, it was about Hilary term in this year. I was in Mr. Loddington's office, I heard a noise of something falling, I went out and I found the prisoner in a nook or corner, to which no person that comes on business at either of the offices would go, I perceived three bundles of paper that I myself had taken out of a box, and I had put them on a high shelf, the papers belonged to the office; I asked the prisoner what business he had there, he replied, he was waiting for a person coming to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.How near was he to this paper which was so down on the ground from off this high shelf. - A. He stood within three feet of the paper, and about four feet from the place where they were taken.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Did you purchase a quantity of parchment from the witness, Scott, Falcon-street, Clare Market. - A. Yes, about the month of May last, I produce them; this parchment is worth about eighteen pence a-pound to make glue of; there is eleven pound weight of it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Did you sell bundles of parchment of this description to the witness in the month of May last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you buy this parchment. - A. I bought them at three or four different times from a man in our shop, I believe the prisoner to be the man, I gave him from sixpence to ninepence a-pound for them, some of them was mouldy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. The quantity of parchment that is now produced you bought of a man two or three different times, you cannot tell me from whom you purchased it at any particular time. - A. No, the transaction took up a very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in a situation to buy parchment of that description. - A. Yes, we keep a bookshop, we advertise for parchment or waste paper.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that as you purchase a vast quantity, you are not able to say that you purchased the parchment now produced of the prisoner at the bar. - A. I cannot swear positively that I bought it of the prisoner, but I believe to the best of my knowledge he is the man that I bought parchment of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any particular notice of him at the time that the parchment was sold to you. - A. I did not, he appeared to be some lawyer's clerk, some underling.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you upon your oath, will you take upon yourself to swear that is he the man. - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have bought parchments of different persons. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy parchment like that of other persons. - A. No, this is a particular kind, I never bought any before like it or since.</p>
               <p>Court. Then where is your doubt, you first of all swear you believe him to be the man, then being pressed and asked about it, you say you will not swear he is the man, but now upon re-examination you say you bought no other parchment like this but of the prisoner. - A. I have no doubt in my own mind but he is the man, I think he is the man, but I will not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. He is so much like the man that sold it to you that you have no doubt. - A. I have a doubt, I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, this kind of shuffling will not do, how came you to purchase parchment of a man whom you thought to be some lawyer's clerk, some underling, you know it could not be possible for him to have anything of this kind honestly. - A. I did purchase it.</p>
               <p>(The parchment identified by Mr. Hewlett.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the court of Common Pleas and the King's Bench, there are offices where we stick up bills for employment; being out of employ I used to go to see if my bills were underwrote, Mr. Hewlett saw me standing on a stool, he asked me what I was about, I told him I was looking for a piece of waste paper to write a bill; sometime after Mr. Sherwood met me and took me to Bow street, there the husband of Mrs. Scott said that he never saw me in his life, and I was discharged. Three weeks afterwards I met Mr. Hewlett, he says to me, you are the person that we want, he took me to Bow street, Mrs. Scott came, she said the person that sold the parchment was a dirty man, she did not believe me to be the man. On the third examination, she said she thought I was the man; I am perfectly innocent, I never saw Mrs. Scott in my life, nor did I ever take any thing out of the office in my life.</p>

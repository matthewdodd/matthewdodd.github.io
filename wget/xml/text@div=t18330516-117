               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. The gold tops and the garnet broach are certainly yours? A. Yes; I speak to them positively - I had told him not to use any of that gold in my business - he was in the habit of using small quantities of gold - he did not say he had used it in my business, he said he used it for himself - I know Gleeson; I cannot tell whether I said in his presence to the prisoner, that it would be better for him to tell me the truth, I might, but if I did, I believe it was some time before the prisoner was taken into custody - when his father was at my house, when I was speaking about his calling on persons for goods in my name - Gleeson works for me, but I don't recollect speaking to the prisoner on this subject in his presence - the prisoner was to leave me this year; I had heard he was to set up in business.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the conversation you had with the prisoner in the presence of his father, allude to this transaction? A. No; to some other - when he spoke to me about this he said, if I would not do anything to him he would make the gold good.</p>

             (police-constable, G 32). I took the prisoner - his master said he had lost a great deal of property and he would make no promise to the prisoner; he said if his master would forgive him he would restore the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160063"></xptr>gold - I have the coral necklace and other articles which I got at Mr. Campbell's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you see Miss Campbell? A. Yes; this brooch was in Mr. Campbell's shirt, and I received these gold tops from him, and this snap from Miss Campbell.</p>
               <p>Mr. COOPER. I know these tops and this brooch - I had several pairs of these tops in my counting-house; the brooch is marked.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who puts the mark on your articles? A.Sometimes myself, sometimes other persons- the prisoner has marked some - I have sold some brooches, though not perhaps exactly of this description - I have no mark on these tops, but they are not a common pattern; I only know one workman who makes that pattern - there may be others.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Did you miss any brooches from your stock which have not been sold? A. Yes, several.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many persons have you in your employ? A.Only Mrs. Cooper, who would occasionally go to the back of the counter; I have two persons who work in-doors, and several I employ out of doors; they have not access to my stock - this letter is the prisoner's writing, and is signed with his name. - (Letter read.)</p>

               <p>To Miss Isabella Campbell - My dear Isabella; - I hope this will find you well, as it leaves me at present. I am sorry to say you will be under the necessity of coming to Hatton-garden on Tuesday next, to say I gave you the coral-necklace, the coral-snap, also the gold tops, and the garnet brooch which your father had. Do not say any thing else; perhaps they may ask you many questions, but you need not answer any unless you choose. I hope, my dearest love, you will come, or else I shall be kept until you do come. For God's sake come, and keep up your spirits, as I am almost certain it will be all right then, if not then, it will, of course, be right at the trial.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. COOPER. Were you at Hatton-garden? A. Yes; Miss Campbell did not come, I believe she is out of the way - I have been to Bristol in search of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the brooch and the snap of Gleeson, and the coral-necklace of Mr. Couch - I used the gold in Mr. Cooper's business.</p>

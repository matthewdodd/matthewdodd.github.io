                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Tooting; the prisoner was in my service about eleven months—he slept in the house, and had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. On Tuesday, the 15th of May, I had been to London—when I re<lb></lb>turned, having suspicion, I went into the bakehouse, and saw a basket hanging on a nail—I examined it, and found it contained flour in a paper bag, and also some dirty clothes belonging to the prisoner—the flour was the lowest thing in the basket, except his dinner-cloth—the bag is one of our make, and I believe the flour to be mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)—I hung the basket up again, and went and stood in the lane, where no one could come in or out of the bakehouse without my seeing them—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and two of my men delivering bread—he and a child came up the passage—the child went into the bakehouse, and came out with the basket—I said, "What have you there?"—the child began to cry—I took the basket into the shop, and sent for a policeman to take the prisoner.</p>

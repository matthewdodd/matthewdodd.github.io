            . I am a private in the first regiment of Foot Guards. On the 12th of November last, I was in the stables, which belong to Hyde-park barracks, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard somebody at the top of the barracks; I went out to see who it was; I climbed up, and saw the two prisoners cutting the lead off the gutter. I did not think that they were doing wrong. The prisoner. Washington, came down with me; I pointed out a pipe in the roof of the stables where the rain came through; I went up again with another man; I then observed that the lead was fresh cut, and sent for the clerk. I went down a second time, and returned again; the lead was then cut off and gone.</p>

            . I am also a private in the same regiment. I went up to the top of the barracks, and saw that the lead had been cut away; I saw the prisoner, Baron, coming down, with a basket, from the top of the building; I did not suspect him; I afterwards saw him standing by the dung-hill; I went there, and found the lead hid in a basket, covered over with dung; there was also a knife in the basket.</p>

               <p>JOHN BRAGG. I am clerk of the works at the barracks. The prisoners were employed at the barrachs; one as a bricklayer, and the other as his labourer; they had no authority to move the lead; it is not their place to do any thing with the lead; Baron is the last person that I should suspect.</p>
               <p>Washington's Defence. The man spoke to me about a pipe being stopped I went up to look at it, and saw the lead cut; I told the other man of it, and he took it to the barrack servant.</p>
               <p>Baron's Defence. We went to the top of the house; the other prisoner told me the lead was cut; I was going to take it to the servant, but not directly; I put it on the dung-hill, and it must have sunk down; I did not cover it.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me nine weeks ago, and was with me some time. About seven weeks ago the things mentioned in the indictment were missing: I was then in the parish-house: my sister missed them. I went to the pawnbroker where the prisoner frequented, and found one shirt and the body and sides of another. The prisoner sent another person to the pawnbroker, who was stopped with the other things upon her.</p>

            . I am sister to the prosecutrix: I informed her these things were missing on Friday the 13th of December, in the evening. We suspected the prisoner, she not coming home that evening. I went with my sister to the pawnbroker's, where we found one shirt, and the body and sleeves for another: there was Esq; Henley's name upon the shirt, she had had that to make the others by. The pawnbroker stopped a woman about half an hour after we came away, with some of the cloth, and sent for us.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, I live at Mrs. Rodbird's, Black-friars; the prisoner pledged a shirt body and pair of sleeves and the pattern shirt for 2 s. the others for 6 s. She brought them both in the name of Mrs. Finley, who came and said they were her property: she bears a good character, and lives in our neighbourhood. She since owns she was deceived by the prisoner. On the 14th of December another woman came with other pieces and a petticoat, in the name of the prisoner. I got a constable and took Woolf<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160003"></xptr> up. I took a piece of it upon her neck, and the other in her room where she lived; in the whole there were seven pieces. The prisoner acknowledged she took the things, and that she did it on purpose to be transported.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>It is true I took them, but not with intent to defraud her. My husband used me ill, and I took them in order to raise a little money to pay a debt.</p>

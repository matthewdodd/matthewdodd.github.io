I am a collar-maker, and live in Victoria-road, Cambridge<lb></lb>heath-road—about half-past 12 on the morning of 14th July I was in the Hackney-road—the female prisoner accosted me, and asked if I would stand something—we went into a public-house opposite Shoreditch Church, and she had a glass of gin, and I had a glass of ale—we then walked down the Hackney-road together—when we got as far as Weymouth-terrace I left her—she called me back again and said she had something to say to me—I went back, and she made a snatch at my chain, and ran away with it—she did not say anything—she got my chain and watch, with a locket attached, and left the key in my button-hole—she proceeded a little distance and fell down, and then for the first time I saw Rose—he came and assisted her to rise, and they both ran on together—I followed them, and just as I was catching hold of Jameson, turning into Little Cambridge-street, Rose came behind me, and struck me with his hand—I fell down—they both ran on together—I got up again and pursued them—I kept them in sight; they were a long way in front of me then—I saw Jameson taken by the policeman in the Hackney-road—I did not see Rose taken—this is my watch—the chain is not here—mine was a gold one—this is my handkerchief—I must have lost that out of my pocket.</p>

I was in the Hackney-road on the night in question, and saw Jameson talking to the prosecutor—I watched them—all at once I observed her make a rush at the prosecutor and knock him in the middle of the road—as he was falling he pulled her along with him—Rose went to pick her up, and as soon as he had done so they made off together—the prosecutor got up directly and pursued them—just as the female prisoner was going to turn into Little Cambridge-street the prosecutor went to catch hold of her, and Rose ran behind him, gave him a blow in the head, and knocked him down in the middle of the road—I pursued them—seeing another constable in Brunswick-street I said, "Go and stop them"—he ran on past the female, and I caught her in the Hackney-road—my brother constable caught Rose.</p>

I was on duty on 14th July—I saw the prisoners running down Brunswick-street—I went into the middle of the road and heard the prosecutor say, "Stop that woman"—I passed by the woman, and stopped Rose in the Hackney-road—I saw him put his hand into his side pocket and throw the watch away—I took him by the collar of his coat and went and picked up this watch—the ring of the watch was picked up also.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rose's Defence.</hi> I was coming down the Kingsland-road when the female ran by me and fell. There was no cry of "Stop thief." I helped her up. The prosecutor came running up drunk, with his umbrella in his hand; as he ran he got his umbrella between his legs and fell and grazed his hand, and then he said I knocked him down. No one ever saw me receive the watch, or throw it away, or ever saw me in company with the female. The police<lb></lb>man and the prosecutor contradict each other; one says I knocked him down, and the other says the female did. The policeman never saw me with the</p>

I am innocent of the charge; the policeman is at the bottom of it all; he told the prosecutor to say I knocked him down. I never laid a finger on him.</p>

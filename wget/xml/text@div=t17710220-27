I was close to Mr. Foy's side: his foot slipped, and he jostled against one of the women. Mr. West instantly knocked him down with his fist. When he got up he was all over blood, and without his hat and wig. I cried out, For mercy and peace. I looked for his hat and wig. I slipped down. While I was down I received two or three blows. I saw Mr. Foy down upon his back, and the little man Paris striking him with a short stick, about an inch and a half or two inches round; it was no extraordinary large size. After I saw this, I heard Mr. Fynes call for the watch. West had hold of Mr. Fynes, and held him fast, saying, he should not go till he charged the watch with him. The watch came, and he charged him. I went with him to the watch-house. I did not see the deceased: he was brought into the watch-house, and he could not stand. A watchman set by his side, and supported him; he bled very much from his nose and mouth; and he had a cut on his nose: he said, That little man has broke my heart: he denoted him by having a small cockade in his hat. I did not see Randall strike at all: he had a stick in his hand then. I was not charged with the watch. I asked the officer to let me get bail for Mr. Foy and Mr. Fynes; he said, No, he would take no bail at that time. I had been about half an hour in the watch-house. Then I went and fetched Foy's wife, and came back again, and staid with the deceased till five o'clock. I asked him if he would be bled: he said, Yes. I went and fetched Mr. Gill: he bled him; and then he spoke a few words of the sad affair he had fell into. In the morning we procured bail for him. Then we carried him home in a chair. When he went to go to bed, he said to me, Joseph, now I am going to bed, I shall, I am afraid, never rise out of it more. I asked him then who did him the injury: he said, the tall man, West, knocked him down, and kicked him in the side, and the little midshipman, Paris, jumped upon him. I was called up next morning at three o'clock by Mr. Foy's apprentice. I went and took him by the hand, and said, John, how do you do? he said, Very bad.

I went to a surgeon, and told him there was a young man in a dangerous way wanted assistance; the servant said his master was ill. I went and told Mr. Foy of it: he said, For God's sake get me the gentleman that bled me. I went. It was five o'clock. I knocked at his door. He answered me out of the window. He came down and went with me and Mr. Grey to Mr. Foy; there he made the same declaration as before. Mr. Gill said he had prepared some little medicine for him. I went to his father-in-law's, and in the mean time he died; which was about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes; half a gallon of beer before I came in, one half afterwards, and a p int of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave the house?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Pretty near two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Very well in his senses; he walked upright. I can't say he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in liquor?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes; a little.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he jostled a woman; describe in what manner: who was the woman?</p>
               <p>Roadey. I don't know: she was in company with him: there were six men, and four or five women.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the foremost of the company?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Mr. West.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the jostling?</p>
               <p>Roadey. He slipped from my side against the woman; but neither of them fell.</p>

               <p>Roadey. I don't know; I was diligent after taking care of Mr. Foy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who called for the watch?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any women scream out?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes; then they were crying out, Murder, and so on.</p>
               <p>West. He declares he was on the side of the way we were of; we have witnesses to prove he declared himself to be on the other side of the way.</p>

               <p>Roadey. Rather a gloomy night; there was a lamp over our heads. I took particular notice of them in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure West was the man that knocked down Foy.</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see the other man that struck him was Paris?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. You say he was merry; was the jostling by joke or accident?</p>
               <p>Roadey. By accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he leaning upon your arm or any thing? Did he want that help?</p>

            . I was in company with Mr. Foy and the company at Mr. Nash's; we had a pint of gin and beer; we were there from about a quarter after nine to near two o'clock. Roades and the deceased and I came away together; we came along very peaceably till between the Ship and Black Dog in Shoreditch. The first thing I saw was, West knock the deceased down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company with him?</p>
               <p>Fynes. Randall, Paris, and three or four women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing pass between Foy and the women?</p>
               <p>Fynes. No. The first thing I saw was Foy knocked down by West; he got up immediately; his face was all over bloody; I had stopped at first; then I advanced nearer; then West turned upon me and gave me a blow on the side of my head; the prisoner Randal came and assisted him. When West and I was engaged, to the best of my knowledge, I saw Randal strike the deceased with a short stick; then Randal came upon me with the stick; they were both upon me; I was knocked down and struck several times; as soon as I got up I ran and called the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any violence offered to the deceased in your presence?</p>
               <p>Fynes. I saw him strike him twice. I did not know Randal at the time; it was a frosty night; no moon light; there was a lamp just over the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a light as to know him?</p>
               <p>Fynes. Yes, when he came upon me there was charge for charge. I was brought to the watch-house: the deceased was brought in soon between two watchmen and laid upon the bench; he slipt off the bench upon the ground: after he had been there about an hour he vomited blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any marks of violence?</p>
               <p>Fynes. He had a wound on his nose and his mouth was bloody: the officer of the night kept us in custody till next morning: we were sent to the cage next morning, because we would not give the watchmen money. The deceased was carried home about eight o'clock, supported by two men upon a chair. I had visited the deceased but once before he died. I did not suspect he would die. It was on the 15th of January in the afternoon that I called to see him: I asked him if he knew me, he said he did: I asked how he did, he said, I hope I am done for. I said no more to him: he and I were weavers, both of us mostly in the velvet way. The officer of the night took their words, but he would not take ours: West I believe gave him money.</p>

            . I am a watchman; on Monday, the 14th of January, about two o'clock on Tuesday morning, I was on my stand at the end of Magpye Alley: I heard some people on the other side of the way have many words. I heard them soon call watch: then I crossed the way and went to them: the deceased lay upon his back, and Paris was standing over him in a threatening manner with a stick, a kind of a short stick about as thick as my wrist.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Randal a stick?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Yes, much such another</p>
               <p>Q. Had West a stick?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Not that I saw. West was striking two men that run behind me for shelter. I went to the watch-house and got three men to my assistance: one got West by the collar, and then it ceased; we secured them and took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Foy struck?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Not to my knowledge: Foy was left in the care of the other watchmen upon his belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear hurt?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Yes, his hat and wig was off and his head all over blood. The constable said there was another person wanting: I went to see, and they were bringing up the deceased in a disorderly bad manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say in a bad manner?</p>
               <p>Clayton. The watchmen were pulling and hawling him: Mr. Pickersgill stood by him. I told him they did not use him well. I went out upon my beat; when I came back I saw Fynes, and I asked who the other was: he said, Foy: I went out and returned at six, and I asked Foy how it happened; he said the midshipman ( Paris went by that name he had a cockade in his hat) he said the midshipman has broke my head with a stick. I got his wife to fetch a gentleman to let him blood; he drew his breath very hard; after he was let blood he breathed easier: we got him discharged: he could not walk at all; the watchmen attended him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the parties before?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I was well acquainted with Fynes and the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Foy appear in liquor?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Fynes?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No.</p>

               <p>Clayton. He led him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you said to them. What did you say the men had done?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I said there was a quarrel in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that they had been making a fray?</p>

               <p>Clayton. Yes; by the accident that had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Why charge him with having done a pretty piece of work?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Because it was a bad accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Fynes strike West?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I saw either Fynes or Roadey strike him; I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had hold of Fynes?</p>
               <p>Clayton. They all went together: West charged Fynes and Fynes charged West:</p>
               <p>Q. You had been acquainted with Fynes?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I knew him in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it so dark in the street you could not distinguish him then?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Foy had any falls with the watchmen?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I believe he had; I saw them gathering him up like.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any battles with the watchmen?</p>
               <p>Clayton. That I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him?</p>

               <p>Clayton. At the Unicorn brew-house, about forty yards from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you stay with him?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No; the watchmen said they could not bring him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give the reason why they could not bring him up?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him aim any blow at the watchmen?</p>

Mr. Gill went to him: he said, Sir, I am glad you are come: save my life if you can. He desired us to fetch a doctor.

            . I am a weaver. I was at Mr. Foy's about eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning: he was lying upon his back; his eyes were shut; sometimes he opened his mouth: I said, Jack, do you know me? he said, Yes, Will, very well: I said, I am sorry to see you so ill used: he said, Will, I am barbarously used; my heart is broke within me. I asked him if he knew any of them: he said, Yes; Pickersgill I know. He said a big man knocked him down, and kicked him in his private parts when he was down; and a little man jumped upon his breast I asked where his wife was: he said she was gone to the justices. He said the little man that jumped upon his breast was a midshipman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Foy mention the names?</p>
               <p>Williams. Only the name of Pickersgill.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Shoreditch. About the seventeenth of last month, I received orders from the coroner to open the dead body of Mr. Foy. I first examined it in the presence of Mr. Milward, and Mr. Gill the apothecary, but could not observe any thing worthy of notice, except upon the scrotum or bag of the body. Upon opening the body, I found a rupture to consist of the intestines and cawl. When I examined the intestine part of it, it was mortified, which I imagined was owing to the confinement in the part, and part of it was ruptured: the remainder of the viscera seemed to be in a very good and found state. Upon opening the breast, the right lobe of the lungs was considerably injured, and adhered to the adjacent parts, so that it was incapable of performing the common function of breathing; the other parts of the breast seemed in a good state. From the symptoms which he complained of, and the appearances, I do imagine his death was owing to the rupture, which, if he had had proper care in time, there was more than a probability of his doing extremely well.</p>
               <p>Q. That of the lungs must have been a thing of some continuance?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. I suppose three years.</p>
               <p>Q. With relation to the rupture, would that happen by any kind of violence, and what sort of a violence?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. I look upon a violence on the belly to be the immediate existing cause; but there may be a pre-disposing cause, which may be some force exerted on the bag or scrotum.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think any hurt or blow on the scrotum could hurt it?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. It might be the pre-disposing cause, but not the immediate cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not they be both made at the same time?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. Almost instantaneously, one after the other.</p>
               <p>Q. At the same time?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you distinguish whether it was an old rupture, or lately come down?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. In this case, it is not of much signification, because the same immediate acting cause must exist to impress an old one, so as to occasion a man's death, equally the same as to occasion an immediat e one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this appear the effect of violence?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. All ruptures are the effect of violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend he died naturally, or owed his death to violence?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. He owed his death to the rupture.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any mark or swelling upon it?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. There was a discolouration, from some force exerted on that part.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that come by falls only?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. It might come by any sudden or quick motion; it might come by falls, or motions, or leaping or jumping, or lifting heavy weights, or any thing that puts the muscles of the belly into perpetual motion: it might come from falls, or blows, or strains.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any marks on the belly outwardly, as if it had been bruised?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. I did not; the belly gives way on any violence, which does not discolour the part so much as on other parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any body had stamped upon the belly in that manner, would there have been marks of violence?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. There is a possibility of being marks, but a greater probability of there not being any, on account of the belly giving way: the rupture in the scrotum might be occasioned by falls, leaping, blows, or any quick or sudden motion; even coughing and vomiting might occasion it, when the parts have been considerably relaxed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of his having had ruptures before?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. It did not appear to me that he had a rupture before Mr. Millward, the other surgeon, thought there was; but it is a matter of little consideration whether there was or was not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it might be occasioned by leaping or jumping, &amp;c. Supposing the party to be full of liquor, would it not more probably happen then by a lesser motion?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. When the person is stimulated, the muscles are certainly more laxed then than in a better state.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark on the breast?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. None at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200046"></xptr>Q. If there had been a punch upon the breast with a stick, would not that have made a mark?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. I make no doubt of it, because there is the resistance of the ribs.</p>

            . I keep a house in Bishopsgate parish: Mr. Foy and I spent the evening together: that this happened at my house: there were seven men. He came in a few minutes after nine at night; and Mr. Roadey, and Mr. Robinson, an acquaintance of mine, came in about ten, and Mr. Rowe, and another; in the whole there were seven.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink?</p>
               <p>Nash. Beer chiefly; we had two gallons of beer, and a pint of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think Foy drank?</p>
               <p>Nash. I cannot tell; there was above a quart of the liquor left: they went away about half an hour after one; they were sober and solid: Mr. Foy was a little merry and hearty; but, upon my oath, he was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he quarrelsome or noisy?</p>

               <p>Q. Was he sober or no?</p>
               <p>Nash. He was a little merry, but capable to take care of himself.</p>

               <p>Nash. He was sober then.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what sky-larking is?</p>
               <p>Nash. I don't know: I believe it is playing tricks with one another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see sky-larking tricks played?</p>

               <p>On the fourteenth of last month, my wife, and family, and I, were invited to spend the evening at Kingsland Road: being engaged at Stepney, I could not accompany them there. I went at night to fetch them home; when I came there, I staid about an hour, or an hour and a quarter till it was rather late; my business detained me. I staid about an hour and a quarter, we all set off very peaceably. I, my wife, her mother, her sister, her two brothers, and her cousin. When near Holywell Lane, we were unfortunately met by these three men; they were all arm in arm, and running, and the deceased Foy run against my wife, and struck her on the breast. I then demanded the reason of it, a blow immediately followed; one took my wife by the arm and snatched her off the pavement. I ran towards her, and two of them took me by the collar. I had a handkerchief tied round my neck, they got hold of it, and one on one hand, and the other on the other, squeezed my handkerchief round so that I could hardly speak, I could not utter any words. My wife screamed and cried out for the watch, upon which some of my company that were behind came up to my assistance. I struck one of them, and then this Fynes blasted his eyes and swore the most bitter oaths, and then struck me. I was obliged to strike him, and do the best I could till the watch came up; then I gave charge of this Fynes, seeing him first: then they gave charge of me. The watchman took hold of me, and there was he with his fist over their shoulders and d - n - g and swearing at me, and wanted to get at me all the way to the watch-house, and abused us: he called my wife's mother old bawd, and said that my sister and all were a parcel of whores. The constable said, if he would not be easy he would put him in the cage. I told the constable to take charge of the other man. I did not know this Roadey, but I suspected him to be the other person. I taxed him with it in the watch-house; he said, No; he was not near us, nor in the company, and knew nothing about it. My wife had been ill almost five months. She was brought to bed about five months before this. The surgeon told her he did not know whether her arm would not be cut off. I had hold of her right arm, they came slap against us, and turned us out both against the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. To Nash. Where had Foy been the rest of the day?</p>
               <p>Nash. He said he had been with his father-in-law buying some pewter.</p>

            . We had been spending the evening at Mr. Buckley's, in Kingsland Road. Mr. West came between eleven and twelve o'clock. Mrs. West was there all the evening. Mr. West came to fetch his wife home. Randal came into our company about half an hour after twelve: Randal belonged to another company at the same house. We joined company to come home together: there was my brother, mother, sister, my cousin, Mr. Pickersgill, his wife, son, and daughter. Mr. West was to the wall, and Mrs. West outside. Near the Black Dog, Shoreditch, we met three men; two came first, one came after: the two men came and jostled Mr. West; his wife cried out; he asked the cause, and then one of them struck him, and said, D - n you, don't you like it? A third came up; Mr. West said, Here is another of the thieves: Mr. Randal went to his assistance. My brother was on the other side of the way, with my sister, and young Mr. Pickersgill. I took my cousin away, to be out of the way. The man took Mrs. West from her husband, and put his hand in her bosom; that was one of the three, I don't know which: two of them collared Mr. West. A third came to them, and then she was pushed off the pavement. Mrs. West shrieked out; Mr. West called, Watch; two watchmen came up, Brown, and Moy; they secured Mr. West. Fynes struck at Mr. West over the watchman's arm, as he was in custody. We were all very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. West strike Fynes?</p>
               <p>Paris. I don't know he was struck first; I saw the blow given him over the side of the head; we all went to the watch-house. I did not see the deceased till he was brought into the watch-house: my brother was the first man that entered the watch-house. The deceased was brought in about five minutes by two watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men say any thing when they first attacked Mrs. West?</p>
               <p>Paris. I did not hear any thing; I heard a hollowing and hooting before they came up, but I did not expect any harm, so did not take any particular notice of it.</p>

               <p>Paris. No, the lady was meddled with first: he asked the reason, then he was struck. I was a little behind; I walked up to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the lady struck?</p>
               <p>Paris. Yes, over the breast: I saw them jostle against the lady, which appeared to be done by design.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Paris knocked down before West, or after?</p>

            . I was in company with the prisoners at this house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise before these men came up?</p>
               <p>Hortell. No; I was about four yards behind Mr. and Mrs. West: the three men knocked Mr. and Mrs. West up against the wall, and would not let them pass; they came along singing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be by design or accident?</p>
               <p>Hortell. By design. One laid hold of Mr. West, and put his hand down Mrs. West's bosom. Mr. West asked, what he meant; with that he said, D - n you, don't you like it? It was the same person that first jostled her. One of them pulled Mrs. West off the causeway. One of them struck Mr. West on the side of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. A tall or short man?</p>
               <p>Hortell. A short man. Some of our company came up then; Mr. Randal ran to assist them, and they were all in confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else done at that time by West?</p>
               <p>Hortell. No. Mr. West cried out, Watch? They throttled him, so that he could not speak; they collared him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who cried out, Watch, first?</p>
               <p>Hortell. Mrs. West.</p>

            . I was in this company: I walked with my spouse: Mr. West and his wife went first: my wife and I were the third couple; we were arm in arm. A little beyond the Black Dog, I saw two men come and separate Mr. West and his wife; they took hold of me, and dragged me on the other side the way: I gave my wife my watch, because I thought they were disorderly people. She said, You'll get a blow; I said, I could not fight, but I could see who did. I went over the way with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing to West and his wife?</p>

In returning back, I saw a good many people together about Hog-lane; words arose, and blows ensued. The motion was very quick. I sat upon my box and saw it in the middle of the street. I can't tell one man from the other. One out of three men ran against a lady: the gentleman took the lady's part, and asked him what he meant: words ensued. I don't know which gave the first blow.

My partner took hold of Mr. West: he said, Don't use me ill; I am a house-keeper night hand. Mr. Fynes came up to him, and I could hardly keep him off from striking him. Mr. West gave charge of Fynes: my partner took hold of him, and carried him to the watch-house: we put them in the watch-house.

               <p>Q. Had it more the appearance of pain, or drunkenness, that he fell off the seat?</p>

               <p>Q. Who put it in his head?</p>
               <p>Moys. The company. Brown was the man that first took him into custody. I had West in custody. We brought in West and Fynes. The officer said there was another. I went,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200050"></xptr> and found the deceased lying upon his back: we lifted him up: we brought him to the watch-house, and set him down upon bench; there he sat an hour and a half.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Shoreditch. When Clayton came down to the watch house, I, Mr. Haywood, and Mr. Moys, went out; just as I got into the place, I took hold of Mr. West: he asked me if I was a watchman, and bid me take charge of them people. Fynes came and made a blow at Mr. West: he made several blows at him. I delivered Mr. West to Moys, and took charge of Fynes. West made no resistance, but said he would go with me with all the pleasure in the world. I had blows over my arms from Fynes several times: he behaved very rough for some time. As soon as he came into the watch-house, he attempted to strike Mr. West. Fynes tried to slip his coat over his shoulders to get away, as I had hold of his coat: he appeared to be drunk. I was in the watch-house when Foy was brought in by the two watchmen; he appeared to my thinking to be very drunk; he slipt upon the floor, and seemed to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How did West and his company appear?</p>
               <p>Jones. Sober, and behaved very civilly. Foy went to the door to make water, but could not; he complained his stomach was bad: he said his heart was burst. I think he sat down sometime. His wife brought him some water afterwards, and washed him.</p>
               <p>Thomos Brown. I am a watchman. Clayton told me three men had fell foul of some gentlemen, and some mischief would be done. I went: Foy was upon his legs, and fighting like to himself: West gave me charge of him. Foy struck me, and knocked me down; he fell down himself in the channel: as he was aiming a second blow at me he fell flat upon his belly: I heaved him up, but he could not stand.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you the first man that came to Foy?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones come before, or after you was knocked know?</p>

               <p>Brown. After; Jones did not see him till he came into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what he meant by fighting with himself?</p>
               <p>Brown. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body near him then?</p>
               <p>Brown. No; he was at a distance from the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear then to be staggering?</p>
               <p>Brown. He appeared to have a great deal of strength; he struck me down with one hand; he seemed to be very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was pretty strong he was not much in liquor: Do you attribute his weakness to his fall with you?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes; he said in the watch-house that the midshipman had broke his heart.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Where was Moys?</p>
               <p>Brown. I did not see them till they came back to help me with him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I was in the watch-house. I went to see what was the matter. I saw a disturbance: the first I came to were three women; Mrs. West was one. One of the Shoreditch watchmen had hold of Fynes: he made at Mr. West in the watch-house to strike him. The deceased was brought in by two watchmen; he did not complain at all; he stood very well.</p>

            . Fynes has worked for me a twelvemonth, and upwards. I went to his house, I believe the Monday after these men were sent to Newgate. I saw Fynes by the fireside; I understood he was one of these men; I told him, I knew the parties in trouble, and I should be glad if he would give an account of it; he said, the night the accident happened, he and the deceased were going to a club; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200051"></xptr> said, they came along Bishopsgate-street; that the deceased was skylarking, or something of that kind: he said he was pt to kiss women when in liquor: I think he said it was severe weather; he said he got off the foot way, and fell among the ice; that he asked him if he hurt himself, and he said either No, or, Not much: I asked him again; he said he was sure he fell: he said he got into the foot-way again, and was twenty or thirty yards a-head of them. He said, he did not see the beginning of the quarrel; that when he came up, the man was upon the ground: he said he did not see who struck first: Fynes allowed they might be fuddled a little, or some such thing. I asked him if Pickersgill was present at the scuffle; he said he was not; that both he and his wife were at a distance.</p>

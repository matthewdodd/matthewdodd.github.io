                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STARLING</hi> wickenham, and am the prosecutor's housemaid—on Sunday 26th January, about half-past nine, I and the servant girl, Matilda Hurrell, were in the back parlour on the ground floor—we saw the door open and two men in the doorway—the prisoner I believe to be one of them—he was going towards the stairs—the other one came into the room towards me, and said if I called out he would dash my brains out—the prisoner went upstairs, and the other man stayed in the room the whole of the time with us—after a short time the prisoner came down again, and brought a gun to the man in the room, and said "Shoot them, spare no lives"—the prisoner then went up stairs again—he came down soon afterwards and spoke to the other one, and said "Come and help me with this box"—he went out into the passage, and said that if we made any noise they would shoot us through the window—he then locked the door—about, five minutes afterwards someone came to the door and found it locked—and one of Mr. Stedwell's men got through the window—I had locked all the doors and windows when it was dusk, the back door was locked and all the windows closed—after Mr. Stedwell's man had come in, I went upstairs and missed four pairs of earrings, two rings, a locket, and a gold pencil case, belonging to me—the man who I believe to be the prisoner had false whiskers on—and the other had a night cap tied close round his head—they were in the house altogether about three-quarters of an hour—I saw the prisoner again, eight days after, at the police station—he was placed with four others, and I picked him out without difficulty—the entry was effected through a side slide door in the shop, leading into a yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Stedwell—on 26th January, I was with the last witness in the back parlour, about half-past nine—the door flew open, and I saw two men—one came into the room, and the other went upstairs—he just Came against the door before he went up—the man who came into the room had an iron bar in his hand, and said, if we said a word he would knock our brains out—a little while after, the man came downstairs, and came into the room with a gun—he said to the man in the room, "Spare no lives, shoot their brains out"—he then went upstairs again—the man in the room called out to the other, to know if he was going to be all night at it—the one upstairs called out, and asked him to come and help him with a box—he did not go—he then came down<lb></lb>stairs and came, into the room—before he went away, he said that if we moved, or made any noise, he would shoot us through the window—they then locked us in and went away—the prisoner is the man that went upstairs—he had false whiskers on then—I saw him a fortnight after, at Brentford Police Court—I am sure he is the person—there were seven or eight men, and I picked him out without any difficulty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say that the man who went upstairs did not enter the room. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not see him till he came down with the gun—he went up again immediately—I was very much frightened indeed—at the time he came in I covered my face with my hands—the man who came into the room had a night cap on—it was tied under his chin, and he had a hat on—I did not say that the cap was pointed at the top—I could not see the top at all—we remained sitting in the room while the man was upstairs—the other one kept walking up and down the room, threatening us from time to time—I will not swear positively that the prisoner is the man who went upstairs—I did not see the prisoner in custody until a fortnight afterwards—I did not see him till I went into the room at the police station, and then I picked him out—he was not brought through the room where we were sitting—I saw Harris that day in another room—I was not taken through that room before I went to pick him out—there were seven or eight men dressed in light and dark clothes—the prisoner was in the middle of the men, and I went straight to him and picked him out—I did not see him the week previously, at the first hearing—I was there, but I did not see him—the policeman has never said any<lb></lb>thing to me about a reward, nor to Harris in my presence—when they went away they left the gun outside the dining-room door—the bell had been rung before they went away—the persons outside kept on ringing for about twenty minutes, but we could not let them in.</p>

            . I am sister-in-law of the Rev. Harry Bristow Wilson. On the 22nd of May last, in consequence of my attention having been directed to the middle drawer of my sister's dressing-glass, in which the trinkets and jewellery that I seldom wore were deposited; I perceived it was shut; but the bolt stood up, and prevented it from going into its place; it had been opened by some violence. I missed several things from that dawer, and among others the diamond ring and brooch in question.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, I went to Messrs. Dunn and Dalgairn's; I first saw one of the partuers; I asked which was Hawkins's desk, and on its being pointed out to me, it was unlocked; I opened it, and there I saw the brooch laying, and a pack of ivory trinkets. The gentleman found the duplicates, and gave them to me; that was when I came the first time.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have known the prisoner about three years. In May, he came to my shop, with a ring. I look at the ring produced; I believe that to be the ring. He offered it me to pledge; he wanted to borrow ten pounds on it; on looking at the ring, I said, I thought it was a larger sum than I felt warranted in lending; and he took it way, saying, that a less sum would not answer his purpose.</p>

            . I live with Barber, a pawnbroker. I know the lad at the bar; I have known him three years and a half. He came to me on the evening of the 22nd of May, between seven and eight o'clock; he brought this ring, and said, he wanted ten pounds on it for his father; I told him that was more than it would do for, and I said, I would give him six pounds; he said, that would not do; but he would go and ask his father; I then saw him go to another pawnbrokers. In two days after, he came again; then he said, that would do; but I was not inclined to lend him so much, and I lent him five pounds, twelve shillings, and sixpence.</p>

             WILSON. I know the drawer from which the jewellery in question was taken. I cannot speak positively to its state of safety previous to the loss. After this lad was taken up, I had a conversation with him. Messrs. Watson and Chappel sent for me, to inform me that the prisoner was then at their house. I went down there; I found the boy there. In his presence I said, that that ring and the other articles were stolen from my house, and that in consequence of the information given to me, I apprehended that a ring which he had offered at Messrs. Watson's, answered the description of the one that had been stolen. I asked him what he had done with that ring, and he said, he had returned it to his mother. I asked him where his parents lived, and who were his employers; he told me he was in the employ of Mr. Brown, at St. Mary's hill, and that his parents lived in Sloaue-street, Chelsea. Not wishing to cast any doubt on the prisoner's character with his employers, I abstained from going to St. Mary's Hill, and prefered going to Sloaue-street. The prisoner assented to his accompanying me and the pawnbroker's man in a coach to a house in Sloane-street, which on our arrival at it, by his direction, we found to be empty. I sat in the coach with the prisoner, while the pawnbroker's man went to a shop on the other side of the street, to make some inquiries. The result was that the house had been shut for three months. The person of the shop where the inquiry was made, sent his errand boy to ride on the coach-box to the landlord of the empty house, who resided at Brompton, whom I found at home. I asked him if any one could have occasionally slept at the empty house, and he said no one could have acces to it, because the key was in his own possesssion. Finding the boy had told me that falsehood, I determined to have him taken into custody; not knowing whether he should be given into the charge of an officer of the County or of the City, I went to Bow-street, and in consequence of the advice given me by the magistrate, I had the prisoner apprehended by a City officer, and he was taken to Giltspur-street Compter. In his way thither he retracted what he had said with respect to having the ring from his mother, and he said, he had it from one Singleton, who, he stated, lived at the house of Messrs. Finch and Co. in Skinner-street, Snow-hill. No person of the name of Singleton lived there. The prisoner was taken before the Alderman on the next Monday, and Singleton attended, and is here to day.</p>

               <p>LEE SINGLETON. I live in Newington, with my father. I know the prisoner at the bar, and have known him about fifteen months; I have known him when my father was unfortunate, and in the King's Beach. I look at that ring; the prisoner never had it from me; nor did I ever see it before I saw it at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>(Property produced, and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Singleton gave me the ring, and I pledged it for him; I was not aware it was stolen.</p>

               <p>-SQUIRE. I never saw Singleton but twice in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100016"></xptr>my life. I saw him in company with the prisoner about a week before Easter; they came together to my counting house where I was in Castle-court, Biching-lane; I was out when they came at first; they brought two rings; they were only guilt ones; they were cheap articles, and Singleton appeared as the proprietor of them. After that time, I did not see either of them until the 22nd of May, and then I saw the ring in Hawkins's possession. I had no dealing with Singleton.</p>

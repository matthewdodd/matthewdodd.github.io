On Sunday the 10th of May, between nine and ten in the morning, I put the pocket book in the looking glass drawer, in the two pair back room where we sleep.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there in the pocket book. - A. Three ten pound note, two ten pound drafts, and two indentures of the apprentices; one of them was the indenture of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the drawer. - A. No, I believe the prisoner was out at the time I put it there; he returned about eleven o'clock, I was below stairs; he went into the shop up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pass the room where you slept to go to the shop. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your bed room door locked. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband during this time. - A. My husband went out just as the prisoner came in; my husband returned at two o'clock, and a few minutes after that the prisoner went out; about three or four o'clock my husband went up for the pocket book; he missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time find any bank notes upon the floor of your room. - A. I did, in the parlour; that was two or three weeks following; I found five one pound bank notes, at the time I picked them up the prisoner was in custody</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in that room before he was taken in custody. - A. Just before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. There was some other lad taken up, charged with this offence. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember on Sunday the 10th of May - do you remember your wife putting any pocket book of yours in the drawer. - A. No; on Saturday night I received the ten pound notes; I told my wife to put them in my pocket book, and to take care of them. On Sunday the 10th of May I had occasion for some money; I asked her where the pocket book was; she told me it was in the looking glass drawer, in the bed room. I went and looked for it and it was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended the prisoner on suspicion that he had done this. - A. Yes, I apprehended him on Tuesday the 19th of May; upon searching him the officer found a watch, a one pound note, and a seven shilling piece; on Monday he stopped out all night, and on the Tuesday I apprehended him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any watch before that time. - A. Not to my knowledge; and there was another watch found in the lath and plaster in the room where the prisoner slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found in the room near where the prisoner was, when the officer took hold of him. - A. Not on the same day, that was the day after; there were five one pound notes found much about the same spot as he stood when the officer searched him, and found a watch, a one pound note, and a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You found on his person a watch, a one pound note, and a seven shilling piece. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow your apprentices over money if they work. - A. Yes, he can get from five to seven shillings a week for himself; he has lived with me eight years, I always found him honest.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time your master having left his pocket book on the desk in the shop. - A. Yes, about two months before; Meaking saw it, he opened it, he said his indentures were in it; he took them out and put them in again; one night afterwards he stopped out rather late, and master scolded him for it; he told me if he could get his indentures he would not stop; he told me if I should see them to give them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when your master's pocket book was missing. - A. Yes, it was on a Sunday; the next day Meakings told me if I would keep a secret he would give me a watch; I told him I would; he said he had got a pocket book, and he brought the watch home at night; he did not say whose pocket book it was, nor what he had done with it; afterwards he told me that he had burned the two papers that were in the pocket book, that was two drafts I suppose. On Monday night he brought me a watch, he put it in the wall in the bed room in the back parlour; he said I might take it, after it had been there some time; and in the course of a week I saw him put two guineas in the window frame of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. You are this man's apprentice - did you happen to be taken in custody for this yourself. - A. Yes, on Wednesday week after the pocket book was lost.</p>

               <p>Q. It was shortly after the robbery was committed that he told you this secret. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remained in the house and never gave any account till you were apprehended. - A. No.</p>

On Tuesday the 19th of May I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner at the bar, I asked him what money he had got about him, he told me two or three halfpence; I searched him, I found a five pound note, a seven shilling piece, a halfpenny, in his pocket, and a silver hunting watch; it appears to be a new one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards search the back parlour of the prosecutor's house. - A. That was the next day; there I found a watch between the lath and plaster, that parts the two parlours near the head of the bed; the person produces that watch that took it out of the wall; I produce the hunting watch, the note and the money. I then went up into the shop, I found two guineas in the window frame, where the window slides up and down.</p>

I sold it on Saturday evening, the 16th of May, for five guineas, to two young men, they appeared like blacksmiths; I am not certain as to the identity of the prisoner; the other watch was sold out of my shop, but I cannot recollect when; I have some recollection of the prisoner, but I cannot swear to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, in partnership with Mr. Lawson at 44, St. Paul's Churchyard—the prisoner was our traveller—last November he was entrusted with jewellery to go round to customers and to dispose of it—we supplied him with this black bag to place it in—we kept a record of the jewellery he took away every morning, and he had to give us an account of what he sold or left on approbation, and it would be charged against the customer and written on his account—on 12th November a new stock book was being prepared at our premises at Hatton Garden, where Mr. Lawson was—I saw the prisoner that morning at St. Paul's Churchyard, and said "I would rather you did not take your out this morning, because we are going to make a new stock book"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187803110032"></xptr>
               <p>—he said "I have an appointment with Mr. Harnett of Edgware Road and I will be back by 11.30"—he mentioned that more than once and ultimately left the bag—he returned by 4.45 without the bag and rather excited—I think he was the worse for liquor—he said that he had had his bag taken out of the train, at King's Cross railway station by three men. who passed hurriedly by him, who were in the same compartment with him, that his bag was by his side, and that he found something touch him, missed his bag, jumped out of the carriage, called the guard and said he had been robbed of a bag worth 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked him to stop the train, but he would not do so, and that he then went to Bagnigge Wells police-station and gave information, and from there came to me—I sent him with my partner's son in a cab to Scotland Yard, and they re<lb></lb>turned for a full list of the property, which was made out by Mr. Lawson, jun., and the clerk—Mr. Slade afterwards made a communication to me and I went to his place at Paul's Wharf and saw the bag; it was open and the empty jewellery cases were in it—when the prisoner came to me that evening he showed me the centre of a diamond bracelet with which he had been entrusted, and said "I have found this in my pocket"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the case of that bracelet, I found it in the bag at Mr. Slade's—I had looked out an order for the prisoner for some shirt studs for Dr. S. Bridges and handed them to the prisoner with some links and collar studs, and also a pair of earrings for Dr. Bridges' brother—on 14th August the prisoner was entrusted with a single stone diamond ring, No. 1082, value about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have asked him about that ring since the loss of the bag, and he said that he had never had it—on 9th October he had a diamond gipsy ring, No. 596, value 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have asked him about that, and he said that it was in the bag—he never suggested that he had been robbed of it by a woman—on 16th August he had a silver hunting watch—I asked him for it on several occasions—he said that it was with Mr. Norbury, who was getting up a watch club, he being employed at Ryland's in Wood Street—on 8th December instructions were given to take him in custody and he was taken—the case was investigated from time to time until 9th January, when he was discharged—we had had no information from Mr. Brown then as to where certain pawn tickets were—I have inspected the goods referred to in these six pawn tickets which Mr. Brown snowed me, and find they relate to some diamond earrings, a diamond and turquoise brooch, a pair of gold earrings, and a pair of diamond and turquoise ear tops, which had been entrusted to the prisoner for sale and which should have been in the bag—I had given Mr. Brown certain instructions previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner was in my employ about 6 months, I had a good character with him—he used to carry a stock book in his pocket—somebody in the firm gave him the bag every morning and it was kept in the iron safe at night—we had no other traveller at that house—on one occasion the goods were wrapped in paper and the bag was taken by somebody else—the firm checked his book with the general stock book—he would leave 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods with a customer, and generally for 10 days—I do not know that a warrant is out against Mr. Bridges—the prisoner was charged with a ring and wrote to say that he knew nothing about it—this centre out of a bracelet forms a pendant and can be used separately, he gave me that after he came from Scotland Yard—I believe he drove up to our place in a cab—he was first charged before</p>

               <p>a Magistrate about a fortnight afterwards—there were three or four remands and the Magistrate thought there was not sufficient case—I offered 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward in different newspapers—I do not know what Brown is—he has taken goods to Dr. Bridges in the evening—I examined the prisoner's stock book twice a year—I had no means of knowing whether goods left on approbation were entered in it unless he told me—trade had been bad for a long time and he said that he had answered an advertise—ment.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father and Mr. Goddard at St. Paul's Churchyard—the prisoner was their traveller and was paid by salary and commission, but I believe it was always made up to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on 12th November at a few minutes to 5 o'clock he came to the warehouse a good deal excited and made a statement, and I accompanied him to Scotland Yard in a cab—we were asked for a complete list of the things stolen and returned to St. Paul's Churchyard, where I called the articles out of the book and he told me whether they were in the bag or not—I called out the various articles mentioned on these pawn tickets, and he said that they were in the bag—I also called out the bracelet, of which he showed me the centre, and he said that it was in the bag—I called out ring No. 1082, he said that he had never had it; but I had given it to him myself and entered it at the time—it was never returned to me—I called out ring 596, and he said that it was in the bag.—he never complained to me that it had been stolen from him by a woman at Liverpool Street station—I called out a silver watch, and he said that Mr. Norbury had it—after the list was made out he said that if he took it to Bow Lane they would be able to communicate with Scotland Yard quicker than we could, that they would telegraph, and he went to Bow Lane for that purpose; he was away about 25 minutes and we left at a few minutes to 7 o'clock to go to Scotland Yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He got a good deal excited that night—he told me in the cab that while showing the bracelet to Mr. Barrett it came un<lb></lb>fastened, and he put it in his pocket—he asserted frequently that I had not given him one ring, and he had done so before—there had been a dispute about it—I know of things being taken out which were not entered in the stock book in which we kept the account with him—I believe it was an unlocked bag—it was in one instance my fault that he took out articles which were not entered—he was not credited with them though he was debited—that was a pair of ear-rings—there are 39 or 40 articles in this list which we made out—I know of his leaving goods on approba<lb></lb>tion with people—that is part of our trade—their names would only some to my knowledge from what he told us—I have no doubt that he returned a 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ring to the firm a week after the robbery, which had been out on approbation; I was not present, but it is marked in the stock-book—that was a little over three weeks before he was given in custody—he remained in our employ a week or 10 days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The ring he returned was one which had been out on the books to Mr. Cooper—during the five months he was in our employ I never took anything out of his bag and sold it to a customer—Mr. Goddard and Mr. Hitchin could—this entry is my writing—he had ring 1082 and two others.</p>

I am assistant to the prosecutors—I produce the stock-book—here is an entry in it on 14th August of the delivery of a diamond ring, No. 1082, and two others to the prisoner, in Harry Lawson's writing—two of the rings were returned to me on 21st September, and I said "You have another ring to return"—he said that he had never had it—he never said anything to me about having a ring stolen from him by a woman at Liverpool Street station—he never returned to me ring No. 596, which he had last October—I gave him out the silver watch on 16th August, and he has never returned it—on 30th August he had a clock from me, No. 5913, to show to Spiers and Pond, which has since been shown to me by one of the officers.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>them—I knew that he had been in Lawson and Goddard 's employ—I spoke to a man named Palethorpe, who was in the room, and we both went to the station for a description of the stolen property—on Sunday, February 3rd, I saw the prisoner at his house at Leyton (I had communicated with Mr. Goddard and with Sergeant Green, and was acting under their in<lb></lb>structions)—we had several hours' conversation about the robbery of the bag—I knew that he had been charged before a Magistrate and discharged—he said that there were three men in a railway carriage on the Metro<lb></lb>politan line, and two of them took the bag from him, that one passed him and the other blocked him, so that he could not get near him, and that he could not overtake them, as the train went on—he did not say how far he went on with the train—I made an appointment to meet him the following Monday at Broad Street station—Mr. Palethorpe, who was with us, left fur a few minutes, and then the prisoner said to me "I have a great deal to say, but I cannot say it, because there is a third party present"—he was with me the whole of Monday, from 10 to 4 o'clock—I then left him and arranged to meet him at 6 o'clock at the Catherine Wheel, when he was to produce six pawn tickets, which he agreed should be purchased for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me he had six tickets which formed part of this jewel robbery, that they had been given to him as his share by those who committed the robbery, that they had treated him very badly, having only paid his legal expenses and his wife's main<lb></lb>tenance while he was in prison; that they represented about 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the goods were pledged for about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he also told me that he knew of several similar robberies which were coming off, one in particular where the traveller was deficient in his cash about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he must go—I told him I wanted to see the articles and agreed to give him the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left him at 4 o'clock and communicated with Mr. Goddard, and then met the prisoner at the Catherine Wheel—he came in alone, but another person joined who I do not recognise—he took me from there to the Ship and Turtle, showed me these six pawn tickets, and asked me for an advance—I gave him a sovereign and promised him the balance when I had inspected the goods—he asked for my private address and said "I will see you again in a few minutes or a quarter of an hour and will show you a letter I have written to you"—he showed me this letter and I saw him post it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Brown. Feb. 4th, 1878. Dear Sir,—Having received a letter containing tickets, which I have every reason to believe are connected with the bag which was stolen from me, you would be doing me a great favour if, with your usual kindness, you would not only meet me early to-morrow, 10: N. L. Railway Station, but also help me by going to the various places so that I can identify my employer's lost property, the interest on one only will be returned by yours truly, S. W. Liversidge.") Written across that is "By doing this you will help to reinstate me in my old position."—He asked what I thought of the letter—I said that I thought it was a very clever invention—I met him on the Tuesday by appointment and he asked me to go with him to Chelsea—I went with him to Mr. Withers' shop, King's Road, and saw some earrings which were in pawn for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and for which I had the contract note—I took them out, paid the interest due, and a further advance of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made upon them, making the deposit note 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Withers offered to buy them, but the prisoner refused to sell them—we went to a public-house, where he said that we were going</p>

               <p>to a place where the remainder of the money might be found—I handed him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a brougham was waiting, I don't I know where it came from—we both got into it and went to a public-house, where he left me for a short time and came back and asked me for the tickets—I refused to give them to him—the brougham went away, and we took a cab to the Embank<lb></lb>ment—he insisted on the way upon having the tickets but I refused—he was getting the worse for liquor—we parted in Margaret Street about 7 o'clock and I immediately went to Mr. Goddard and Sergeant Green and handed the tickets over—I went round with Mr. Goddard and identified the goods and we were given in custody at one of the pawnbroker's—the prisoner was taken as the Bull and Mouth the following morning, and I found this letter there addressed to me: "Dear B.,—I have a special appointment to-day at 11, which I forgot to mention yesterday. Will meet you to-morrow, Thursday, Bull and Mouth, 11 sharp. Be there, I want to see you very particularly. S. Liversedge." When I left him at Margaret Street on Friday night, we had arranged to meet on the following day; he had promised to introduce me to people who had the property.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">See New Court, Friday</hi>)—he is a member of the Long Firm and a friend of the prisoner—I have been mixed up with the Long Firm three times, I have sold to them and have lost money by them—I never gave Horn a reference—the Bell and Bull is about two miles from my shop—I do not live there, but the landlord is an old acquaintance of mine—Petherick is a metal merchant, not a marine store dealer—I don't think he was called before the Magistrate; he is here—he did not see the 29 diamonds, but I mentioned them to him—the prisoner distinctly told me that he and three other men did the robbery; that the men in the carriage were acting with him, and that he knew them, and had part of it as his share—I was surprised, but I did not express it, as I had another object in view—he did not say that he was going to take part in the robbery where the traveller was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in default but he said "I could take part if I thought proper"—he thought I was a respectable man—he talked of the jewellery as "the stuff"—I do not know why the letter was written—I never knew till a fortnight afterwards that there was a reward out; that would not make much impression upon me, I am glad to render the public a service—I signed this contract note in the name in which it was given before, I believe Mr. Withers asked me to do so—I have never given evidence at a police-court before.</p>

            . I am a seaman. I was sitting at the Roebuck's Head, having a pint of beer; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner come in - they had a quartern of gin, drank it, and were then going away; the prisoner said to the prosecutor, "You had better let me have your watch, because you are too drunk;" the prosecutor said,"No, nobody shall have my watch;" the prisoner then put his hand down, took the watch out of his pocket, and put it into his own - they went out together; I did not see any money; I had seen the prisoner about, but never had any acquaintance with him - he seemed to be about half drunk.</p>
               <p>JANE WILSHERE. The prisoner came to my house on the 24th of March; he threw down half a crown, and sent for some gin; he had a handful of silver at the time - he then pulled out a watch, and asked me to take care of it; I said, "Is it yours?" he said, Yes; I said, "All the years I have known you I never knew you had a watch before;" he said, "If you don't like to take care of it, give it me back," and I gave it to him - he said he had brought it from on board a ship called the Hope, and he had brought it from Shields; he then left the house, and took the watch with him - it was a good silver watch, and had a brass chain, I think.</p>
               <p>JOHN SCOTT. On the morning of the 25th of March<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070098"></xptr>the prisoner came to my father's, at the Ship public-house, in Shakspeare-walk; there was a seafaring man there whom he seemed to have some knowledge of, and he said to him,"Ever since I saw you yesterday morning, I have been upon the spree - I have spent 2l. and parted with my watch, and all I have is this," (holding up this George the Second sixpence, tied to the ribbon,) and he asked the man what it was, the man said, "I don't know;" I said, "Let me look at it" - I said, "Any one might know that;" the prisoner had some gin and had no money to pay for it; my father said he ought to be ashamed - he said, "Here, d - n you, take this, it is worth it, I will call and have it again" - the officer came, and I gave it to him.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. The prosecutor came to me on the 25th of March, and gave me information - I went to the Three Crowns, where the prisoner was; he denied knowing any thing of the watch or money - I took him outside and said I would take him to the watch-house; he said he would take me to the house which he was at the night before - I went to the White Lion, in the same street, not many doors off; the landlord said he knew him, and he had offered a watch in pawn for 5s., which he refused to let him have.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned to him that the watch had been lost? A. Yes, it has not been found since.</p>
               <p>(Ribbon and sixpence produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That ribbon was not on the watch; he laid it down on the table and said, "Take care of that, I am drunk;" I said, "I am not much better;" he then told me to take care of his watch - I said, "You have a watch-pocket, and I have not," but he gave it to me - I put it into my pocket, and lost it - we were both drunk.</p>

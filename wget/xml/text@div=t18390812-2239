                  </hi>. I live in Wild-court, Drury-Jane, and sell things in Clare-street, Clare-market—the prisoner does the same. On the 18th of July I was eating cherries at my stall—the prisoner was before my stand—I spat a cherry-stone out of my mouth, which hit her cap border—I did it on purpose—she went into the public-house, then came out behind me, and spit some beer out of her mouth—part of it went down my back, and some over the goods I had on my stand—she returned to the public-house—I followed her, and told her as she had spoiled my goods, I would knock her down for it—she took up a quart-pot, and attempted to strike me, but did not—she afterwards struck me with her fist—I did not strike her, but we both walked out, and took no more notice of the case at that time—she remained at her stall about a quarter of an hour or less, and then came from her stall in front of mine—there was a large knife on my stall which she took up, and made a cut at me—I put up my left arm, and stopped that—she then turned the knife in her hand, took the blade in her hand, and struck me with the handle—she had struck me with the blade pre<lb></lb>viously, and I was cut on the wrist—I cannot say how she came not to cut her own hand—I do not know which blow inflicted the cut—I am not aware whether it was the heel or the point of the knife cut me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my name—it was read over to me before I signed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-porter, and live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. I was coming by when this happened, between six and seven o'clock I think—I saw the prisoner get up from behind a basket, and just before she got to the prosecutor she said, "D—your eyes, I will serve you out"—she then began to chop at him with the handle of the knife, and then took the blade, and began to chop at him with that—I saw his wrist bleed—it was cut—he put up his arm to prevent it cutting his head—I do not know whether she cut him with the handle or blade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital. The prosecutor applied to me to dress his wound—he had an incised wound on the left side of the left wrist, which had been recently inflicted—it was such as the knife produced might inflict—it was about an inch and a half long inside the wrist—there is no vein of any importance there—the wound might be half an inch deep—I should not call it a severe wound—it would deprive him of the use of the hand for some time—he might not get the full use of it for some months—it would maim and disable him for a time.</p>

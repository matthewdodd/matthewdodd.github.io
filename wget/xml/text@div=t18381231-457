I was out on furlough, and was at Edgware, on the 12th of December—I was going to Watford, to my friends—I got to Edgware about eight or nine o'clock at night—I went into the White Lion public-house, and found the prisoner there, in company with another woman—I got into conver<lb></lb>sation with them, and treated them—I paid about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for what I had—I took out my purse to pay—I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I was rather under the influence of drink, but I knew what I was about—about eleven o'clock the prisoner and I went out together, and the other woman left us—I went into the fields with the prisoner, and laid down and went to sleep—I do not know whether I paid her any thing—I had a watch, fastened to a guard round my neck—the purse was in my right-hand pocket—I awoke between four and five o'clock in the morning, and she was gone—I missed my watch directly I awoke—the guard-chain was broken—I went into a public-house immediately, and then missed my purse—the prisoner was taken next evening—this is my watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not give either the watch or purse to her.</p>

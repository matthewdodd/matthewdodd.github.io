                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Old Gravel-lane. The prisoner was my apprentice for fifteen months—I have no other apprentice—I had missed money from time to time—on the 19th of January Blakebo<lb></lb>roogh, a smith, was engaged on my premises—I saw him mark seven half-crowns, seventeen shillings, and eleven sixpences—I emptied the till of all other monies—I placed the marked money in the till about eight o'clock, and left it alone—I arranged with Blakeborough that he should watch—I left the shop a few minutes, leaving the prisoner there, and soon after Blakeborough made a communication to me—I returned, and emptied the money from the till—I counted it and found one shilling and one sixpence deficient—I took the prisoner to the back part of the shop, and said, "You have taken money from the till"—he denied it—I said, "It is no use your denying it, I know what you have taken, I shall send for a policeman and search you"—he said, "You may do that and welcome"—I put my hands into his pocket, but found nothing there—I sent for a policeman, he took from some part of his trowsers one shilling and one sixpence—I called Blakeborough to see what he was doing, and I kept him in that position till the policeman arrived—I saw Blakeborough take the money from his hand.</p>

I was engaged on the prosecutor's premises—I marked seven half-crowns, seventeen shillings, and eleven sixpences, which the prosecutor gave me—when he left the shop, I placed myself so that I could see the prisoner distinctly—he was standing behind the counter, near the till—I observed a move of his body, he then moved round the counter, and I saw him place something under the band of his trowsers—I told Mr. Lawley what I had seen—we went into the shop immediately—I saw one shilling and one sixpence in the prisoner's hand—his master laid hold of him, and asked me to</p>

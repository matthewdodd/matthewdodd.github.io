Give it to me back," and in the hurry of the moment I gave her the wrong one, which I had in my waistcoat pocket, and which I had taken the week before—that was a marked one—she threw the almonds into the road, and I gave her into custody—I discovered next morning that I had given her the wrong one—I then gave the right one to the constable.</p>

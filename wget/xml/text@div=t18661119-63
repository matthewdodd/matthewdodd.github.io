                  </hi>. I am in the office of the Chief Registrar in Bank-ruptcy—I produce a copy of a composition deed made on 22nd March by William Hopkinson, of 3, Alfred Place, Lower Wandsworth Road, which was left for registration on 13th April, and with it an affidavit of the truth of the accounts—I also produce the amount of debts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and teadealer, of Market Terrace, Victoria Park—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years—he came into my service some years ago, which was the commencement of my knowing him—he set up in business for himself about two years since—he had had goods of me before the commencement of this year, and I continue to supply him—in January, February, and March I supplied him with goods to the amount of about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid some small sum, leaving an amount of 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the 13th April—he obtained the last goods for me on March 26th or 27th—the date appears to have been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190109"></xptr>
               <p>the 26th, and I appear to have altered it to the 27th—on the 2nd May I received a letter from the prisoner, dated the 1st May; it is, I believe, attached to the depositions—at the time I supplied the last goods I was not aware that he was about to enter or had entered into a composition deed—I first heard of it through another creditor after the deed was registered, after the 13th April—my name is not in this account, which is signed in the prisoner's writing; he is still indebted to me in the amount of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's letter was dated May</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">addressed to Mr. Seear, and stated</hi>:—"I was not aware that you intended to push me. I did not put you down in the list of creditors, as I meant to pay you in full as soon as I get my affairs settled")—I called on the prisoner after the last goods were supplied to him, and before I was aware of that deed—I found him in bed, and told him I was sorry to hear that he was in difficulties, and urged him, whatever he did, to act in a straightforward honourable way, or he would blast his reputation in the commercial world for ever, and that I was afraid he had got into bad hands, and had got bad advisers—he acknowledged that he was in difficulties, and I asked him if he was so far involved that he could not by perseverance and industry keep a good name, as few men were in business but who at some period of their lives had been sharply pinched, but by industry and perseverance had kept a good name, and asked him what he owed—he went through his debts from memory, and I reckoned them up, and made it 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that there were some smaller amounts, which he could not specify, which would bring it to about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—among others, he mentioned White Brothers, Revell, Philpott, and Luce Brothers as creditors—he did not mention a word to me about having debts to the amount of 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor did he mention his father-in-law, Mr. Fashion, as a creditor for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he thought it was more than he could pull through—he did not ask my assent to a deed, or mention one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe he has been on visiting terms at your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not what I should call visiting terms—he was an old servant, and I think I was a good master to him—he called on me when he was in the neighbourhood, always addressed me as Sir, and signed his letters "Yours respectfully"—he has called on me about meal times, and I have invited him to have some dinner with me, but he has gone away im<lb></lb>mediately afterwards and not spent the day with me—he sat with me, and not with my servants—I find in my ledger that the last goods were de<lb></lb>livered to him on the 26th or 27th March—I did not say at the police-court that the day was the first Sunday after the delivery of those goods—I said that it was on a Sunday between those two dates—it was after he had the last goods and before I heard of the deed—I had been to him con<lb></lb>cerning his debts about a couple of months previously—I had not been and seen his wife during that week, nor some short time previously, less than two months—I had a conversation with her on that Sunday when he was not present—I never told her that some of his creditors had been to me respecting his affairs, and that I would call and see William, meaning the prisoner, about them—I believe I wrote him a letter saying that I would call—I have no recollection of calling and seeing his wife and saying that I would call on Sunday—I had a conversation with her on this Sunday—I do not recollect a previous conversation—I went there some time previously, but he was not at home, and I saw the young man—I did not, in a conversation, during which Mrs. Hopkinson was very much distressed, say to her, "Do not fret, I will be a friend to him," but it might possibly be turned into that—I said that if he made an honourable arrange<lb></lb>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190110"></xptr>
               <p>with his creditors I would assist them—on the Sunday I saw him in bed he had a bad leg—I do not know whether it was broken—I went to him both as a friend and a creditor—I was sorry to see the young man going wrong—I believe the expression I used before, was that I went rather as a friend—my deposition was read over to me, and I was asked if it was correct—I made one alteration in it, which was needed, and then signed it as a correct transcript of what I had said—I believe I did not say that I went only as a friend, not as a creditor—I believe I said rather as a friend than as a creditor—those were the words I used—I do not know how they were copied—(<hi rend="italic">The deposition stated</hi>;—"I went to the prisoner only as a friend, and not as a creditor")—he said to me that he should have to make an arrangement, a friendly composition with his creditors, and I advised him to go to my own solicitor, and gave him the name—I offered to assist him in any way I could with his creditors if he acted in an honourable way—I was, I believe, the first creditor who took proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act—when I went on that day I should have advised him to make an arrangement with his creditors if he was not in a position to pay—I thought it might be a temporary difficulty—I cannot fix the date when I first went before the Magistrate for a sum<lb></lb>mons or warrant—it was certainly after the 13th April—it was after we were aware of the composition deed—it was within two or three weeks of the 13th April—I did not know that an action had been brought against some creditors of the name of White Brothers—I knew that White Brothers had put an execution into the prisoner's house and taken away all his goods—they have told me so—I have done business with them many years—they did not suggest my applying to the Magistrate for a warrant, or advise my taking proceedings—I was introduced by the prisoner to them, and I am bound to carry it on, as he has made creditors of them—these numerous creditors are not paying between them for this prosecution—I have paid nothing yet, but I expect to do so, and I hope to get something from every <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> creditor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that you were the first creditor who took proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court; was that after you heard of the deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not believe it was genuine; and it was for the purpose of testing its validity—I am not aware that Mr. Read took pro<lb></lb>ceedings at the same time—he was at the Court at the same time.</p>

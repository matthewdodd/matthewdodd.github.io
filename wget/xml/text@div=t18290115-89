On the 22d of December I left my house about twenty minutes before five o'clock, and returned about six- the window was broken, the blinds were open, and my drawers and boxes were stripped; the coast, and a variety of other things were gone - the prisoner used to bring my beer from the public-house; he came at nine o'clock that night - I said I wanted no beer, I had been robbed; he came again at ten o'clock, but I took no beer; he came again the next day - I took no beer, and the officer brought him about five minutes after, with the coat.</p>

            . I go out nursing. I was opposite the prosecutor's house, and saw this witness take her husband's tea - I then saw the prisoner, and a man in light coloured clothes, come to her gate; I turned, and made up the fire- I then saw the prisoner walking up and down by himself; I thought he was waiting for the pots: I left the window, and left him walking about - at six o'clock I heard the prosecutor had been robbed; my mistress told me to go and see what was the matter - I then went and told what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see me go to the door for pots? A. I have seen you with pots, and you had a pot in your hand.</p>
               <p>JAMES PEPPER. I live next door to the prosecutor. There were some suspicious of this pot-boy, and on the 23d I saw him in Corporation-lane with a bundle, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day; I saw him go into a green-shop, and he had no sooner crossed the threshold of the door than he dropped the bundle: I gave information in about five minutes to Walker, who took him, and found the bundle at the green-grocer's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see a man come up to me with a bundle? A. There was a young man with him, but the prisoner had the bundle; the other had it first - the prisoner left the bundle at the house, and both went off to the end of the lane; the other man then absconded.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at his master's house; Walker had got the coat - I told the prisoner there was a coat found at Field's which he and another man had left there; he said the other man came and asked him where he could leave a bundle, and he took it there.</p>

On the 5th of March I missed a pair of cart springs out of my yard, in <placeName id="t18280410-40-crimeloc237">Old-road, Ratcliffe</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18280410-40-crimeloc237" type="placeName" value="Old-road, Ratcliffe"></interp>

On the 8th of March I observed a cart coming down Long-lane at a very fast rate; I thought the springs to it were mine before I saw them, from their peculiar rattle; I followed the cart into Smithfield, where it stopped; the prisoner and two or three young lads about fourteen years old, were in it: I went and handled the cart all round; Wells then asked if I would buy it; I asked the price - he asked seven guineas and a half; I said I did not think the springs were strong enough for my purpose - he said they were strong enough for anything, for he had used them a scores of times to bring potatoes to his mother's, with 16 cwt. on them. I said, "Your cart-builders don't live far from Spitafields, and have not far to take them" - he said, "I have to take them to Limehouse-fields," which is about 300 yards from my yard. I went aside and asked a man to fetch an officer, and gave him in charge - I said, "These are my springs on that cart, and I will swear to them" - the officer asked how he came by them - he said, he was not obliged to tell - the officer said, "You must tell; or I must take you into custody." The prisoner then said,"If they are your springs you may have them" - the officer said that would not do, and took him in charge, horse, cart, and all. I examined the springs, and am certain of them - they were separated from the cart, and are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he had bought them in the market on the Friday before? A. Yes, I forgot that; the officer and him went round the market for about ten minutes, for him to point out the man - I am certain he said he had bought them on the Friday before, which was before I lost them - I missed them on the Tuesday; I used to drive four days a week, and I knew the rattle of them - I thought they were mine before I saw them; it struck me in a moment they were mine from the rattle - that induced me to look round - it did not convince me at once that they were mine; I swear to the rattle, which is caused by the hole being worn in an oblong way- that would have been prevented by putting new irons to them; they had been fresh painted when I found them - the paint was wet; my son took the dimensions of the holes on the cart, and brought it to Guildhall to match them - I did not alter the plates - the blacksmith scraped them by my son's desire; he scraped them of his own accord - my son did not desire him to do so to my knowledge; the prisoner did not hear me send for the officer.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. My father has made a mistake, the springs were missed on the morning of the 26th; I locked them up in the yard myself between six and seven o'clock on the 25th - they were fastened to an axletree which laid on the ground; I went to the yard between six and seven o'clock next morning, and they were gone - I saw them on the Saturday following at Guildhall, and am certain of their being my father's; I had built the cart myself, and not being a cartwright it took me longer than usual, and I am certain of the springs; I went to the yard on the Saturday afternoon, and measured the holes of the scroll irons - they corresponded with the bolts; I have not the least doubt of them; the prisoner was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him near your premises? A. No; I should not know the rattle of the springs as I very seldom ride in the cart; I never remarked their jingling - I have been in the cart; they are not of an uncommon size - there were eight leaves to them, but when we found them one was taken off; the rivet was plainly to be seen, where it had been.</p>

            . I am a smith. I saw these springs in Burton's possession before the robbery, and saw them at Guildhall; I have no doubt of their being the same springs - an attempt has been made to alter them by taking one of the leaves off; I am confident they are Burton's springs - I had made an alteration in them on the Friday before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you repair them? A. Yes, they had a defect which would cause a jingle - it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100042"></xptr>cost about a guinea and a half to remedy that - they would then be worth about 5l.; I know them by two or three marks which are very seldom found on springs - I never saw any with such marks; I scraped them to point out where the friction of the leaf was; the prosecutor asked how I could tell about the friction - I had no conversation with him about them; they were painted over, but I should know them if there had been twenty coats of paint - I should know one part of them; I have no doubt whatever of these being the same.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you walk through the market, for him to shew the person he had bought them of? A. I did - he said he had bought them on the Friday before at Smithfield-market, of a man rather stouter than himself, dressed in a velveteen jacket, and having a cut in his face; I took him several times round the market where people stand with things - he kept looking about; he made no attempt to escape - I kept close to him, but did not hold him; he said he would give up the springs.</p>

            . I keep a green-grocer's shop at Farnham-street, Limehouse-fields. I have known the prisoner about two years; he has mended carts for me twice. On the 21st of March I saw him buy a pair of springs in Smithfield-market; I went to buy a horse - my wife was with me; the man he bought them of was a remarkable man, who had a scar on his face, and wore a velveteen jacket.</p>

            . Q. What repairs did you do to them? A. I made a new scroll iron - this is the iron I made, to the best of my recollection, but I will not positively swear it, but I swear to the springs, for I noticed a particular mark on both of them; several of the knobs have holes brust aside, and one of the plates hung over the other, which is common, if they have been made a long time, but in the generality of springs the plates are all alike - these are not so.</p>

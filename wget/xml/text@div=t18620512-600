                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the King's Arms public-house, at Suffolk-street, Southwark—on Saturday, 12th April, the prisoner came in with two women and asked for half-a-quartern of gin—I served him—he gave me a florin—I put it in the till where there was no other money, and gave him change—he remained a few minutes at the bar, and then asked for another half-quartern of gin, which I served him with, and he gave me another florin—I also put that in the till, and gave him change—he re<lb></lb>mained at the bar, and shortly afterwards called for a pot of beer—I served him with that, and he gave me a shilling—I took it to my master, spoke to him about it, and gave it to him—went to the till and saw the two two-shilling pieces—he took them out and kept them—my master asked him to pay him—he told him they were bad—the prisoner ran sway, and my master after him—he was taken in custody the same night.</p>

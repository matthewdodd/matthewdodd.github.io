            , and the Martha too.</p>
               <p>- DURANT. I am quartermaster on board the Worcester. On the 15th of December, late at night, I am the boatswain's mate went below to make our bed; we saw a pig of lead secreted under the cable, we removed the lead into a place of greater security. The next morning four lumpers came on board; they looked for the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar one of them. - A. I cannot swear that he was one or no; they looked for the lead, and not finding it where they left it they lit a candle and found it; there were four persons, they came down, found the lead, and took it away to the Lazoret. In consequence of some noise I went down, I saw the pig of lead laying upon the support of the bits, and a carpenter's hand saw about an inch into it; there were three men rushed out against us. When we went in, the prisoner at the bar came to me; he says, d - n you, I know you are down to it, but we will splice it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time might this be when you went there, after you saw four men take the lead away. A. A quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner made that observation, what did you do or say. - A. I said not for a thousand guineas; I will not have any hand in it, and I would advise you to let it alone, or else you will come to harm. I left the Lazoret again, and returned in about ten minutes; after that I found it there the third time, and then the lead was nearly cut in two, all but half an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other division in the lead. - A. Only one, nearly cut off to make two pieces of it; says he, d - n me, we will cut it off, then says I you must stand to the consequence. I then left sight of the lead, and immediately they took possession of the lead I gave the information.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did the lead weigh. - A. One hundred, one quarter, and fourteen pounds; they divided it to carry it.</p>

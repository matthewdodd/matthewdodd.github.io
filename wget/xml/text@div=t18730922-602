                  </hi>. I keep the Maltster Arms, 52, New Road, Stepney—on Sunday night, 17th August, about 9. 15, the prisoner came in front of me, struck me a violent blow on the chest, and, at the same moment, tore my chain from my breast and made off—the watch remained in my pocket—I ran after him, crying "Stop thief!"—when I had run about a quarter of a mile I was tripped up, and fell violently—I got up and caught sight of him again, and saw him stopped by a policeman—this seal is mine, it was attached</p>

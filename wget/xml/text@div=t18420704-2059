                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday, the 19th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the afternoon, I took Daley into custody at No. 5 1/2, Flower and Dean-street—I took him to Spitalfields station, then returned to his lodging, and felt the weight of his box, which appeared to be heavy, returned to the station, and asked him for the key—he said he had not got it, somebody in the house must have it—when I left the box in the room, T left Crawley there—when I returned he was gone away with another constable, and I found the box open then—I found in it these pieces of copper, a piece of lead, and a piece of solder—I showed them to the prisoner afterwards—he said he had had them in his box for years—I asked him if he knew how much money he had got in the box—he said two 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces and two half-crowns, which I found in it.</p>

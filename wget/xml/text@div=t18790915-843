                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 430). About 5,15 on 3rd August I was in the Fulham Road, Brompton, and saw the prisoners leave 8, Alex<lb></lb>ander Square, by the front door—I stopped them within 100 yards and called out asking them if they lived in that house—Jones, who was dressed very respectably, called out, "All right, constable, I live there"—Hicks said, "No"—they were both at that time walking away from me—I again asked them to wait a moment, but neither of them stopped—I commenced running to get in front of them, and saw Hicks had something bulky in bis pocket—I got near them and they both darted off—I caught hold of Hicks and asked him what he had under his coat, at the same time opening it—he said, "You see what I have"—seeing two other constables I shouted to them to stop Jones; he was stopped by 425 B—on the way to the station Hicks said to Jones, "I say, we're right this time for a month or two"—at the station we searched them and found upon them the property described in the indictment, the greater portion of which was handed over by order of the Magistrates to the prosecutor, he being a lodging-house keeper and wanting to use them—the greater part of the property was upon Hicks—Jones had on a new suit of clothes stolen from a portmanteau, and ties, collars, pins, etc., were found upon them—I examined the house and found they had burst the iron bars at the scullery window, effecting an entrance there—this knife was found in the kitchen.</p>

I was with the other constable in the Fulham Road, and saw the prisoners come out of 8, Alexander Square—430 B asked them whether they lived there—Jones replied, "Yes," and Hicks, "No"—he asked them to stop, and went towards them—I was just behind him, and Jones ran away—Hicks attempted to do so, but was stopped—I chased Jones some distance, and saw 415 B standing some distance out, and called to him, and he stopped him—I went back and saw the scullery window and the broken bar.</p>

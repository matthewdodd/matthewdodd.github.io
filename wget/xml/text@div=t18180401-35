            . I am in partnership with William Irwin, we both occupy the dwelling-house. On the 24th of February, in the evening, I was accidentally at Bow-street Office, the witness, Aldous, came and asked me if had lost any cloth? I said I did not know; he said he had detained a person with some. On looking across the room I recognized the prisoner, who was then living with us as a <rs id="t18180401-35-deflabel203" type="occupation">servant</rs>

Aldous is a pawnbroker - He came with the officer who took the prisoner. I had bought the cloth only the day before, and gave 14s. a yard for it; I lost three yards and a half-it was worth 49s. I had not been at home from the time it was taken. The prisoner left work that evening at dusk.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 24th of February, in the evening, the prisoner brought the cloth to me, and offered it to me in pledge - He asked 30s. upon it. I asked him what quantity there was? he said there were fourteen yards. I asked whom it belonged to? he said it was his own. I then asked whom he bought it of? he said of a hawker in St. George's-fields, at four shillings a yard. I detained it, and gave him in charge. We took him to the Office, Mr. Kipps was there, and the officer asked him about it. The prisoner told who his master was. Mr. Kipps claimed it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of February I was in Mr. Aldous's shop, on business, the prisoner came in and produced the cloth - He asked 30s. upon it. Mr. Aldous asked him about it; he said it was his own, and that he bought it of a man in the Borough. Mr. Aldous told me I had just come in time. I asked the prisoner what he bought the cloth for? he said it was to make a coat or coats, I dotnot know which. I asked him if he bought it for himself? he said his brothers were to have half of it, and that there were fourteen yards-there was no such quantity. I asked him if he had a family? he said, yes, and that he gave four shillings a yard for the cloth, and 2l. 9s. in all. I asked him if his wife could cut it? he said she might. I took him to the office. Before the magistrate came he called me aside, and said he would tell the truth, I neither threatened or promised him; he then said a man named Gurney, who worked at the same place as he did, gave it him to pledge for him. I asked whom they worked for? he said for Irwin and Kipps, Great Marylebone-street; he pointed Mr. Kipps out to me in the magistrates' room. When I took the prisoner in I shewed Mr. Kipps the cloth and he claimed it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not know what I was telling the pawnbroker. My master came to the office, and I pointed him out. Gurney and Adams (Adams is my master's apprentice) asked me to go and pledge the cloth for them, for 30s., and to bring them the money next morning when I came to work - They said it was their own. I took it to Aldous; he asked if it was mine - I said, yes. I believe it was done to prevent my working there, as I had quarrelled with the apprentice; he said I should not work there longer than he could help.</p>

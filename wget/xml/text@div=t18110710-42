            . My father sent me to Mr. Gosford's; he gave me a pound note to pay for the bread; I had two quartern loaves; I gave them the pound note, and they gave me the change all but seven shillings, the change that I received, and the bread I took home.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you leave the seven shillings - A The seven shillings was in copper, I could not take it home all at once. I returned to the shop and received seven shillings in half-pence of Mr. Gosford, and I was coming home with it when the prisoner asked me where that street would lead to; I said if he went straight on it would take him into Union-street. Then snatched five shillings out of my hand, and ran down Spital-square. A young man stopped him by Mr. Goldsmith's, he then threw the half-pence down.</p>

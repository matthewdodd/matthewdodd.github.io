               <p>towards London; they had the coats which they have on now <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> over them; their arms were underneath—I watched them some time, and saw them go into a large clothier's shop in Deptford Highway, and lost sight of them for about ten minutes—I then met them in the High Street, and they went into another large clothier's—I saw that Rinoldi had got a bundle under his cloak; he put it in his hand—they remained about a minute, and went on the Lower Road, through Gibraltar Gate, towards London—I had a sergeant in plain clothes with me; he caught Rinoldi, and I caught Conte; they were taken to the station—I had seen them together before, at Gravesend, on the 3rd—I found in the bundle five pairs of boots, seven waistcoats, and three coats.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot maker. On 10th Feb., the prisoners came, and Conte asked to look at a pair of boots which were in the window—I showed them to him, and they would not fit—he spoke English—he had two other pairs tried on, but neither of them fitted—he said that if I would put the tree in, he would call again in half an hour—it was then half-past 12 o'clock—they did not call again—these two pairs of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)are mine; they were safe in my shop shortly before, and Rinoldi went to the other end of the shop and placed his parcel where they were hanging.</p>

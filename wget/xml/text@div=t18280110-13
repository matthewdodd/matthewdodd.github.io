I and a friend called in at the Britannia public-house (where I had never been before) and had something to drink; I had six shillings, a half-crown, and a sixpence. I left the house with that money in my left-hand breeches pocket, having paid two sixpences at the house; we were not there above half an hour; I left my companion in the house, and came out alone. I got about one hundred yards, to the corner of Brackley-street, Golden-lane; I was there knocked down by a man, by a blow in my mouth; there were four women with that man; the prisoners were two of them; Nicholls held me fast while Law took my money out of my pocket; I could swear to the man if I was to see him; Law had been in the house where I was drinking, and I knew her directly I saw her in the street; I had a gas-light over my head, and am certain of them both I got up, and pursued both the prisoners, but did not call out, as my mouth was full of blood, from the effects of the blow - I could not call out much. I did not lose sight of either of them, till they got into a house, and the door was shut - I understood the house to be the back part of the Salmon and Ball public-house; I felt very ill, and did not get them secured - I went home, and next morning I went to find them out; I went into Cripplegate without, and got Wetherall; we went to the Britannia; there was no one there that I knew, but as we came out, we turned ourselves round, and Law was coming up the street, in company with another woman - I gave her into Wetherall's charge - I had no doubt whatever of her. In the evening of the same day I went, with Wetherall and Atterwell, to the spot where they got into the house; I knew the house, and went in: we found Nicholls on the stairs of that house - I was positive of her directly; I swear to her now, and did so before the Magistrate. My money was not marked; I believe no money was found on them. I sometimes work for myself, and sometimes for other people; I lodge in the second floor, and have a wife and four children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LAW. Q. Had you not been drinking with me for above an hour? A. My friend and I went in - there was certainly some liquor drank between us, and the prisoner helped herself, but without my permission; my friend certainly knew the house, but I was never in it before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any familiarities pass between you, or did you invite her to join your company when you went out? A. By no means, nor did I intend any thing of the sort; she took the liquor without my consent.</p>

            . I am a constable of Cripplegate without. On Monday, the 17th, Panton complained to me of having been robbed on the previous night - I went with him to endeavour to find the party, about one o'clock in the afternoon; he described the persons to me before. I accompanied him to Golden-lane - we went into the Britannia- they were not there; soon after we came out I stood talking at the door with him - I looked down the lane, and saw two females coming up; I told him to look down, and he said Law was the woman who took the money out of his pocket; I asked if he was positive - he said he could swear to her; I took her, and locked her up - he knew nothing of the other woman. Brackley-street is all in the City - he met me at six o'clock, at the Britannia; Atterwell, he, and I went to the back of the Salmon and Ball yard; Panton pointed to the door - we went in; Atterwell waited at the bottom of the stairs; as I went up the first flight of stairs I heard somebody running up the second flight; the room door was open, and Law's daughter was there - and on the second flight of stairs I found Nicholls; Panton had not described her, but said he should know her if he saw her - the moment I took her down to him he said she was the person who held him while he was robbed. He spoke to her with certainty, and said he could swear it; he said, "You are the person who held me;" she denied it, and said he was mistaken.</p>

            . I went to this house with Wetherall. When Nicholls was brought down, Panton said, that was the woman who held his arm; I asked him about it several times, saying it was a serious charge - he said, over and over again, she was the woman who held his arms. No money was found on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner NICHOLLS. Q. Did he not say I had been to the public-house with him, and I insisted upon being taken there, and the landlord said I was not there? A. I think something of the sort was said, but he denied it afterwards.</p>

               <p>LAW's Defence. On the very same evening I came out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100011"></xptr>and told Nicholls to mind my child and my place, while I went to the Britannia, as a man owed me a shilling, who used the house; I staid an hour - Mr. Panton came in, and called for a pot of beer; he said, "You seem very cold - will you have a pot of porter with me?" - I said I had no objection, and drank with him. He sent for a quartern and a half of gin, and I drank a glass; in ten minutes he called for another quartern and a half - he seemed intoxicated then- I had another glass with him; and in a quarter of an hour he called for another quartern and a half, which his friend and him drank; I objected to drink more, having been ill; I got up, and bade them good night: he wished me to have more beer. As I came out he said, "Have you got a place you can take me home to?" I said I had, but it was a good way off, near Bunhill-row; he said he did not mind. I took him home, and Nicholls, who was at my house, showed us a light, and went out of the room; I said, "How much money will you give me?" he said "I have only 1s. 6d. - I shall send for a quartern and a half of gin, and give you the 1s.;" he sent me for the gin; I got it from the Salmon and Ball, and brought it up stairs; Nicholls waited at the door, and I fetched it; we all three had a glass: she went away to her room with my child; in a little time the woman of the house fetched her over, and said there were words between me and the man; Nicholls came over - he said he was robbed of half-a-crown and 3s., because I would not let him lay on my bed; I said he might search my place; I had no money but the 1s. which he gave me: he tried to snatch it out of my hand- I said, "Don't ill-use me, send for an officer, and give charge of me;" Nicholls said, "Don't commit violence on the woman," and the woman who lived down stairs said,"Don't hurt her." I went to the door; he wrenched the shilling out of my hand, and said, "I will serve you out tomorrow;" he went out, and I was so agitated that Nicholls said, "Don't go out again to-night;" I went out next morning; I was hardly able to walk, and the officer took me. As to my being in Brackley-street, I deny it; I did not think him capable of swearing what he has.</p>

               <p>NICHOLL's Defence. I was not outside the door till half-past ten o'clock. I told the officers if they would go to a public-house in Angel-street, they would find that I had been there with a young man. I have written to the prosecutor, to say if he would go to the young man he could prove I was in his company from half-past three o'clock. I never saw the prosecutor till he came into Law's room.</p>
               <p>JOHN WETHERALL re-examined. Q. When you took Law, did she give this account of the transaction? A. No- she said something similar to it to the Alderman, on the 18th.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN PANTON. Q. Did you leave the public-house before Law, or after? A. She left before me, I suppose ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I did not observe any man go out with her. I am certain the man who knocked me down was not in the room where I was. I cannot say whether any other woman was there with Law.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know your way home from the Britannia? A. Yes; but I went from the public-house, to call on a friend who lived in Whitecross-street - I was in the way to Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN WETHERALL. The corner of Brackley-street was in his way to Whitecross-street.</p>

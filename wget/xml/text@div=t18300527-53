I lost these hams and pork on the morning of the 13th of May, from a little bit of a place that I call a dairy - I saw them safe on the 12th of May; it was locked up, but a piece of canvas was cut so that a man could get in; the prisoner was taken up on the 13th - I had a number of duck eggs there - I cannot say whether I lost any of them.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner from the Saturday before the Thursday this happened - I had lived with my grandmother, but I quarrelled with her, and went to my sister's, where I slept with a young woman named Walker - the prisoner came up on the morning of the 13th, and asked if we had any money; we said No - he said, "I will take you to my mother's, and give you a good dinner;" with some hesitation we went with him - he took us down a lane, and gave each of us a leg of pork, and gave the other young woman some duck eggs - I do not know how many; as we were going on I saw a young man, who went and got an officer; he ran after Sage, but could not take him - he then came, and took the pork from us.</p>

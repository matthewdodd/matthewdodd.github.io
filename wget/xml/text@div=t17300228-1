             depos'd, That the Prisoner had confess'd that she took the Watch out of the Drawer, and wrapped it in a Sheet of white Paper; and that she had broken it, and thrown it into the Common Sewer; and afterwards that she had thrown it down the House of Office, but that at first she said she had sold it, where her Sister had before pawned some Things. But enquiry being made in the several places she had spoken of, none of them knew anything of it; she added, that the Prisoner was taken into the House to wait upon a Child.</p>

             depos'd, That the Prisoner was taken into the House several times to do Work, and was left all alone in the Dining-Room, and that her Mistress said she had put the Watch into the Drawer; and that in discourse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173002280003"></xptr> she had heard her say, she had not seen the Watch for a Week. That the Prisoner came to Mr. Piver's House on Saturday Night after the Watch had been missing, and they bid her not be out of the way; that thereupon she came again on Sunday Night, and that they charged her very strictly with having taken the Watch, telling her, that if she did not tell where the Watch was, they would hang her; but if she would discover what she had done with it, if she had sold or pawn'd it, he would redeem it, and forgive her. That thereupon, though she had before deny'd that she knew any thing of it, she owned she had taken it, and thrown it into the Common Sewer, and sometimes she said she had burnt it; that she varying thus in her Story, he said to her, you know what you say, what have you done with it? That she deny'd that she ever took it, and that she was frighten'd out of her Wits, and that being carried before a Justice, she said she knew nothing of the Watch, and that what she had before said was in her fright.</p>
               <p>The Constable depos'd, That he coming to the Prosecutor's House, did examine the Prisoner about the Watch, and she said she had thrown it into the Common Sewer.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor's Nurse depos'd, That she saw her Mistress put the Watch into the Drawer a Week before, and the Drawer had been Lock'd till the Day the Girl was in the Room, but that Day it stood unlock'd.</p>
               <p>There being no Evidence of the Prisoner's having the Watch, but her own Confession, which was so inconsistent, and seeming to proceed from the fright she was in, upon being charged with the Watch; and she being a young Girl of about 12 or 13 Years of Age, and of an honest Character, the Jury <rs id="t17300228-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

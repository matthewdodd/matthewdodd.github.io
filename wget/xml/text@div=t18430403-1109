                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-sergeant, No.</hi> 201.) On the 20th of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and another in Alders<lb></lb>gate-street—the other had a bridle, reins, and bit, which I saw him tie up in a handkerchief, and give to the prisoner—they then separated, the prisoner went down on one side of the street, and the other on the other side—I followed, stopped the prisoner, and asked what he had got—he said, "Some harness"—I asked whose they were—he said they belonged to a person named Hornsby, a butcher, who was his master—I took him to the station—he then said he had brought them from Cambridge, he had bought them of a person named Osborne, and had brought them up, with other things, to sell—they were after<lb></lb>wards claimed by Mr. Scholes—I saw some other harness in Mr. Scholes's stable, which matched it.</p>

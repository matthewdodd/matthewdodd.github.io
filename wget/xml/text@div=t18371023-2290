                  </hi>. I keep a linen-draper's shop in the Whitechapel-road. About half past three o'clock, on the afternoon of the 3rd of October, I was told a piece of merino was taken, about three feet from the front, in the lobby—I went towards Whitechapel and saw the prisoner and another running—I pursued, and in Mary-street there is a gateway—I was within a step or two of them, and they pushed the merino behind the gate, or door—I took them both—they were standing together and running together—I took the merino from the ground and held the prisoner—I gave the other woman to my lad, and she was rescued from him by two men—this is the merino.</p>

                  </hi>. I was talking to a woman at an apple-stall before the prosecutor's door—I saw four women together, and the biggest of them went in and looked at some flannel—the other three followed her—this prisoner took the merino and put it under her shawl, and walked away with the other females—I am sure she is the person.</p>

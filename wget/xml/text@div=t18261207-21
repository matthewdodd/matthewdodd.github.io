               <p>FRANCIS BRENTNELL. I live at Derby, and am clerk to a person there. I was in town, and lodged in Oxford-court, Cannon-street. On the 30th of November, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was going through a court from Cornhill to Lombard-street; I had left home about half an hour - my handkerchief was then safe; I felt nothing, but an officer came and asked if I had missed my handkerchief; I felt, and missed it from my outside coat pocket- I saw it in his possession; I saw him lay hold of the prisoners immediately afterwards - they were in company together; he charged them with taking it; I did not hear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070018"></xptr>what they said - they were quite strangers to me; it is a silk handkerchief, and worth 2s.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners in company together in Cheapside; I watched them, and when they got into Cornhill they went up to Mr. Brentnell - he went through Pope's Head-alley; Mullins was nearest to him, but they were in company; they turned into <placeName id="t18261207-21-crimeloc120">Pope's Head-alley</placeName>

I then saw Morland take a handkerchief from his breast, and put into his hat; I seized them both, and took the handkerchief from his hat, and Mr. Brentnell claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MULLINs' Defence. I went to work that morning; my sister asked me to go and see another sister, who was lying-in at Whitechapel; I did not know my way, and asked this boy to show me - I lost him, and went back to look after him - he told me the way, and I was going when the officer took me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman, and am incumbent of Purbrook—I know Hullett, he lived in my neighbourhood, and was connected with musical matters—I know his handwriting—I believe the body of this bill for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in Hullett's writing, and the indorsement also—here are four other bills of exchange, the body of which 1 believe to be in Hullett's writing; the endorsements also—one purports to be endorsed by Mr. Eversfield—(<hi rend="italic">The bills were put in and read; one was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">at six months, drawn by John Hullett upon and accepted by Charles G.

My dear Sir, By the advice of my solictor, Mr. Frederick Farrar, I wrote to you this afternoon the letter you probably have had ere this, and I am now writing unknown to him and contrary to his express wish. He is I suppose doing all he can for me, but says that I ought not to see you, or make any sort of admission, or I shall be ruined beyond hope. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230030"></xptr>
               <p>cannot, however, go to bed without writing far more fully; and taking a different view to him, feeling, too, to the utmost now, the awful wickedness I have been guilty of towards my dearest and best friend I ever had in the world; I cannot help seeing matters differently from Mr. Farrar; but I wish you to know I do this on my own account, and directly contrary to his and my friends' advice (excepting only my poor wife). It is impossible for me to give you anything like full particulars of the bills you require, until I can see Mrs. Hullett, who has all my letters and papers of every kind, but I will meantime do all I can from memory, and I call God to witness that to the best of my knowledge all I write is thoroughly true. In the first place, then, the only persons who hold any of these bills of any sort are the following; whether they hold them in their individual hands I know not, but they profess to:—Henry Howse, 49, Leicester Square, W.C.; Mr. Ford, or Lewis, or other names, of 17, Cork Street, Burlington Gardens, solicitor; Brandons, of Essex Street, W.C.; Ley &amp; Brocklesby, 16, Water Lane, Great Tower Street, E.C.; W. S. Meynell, 119, Warwick Street, Pimlico, S.W.; and Mr. Farrar, 6, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, E.C. These five persons are the only ones who have any bills of mine, or bills with Mr. Eversfield's name to; and I am afraid that they represent a sum of nearly 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I have had the value of at least (or nearly so) 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, but not more. I am sure Mr. Ford or Lewis (he goes by both names) has three with Mr. Eversfield's name, two for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, on which any value has been given. He has, I regret deeply to say, others on which not a farthing of value has ever been given in any way whatever, gave a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque (stopped) on one more. Mr. Meynell has the two which you wrote about in the summer, viz., one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on neither of which has one farthing ever been given. I could tell a tale about these which I hardly think you would ever believe. I was for months persuaded, and every possible inducement made, to get by any means, Mr. Eversfield's name to them. I will not repeat the arguments used, or the wicked, awfully cruel means this villain used. He promised, in the most solemn way, if I could get the name 'by any means, he did not care nor ask how,' he would pledge his word they would be at once locked up, never see light, nor Mr. Eversfield ever know about them, and much more. I was dreadfully pressed at the time, in fearful trouble—a poor young girl of a wife, two dear little innocent children actually in a semi-state of starvation and misery you can never know; but you know the rest. The moment he had them he did as he has done before with others, took steps to shew they were forged; came down to me, told me he would transport me at once, and more I cannot repeat, unless he had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get them back to me, though he never gave a farthing in any way whatever. He lived at Portsmouth at my expense, and the Isle of Wight, and got nearly a hundred pounds from me by threats; told me (which was false) that nothing would prevent your making an example of me; and when you insisted on having back the bills, as he would not part with his, suggested the way of getting over it I need say no more: to get the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had to do what you well know; but God in Heaven only can know the pressure put upon me, and the awful agony I suffered. As for Ley &amp; Brocklesby, they never gave for any one of Mr. Eversfield's bills half its value, but most there was no value for whatever, saving to 'hold on' for a time. They had money from me constantly, almost daily, at one time. They made me send them hot-house grapes, salmon, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>., <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>., <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>., when they were so expensive, a diamond ring</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186811230031"></xptr>
               <p>worth a great deal, my wife's jewellery, and lots besides. Their letters, taken at random, would show this. They have had in cash from me more than they ever gave, to 'hold over' for a few weeks, Sir, you cannot, as a respectable man, form any idea of the means used by all these people (excepting perhaps Mr. Farrar). My wife has a lot of their letter in her possession, and you have my authority to write to her and say I told you to ask for them, if you would like to have them as a sample of the style of thing, and I have written to say that she is to send them to you if you write for them. I gave a bill of sale to Howse; he sold up my poor home, taking the very beds and clothes from them, while I was taken off by that dreadful man Ford, and put under charge of a detective, who went everywhere with me, but I could not get down to Waterloo, but could only hear of it. Without any possibility of doing anything, and I suffered under Ford's treatment that a savage would be horrified to give anyone. Even the poor little baby's crib was sold, and the poor little thing turned out; my poor dear young wife, so near her confinement, and I am expecting every post to hear of it, and I dare not go near her, excepting only by stealth. I escaped from the detective, and am now hiding. I don't say this for pity; for I, myself, deserve none whatever; but I feel most acutely now how poor Mr. Eversfield, with his goodness, has been used by me, and my sufferings of mind are awful; were I in hell they could not be worse. With regard to your letter, though Mr. Farrar says I must not see you or your manager, I wish to say this: I shall be on Monday, at 12 o'clock, at any place you may appoint by return of post to me at the Post Office, Gower Street, W., or at the place you name in Holborn, if you still think it will be good for your manager to see me. I will give you every possible assistance in my power, so help me God! but without seeing my wife, I cannot, I tell you fairly, tell you full particulars, as I don't know the amounts; but this I do know, that the amounts really received by me do not amount to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I feel sure. You are perfectly at liberty to write to all parties I have named, no one else has any paper of Mr. Eversfield's, and make any inquiries, or ask any particulars, with my authority, you please. They will furnish you particulars of the bills, and then I will answer any question you like. If it were not for my poor sweet children—poor innocent little children—and my good young wife, I would say this: give me in charge, or custody, and let me pay the penalty. It would save Mr. Eversfield; and those who lent the pitiful mites of money on large bills, can afford too well to lose them; but I pray of you, I implore you, for Christ's sake! to have mercy on them. I have two dear, dear little girls, perhaps (most likely) am the father of another before now, and I cannot be near or comfort my innocent good wife; and let me say she never knew anything of this matter till I was arrested by Ford. I had kept all from her, and I call God to witness that it was seeing their faces, whom, with all my sins, I love more than all the world, starving, that first made me do this. I pray of Mr. Eversfield to have mercy on them poor children, all, for she is a child I will do all I possibly can, in every way. If he will have patience with me, I will pay him all in time. I have put myself in your hands, and wish to do so. Write by return, and say if I shall be anywhere, and whore, on Monday, to meet your manager. My solicitor knows nothing of this letter. Yours, most truly, J. Hullett.")</p>

In haste, yours very truly, Chas. G. Eversfield."—My memory does not serve me as to what I meant by the expression, "You have my consent to the proposal with regard to the bills"—I have no memory on the subject—I should imagine these letters were written in 1867—the one dated September was in 1866.</p>

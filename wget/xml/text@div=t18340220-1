               <p>Q. Could you discern the features of a man by the light of day at that time? A. Yes - I cannot tell how long there had been sufficient daylight to discern the features of a man - I came down directly I got up, and I found all the doors open which I had left shut and locked the previous night - the pair of folding-doors exactly opposite the warehouse were wide open, they are inner doors - at the back part of the premises there is a room looking into a small yard belonging to the next house by a window - that window was open, and a pair of shutters which fasten inside, and were fast overnight, were forced open - I immediately called in an officer and went over the premises, and found the till had been robbed of its contents - I missed about 8s. or 10s. as near as I could judge - there was half-a-crown, 3 shillings or more, and two sixpences, and about 2s. in copper - there was more than 1s. in copper - the warehouse-door was ajar and the chain down - that was shut overnight - the counting-house-door was open - the party had entered through the back window - I missed nothing else myself - a desk in the counting-house, which was not locked overnight, had been opened, and the papers strewed about - the house was entirely secure overnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARNOLD. Q. Are there any other persons in the concern? A. No - the elder Mr. Sutton's name is not William Henry - I am sure the back window was fastened - I did not do it myself, but I saw that it was done - I do not know who did it - I looked round the premises and saw it was fastened - I did not lift up the window to see if the shutters were bolted, for they are inside shutters - the window is outside.</p>

            . I received a crow-bar from Batten between five and six o'clock on the morning of the 13th of January, it was before daylight - I kept possession of it till we went before the Lord Mayor, at twelve o'clock - the prisoners were then remanded till next day, and I kept possession of it till Tuesday, at twelve or one o'clock, when the magistrate sat; and, as I was not bound over, I gave it over to Batten; but, on the Monday night, I went to Mr. Sutton's premises, between five and six o'clock, and applied the crow-bar to the marks on the shutter; it fitted two marks out of three exactly; it did not exactly fit the third place, but it might have been made by the same instrument - one prong of this crow-bar is shorter than the other - there was the same appearance in the marks, and they exactly fitted it on the back - they were sliding shutters - I could be on my oath that the marks were made by such an instrument - they had every appearance of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not that a common-sized crowbar? A. It may be, for what I know - I have seen crowbars before, but very seldom - I have not seen many similar ones - I have seen a larger and a smaller one, but not one broken exactly as that is - I might have seen them, but never had them in my possession - I could not account for the crow-bar not fitting the third mark - two marks were on one shutter, and one on the other - they might be three or four inches apart - Batten gave me the crow-bar about five o'clock in the morning - I saw it found on Brown at the watch-house - I had it in my custody from then (Monday), till about twelve o'clock on Tuesday - it was never out of my possession from five o'clock on Monday till twelve o'clock on Tuesday, more than handing it to the officer.</p>

             re-examined. Q. How is it you and Slate differ as to the time the crow-bar remained in your possession? A. I remember taking it from him when they were committed - I am mistaken in saying I had it from him on Monday, it was on Tuesday when they were committed - I gave it to Slate on Monday morning at the watch-house - I took it from the prisoner Brown in his presence - I did not find the snuff-box - I saw a fellow-watchman pick it up - he is not here - he picked it up going up Holborn-hill, nearly opposite St. Andrew's church; it rolled off the pavement opposite St. Andrew's church, Holborn - I had the two prisoners in custody at the time - they were passing along where it was found - I and another watchman and the prisoners were present, and one or two of St. Sepulchre's watchmen, and two other prisoners - there were in all four watchmen and four prisoners, and people following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You mean to say it was purely a mistake when you said you had the crow-bar out of your possession only six or seven hours? A. It was quite a mistake - when I heard Slate say it was not so, I recollected myself from the prisoners being remanded - I have kept the crow-bar ever since on my premises in my top cupboard, in my front parlour, locked up, and I have always kept the key - I have trusted my wife with the key when I have been present, but never when I have been absent - I do not swear the cupboard was always locked, because it was frequently unlocked - it has never been unlocked while I have been absent.</p>
               <p>Packer's Defence. I had been to Epping on Sunday morning - I returned and got to Farringdon-street about half-past two o'clock - it was too late to go home - being too soon for the coffee-shop to open, I stood about on Holborn-hill until three o'clock, when the doors were open- I went in and had some coffee; and about five minutes after I went in, the other prisoner came in - I knew nothing of him - he sat in the box - I had what I called for, and paid for it - there was another lad in the box besides me - before I went in he had gone into the box - well, in came two others, who were taken up afterwards - one of them was making a disturbance with a man - the woman said, if we were not quiet she would have us turned out - she went and fetched two watchmen, who turned us out, and then a watchman came, collared me, took me to the watch-house, he found nothing on me but the money - I know nothing of the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Brown made no defence.</p>

            . I have been a proprietor of cabs till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200005"></xptr>about six weeks ago, and live at Walworth - Brown was in my service about eight months, not exactly driving, but looking after the stables; and sometimes he drove - I have known him at least six years - I knew him when he lived with Dr. Box, on Ludgate-hill - he bore the character of a very honest man indeed - he was driving a cab for me on the 12th of January; and at one o'clock that morning he drove the cab home, and put up and fed his horse at my stables at Walworth - I believe he lodged in Searle's-place, Carey-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him on Sunday night? - A. Yes, at Walworth, on Sunday night, the 12th of January, at one o'clock - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Would his way from Walworth to Searle's-place be over Blackfriars'-bridge? - A. Yes; I should say so - I believe the coffee-shop in Farringdon-street is at this end - it would take him not above half an hour to go from the stables to Carey-street - he left the stables after one o'clock - during the time he was with me I believe him to bear an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he leave with his cab or on foot? - A. On foot - Searle's-place is in Carey-street - it would take about half an hour to go from Walworth to the coffee-shop - I know Bow church-yard - it would not take much longer to go there.</p>

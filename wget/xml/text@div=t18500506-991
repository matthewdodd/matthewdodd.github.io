                  </hi>. I live in North-street, Paddington. On Saturday, 14th April, I was at a public-house with my husband, John Lewis—he went away in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> leaving me, and Joseph Harrington, and another man—I went with both of them to a house near King's-cross—we went to an upper room—the prisoner Nowell was there—she was shown up into the room—one of the men spoke to her—she came back for some beer and gin—I did not have any of it—I got up, and wished to go away—I went towards the door—I got to the middle of the room, and Nowell came and put her hand into my bosom, and took out my money—I said, "For God's sake, don't take my money"—she put it into her pocket, and knocked me down—she had not said anything to me before, only asked me to drink—I had not shown her my money—the other man saw me put it in my bosom—Seaman was not in the room at the time Nowell took my money; I did not see him at all—I had one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and some silver—Harrington put his back against the door, and would not let her go out—she called out for some men, who rushed into the room, knocked Harrington down, and beat him in the face—she said, <hi rend="italic">"Lay on, Jack,"</hi> or something, and ran away—she had also got my victorine, and attempted to take my shawl—she got out, and I got out and got home—I spoke to a policeman in the passage—he said I had no business there—on Wednesday I went to the house—my husband asked at the door for the woman who robbed his wife—I went into the room, and saw Nowell at the foot of the bed, getting her tea—it is a private house, in Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge—Nowell denied that she was the person who robbed me—I said she was—I had a policeman with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not a fellow-workman of the prosecutrix's husband. I was at the public-house that night with her and her husband, and another man—I had seen the other man, but I never saw her and her husband before—her husband went away, and left me and the other man with his wife—we went to a house at Battle-bridge—the other man told us where there was something to be had to drink—she went with him, and I followed behind—when we got to the house 1 saw Nowell—she went out, and came back with some drink—she came up into the room, and poured out a glass of gin—I drank part of one glass—I cannot say whether Lewis did—the other young man drank some—Nowell went down-stairs again, and after a time the came up again, and the man who went with me, talked with her—I did not hear what they said—after that Nowell began to search Mrs. Lewis about the bosom, but I did not see her take anything—Mrs. Lewis said, "She has taken my money," and called, "Police 1" out of the window—soon afterwards Mrs. Lewis was struck down in the room; 1 cannot tell who did it—there were four or five in the room—I cannot say whether Mrs. Lewis was sober—she could walk—she had bad some drink—I was examined before the Magistrate—what I said was read over to me—this is my mark to it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"The prosecutrix called,' Police!' and Nowell knocked her down")—I did not see Nowell knock her down—she pulled her away from the window, and she was down on the floor—I was knocked down at the time—Nowell called out, "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> come up-stairs"—this was before Mrs. Lewis was knocked down—I was holding the door to stop Nowell from going out, and four or five men came up and rushed into the room—I identify Seaman as one of the men that came into the room—I did not see him do anything—some of the others who were in the room hallooed out, "Lay into him"—there were two of them <hi rend="italic">thrashing</hi> the other young man who was with us—the other young man paid Nowell for the liquor—it was nearly one o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>

I never saw the woman; I don't know her"—when I got her down-stairs, she said, "That woman wanted to give that man in charge on Saturday night."</p>

On the 17th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, a man came in for a quarter of a pound of Cheshire cheese, I was serving of him, the prisoner at the bar followed him a little way in the shop, she kept at the back part of it, close to where the bacon was; she had a red cloak on, she walked back to the door, I heard her say here; I cast my eye to where the bacon stood, I saw her hand a piece of bacon to another woman, who went off with it. I walked round the counter and the other person was gone, I called an officer in and gave charge of the prisoner; as she was going to prison she offered to pay for it and begged that we would not take her to prison, she would make any satisfaction for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of bacon was it, how large a piece. A. It was upwards of eight pounds, I am sure the prisoner is the woman that took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this man's shop, I asked for a quartern of butter; a man was there having some cheese, he said to me, what do you ask for, a quartern of butter; he said I think I have lost something, there were two pieces of bacon, I have lost one, I insist upon searching you; he pulled off my cloak, he found nothing; then he said I will send for an officer. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

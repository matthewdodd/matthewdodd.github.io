On Monday, the 17th, I sent Skilling to Pimlico, and Nowland to Lambeth-Camfield remained at home. I told him I was going out, and to have an eye about the premises; I went to the hay-loft, which is over the stable, to watch him; in a short time I saw him take a scraper, and draw out one of the boards from my cutting room-he took a cake of soap, and put the board in its place again, and laid the soap on the hay-loft stairs, and covered it over with hay; he went into the factory, I came down, and put a farthing in the cake, to mark it-there was a mark in it before. He walked up and down the factory for a few minutes-Skilling came in and gave Camfield the money he had received; he then drew out the board again, and handed Skilling three cakes of soap, one by one, Skilling put one cake in his breeches, and the other two between his waistcoat and shirt, and asked Camfield if it made any appearance, he said it did not; he went away, returned in about five minutes, and took three more cakes out; before Skilling returned Camfield took a piece and put it into his own breeches-it was then nine o'clock. Nowland returned from Lambeth, Camfield told him there was a cake of soap laid for him on the stairs-Nowland took it, and put it in his breeches, and all three went to breakfast; I went to Gilmore, who was waiting with me, he stopped Nowland, and took the cake of soap out of his breeches. I gave him in charge. Gillmore brought Camfield in and took a cake out of his breeches. He then went for Skilling, and brought him back - We found no soap on, but made him shew his linen-it was stained with yellow soap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. Nowland had worked twenty-eight years for me; Skilling nine years, and Camfield twelve years. I saw all that passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. James Wallington, a linen draper, at Strutton-ground, Westminster. On the 24th of February, about three o'clock, the prisoner Cox came into the shop, and went out again, and is four or five minutes Brown came in, took this calico, and went out—I went out and saw Brown going down the street with this calico—he went on to Cox's house, and there he was taken with Cox, in about half an hour—this is the calico—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—it had been in the back of the shop near the parlour.</p>

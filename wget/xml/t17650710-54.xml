               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Geldard. I had been in Smithfield drinking all the evening; I can't say I was very much concern'd in liquor; I went to her home, at the house of one Murphy; she made excuse to go for a pot of beer; while she was gone, I fell asleep; when she came back again, she awaked me by taking my breeches from under my head; I was going to take them from her; she left them, and slipt out before me, and lock'd me in; she had taken my money out, which was a guinea and half a crown; I was forc'd to get out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took your money?</p>

            . The prosecutor being an acquaintance of mine, sent for me to the Royal Oak in Broad St. Giles's, about seven in the morning; the landlord said he had chang'd her a guinea, but she had no money; she was taken before Justice Welch; I think there she said she had paid the money away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I got up in the morning; he begg'd of me to go to the Two Brewers for beer; I fetch'd a pint of purl; he made me a present of two shillings, as he thought; one I found to be a guinea. When he came to me at the Royal Oak, he called me bitch, and knock'd me down, and took me to the watch-house; and by the blow he gave me, I dropt the money out of my hand; whether he took it up, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you give the prisoner two shillings?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure one of them was not a guinea?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It might be I gave her a guinea instead of a shilling.</p>

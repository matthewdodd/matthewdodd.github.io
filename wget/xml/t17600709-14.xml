               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I was, as sober as I am now; the prisoner came and awaked me, and said my friend was gone, and took me by my arm; I said, what business have you with me, if he is gone? she said, he wants you at the bottom of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in company with her;</p>
               <p>Dixon. No, not at all, only I saw her in the house; she held me fast by the arm, I wanted to get my arm from her; I observed she wanted to get me out of the house. I said again, what business have you with me? I felt in my pocket, and miss'd my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your money in your pocket when you laid your head down to sleep?</p>
               <p>Dixon. I had; it was a guinea and half, and some silver: I said to her give me my money, or I will tear your arm off She immediately gave me a guinea, and said that was all she had; I found this piece of metal in my pocket, which I knew nothing of before (Producing a counter)</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner set down by you?</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant superintendent of agents to the Prudential Assurance Company—I had a policy in my district on the life of James Burgess—I received information of his death—a claim was made by Susan Walker as cousin of the deceased—the policy was dated the 10th December, 1879—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable to the next of kin, the weekly premium being 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in const quence of the receipt of the claim I went on the 5th of October to 4, Joseph Street, Capel Street—I saw Mersh, Eliza Clarke, and Mrs. Walker—I said to Mrs. Walker, "I am come for the necessary particulars to fill up the form of claim"—she gave me the particulars, and after filling up the form I asked Mrs. Walker to sign it—she put her cross—Mersh put his name as attesting witness—I told Clarke that although she cohabited with the deceased she was not entitled to it—she said she knew that Walker was entitled to it, and that she would pay the funeral expenses—in conse<lb></lb>quence of instructions I received from the office I took the money on the 7th to the same house—I saw Clarke coming in from the street as I entered the yard which leads to the house—I said, "You can turn back now, I have got the claim"—she turned round—I followed her to the house—I said, "Is Mrs. Walker in?"—she said, "Yes"—she took me into the room, and I mistook Fox for Walker—Mersh's wife was also present—I think Clarke's words were. "Here is the agent"—I said to Fox, "I am pleased to tell you you will get the whole amount"—there was some question as to whether she was entitled to it all, but it is the practice of of our office to pay in case of an accident—I was not previously in a posi<lb></lb>tion to say so—I told them the deceased was not in benefit, yet on account of accident they would pay the whole—Fox seemed pleased, but did not reply—I then produced the necessary receipt and asked her to sign it—this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said she could not write—I said, "I recollect you could not write; the other day you made a cross"—so she made a cross after the words "Susan Walker—Clarke and Mersh were also present—prior to that I said, "I want some one to witness it; a respectable person from the street can be called in"—they demurred, but eventually called in Mersh—I said, "I merely want you to witness this claim for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he had signed the paper on a former occasion—he signed the paper after the cross—it is the usual form indemnifying the company against any further claim—I counted the money out to Fox, thinking she was Mrs. Walker—I then endeavoured to canvass her—she made some excuse about distress, and I went away—on</p>

               <p>the same day, in consequence of what my wife told me, I went and found the prisoners—I saw Fox in the deceased's house—I said, "It is a serious thing your obtaining this money"—she was intoxicated—she said she had as much right to the money as the Walkers, and more, at she was as much Mrs. Walker as she was herself—she said her brother had it, and it would be all right; the money would be right enough—she made several attempts to take me into public-houses, stating that her brother or her sister were there—I did not find them—when I saw Susan Walker she was perfectly sober—I did not see her on the 9th when she came to my house to see my wife—I saw her the next morning at 7 o'clock, she was then perfectly sober, and the husband too.</p>

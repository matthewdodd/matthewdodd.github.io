I lost that watch on the 29th of June; my watch was in my dressing case on the 29th of June; it was there at seven o'clock in the morning when I went out, and when I returned at five o'clock in the afternoon I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your dressing case locked when you went away - A. No it was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - 
               <persName id="t18141026-14-person221">A. </persName>
            Yes; I know him; he was a servant to Mr. Harrisson, who keeps the hotel; he was porter there, and lived as one of the servants of the Hotel at the time. I have seen my watch since at Bow Street, about five weeks ago; Perks, the officer, produced it before the Magistrate. I shall know it again when it is produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Did you live in town last June or only there on a visit - A. I lived in town; the town is my regular residence, I had no servant at the Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Crisp was not employed about your person - 
               <persName id="t18141026-14-person222">A. </persName>
            He was employed about the house as boots.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did not leave your watch in the water closet - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the prisoner at all employed about the rooms - A. He did not attend the lodgers in any of the rooms as I know of; my room was up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the Hotel - A. Mr. Harrison; he lives there.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKS. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody on the 20th of September, on the charge of stealing a one pound note of his Master, at the Tavistock Hotel. I took him to the public office Bow Street, and locked him up. I asked him where he lived; he told me his wife kept a chandler's shop, at No. 2, Cross Lane; I went there, and searched, and in the parlour there were a chest of drawers, and in one of these drawers' I found this watch his wife was present and a young man living at the Hotel, of the name of Wilsdon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the house kept by - A. The lower part of the house was kept by Mrs. Crisp, the wife of the prisoner, the lower part of the house is a shop, and parlour, kept by the wife only; she had two little children, and seemed forward with child again. When I found the watch, I took it to the office, and looked into the robbery-book; I found the number talley with the number of Mr. Tulloch's watch; the number tallied with the number in the hand bill. I took the watch to Mr. Tulloch; he attended at the examination. The watch has never been out of my possession since I took it out of the drawer; I found this watch in the drawer. There was another watch, five spoons, and some other valuables, all put together.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that watch, is that your watch - A. It is; I know it by the maker's name, and by the general appearance; there was no chain to it, only merely the watch; it is of the value of fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the watch in the water closet, and when I found it there was a piece of coloured string to it, and a single key.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

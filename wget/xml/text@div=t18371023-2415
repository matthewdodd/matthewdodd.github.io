On the 25th of October, in the morning, I was on duty in Lewisham-road, and saw the prisoner carry<lb></lb>ing a load on his shoulder—I asked what he had got—he said, "A roll of lead "—I asked him to let me look at it, and found it was the head of a pump—I asked where he was going to take it—he said, "To New Cross, to a plumber's named Thorpe"—I asked if it was his own—he said, no, it belonged to Mr. Whomes who had sent him with it—I asked if the plumber was aware he was going to bring it to him—he said he believed he was—I went to Lewisham, and found, in an empty house adjoining the one the I prisoner lived in, a pump without a head to it, and it fitted it—we exa<lb></lb>mined the prisoner's house, and found some more lead which fitted to the same pump—he had 39lbs. weight of lead in his bag, and 27lbs. weight in his house—he said he lived there—I inquired at New Cross, and could find no Thorpe a plumber and glazier there—the whole of the pump was taken away level to the ground—all the leaden part of it was taken away—it appeared as if it had been recently unfixed, by the white lead—it appeared fresh moved, for it had rained that morning, and it was not wet—the house is in Lewisham, and is the property of Mr. Dawes—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner two years, and never knew any thing against him.</p>

I accompanied the officer to the room occupied by the prisoner adjoining Mr. Whomes's house, and found a saw and some lead hid under some shoes in the room—the lead appeared to have been cut with a saw, and the saw I found had lead in the teeth—I have fitted the lead and the pump head, and can say they formed part of one pump.</p>

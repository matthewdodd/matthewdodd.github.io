                  </hi>. I occupy a house in the parish of Stepney. I do not know any other name to the parish—I am a shoemaker, and my shop is part of the dwelling-house—I keep shoes in my shop window—last Satur<lb></lb>day evening I shut my front door, and went up stain about five minutes after five o'clock—I had seen these shoes safe in the window five minutes before—I left my daughter in the back parlour—she is between eleven and twelve years old—the shop window was left unfastened—it is a sash window—it was down at the time I went up stairs, but not fastened—I had hardly got to the top of the stairs before my daughter called me—I went down stairs and found the window sash shoved up about four inches—there was a vacant apace in the window—I hardly knew, at the time, what I had lost—I examined, and missed three pair of shoes, two odd shoes, and one odd boot—I have seen them since, at Lambeth-street—I found the sash completely down when I lighted the candle, about a quarter before five o'clock—it was quite dark then—I could not see a person's countenance independent of the gas-light.</p>

               <p>Saturday evening—I only know the parish as Stepney—I do not know any other name which it has—I was there between five and six o'clock, and saw the prisoner and two more in the field—I suspected that some<lb></lb>thing was wrong, and watched them—I saw them go to a corner of the field—I ran and watched them, and saw one of them come out of the field into the street—the prisoner came out second—they went towards a broker's shop—a young man outside said to him, "Go on, go on"—I ran and laid hold of him, and asked what he had got—I put my hand down to the bundle—he said, "Shoes," and let them fall—I took him to the station-house, and kept the bundle which I had taken up—he said he had got the shoes from another man to hold, and that they were going to sell them—I neither threatened nor made him any promise—he said the other man was a shoemaker, and he himself was a shoemaker—I produce the bundle of shoes, which I have had ever since.</p>

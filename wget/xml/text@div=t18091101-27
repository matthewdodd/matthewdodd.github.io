            . I am a watchman of Acton. On the night of the 2nd of October, after crying the hour of twelve, I sat down upon Mr. Pierce's step, a linen draper's shop about fourteen or fifteen yards from Mr. Briggs' house, I heard a rattling of a door; I walked towards Mr. Briggs' door, I saw the prisoner opening his glass door; she said, what, Goss, you are our watchman. She had been a servant there, but was not then. I asked her what made her open the door, and told her I would call Mr. Briggs; I left another watchmen with her. I went down a passage and called him, I did not make him hear; she said she would call master; she called out, she seemed very much in liquor. The housekeeper came down in her shift; she said, for God's sake what is the matter; how came you here. When Mr. Briggs came down, he said, take her about her business; then he said search her; Mr. Briggs put his hand into her pocket and took some tea spoons out; he put in his hand the second time and took out a pepper box; he told me to lock her up in the round house; then he said he would not wish her to go to the round house; he then said, take her to a woman of the name of Clarke, where she had slept before, and when I had taken her to this woman's house, Mr. Briggs came down; he said he had lost more property. I saw something in her bosom; I took out of her bosom a two pound note. Mr. Briggs took the spoons and the pepper box, I have kept the note ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Who lives in the house with you - A. Only a housekeeper and a little boy.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this night the watchman has been speaking of; what time did you go to bed - A. About half past nine; I left my housekeeper to shut my shop door before I went to bed; I followed her up about five minutes afterwards. I saw the back door bolted; the kitchen window was secured with a wooden pin. About twelve o'clock I was alarmed, I heard a noise below in the shop like people quarrelling; it awaked me. I went to the chamber door and called what noise was that; the watchman answered, come down. I put my clothes on, went down, and saw the watchman and the prisoner there; she was scolding, raving, and quarrelling like a person deranged; she is subject to a deranged mind at times. I then asked her what she did there, and how she came there; she said she was going by about ten o'clock, found the street door open, she came to lay there, that was her place, and there she would be; I have great reason to believe that her intention was to be there all night, because she had made up a fire in the kitchen. When I went to bed I saw the fire out myself. We searched her pockets and took out four silver spoons and a pepper box; I have got them. She was taken to Mrs. Clarke's by my directions, where she had slept before; she made so much noise Mrs. Clarke was afraid to sleep in the house with her; she was searched; I think the watchman said he took the two pound note out of her bosom. She was afterwards taken to the round house, after a great deal of trouble and violence made use of to get her out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be in liquor - A. I think she did rather.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had these silver spoons and the pepper box been put on the over night. - A. They were on the tea-board on the dresser in the kitchen, the two pound note was in the cupboard in the parlour, I believe I locked the cupboard when I went to bed, the cupboard had folding doors, there appeared to be two nails drawn from the bottom, that is the way how it was opened, the lock was not hurt, the shutter of the kitchen window was open, and there were two squares of glass broken, on the next day she said she broke them in opening the windows; she had lived with me five or six years and she had only left me about five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Then her account how she got into this house was, that she found the street door open, that she came in to lay there, that was her place and there she would be. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it you say, you supposed her to be deranged. - A. Yes; I supposed her at times to be deranged, her head was disordered, she used to apply to spirituous liquors, and say it would make her head better, and it always made her head worse, and when she was so I turned her away, not for dishonesty, when her head was bad she would drink, that made her quarrelsome, then I turned her away, and when she got into a sound-mind, then I took her again, the last time I sent her away she went to her friends in the country; she was under the doctor's hands, he advised them to put her into the private madhouse; however she got the better of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On that night I came from London in the stage coach to the George at Acton, between nine and ten o'clock at night, and going by Mr. Briggs' door I saw the door was not fast; before I went into the house I saw there was a light in the housekeeper's room, I thought Mr. Briggs was making of candles; I went into the kitchen, and as I came to the back door I thought I heard somebody come in at the street door, then I went up stairs and the light was not in the housekeeper's room. At the same time I heard Mr. Briggs sleeping in his bed; I came down and fastened all the doors; it was very dark in the kitchen, I opened the window to look for the tinder box; I thought there had been somebody in the house by the doors being left open; in opening the window I struck it by accident; I struck a light, and the first thing that I looked after was the plate, and as I found it I put it into my pocket. I looked in the china closet in the parlour, where there was a deal of plate; I saw it all safe; then I went up into my own room, where my own clothes were I found my box as I left it. I then came down stairs made a fire, and made some tea, and drank it. I intended to sit down there till the morning, untill Mr. Briggs got up; I had sat down in the chair some time, and then I thought I heard somebody at the street door; I went to speak to the watchman; when I came to the door it was the watchman; I said, well watchman, what is it you want; he directly took me in custody; he alarmed me very much, saying, I was his prisoner, and that he would take me away; I said I would not go out of the house till Mr. Briggs came; I went to call Mr. Briggs, in my flurry I fell down; Mr. Briggs came down; the watchman said he would have me searched, I told the watchman not to search me, what I had in my pocket Mr. Briggs was very wellcome to take out. The watchman alarmed me, else I should not have left my umbrella, my bonnet, and my bundle in the kitchen, and a fire was in the kitchen as I was going in again.</p>

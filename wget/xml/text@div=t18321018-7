            . I am the prosecutor's sister, and live with my father, in the same street. On Saturday morning, the 18th of August, about seven o'clock, I went to my brother's place to take his breakfast; it might be later than seven - I had the key, which he had left with my mother; as I was opening his door, somebody inside pushed up against the door - I found the prisoner inside my brother's room, where the trunk was; I was trying to push the door open, but could not; I pushed it a little way open, and saw his white trousers - I went round, and opened the window shutter, which was a little open, and then he came out at the door which I had opened; I had seen him before, and knew him by sight, but I was a little girl when I saw him before - I am sure he is the person; as he went down the street he shook his head at me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far did you open the door to enable you to see my trousers? A. Very little - I saw you come out, and you shook your head at me; I did not halloo out - when I went inside I found the back window broken open; the box was open, and a poker laid by the side of it.</p>

            . I live at Dover; I was at the prisoner's house on the 14th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is her house?</p>
               <p>Cray. It is in <placeName id="t17581025-15-crimeloc75">Rosemary-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you lie there?</p>
               <p>Cray. I was upon the bed with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you charge her with?</p>
               <p>Cray. I lost a purse and eleven guineas in it.</p>
               <p>Q. From where was it taken?</p>
               <p>Cray. From out of my right hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take it?</p>
               <p>Cray. I felt her take it; I jumped out of bed after her, and before I could get down stairs, the other woman that was with her, that shewed me the way to the house, was gone away, then I could not get a constable, so the prisoner and I went both of us to the Watch-house together, and staid there till the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched there?</p>
               <p>Cray. No, she was not, I could not search her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other woman upon the bed with you?</p>
               <p>Cray. No, she was not, I never kissed her hand nor lips, I did kiss this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your breeches on or off?</p>
               <p>Cray. They were on, but they were down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it?</p>
               <p>Cray. No, I did not, but I felt the purse go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it walk out, or did she take it out?</p>
               <p>Cray. There was no body near but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you lay hold of her?</p>
               <p>Cray. She was too nimble for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your money in the prisoner's custody afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cray. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your purse or money again?</p>
               <p>Cray. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Cray. No.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor then laid before the court a detail of his giving the prisoner six-pence to purchase a couple of birch rods, and the purposes for which they were bought, which rods the prisoner produced in court; but as this history is of too indelicate a nature to be laid before the publick in general, we chuse to draw a veil over it. The jury <rs id="t17581025-15-verdict76" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t17581025-15-verdict76" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"></interp>
               acquitted
            </rs> the prisoner, and desired, that as the rods were proved to be the property of the prosecutor, that they might be delivered to him, which was accordingly done.</p>

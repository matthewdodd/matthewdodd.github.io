                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Dunnett, of the Luke's Head, Little Poulteney Street—on 24th February the little boy, Harper, came in for a half-quartern of sherry, and I gave it to him in this bottle—he gave me a bad half-crown—I bent it—I knew the boy, and asked him who sent him—he said, "A man standing at the corner of the street"—I gave the coin to my master, and by his direction gave the boy the change—he went out at one door, and my master at the other.</p>

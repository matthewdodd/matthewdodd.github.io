The locks of the drawers and the boxes were all broken; I missed a few pieces of coin that I had since I was about ten or eleven years of age, a crown-piece, a half crown, that was a medal of the late King of France; the money was taken from a drawer in this purse, (shews the purse;) up stairs some of it, and the other in a little box.</p>

             sworn. - I was present at the search of the prisoner; after Mr. Goodall had searched him, on putting on his clothes I searched his pocket, and in his great-coat pocket I found a branch of a myrtle-tree, it was quite fresh, as though it was on the pot; I said to Goodall, I have no doubt that this come off the premises; I went back to match it with the myrtle in the pot; it exactly fitted the place where it was stripped off, the myrtle-tree was in the back-room up stairs.</p>

             sworn. - I am the officer that was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search the prisoner before he was taken to the watch-house? - A. No, I took him to the watch-house, and there I searched him; I found in his bosom a half Belcher silk handkerchief; out of the ham of his breeches a crown-piece of King Charles the Second; I pulled off his boots, in the ancle of his stocking I found a medal of the King of France; a little bit of foreign coin of Mrs. Paterson's, in his breeches-pocket. (The articles produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. The sprig of myrtle escaped you? - A. Yes, we went back and searched the privy; we took up there a half-crown piece, and two smaller pieces of silver coin. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Paterson.) You said this money was given you when you were a child? - A. Yes, it had a mark on it; I had often took notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you took notice whose coin it was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, from that circumstance, take upon you to say that crown-piece is your's, and was in your house? - A. Yes, it was in my purse; the medal of the late King of France I had one exactly like it, but cannot positively swear to that; I have had that medal about five years.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Goodall.) Was this one that was found upon his person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Paterson.) Look at the small pieces of coin, do you know that? - A. I cannot exactly say whether it is a threepenny piece or a twopenny piece; I have had it about nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on it? - A. There is a little hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's had a drill in it? - A. Yes; I am sure this is the same coin.</p>
               <p>Q. The half-crown is King William and Queen Mary, that is all you can say upon that? - A. Yes, and there is a German sixpence. (The bundle produced.)</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Paterson looks at them separately.)</p>
               <p>Q. What are those - a pair of sheets? - A. Yes, I have examined them; they have my mark upon them, they were in my house when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those sheets? - A. I cannot tell exactly what I gave for them, I have had them about ten or twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. They must be worth more than fourteen shillings? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. The next article is your gown, do you know that? - A. Yes, it is a new one almost, it cost me twenty-three shillings, I have had it about eleven months.</p>
               <p>Q. It must be worth more than ten shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a shirt, is that worth five shillings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is child's cloak, do you know it? - A. Yes, I value that at five shillings, and the waistcoat is an old one, I have valued that at three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Goodall.) These are all the articles found in the bundle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are the keys? - A. (Goodall produces the keys and an iron crow.) They are all skeleton-keys; I let Mrs. Paterson in the next day with one of these keys. The crow fitted the mark on the drawers, and it looked as if they had been forced by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the sword? - (The sword produced by Goodall, and shewn to Mrs. Paterson.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of such a sword? - A. Yes, it is Mr. Paterson's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went away, did you leave a canary bird? - A. Yes, it was missing when I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cage gone, or only the bird? - A. Only the bird.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a myrtle in the house, where was that? - A. On the first pair of stairs in a little room backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself observe whether any thing had been stripped off? - A. Yes. (The myrtle produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any sprig that had been stripped off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to correspond with what had been stripped off? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110032"></xptr>Court. You may compare it, but I suppose it is too dry now.</p>
               <p>(The sprig of myrtle was placed where it had been stripped off.)</p>
               <p>Wilson. It exactly fitted the joint on placing it to the myrtle, I am confident, when it was fresh; it was kept in water till on the second examination, it fitted then, and was in appearance quite fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Paterson.) Is that your half handkerchief? - A. Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Radnor Street, St. Luke's, and am in the employment of the Mint—on Thursday morning, 3rd May, about half-past seven or a quarter to eight, I went, with Inspector Dann, Inspector Bran-nan, and many other officers, to No. 3, Little Queen Street, Camberwell—we forced open the door of the house—it consists of two rooms, one above the other, with a kitchen at the back—we proceeded upstairs, and in the first floor found two moulds for making florins, five double moulds for making shillings, and one treble mould for making sixpences—on the mantelshelf stood a good florin and two good shillings, fifteen counterfeit shillings, and two counterfeit sixpences—the shillings corresponded, in date with the mould and with the two good shillings, which I believe the impressions were taken from—the mould also corresponded in date with the good florin, one of the sixpences also corresponded in date with the mould, and one I believe was cast in the same mould that was found in another house where a large seizure was made that morning—in the room I found several tin bands for making moulds, and iron clams for holding the moulds when the metal is poured in in a state of fusion—in the cupboard I found two galvanic batteries charged, containing acid much diluted, with these wires, bent as they appear now, to hold the mould at each side, some plaster of Paris, and some powder, a file, with white metal in its teeth, and all the necessary implements for making and coating counterfeit coin—in the back kitchen there was a middling-sized copper, full of broken plaster of Paris moulds, a glass with plaster of Paris adhering to it, and a box con<lb></lb>taining a small quantity of quicksilver, which is used in the process of coating—we took possession of the articles, and came away, leaving persons to watch the house—on the morning of 20th June, a little before eight, I accompanied Inspector Fyfe, with another officer, and placed myself in a position to command a view of Bowman's Buildings, Aldersgate Street—I saw the male prisoner come from the court, accompanied by another man—I pointed him out to Serjeant Elliott, who took him into custody—I said to him, "Well, Mr. Williams, we visited your house, 3, Little Queen Street, Camberwell, on 3rd of last month—you have not been there"—he said, "I never lived there, I was never there in my life, nor do I know where Camberwell is"—I said, "Quite a stranger, Mr. Williams. Where do you live?" He said, "I have no fixed residence"—I asked the man who was with him where he lived—he said, he worked for Mr. Brock, and lived at 41, Snow Hill—he did live there—I knew him to be a working man—I went there, accompanied by Fyfe, and saw the female prisoner—she was taken into custody—I called her by the name. of Williams, and</p>

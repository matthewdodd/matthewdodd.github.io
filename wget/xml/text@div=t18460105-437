I was in Whitechapel-road, opposite the King's Arms public-house—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and Myers—they drove a horse and cart up to the door of the King's Arms—they both got out of the cart, and went into the public-house—I went in after them—I left Bray with the horse and cart—when I went into the house there were from fourteen to twenty persons there, but I did not see the prisoner there—I came out, and was about to take the horse and cart to the station—the persons in the public-house came out, from fourteen to twenty of them—they surrounded and knocked us about very much—I was cut in the nose, and Myers got hold of the cart, and got it away—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner then—the persons who were collected said, "Cut their b----y hands off; don't let them take it"—they were very riotous indeed.</p>

On the 13th of Nov., I was called by Burgess to watch the cart—he went into the public-house—after he came out I saw from fifteen to twenty other persons come out—they rescued the horse and cart from us, and struck us several times—the prisoner came to the side of the horse—he laid hold of the horse by the reins, and tried to get it away—he pushed me several times—he said, "Don't let the b—stake it; cut their b—y hands off!"—I had known the prisoner for nine months before that evening, by the name of Don—he is called Don—I am certain he is the man who came up by the side of the horse and pushed me about—I am posi<lb></lb>tive about it, and that he used the expression, "Don't let the b—take it; cut their b—y hands off"—the result was they got possession of the horse and cart, and Burgess and I were left senseless.</p>

I received some description, and took the prisoner on the 1st of Dec. in Threadneedle-street—I had been looking for him before—he asked me what I took hold of him for—I said for assaulting Bray and Burgess—on the way to the station-house he said, so help him God he would not be sent innocent away from his family; he would tell the Magistrate the truth, and that the worst of the parties were away.</p>

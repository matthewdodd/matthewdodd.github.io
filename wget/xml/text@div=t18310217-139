            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Bulworthy, a pawnbroker, in Aylesbury-street. On the 20th of January the prisoner came, and pawned two rings, two brooches, and one seal, for 5s.; he said his father sent him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. About eleven o'clock - he came round to a box; he could get his head up to the counter - I did not know him before, but I am confident he is the boy.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 20th of January I saw the prisoner in Woodbridge-street, in company with two other boys; in consequence of something I had heard, I watched them, and saw them go behind a dead wall; they appeared to be sharing some money - I took the prisoner, and found on him this gold seal and the duplicates of the other articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he tell you he had been instructed by them to take these things? A. No - I took the other boys, but they were not detained; I believe the prisoner's father is a broker.</p>

On the 20th of January I sent him on an errand to Clerkenwell; I believe all these articles to be mine - I have a mark on these two rings, and I had such brooches and seals in my possession about this time; I did not miss them till the constable came to me - I had a glass-case, in which I kept them; I looked into that, and missed one or two of the articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state before the Magistrate that you could swear to the rings? A. Yes - if I had marked them the marks would remain on them; I have not a large stock - I cannot say when I had seen these seals; I had had the tray of seals out, and cleaned them a few days before, but I cannot say whether they were among them then - I do not think they were missing at that time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

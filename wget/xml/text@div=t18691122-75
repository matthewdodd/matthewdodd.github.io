                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bulford, who keeps an eating-house at 42, Bereaford Street, Woolwich—on the night of the 11th instant the prisoner and two other men came in—two of them ordered some soup, and paid for it, and then the prisoner ordered some, and he said it was paid for—I went and asked my husband, and he said it was not—my husband tried to take it from him, and the prisoner threw it over him—my husband went to look for an officer, and while he was gone the prisoner went into the parlour and took this coat off a nail—I was stand<lb></lb>ing at the shop-door—I met him at the parlour-door with it in his hand. I said, "What business have you in my parlour? you have stolen that coat; I will give you in charge," and he swore at me—he dropped the coat and went out—I afterwards went to the police-station, where I saw the prisoner—I said, "That is the man who took the coat; I have no doubt at all that he is the man."</p>

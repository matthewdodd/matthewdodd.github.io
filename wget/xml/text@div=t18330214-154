               <p>Burton. Q. Can you swear I was with them? A. Yes, I am positive of that, though he had disguised himself as much as possible - when I saw him first, he had a frock-coat open, a blue apron under it, and a comforter inside - when I took him, he had his coat buttoned, and the apron and the comforter outside.</p>

             (Police-constable N23). I saw the prisoners on the 31st of January, as I was standing at Holloway turnpike-gate; they had another person in company with them - they passed me, and in a short time I saw Russell running with a coat on his arm; I followed with him and took the prisoners in Maiden-lane, close to

               <p>Harrold. He stated that he lost sight of us, then went back to the carman, and asked if he had lost a coat; Maiden-lane is two miles and a half long, and is it likely we should have got so far? Witness. It is about a mile; I saw them about a quarter of a mile from where the coat was taken.</p>

               <p>Burton's Defence. The other prisoner, whom I had not seen for three years, asked me to go with him to Highgate, and then I told him I knew a nearer road home; we crossed over into Maiden-lane - the two officers jumped off a bank a hundred yards off; they looked in our faces, and took us into custody.</p>

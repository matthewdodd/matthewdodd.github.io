On the 29th of last May, between the hours of five and six in the afternoon, as I was driving my stage between Stanmore and Edgeware, I saw a little way before me two or three teams, the driver of the first team had got hold of one horse, whether it was the foremost or not I cannot say, he had got hold of the halter, and he got pulling it in, beating it about the head, that is all that I saw.</p>

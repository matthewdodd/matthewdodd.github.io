I was called by Tiddersley to the area in Hill Street—I found in that area a female child—the area belongs to a cloth factory in Hill Street—there are three iron railings to it, running parallel to the street—the railing is three feet high, and stands on a coping stone level with the pavement—the area is three feet four below the level of the street; that makes six feet four from the top of the railing to the bottom of the area—the child was lying on its right side, and its legs as if sticking to the area, and its bedgown was sticking up close against the brickwork which forms part of the area against the road; it was lying parallel with the area—the area is paved with bricks—I took the child to the station, and then to St. Margaret's workhouse, where I delivered it to the nurse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw this child about 9 o'clock in the morning, after it was admitted—I saw it every day until it died—at first there was no evidence of external violence, except a bruise at the corner of the right eye; the day before its death there was an extensive tumefac<lb></lb>tion of the right side of the back of the head; the bruised appearance of the eye was also more extensive, and the pupil of the eye was dilated, indicating compression of the brain—she died on the following day, 1st April—a post<lb></lb>mortem examination was made by my son.</p>

                  </hi>., M. D. I made a post mortem examination of the child—on removing the scalp, I noticed considerable engorgement of the vessels generally between the scalp and skull, and far back on the head, on the right side, I found two complete fractures of the skull, one of them about three inches in length, and the other about two inches; they met at a point—an abscess had formed underneath—that must have been some days in forming—that was the cause of death—it was a consequence of the fracture—I should not have expected the falling of the child into the area to have produced the fracture, because it is a very unusual thing for the bones of a child to be fractured at all, unless very great violence is used—the bones are very soft indeed at that age—I do not mean to say that it could not have happened in that way, only I should not have expected it.</p>

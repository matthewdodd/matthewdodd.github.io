The two prisoners were the men that robbed me; they took from me seventeen guineas and some odd money, besides my hat and three keys; I was going on foot from Highgate, where I had left my horse, to my own house, about a hundred yards further.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you positively sure as to the persons of the two prisoners at the bar? - Perfectly clear; for on going down I was quite abreast of them; I had not the least suspicion of being stopped; they both took hold of me by the collar, they were abreast, one of each side; they asked me for my money.</p>
               <p>Court. It must have been perfectly light at that time of night? - Broad day, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Which way did they go? - After they stopped me, I told them they were drunk, they were not serious; and by that time I had some how disengaged myself from them, expecting somebody would pass to my relief; I gave them a few blows, but they got me down, and one of them put his hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, and took my money, as I mentioned before; they crossed the field over to get from the spot, to get towards Caen Wood; I proceeded to a neighbour's, within a hundred yards of the spot, to a lady who holds a large farm under Lord Mansfield, expecting to find some assistance from her servants; I found only one at home, in consequence of which I did not wait there, but made the best of my way by running to Highgate, I got on my horse, and rode round by Hampstead-lane, by Lord Mansfield's; there is a little hut just opposite, there I saw a person who said he had just seen the two men, and he supposed they were then in the wood; having nobody with me, I went to the Spaniard, which is very near, and there were several people proposed looking out for them; I left them, and proceeded further through Hampstead, and came to Red Caps, about half way to Hampstead; there I found the patrol, and after giving them the information, I proceeded to go through Kentish-town; after I passed the workhouse, which is close to Red Caps, there is a vacant field, and there I met two soldiers; it being near dark I could not discriminate, and I went to the next public-house; not procuring any assistance, I rode back and passed them before they got to the work-house, and went to the public-house where the patrol were, and they seized the prisoners, who were just come up to the spot; on being brought into the house they were searched, and the particulars the patrol can inform you.</p>

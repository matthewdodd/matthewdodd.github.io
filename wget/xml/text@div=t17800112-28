               <p>Do you recollect how much money you gave him? - No; I believe it was about 12 s. I don't know exactly what I had in my pocket; my son ran towards the turnpike to get help for me; I went as fast as I could home to get help to see whether my son was murdered in the road or not; I expected he was dead in the road.</p>
               <p>Do you know who made this attack upon you? - No; only he had passed by me about a quarter of an hour before, and I observed his coat.</p>

               <p>How do you know that it was the same person that made the attack upon you? - My son saw him go all the way before; when I saw him come out of the ditch I saw he had the same clothes on as when he passed me.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him since? - Yes, at Mr. Griffith's; he was then in a different dress to what he had on when he stopped me.</p>

               <p>How came you to take any notice of him? - Because I had some suspicion of him.</p>

               <p>What did he do then? - I did not see any thing after that; I ran back to the turnpike.</p>
               <p>How soon did you come to your recollection to see what was doing? - I cannot tell; I did not stay to see any thing else; I got up directly and ran to the turnpike for assistance.</p>
               <p>Did you, before the man knocked you down, take so much notice of him, and see him so well, that you should know him again? - Yes; I think I should know him again.</p>

               <p>Was he in the same dress then that he was in the night he committed the fact? - - No; he was in a different dress.</p>
               <p>Did you know him as soon as you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it that you saw him at Mr. Bishop's? - It was on the Sunday after.</p>

               <p>Where does he live? - At Ricklesworth; I believe he is a collar-maker.</p>

               <p>On the second day what promises were made to induce him to confess? - No promises at all; when we came back with the coat, he went into a private room and confessed he had robbed Mrs. Welch and Mr. Jarvis.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him told it would be better for him to confess? - Yes; Mr. Bishop told him he would shew him all the favour he could if he would confess the truth and own what he had done with the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you both say it would be better for me to tell the truth?</p>
               <p>Welch. We did not. I found in his lodging the coat, a stopping iron, and a plough paddle. When I returned with them I said to him, now, my friend, I must confine you closely, for here is the coat you denied; he said then, that he wanted to save himself; I went out with him and he begged and prayed of me to intercede with Mr. Bishop for him; I told him I would not hear it; he then confessed to Mr. Bishop, and then he went into a room and told it to five or six people without being asked any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>What was the iron you found? - An iron they stuff collars with; he owned that that was what he had, robbed them with instead of a pistol.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Welsh. Do you recollect what coloured coat the man had on that robbed you? - Yes, a light-coloured ragged coat;</p>

               <p>Should you know the coat he had on that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it like the coat he has on now? - Yes; it was a light-coloured coat torn behind.</p>
               <p>Was it that coat? - It was like it, I cannot be sure.</p>

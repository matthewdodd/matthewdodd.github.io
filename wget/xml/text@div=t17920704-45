            , I was with him on the 28th of May last, we had been parted nine weeks, we did not agree; he turned me and child into the street several times; he lived in Half-moon-passage, No. 10, and I lived in Middlesex-passage; he came to my room about half past three, I was at home, we had made it up, and had taken a room; he asked me to take a walk; I went for his great coat, and Mr. Lowe was in the room; I had been absent about ten minutes, and I understood they had been falling out; my husband was leaning his hand on his head, he had complained of being not well two or three days before; the prisoner said he came for the money that was owing him, and my husband said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040035"></xptr>owed him nothing, and the prisoner swore he would have it out of his bones, and the prisoner struck him, and my husband struck him, and they had a round and fell, then they got up and had something to drink, and the prisoner poured out a glass of gin and threw it over me; then they drank and sat, and talked a good while; Lowe sent for some more gin, but neither of us tasted it; I got my husband out of the house, and the prisoner followed after my husband, and knocked him down in the Great Close; my husband said he was not hurt by the blows; we went to Islington, and returned in the evening: my husband said he was not well, and he took the bottle in his pocket to fetch something to drink; I went to bed, and the child came and said his father was fighting with Mr. Lowe; I went and brought him away, and he was all over mud and blood, and the people could not sleep all night for his groans; he seemed very bad; he told me to get a strengthening plaster: I fetched the doctor; he bled him, and made up a medicine; I got him a calf's foot, and made him some jelly, and got him some wine, and attended him all night, and next day he said he should die; I got him into the hospital, and he expired on the Sunday night.

               <p>I am a surgeon's pupil of Bartholomew's hospital; the deceased was brought there on Wednesday the 30th of May; he remained till the Sunday night; when he came in he complained of his side; I found four of his ribs broke, I applied bandages and the usual medicines; on Sunday night he died; his death was occasioned by an inflammation, in consequence of the broken ribs.</p>

               <p>I saw the deceased on Whit-Monday between four and five in the evening, and the prisoner came in and there was a word or two arose about family affairs, and they fought about ten minutes; I believe it was a fit of jealousy; they fought in the taproom ten minutes, and then they agreed to go out to fight, and fought about six minutes in the yard; then it was all over; they were down three or four times, and I believe the damage was done against the table.</p>
               <p>Did they fight fairly? - It was no fight, only pulling and hawling, and striking as they could, both of them as much as the other; the deceased went home to his own lodging; they did not live together; I saw him the next day; they were to have fought two or three weeks before, and the prisoner would not come.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's master gave him a very good character, and offered to take him again directly; he said the prisoner had worked in his house before he came into it, and he had been in it eighteen years, and that the prisoner was a very quiet sober man, and the deceased was always in liquor, and very quarrelsome, and he and his wife fought constantly: the prisoner was a cripple from his cradle, and neither fond of fiting nor fit for it.</p>

            . I keep the Three Nuns, at Aldgate. On Tuesday evening, the 11th of February, a person came there - I believe his name was Henry Wright - when I first saw him he showed slight symptoms of insanity - he appeared strange - he went out from my house after having had his place booked by a coach - he waited impatiently, and said he would go home by a post chaise - I tried to prevail on him to stay till the following day, but he went out, and I understand got into a cab - I had requested a witness to take all the care of him he could, and he did so, but he eventually left our house in a cab.</p>

            . I live at Romford. On the evening of the 12th of February, I recollect a cab coming to my house at Romford; a person named Charles Wright was there - he gave me that name himself - I saw the prisoner there - he asked for payment of the cab for driving him from town - Wright said he had given him two sovereigns - he had sent for me into the room, and when I went in he appeared very strange - I told him the cabman was waiting to be paid - he said, "Oh, I have given him two sovereigns - he can't want more; but, however, you go and pay him, and lend me Â£5." - he took tea there and left again in the cab - I told the prisoner to take all care of him, and take him to the Three Nuns, Aldgate, where he would find people to take care of him - he left with him in the cab - the prisoner said he would take him back - when I had first seen Wright, I said to the prisoner, "You have brought a deranged man here" - he said, "Yes; I know I have" - I said, "How came you to bring a deranged man here?" - he said, "I did not know it until the driver of the Braintree coach told me he was deranged" - I said, "Why not take him back?" - he said he would not go back.</p>

            . I live at No. 137, Whitechapel. On the evening of the 12th of February, a person came into my shop, in a peculiar state of dress and manner, about twenty minutes after nine - his right sleeve was torn, and his clothes muddy - he seemed as if he had been thrown down - in consequence of that, and what he said, I examined his pocket - he had 30s. 4d. and a pen-knife, but no watch - I ascertained that a place had been booked for him at the Bull, and sent him there.</p>

            . I live at Roydon, in Essex - I was at the Three Nuns on the 12th of February - I saw Wright taking some coffee - he appeared out of his mind - I saw him go out of the room about ten o'clock in the morning - he walked away into Aldgate to the stand, and got into a cab which the prisoner drove - I told the prisoner not to take him away, for he appeared out of his mind - the prisoner drove him away - I had seen him pull out a silk purse, and it laid sideways on the table - I looked through the holes of the purse, and there was a good many sovereigns, and he had got a watch and seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That was not in the prisoner's presence? A. No, another cabman drove him first, but I brought him back into the yard with the first cabman - he went away, and I followed him to the prisoner's cab - he had got into a coach before he got into the cab.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner was the person you told not to drive him off, but he did? A. Yes, I told him not to drive him away - I said the gentleman was out of his mind - he said, "Oh, I do not mind!" and drove off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."I was taken from the stand, at Aldgate, by a gentleman who caught hold of my reins, and bid me drive off towards Romford - no person came to me and desired me not to drive - I accordingly went, and on the way to Romford the gentleman behaved very strangely, and wanted to get out - I accordingly did drive him on, and then I had to drive him back again, fully intending to take him back to the Three Nuns - in the way home I had much difficulty in preventing him getting out- but he did at last get out near Whitechapel church, at the street leading into the Commercial-road, and ran off - it was late at night, and, after a short time (in carrying another fare who engaged me) I went home to my master's stables - the cab remained in the yard all night - the next morning I went to the stables to clean the cab, and, in pulling out the straw to replace it with fresh, the seals fell out - this was seen by my master and another person - I was recommended to keep the seals for two or three days in case they might be owned, and if nothing was heard, to take them to Somerset-house - I therefore had them in my pocket when the officer came to take me."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LAKE re-examined. The seals were attached to a ring which hung in front of him - I do not know how it was fixed, but I saw it under his waistcoat, and could see the guard round his neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say that a madman, in a fit of insanity, might not seize them and tear the guard off? A. I do not know - I saw him pull his watch out once or twice to look what was o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How were the seals attached then? A. I did not take particular notice of that - they did not fall - there was a guard round his neck - I could see that shine under his waistcoat.</p>

            . I am a waterman at the Turk's Head, Aldgate, No. 84 - I am appointed by the Commissioners of Stamps - on the 12th of February I remember seeing a tall thin man get into a dark cab, No. 1,729 - that is not the prisoner's - the prisoner's is No. 1,407 - that was the second cab heg ot into - he got into a coach before he got into the prisoner's cab - he got in at one door and out at the other - then ran along the rank and got into the prisoner's cab, took hold of the reins himself, and told him to drive down the road - I did not see anybody come up, and tell the prisoner not to drive him - I saw them go up to the other cabman.</p>
               <p>Q. When he got into the coach, was the waiter at the door of the coach? A. No, there was a country looking gentleman with a brown coat on - that person did not go up to the prisoner's cab, and tell him anything.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You generally get a gratuity from the cabmen, don't you? A. I get a penny from each - I got a penny from the first one, but I had not time to take one of the prisoner - the gentleman got hold of the reins himself so quick - Lake is the gentleman who spoke to the first man - I swear he did not speak to the prisoner - he spoke to the coachman and the first cabman, but let the man drive off.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he near at the time he got into the prisoner's cab? A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LAKE re-examined. Q. Is that correct? A. No; the gentleman got out at the same door as he got in at, on the same side of the way - while I was telling the coachman not to drive him away, saying he was out of his mind, a cabman drove up to the door, he got into the cab, and I said to the cabman, "Don't drive him away, he is out of his mind" - that was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then the man did not get in at one door, and out at the other? A. No; he did not go through the coach, I do not know whether it was the cabman or the gentleman, that turned the horse round and drove away - he got into the coach, and the cabman drove the horse round - he did not produce a watch or seals or money to the cabman - the moment he was in, the horse was turned round for Romford - I got into the first cab, and made the man drive him back into the Inn yard - the prisoner drove up to the coach door without being called, and I said, "Don't drive away: the gentleman is out of his mind."</p>
               <p>F. ELLIS re-examined. Q. Is what you swore true? A. Yes; the man got in at the left hand side, and out at the right - Parry was five or six lengths down the rank - the man went to him to get into the cab - the prisoner was cleaning his cab, and the gentleman jumped in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was he cleaning his cab? A. Rubbing the brass work in front - the gentleman jumped in - the prisoner turned round, took his seat, and they drove off together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which way was the horse's head turned? A. Towards Aldgate church, which is the general way of the rank - they turned round to go towards Romford - I heard no directions given which way to drive - I had heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100023"></xptr>Lake interfere with the first cab and the coach - I could not get near him - I was shutting the door of the coach, and he jumped out at the other side - the third cab was next to the Boar, four or five cabs off - I was taking directions at the coach door - the person did not speak to the cabman, for the gentleman was speaking to the coachman at the same time as he jumped into the cab.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who was speaking to the coachman? A. The witness who was last up here; and at that time the gentleman bolted away, and went to the cab four cabs off - it was not the gentleman who was speaking to the coachman, but the witness - when I opened the door for the gentleman to get in, Legg went to the coachman, and told him not to drive him away - he was near me until the gentleman got in, and went round to the cab.</p>

            . I keep the Mitre livery-stables in Mitre-street. The prisoner stands at my stable - on the morning of the 13th of January, between half-past ten and eleven o'clock, I saw him cleaning his cab - I saw him take the straw out of the bottom - I was called away; but I saw a little bunch of seals fall from the straw - I saw the prisoner pick them up, and put them into his pocket - his master stood by the side of me at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the cab been out that day? A. Not that morning - I was standing on the near side of the cab; and the prisoner pulled it out at the off-side, on the same side as the driver sits - there was no straw in the place where the driver sits; but he was pulling it out at that side - he did not call my attention to it - I was called away to a gentleman - it was a little bunch with two or three seals - they were not shown to me - he goes out of a morning, sometimes about half-past ten o'clock, sometimes not till twelve o'clock - Swain has at times only one horse to work with the cab.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he pulling out the straw in the usual way on that side? A. Pulling it out to put fresh straw in - on the 12th of February he drove the cab home about twelve o'clock at night - he was solid and sober then.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was Underwood by when the seals were seen? A. Yes; he saw them drop out of the cab - he was pulling the straw out of the cab - he was at the driver's side, I think; he pulled the straw out and threw it on the ground, and the seals shook through on the ground - he told me he had taken a gentleman to Romford the day before - before he found the seals, he did not say any thing about the gentleman he took to Romford; only he gave me the duty-ticket of the gate - it was when he gave me the duty-ticket that he told me he had been to Romford - the seals were found on the 13th of February - he was taken into custody on Saturday afternoon, I believe - the 13th of February was on Thursday - he mentioned about driving the gentleman to Romford on the Thursday; but it was on Wednesday he drove him - he said nothing about a man out of his mind - he told me that morning, he had come home about nine or half-past eight o'clock the evening previous - I had not seen him overnight - I do not sleep on the premises - my cab does not go out at any particular time in the morning - I have only one horse to it; and when it does well, and comes home in the afternoon, the horse has rest - the prisoner gave me the day's work; he paid me 14s. for the day's work - he gave it me in silver.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does he live with you at night? A. No; he gives me the money the following morning; but I have let it go a week or fortnight - I do not expect him to bring me the money at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does he pay you one sum whatever he does? A. When he does well, he pays me more - if he goes twenty-four miles, I consider it a very hard day's work, and give him more rest in the morning - half-past ten o'clock would be none too early to go out.</p>

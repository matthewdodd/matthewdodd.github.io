             sworn. - On the 10th of April, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was going home to my lodgings; I met the prisoner; I walked down the court that I lodge in with her; she lodges in the same court, and she took hold of the ribbon that was tied to my watch, and gave me a push with her left-hand; I recovered myself, and turned back; she ran away; I saw a woman go into a house opposite me, and I thought it might be her; I went to the house, and told her I had lost my watch; I found she was not the woman; I am quite sure it was the prisoner that took my watch; I had seen her before.</p>

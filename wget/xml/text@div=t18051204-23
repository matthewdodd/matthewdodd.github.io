             sworn. I am an officer of the Hatton Garden office. On the 9th of November, about half past six in the evening, I was going up Saffron Hill, I observed the prisoner on the opposite side of the street; me and my brother officer that was with me crossed the street; I asked the prisoner what he had got under his coat; what is that to you the answer was; I told him that we were officers, and we insisted on knowing; we felt under his coat, and found this blanket, which I produce; I asked him how he came by it; he said it was a comrade of his that gave it to him to sell; he had brought it from the continent; I then asked him where he was quartered; he told me that he was quartered at the prosecutrix's house in Charter-house-lane. I locked him up at our office, and then I went to the prosecutrix house to enquire about him. I asked him for the key of the door, but he did not give me the key of the door; I broke the door open, the door of his lodgings; the lady saw that the blanket was taken off her bed. When she came to the office, she swore to the blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutrix.) Is that your blanket? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; the prisoner was quartered at our house, it is one of the blankets that was on his bed.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 25th of November I went to the prisoner's house, in the Pottery, at Netting Dale—I asked if he had any objection to my looking into his yard—he said "No"—I found three doors in the front yard—I asked how he came by them—he said they were his own, he bought them at a sale in the police-inspector—I then applied to Mr. Richardson about taking the doors, and the prisoner offered to take them in his horse and cart—he sent his buy across, with the horse, to the other yard, for the cart—I followed him, and found two doors in the other yard—I went back to the prisoner, and asked how he came by them—he said they were his own, he bought them at a sale in the Bayswater-road—after that, he said the three doors were his own, but the other two would <hi rend="italic">do for him</hi>—we went on to the Estate, and when he got there he said, "There is where I picked up the two doors, and very nearly broke my neck over them; I put them in my cart"—they were good doors.</p>

Having information, I set a watch outside my door to inform me when any one came to the house. On the 30th of May, at ten o'clock at night, the bell rung - I went out, and found Samme running across the yard - I asked where she was going, and what was the matter - she said, it was only a friend come to see her. I went into the servants' sitting-room, by the door where she came from, and found Ballard sitting there in the dark, eating. I told her to bring a light, which she did, and on looking round, I found a bundle on the floor - I asked him what it was - he said, it was given him for Mary - I opened it, and found a dirty shirt, a pair of stockings, and two empty bottles - he said the shirt and stockings came from James (Mr. Stringer's coachman, of Enfield). for Mary, and the bottles he knew nothing of, but they did not come from James - I had them taken into custody. The officer searched Samme's box, but found nothing. Next morning we went to Ballard's premises at Enfield, with a search-warrant - he said he lived there, and his wife and family were there. I found a plated inkstand, a Delft butter-boat, and some pieces of carpet in the room his wife was in. I do not know that I had seen the inkstand for twelve months before; the carpet had been locked in the store-room, and was merely cuttings; I might not have seen them for six or eight months. Samme lived two years with us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRRICK. Q. She ran from the yard - A. No; from the anti-room into the kitchen - the door opens into the stable-yard. Ballard had come in at the kitchen gate, and the anti-room is close by. Samme had no light in her hand. The shirt and stockings were not mine, but I knew the bottles by the corks - they were empty - the marks were on when it came from the merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Barnes char at your house - A. Yes, I understand some pieces of carpet were given to her, but not these, they were smaller.</p>

He went in, and I rang the bell as a signal for my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mr. Stringer's coachman was her brother - A. No, he is an acquaintance - I know she washed his things.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Walters. I know Mrs. Walters gave Mrs. Barnes some pieces of carpet - it might be eight or ten months ago, when we were cleaning the house down - they were in the store-room - she said Mrs. Barnes might have them, or we might do as we liked with them. I remember some of these produced were among them (pointing them out).</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that that piece was was given to Barnes - A. Yes. I have seen Ballard at the house once or twice - he came about nine o'clock at night - I did not know she supplied him with provisions. I never saw the inkstand in the house - I have been there a year and ten months.</p>

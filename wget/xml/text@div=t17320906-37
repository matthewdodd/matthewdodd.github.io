            . On the 10th June, I was at Enfield-Market, and about 11 at Night, I was getting my Horse ready, at the Door of the King's-Head Inn, the Ostler stood with a Candle to light me while I put my Packs on, and while I was making them fast, the Prisoner, whom I knew very well, ( for he had been my Play-fellow) rode up to the Inn Door, upon a black Horse with a bald Face, and call'd for a Pint of Beer, he look'd full in my Face, and I in his. Before the Beer was brought, he said, he was going to Dr. Wilson's, and would return in a Moment; but he did not come back at all. Says I to some other Market Folks, there's Will Shelton come, and if we don't leave our Money, we shall all be robb'd. I had 6 l. of my Master's Money, which I left at the Inn, and took only 3 s. in my Pocket; and other People took my advice, and left their Money too; and so I and

               <p>Prisoner. I had been at Brocksburn; call'd upon Brigadier Franks, at Enfield, and then came to the King's-Head Inn, and call'd for a Pint of Beer; but recollecting that I had some Business at Dr. Wilson's, I went thither, and it being late I did not return to the Inn as I intended, but rode directly for London. The Place where they say they were robb'd is between Forty-Hill and Maiden's-Bridge, about 2 Miles and a Half from Enfield. The Road there is so narrow, that a Horse can't pass a Coach, and therefore is a very improper Place to commit a Robbery in. My Horse was Chesnut, not black, and had a small Blaze down his Face, but was not bald-fac'd. It's very unlikely that any of these Witnesses should see the Colour and Marks of my Horse so plainly in the dark, as to be able to know them.</p>

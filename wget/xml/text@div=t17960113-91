               <p>I apprehended the prisoner; the prosecutor came to my house, and said he had been robbed of his watch; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I pawned the watch with the prosecutor's leave; I had lent him two guineas; I asked him for the two guineas; he said he had not two guineas; I said, if he had not got it, I was in want of money, and he said pawn the watch; the prosecutor's chest was open, and he told me I might take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Chevrier.) Did you owe the prisoner two guineas? - A. I never knew him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe him two guineas? - A. Not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him leave to pawn your watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Gomez.) How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his character at all? - A. No; I have known the prosecutor about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any transaction between these two people about money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of his lending the prosecutor any money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they upon any terms together? - A. No further than living in the house together.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prisoner.) Is there any body here that knows you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your captain? - A. At Jamaica.</p>

               <p>He must have his things. - A. By all means; he came from Portsmouth when he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Chevrier.) Do you know what ship he belongs to? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Beare. He came over in the Ram.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gomez. He is a very sober, quiet man.</p>
               <p>Beare. I would undertake to get him a ship, and I dare say he would behave well; he has been very ill, and is ill now; he was examined when he was at the Justice's office, he is very bad, and he said he had pawned the watch to pay the doctor.</p>
               <p>(The Court ordered the Interpreter to inform the prisoner that he had been found guilty, but at the intercession of the prosecutor and the Jury, the Court intended to shew him mercy, and after a <rs id="t17960113-91-punish513" type="punishmentDescription">

            . I am a constable. I have known the prisoner a great while. I saw him at Mr. Morris's, at the gun in St. John's Street; Mr. Morris brought in a saddle, and asked the company what it was worth. On the Saturday morning following. Mr. Morris came to me, and told me, he wanted to take up the prisoner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160023"></xptr> for he was afraid of getting into a scrape by buying the saddle. We went to inquire for the prisoner in Clare-street. We found out the cellar where he lodged. We asked the wife, whether he was at home? She said, No. Morris said, Why, I want to drink a pot of beer with him. Upon which it was said he was at home, and he came up. We took him to Clapton. I was exceeding wet, and we had several ditches to get over. We begged he would not run away from us. He said he would not. He could have run away if he had thought sit. He jumped over the ditches, and then helped us over. I have kn own him a great number of years. I never heard any thing amiss of him. When I took him he said he bought the saddle of a man in a blue coat and red waistcoat coming from Highgate.</p>
               <p>- Dewett: I saw Mr. Morris buy this saddle of the prisoner; I asked the prisoner how he came by it; he said he had bought it of a man that had sold his horse. Mr. Morris gave him twelve and six-pence. He said he got but sixpence by it. I saw the saddle advertised. I went and told Mr. Morris of it.</p>

               <p>I had made a pair of shoes, and mended some shoes for a man that lives beyond Highgate. I went to him for my money, and received half a guinea. In coming back, I met a man in a blue coat and red waistcoat. He offered to sell me this saddle and bridle. Mr. Morris had spoke to me about a fortnight before to buy him a good second hand bridle, if I had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Court. Why is not Morris here?</p>
               <p>Lee. He is very ill. I heard him say he had desired the prisoner to buy him a second hand saddle.</p>

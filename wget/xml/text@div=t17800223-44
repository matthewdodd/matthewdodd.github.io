               <p>I lost a pair of sheets in September last. The prisoner was a lodger in my house; she went away about Christmas. I missed them about six weeks ago. When she went away she left the key on the bulk of the stairs. We found it about a week after. When we went into the room we missed an iron pot. The sheets were taken out of the next room to her's. </p>
               <p>How came you not to miss them sooner? - Because some people lived in the room; they went away about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>What is become of those people? - Upon my word I do not know. After they were gone I missed the sheets out of their room. I found a pawnbroker's duplicate in the room they were taken from. I went to the pawnbroker's and found them; the prisoner owned to her taking of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You are a d - d liar; I don't choose to ask her no questions, my lord.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker. I took in one of the sheets of the prisoner on the 22d of October, the other was pledged on the 17th of November. I don't know whether the lad or I took it in; the duplicate is his writing. I have known the prisoner several years; she came backward and forward.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her any questions about the sheet? - None,</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Mr. Dobree's in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did you know where she lodged? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you understand that this woman was a lodger or a house-keeper? - I never understood which she was; she was known before I came to Mr. Dobree's; they were pawned in the name of Linch.</p>
               <p>(The sheets were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>To the prosecutrix. Is there any mark upon them? - None.</p>
               <p>Can you give any reason why you know them from any other sheets? - I know the linen.</p>
               <p>These sheets were not in the prisoners room? - No; the prisoner owned to them before the justice.</p>
               <p>Was any body present besides you at the examination? - Yes; my daughter

               <p>MISS ELIZA GREEN. I live in Earl's-court Terrace, Kensington. On the 28th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, I was taking a walk in the road near <placeName id="t18171029-21-crimeloc116">Earl's-court Terrace</placeName>

I met the prisoner - never saw him before - He was walking with a hedge stick. He said he must have my money - I said I have none, and begged him to let me go. He said, "I must have your watch; "I told him I had none, and begged be let go. I was alarmed, and tried to pass him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290013"></xptr>put himself before me, and forcibly dragged my scarf from my shoulders. I took hold of one end of it, he dragged it from me. I screamed out-he went a short distance, returned, and said he would knock me down with the stick which he had in his hand, if I made any more noise - He ran off with the scarf. I followed him directly, calling out Stop thief! three persons joined in the pursuit, and he was stopped. I lost sight of him for three-quarters of an hour. I am sure he is the man, and knew the scarf to be mine which was found on him.</p>

            . I am a plumber, I met the prisoner running very fast. When he had passed me about fifty yards I heard the alarm and ran after him. In about an hour I found him lying in a very deep trench in a field. I secured him, and accused him of robbing the prosecutrix, he denied it. I asked him if he had not got the shawl? he said he had not - I found it on him; the prosecutrix claimed it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD STANHAM. I saw the crowd, and went with Hughes. The prisoner made no resistance - I secured him; he denied having the shawl on him.</p>

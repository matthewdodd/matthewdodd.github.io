               <p>Q. Where were these premises? - At the old Rotation-office, in Litchfield-street, Soho. The next morning when I came at half after five, he told me there was a bad misfortune happened, he said all the tools were gone, and that I had got a d-ned bad set, and he would work no longer there; I asked him what he meant by that? and he told me that he believed that I had a very bad set, for he had lost some of his tools among them, but as good fortune would have it, some of them he took home, and some of them he had hid under his bench that he worked at, but all the rest were gone; I told him that I should not let him go, that I thought that he was guilty of the theft, and I would have him examined, and I sent for a constable and had him taken up, the officer examined his pockets, and pulled out six duplicates, two of these duplicates were a plow and a saw, for two shillings and sixpence; I sent to his lodgings immediately, to know what sort of a character he bore, and to know what time he came home the over night; I then went to the pawnbroker's, to know whether these were my things, but they were not, nor any things that is stole.</p>

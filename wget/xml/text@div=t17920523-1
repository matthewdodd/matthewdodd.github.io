               <p>The deceased and the witnesses with myself were all drinking together, and we were very drunk, and words arose, and Dell struck me over the shoulder with the fender; my Lord, I had too great a regard for the deceased to hurt her; Dell has got up at four o'clock in the morning and left me in bed with his wife; my Lord, he went and laid with a common prostitute the very night his wife was buried, and lives with her now.</p>
               <p>PRISONER GOODALL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Please you, my Lord, we were all drinking together, and Dell and Anderson quarrelled, and Dell up with the fender and struck Anderson, that is all I know.</p>

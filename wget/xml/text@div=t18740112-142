I am a dressmaker, and live at 247, Waterloo Road—I have known the prisoner about three weeks—on Monday evening, 5th January, I met him at the corner of Wellington Street—he asked to accompany me home—he did so—he sent for something to drink, and I felt ill—I am in the habit of suffering from fits—I had a box in the room which I had opened, and showed the prisoner the things I had bought for my little girl, and then I locked it up again and put the key in the satchel—when I recovered from the fit the box had been opened and the articles were gone: a little waterproof coat, a pair of shoes, a pair of stockings, one little muff and victorine, and one satchell—they were worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went out the next evening about 10 o'clock with my landlady, to look for the prisoner—I saw him in a restaurant in Richmond Street—I told him he had stolen the things from my box—he said "Yes, he had," but he said if I would go with him to his room he would give them back to me—I told him "No, I did not want to have anything more to do with him, but if he would give them back I did not wish to do any<lb></lb>thing to him—I told him if he had pledged them to give me the ticket—he said he had not pledged them, they were in his room—I eventually gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>When did you see the church again? - On the 8th day of October, between twelve and one; between five and six in the afternoon, when I came from my business in the church, I fastened the place where the plate was kept, I locked it and bolted it, and put the key in the place where I keep my books, and I double locked the church door and left it safe.</p>

               <p>When did you see the church again? - On the next day, being Sunday morning, I went between seven and eight in order to light the fire ready for the minister, and when I came, I had the key in my hand to unlock the door, and the door was already open, and this box of the lock was forced off, then I went into the room where the minister is dressed, and found the chest where the place was kept was open.</p>

               <p>Was that chest kept locked? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had it been locked on the Saturday? - It was.</p>

               <p>When did you put up the velvet last? - I put it away the Sunday evening preceding the robbery, I put it in the usual place.</p>

               <p>I am coachman to Mr. Sandiford, I drive the casual coach to Kew Bridge, or Turnham Green, or Hammersmith, or any where, where I can get passengers, I know the prisoner Hill, I know nothing of the other.</p>

               <p>Do you remember at any time taking Hill in your coach? - No, he never was in my coach, but he rode on the box with me.</p>

               <p>When was that? - The 8th of October, between eight and nine on Saturday, he came to me in the road, I drove him to the corner of Half-moon street, I take my passengers to the farther Pack Horse at Turnham Green, and coming back the prisoner asked me if I was going to town, I said I was not, the prisoner said we will give you five shillings, he said he would give seven shillings, I said I will not, but I will drive you down to my master, and if he and you can agree for a fresh pair of horses, I have no objection, with that I staid a little and let another person in, I cannot tell who that person was, it was a very dark night, this was at Turnham Green, after that he got on the box with me, he had rather ride outside, he said he had two men to pick up and they were rather tired, and would wish to ride, with that I drove up, and three got in instead of two, and brought a bag and threw into the coach, I then drove down to Chiswick, the three that got into the coach came from the corner of a field that comes from Chiswick, that comes to Turnham Green, there is a path-way from Chiswick to Turnham Green, and it is all railed along, this was Saturday night, the 8th of October, between eight and nine, as nigh as I can think the time may be, with that the man that rode on the box with me said, how far is it, I said not a great way off, says he, I never was at Chiswick before, with that I got off the box, and my master was in the bar, and the prisoner said he would give seven shillings, says my master, it ought to be nine shillings, then my master came out, and Hill was close to me, and my master said it should be half-a-guinea, and he would not let the coach go under nine shillings, so Hill made answer and said, how much will that be a piece, and somebody that was on the inside said, how much will that be a piece, it will be my whack; then my master said, Caesar, drive into the yard, Hill went into the stable and helped me to harness the horses, because he said he was in a hurry, then I drove to Kensington and gave my horses a littl e water, then I drove to the corner of Half-moon-street, and I drove up the off-side, and they got into a hackney coach, I did not see them take the bag out of my coach and put it in the hackney coach; Hill that was on the box with me got on the box of the hackney coach, for he said, riding withinside made him sick.</p>

               <p>What became of the bag? - I do not know, I saw them open the coach door and get in, but what bag they had I did not know, I am sure I saw them put the bag into my coach.</p>

               <p>Who paid the money? - My master received the money, I cannot say who paid it.</p>

               <p>Did you drive back the same evening from Piccadilly? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you take up any body in the course of your return? - Not a soul within side, only a poor man outside that gave me a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>When you came back to Chiswick did you find anything in the coach? - No, Sir, I did not, but the next morning hearing the church was broke open, I went and looked into the coach, and found this instrument, a large chissel, at the back of the seat, quite under the seat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Are you sure that is the same you found? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the time when Chiswick church was broke open? - Not the particular time, I went on the Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>What was done when you was there? - I put on a new staple to the lock, that was all I did.</p>

               <p>Was the door examined? - I examined it, not that day, and I applied a crow.</p>

               <p>When? - It was two or three days after, I cannot be positive, the crow was given to me by my master, Mr. Hall, a carpenter.</p>

               <p>Did that instrument which you applied appear to fit the door? - It answered to every impression that was made in the door, and likewise in the door case.</p>

               <p>Were there many marks of violence? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Could you compare it exactly with the impressions? - Exactly.</p>

               <p>Which end of the crow? - Both ends, they fitted both ends in different places, it was impossible any thing could fit it more exactly.</p>

               <p>Could you distinguish the mark of another crow that was nearly the same size as this? - It fitted so nearly, I think it was impossible for the hands of man to make another to sit so near.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Could you have distinguished it from the mark that was made by a plaisterer's hammer? - No, I could not.</p>

               <p>You are clear in that? - Quite perfect in it.</p>

               <p>Was this that was delivered to you by Turner, the same that was tried at the church there? - Yes, I saw it tried, I observed that the smaller end had been put in at the top of the door first, in order to make room for something, what that was I do not know, the marks appear perfectly of the crow.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. As soon as you are appointed the old church-wardens give you the keys? - It is my first year, Wapshot had the keys, I never had them at all.</p>

               <p>Was the plate delivered to you? - Never.</p>

               <p>It continued in the old custody? - Yes, it continued in the custody of the parish clerk, by order of Mr. Wapshot, I never gave any order about it, I only saw the plate every fourth Sunday when I received the Sacrament, never at any other time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Sandiford.

               <p>Do you know either of the prisoners? - I know Abbott.</p>

               <p>Did you ever deliver a letter to him? - I cannot tell the day of the month, I believe it was in September.</p>

               <p>Should you know that letter if you was to see it? - I cannot say I should, I took very little notice of it; my husband was very ill, and I was in great distress, I know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see the inside of that letter? - No, my daughter read it to me, and put a wafer into it, and I gave it to Abbott the next morning.</p>

               <p>Should you know it if you was to see it? - No, I make no doubt but it may be the same letter.</p>

               <p>How was it directed? - Only for F. Abbott.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then that is not this letter, for this is Mr. F. Abbott.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you undertake from your sight of it, to say that is the same letter? - To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Why, good woman, may not the prisoner have had others from the same correspondent? - I make no doubt of that, it may be the same letter.</p>

               <p>Court. From your view of the letter, and your remembrance of it, do you know whether it is the same or not? - From my eye sight it is the very same letter.</p>

               <p>(The letter read signed L. Bywater, addressed F. Abbot, dated 28th September, 1785; relating to the business of Mr. Bywater.)</p>

               <p>Do you know Mr. Bywater? - Very well, he has my first floor for an office.</p>

               <p>What was Abbott to Bywater? - He was his clerk.</p>

               <p>Court. That seems to be as far as you can carry that question.</p>

               <p>Had you opened it from that Sunday, till the church was robbed? - No.</p>

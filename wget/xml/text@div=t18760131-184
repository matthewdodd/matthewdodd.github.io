                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Corke, Abbott, &amp; Co., 44 and 45, Fore Street, shirt collar, wristband, and front manufacturers—we missed property some time before January—a communication was made to us in December about a boy named Grant who we had, in consequence of which we had our premises searched in January, and a sack containing 123 dozen collars and three and a half pieces of linen was found on the private stair<lb></lb>case, where it had no right to be—we were unable to trace it further, and discharged Grant—Goods are never sold on our premises in an undressed state—on the 17th January Mr. Westaby, a collar dresser, communicated with me at the police-station, I having put the matter into the hands of the police on the 13th—Westerby produced these half a dozen pairs of Marl<lb></lb>borough wristbands and two dozen Stanley collars marked "P.S.H. Stanley to pattern 15,"which means the size; "P.S.H." denotes the firm for whom they were made—it is Edwards' duty to cut these collars—this pencil mark is his writing—every dozen we make is marked—there is also a mark on the wristbands—the collars were dressed; they were given to me as a sample only of what Westaby had received—in consequence of what Westaby said I saw Mr. Chilton—Westaby produced this document to me. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Memorandum. London Warehouse Company, Limited, to Mr. Westaby. Sir,—Please dress the collars, &amp;c., you have for us, and let me know when they are ready. R. J. Chilton. Jan. 11, 1876." Jennings communicated with us, I think, on the 17th January, and produced these two invoices: "Dec. 23rd, 1874. Mr. Jennings. Bought of W. Garnham, draper, &amp;c., 41 dozen collars at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." "Dec. 28,1875. Mr. Jennings. Bought of W.

Jennings showed me the goods, and they were mine; he produced the lot—I identify them, they are partly dressed and partly undressed—none of Jennings' goods passed through Westaby's hands—I recovered from Westaby 132 dozen of Stanley collars and 38 dozen of Marlborough wristbands, of which 96 dozen collars were undressed and 38 dozen wristbands were dressed—I recovered from Jennings altogether 72 dozen and five collars and fronts, some dressed and some undressed—I then went with Jennings and three detectives to Garnham's house, Hoxton Street, Hoxton—Jennings went in first and asked for Mr. Garnham, as he did not observe him in the back of the shop—the man pointed him out to us and said "That is Mr. Garnham. Mr. Garn<lb></lb>ham, this is the gentleman belonging to the firm I spoke to you about"—Garnham asked me to go into the back room, which I did, and said "My name is Abbott, of the firm of Corke, Abbott, &amp; Co.; I have come about some collars and fronts which you have sold to Jennings; have you any more of them?" he said that he had heard from Jennings about them the day previous, he said "I only bought these seventy-seven dozen, which I sold all to Jennings—I have no more"—I said, "Can I look over your warehouse?"he said "You see how I was occupied when you came in, leave it until 2 o'clock, I will then come down to your warehouse" I</p>

               <p>told him I could not do that—before that I asked him where he got them from, he said "I bought them of a man whom I know, but I cannot now recollect his name"—I asked him if he could find an invoice, he looked over a file, and said "I cannot find it"—I then said "Will you come with me now?" he said "No, I cannot, I am too busy "I said "I can't leave you"; he said "Do the police know anything of this, for God's sake do not put it into their hands" I said "They do know something about it" he said "For mercy's sake do not put it into their hands, I am a man with a family of seven children, I will come down to you at 2 o'clock, and will make up your loss "I said "What loss? with you at present it is seventy<lb></lb>seven dozen, but we have lost considerably over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he made no answer, and Brett almost immediately came in—the prisoner said that he had sold all he bought to Jennings, and after the police searched the premises, he said "I have bought back three dozen collars of Jennings "he called his shopman, and told him to fetch them—he was taken away in custody, and I went to Moor Lane station, and saw him there—a portion of the property I had seen in Westaby's possession, was brought in, and I identified it—Chilton came to the station, and said in the prisoner's presence that he bought of him the goods he had sold to Westaby—the prisoner made no answer that I heard—he said when the police entered his shop, that he bought the goods of Price and Chapman; and he believed it was Mr. Price, of Glover's Hall Court—we stopped there over two hours, and he searched his invoices twice or thrice over—these Marlborough. wrist<lb></lb>bands were on our premises on 5th January, they were not button-holed on the 3rd, the size and the cut correspond with thirty-nine dozen which I lost—the Stanley collars were also on our premises on 5th January; I be<lb></lb>lieve about twenty-dozen were looked out specially.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a collar dresser, of 59, Red Cross Street—on 17th January I went to Moor Lane Station and met Mr. Corke—I produced a sample of certain undressed collars and cuffs which were brought to me in a sack with "D. R. &amp; Co." on it in red letters, by a young man; and two or three days afterwards. I received this memorandum, after which I dressed thirty-six dozen of them—in consequence of certain enquiries I produced a sample of them to Mr. Corke who identified them as being stolen from him—when I received the goods in the sack I did not know where they came from—I had not had any transactions with the London Wood Street Warehouse Company for some years—the message was "They are from the Wood Street Warehouse Company, but do not touch them till you hear from them"—I did not do anything to them till I received the memorandum.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Camden Town—in, January, I was a buyer in the service of the London Warehouse Company—I have known the prisoner for a number of years, he is a draper of Hoxton Street—he has been in the habit of buying largely of the London Warehouse Company; but he has not sold to them till lately; I had one transaction with him before this of about 130 dozen gentlemen's scarves—that was early in January, shortly before this—I called on him at his shop on business two or three days previous to my sending this memorandum, and he offered me these goods which were on the floor of the little back shop—there is a doorway between, and it is up a step or two, it is stowed with goods—I said "What is the price," there were I suppose 110 or 120 dozen collars; I did not count them and he did not tell me, and about twenty dozen wristbands I guessed—he asked me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the collars, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the cuffs which I agreed to give him—I made no memorandum of the transaction, I trusted to my memory—I said "Send them to Mr. Westaby, in Red Cross Street, to be dressed"—I did not know the number, but he is as well-known in Red Cross Street, as you are in this Court—he had dressed collars for me before for my private use, instead of sending them to the washerwoman—he had not dressed collars for the company before—the goods were those which Mr. Abbott identifies—the memorandum is "January 11, 1876. Mr. Westaby. Sir,—Please dress the collars you have for us, and let me know when they are ready. "I underlined" me "that he might communicate personally with me and not with the company, because I was the buyer—I did not enter the transaction in any of the books of the company—I did not hear any more about the property till the 18th—I had not received any document whatever from the prisoner—it is unusual to buy collars by the dozen in an undressed state, but it is sometimes done; I might have a job lot—I never bought any undressed before—the invoice would be sent to the firm not to me—I should not receive any communication from Westaby.</p>

Finlay &amp; Co., of Glasgow—I sup-plied twenty-four dozen, and they were delivered "dressed "in 1875—on the 3rd January there were thirty-nine dozen short; the thirty-nine dozen were down on the 5th January—I did not see them—they had not to my knowledge been delivered—on the 13th I missed those wristbands when searching the stock, when the boy Grant was discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the 13th I knew all that I know now—the prisoner was charged before the Magistrate on the 18th—I did not then know all that I know now—I did not know that the thirty-nine dozen had not come down on the 4th—I don't recollect being asked by Mr. Gain before the Magis<lb></lb>trate, to fix the times I missed the things—my hours at the premises are from 10 to 6 o'clock—as a rule nothing is brought down until the morn<lb></lb>ing from the cutting-room—the work is taken in at night, counted over, checked, and brought down the following day—I cannot tell at what hour the things would be finished—the things are done at their own homes—they would be delivered to the forewoman in the morning—she keep a book—it it is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I have seen these thirty odd dozen Marlborough wrist<lb></lb>bands—they came down stairs on the 4th—I was present, all but two dozen, and they came down on Wednesday the 5th—these cuffs before me are what came down on the 9th—not one of this lot had been down before the 4th.</p>

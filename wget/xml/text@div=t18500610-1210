                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Linfield, a grocer and broom-dealer, at 54, Tiverton-street, Newington. On Wednesday morning, 22nd May, I was awoke, about a quarter or twenty minutes past three o'clock, by the noise of the shop shutters breaking—I looked out of the bedroom window and saw a hat go in at the shop window—I got a light, and in about five minutes went down-stairs into the shop—I found the window and shutters open, which I had left safe about eleven over night, and saw the prisoner lying down behind the counter—I said, "Man, what do you do here?"—he made no answer, and never moved—he was very tipsy indeed—I called my husband, who got a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

On the 12th of November I was at the Coach and Horses public-house, Shadwell, and saw the prisoner there about seven o'clock in the morning - I spoke to her, but went no where with her, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this; is it your writing? A. Yes; (looking at his deposition) I signed this; but on my oath I went no where with her - she took my watch from me in the street - I do not know in what street - it was a quarter of a mile from the public-house; she had walked after me, but not with me; she took my watch in an alley, and I ran after her - it was produced before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take me to the Coach and Horses, and give me a glass of spirits? A. I believe I did treat her - I received the watch-chain from the landlord of the Coach and Horses.</p>

I am a waiter at the Coach and Horses - I found a watch, chain, seal, and key, under a seat where the prisoner had sat with another woman and boy, on the 12th of November, about four o'clock; I saw the prosecutor with her, between seven and eight o'clock that morning; he was not sober; he had been in the house the night before; my master took his watch, and returned it to him in the morning; the prisoner came in at three o'clock with another woman and a boy, and had a pint of beer; she told my master she was charged with stealing the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had spent the evening with her, and given her the watch.</p>

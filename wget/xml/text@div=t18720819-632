                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 11, Suffolk Court, Harrow Street, St. George's, Southwark—on Saturday night, or Sunday morning, 2nd June, between half-past 12 and 1 o'clock, I was up stairs in my own room, my wife came down as I went up—we had had a quarrel previous to that, between 8 and 9 o'clock—when my wife went down between 12 and 1 o'clock she sat on the staircase at the foot—she was alluding to some con<lb></lb>versation regarding another woman, not the prisoner—I put my head out of window and saw the prisoner come down the court—she had no bonnet on—she passed my door, and returned back and said to my wife "Mrs. Walsh, are you alluding your conversation to me?"—she said "Yes, Mrs. Green; if the cap fits you, you can wear it"—the prisoner said "You dirty old dusthole ranger, I think myself superior to you"—that was because my wife works at a dust heap—with that I could not swear whether the pri<lb></lb>soner came in or my wife went out, but as I stooped down I saw my wife take hold of Mrs. Green round the body; Mrs. Green up with her hand and struck my wife a blow with her fist, my wife fell back, and brought Mrs. Green down with her, on the top of her—I put on my boots and ran down stairs, and met my wife coming back from Mrs. Green's door, and as I met her she lay down along the wall of the next house—I went up to the prisoner's house, and met her in charge of a constable—I said "I charge you with assaulting my wife"—she made no reply—she was taken to the station, and my wife Was taken to the hospital—she was covered all over with blood—the doctor attended to her, and I brought her back the same evening—her wounds were dressed, and I led her home—she did not get better, and went to the hospital again on the same Sunday afternoon—she did not stay there—on the Tuesday she got worse, and died on Saturday, 6th July, but she said she would forgive Mrs. Green—I called in a doctor on the Friday—she dressed the wound herself—it was on the left temple, about three quarters of an inch long—it continued running; part of it healed, but the other part kept discharging—my wife had not been injured by any one else—in the afternoon she was not sober, and I shoved her down the court, and she fell down; I put my foot like that, and she fell against the window ledge, and the back of her head got scraped against it—I am quite sure she fell on her back—she was taken up by her own brother, and one of the witnesses brought her up stairs—the skin was a little scraped at the back—the doctor examined that at the hospital, and said it was of no avail.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had quarrelled with my wife on occasions; not to any extent—I had to bring her to order—I did not do that by knocking her about—I was not drunk on this day—I did not knock her down; I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her with my hand—I am sure the doctor saw the wound at the back of her head; I showed it to him myself—I did not kick my wife; I only put my foot like that, to tell her to get up and go indoors—I did not use any violence—I was not having words with my wife at the time I saw Mrs. Green; it was previous to then, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I had not seen my wife after that for four hours—I had been to a beershop till 12 o'clock, and then I went up to my room—I saw the blow struck by Mrs. Green with her fist—I did not see her take up anything—she might have got it up before I came down—I saw the whole transaction from the window—my daughter was down stairs—I saw her when I went down, after my wife had</p>

               <p>been struck—there was a little blood from the wound at the back of my wife's head, which I caused in the afternoon; but from this wound in the forehead she was covered all over—she kept on her work from 2nd June to 2nd July, but not so carefully as she did previously—I am not aware of any quarrel between those dates—I was at the Gladstone Arms on the Monday following the blow, with my wife and <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Driscoll—we were not all three quarrelling there—I and Driscoll had a few words, and wanted to fight; it was all over in three minutes—my wife had nothing to do with it—she was not drinking there; she might have had a glass of beer—I have not had any conversation with my daughter about the case—I did not knock my wife down flat on the ground on this afternoon, and use my foot to her three distinct times—I don't know a Mr. Butcher or Mrs. Martin—I know that man (Butcher), but not by name—my wife did not rush out against Mrs. Green and tread on her dress, nor did they both trip up and fall on the ground—my wife was in liquor between 8 and 9 o'clock, but at this time she was sober.</p>

I am the daughter of the last witness—on 2nd June, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, I was standing in the passage, just at the step of the door, with my mother, outside the house—I was asking my mother for a half-penny—she called me a little b—h—the prisoner was coining down the court at the time, and she said "Mrs. Walsh, are you alluding to me?"—my mother said "If the cap fits you, wear it"—she said to my mother "Go on, you dirty dusthole-ranger"—my mother said "If I am a dirty dusthole-ranger, you are very glad to burn my hard sweat," meaning the cinders she brought home from the dust-yard, and which Mrs. Green used to burn—Mrs. Green then runs to the gutter, and picks up a stone—I partly guess it was a stone, because there is nothing there but stones—against Mrs. Green's gate there is a pile of bricks, but she did not go so far as that—eye had the stone in her right hand and she hit my mother on the left side of her forehead, and said "Take that, you dirty dusthole-ranger"—my mother fell, and Mrs. Green fell on the top of her—I did not see Mrs. Green do anything else to her—she ran into her passage—my mother's face was covered all over with blood—they had a struggle on the ground—I partly think when Mrs. Green was on the top of my mother, that she was trying to use her fist again at my mother—I saw my father up stairs, looking out of the window—he put on his boots and came down, and ran for a constable—I ran for one, but could not see one—I was living in the house with my mother till she died—there was a little scratch on the back of her head; not much—I was present when that was done, between 7 and 8 o'clock—my father <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her; she fell down, and her head knocked against Mrs. Maddigan's window-ledge—she fell on her back—I did not see my father do anything while she was on the ground—Mrs. Mitchell lifted her up, and there was a little scratch at the back of her bead; it bled, but not much—when Mrs. Green struck her there was such a lot of blood that mother was covered with it; it was on the face.</p>

On the 1st of January I went to my workshop, about half-past twelve o'clock, and found the place in confusion - sixteen hats, which had been safe the night before, were gone - I likewise lost a bag. In consequence of what I heard I went to White's house, and saw his mother, but he was not there. When his mother saw me on the Saturday she said he should tell me all about the robbery; I went again, and then saw the prisoner in the kitchen - he said, if I came with any pig man he would knock my head off, but as I came alone he would tell me. I had not said anything to induce him to tell me; I had given the mother 6 d. to get some gin, but she did not have it till it was all done. I asked him who the parties were, and he said if I wanted to know that, he would not tell me anything - he then said they were sold to Philips, in Windmill-street, and went with me; he did not tell me that he was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The information was not true; you did not find any hats there? A. No; I had given a quartern and a half of gin, between me, his mother, and him.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 6th of June, between six and seven o'clock, I went to the City of London public-house to meet a man who owed me 2s. 9d., but he was not there according to promise - I saw a man named Spencer there; he said, "I have not seen you for a length of time, will you stand a treat?" I said, "I am sorry I cannot - I have not one farthing in my pocket, but if you will wait a quarter of an hour, I will go to a little deposit I have in the dust-hole and stand 1s. treat;" the prisoner was standing on one side the table, and he said, "I shall accompany this fellow as far as his lodging, he shall not cut away" - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080046"></xptr>kept by my side; I said I would rather go alone, but he went on with me - I opened my street door and said, "I can dispense with you," but he would go with me to the dust-hole; I took a stick, and was picking away the dirt - he stood by my side, and he saw the money before I did; he gave me a push, and I fell on my elbow - he then snatched up the money; I caught hold of his coat, and he went to pull off his coat - I caught him by the neck, and pulled him down into our cellar, where a man sleeps, and gave him into his custody; I went, fetched an officer, and said, "He is in the cellar" - he came down, and Mr. King, the brush-maker, opened the door and let the prisoner into the yard; he denied having any money belonging to me or any body else - the officer took from him 11s. 6d. and three halfpence all over the dirt; Spencer had got me work when I was out of employ - the prisoner is a <rs id="t18300708-83-deflabel476" type="occupation">tailor</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you keep your meat in the dust-hole? A. No - I had seen the prisoner once at the public-house; I was perfectly sober - I was not two minutes at the dust-hole; Mr. King and his apprentice were in bed in the cellar - I did not go and could not find the money, and then go to the bed-room of two men and say, "Have either of you taken my money from the dust-hole?" I never saw the two men in bed till I took the prisoner down for them to take care of him - I charged him with stealing 12s. in shillings; he had not that on him - I had been in bed that night; I never laid a hand on him till he took and grabbed up my money - I had bought a quarter of a pound of corn beef at the cook-shop, and there was one shilling I could swear to.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DRANE. I am a Policeman. The prosecutor came to me; I went with him to Carnaby-street - he said the prisoner had robbed him of 12s., which he had in the dust-hole; I said, "Where is the man?" he said, "He is below in the kitchen;" I went, and he was there with the landlord and the boy - he said he had no money but what was his own; I searched him, found 11s. 6d. and 1 1/2d., and a little cinder dirt in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bragg, a chair—maker, of Bacon-street, Bethnal-green. I have known the prisoner five or six years, he was in the habit of coming to our house—on Thursday, 19th June, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door talking to William Slater, who lodges up-stairs—the prisoner came across the road to me and asked me if my husband was at home, I told him he was not—he told me to come inside, he wished to speak to me—I followed him into the front-room on the ground-floor—there was no one else there—the door was open—he told me he had heard my sister was coming home in six weeks, and I had not told him, but my husband had—there was an attachment on his part to my sitter—he would have paid his addresses to her if she would have allowed it—when he said I had not told him, he appeared very angry, and I noticed he had in his hand an open pocket—knife, which he carried with him—I did not see him open it—I judged from his tone and manner that he was angry, and he came in roughly—I went up to him and told him not to make himself silly in my place—I tried to get the knife from him—I caught hold of his arm as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070076"></xptr>
               <p>well as I could, and he took hold of my right shoulder with his left hand—he had the knife in his right hand, and I received a blow on my left side, just under the arm—I told him I thought I was hurt—he did not make any reply—he left the room, went into the back-room, and I heard him fall—I went after him and found him lying on the shavings—I called a lodger down, and in about ten minutes Ellen Slater came down—the prisoner was then standing at the back window in the room he had gone into, and I was sitting on a chair—I felt my clothes getting stiff—I took them off, and found I was stabbed under my arm, in the same place where I received the blow from the prisoner—after a little time I felt very faint—there was not a great deal of blood—my stays were cut through—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there till the examination before the Magistrate—I had never had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at Mrs. Braggs'—I was talking with her at the street—door—I saw the prisoner come over the road, from the public—house—he said to her, "Is <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> at home?" meaning her husband; she said, "No"—he said, "Where is he?"—she replied, "You know where he is as well as I do"—he said, "Come in here, I want to speak to you"—he went into the front—room on the ground—floor, and she followed him in—one of my children asked me to take her up—stairs to bed—I did not go up—stairs immediately; I stood two or three minutes at the street—door, which is about four feet from the door of the room—soon after the prisoner and Mrs. Bragg went into the room, I heard her exclaim, "Oh! oh!"—I then went up-stairs—when I saw the prisoner go into the room, I noticed he had both his hands in his coat—pockets—he walked very steadfastly over the road—he might have been a little elevated—he did not appear intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 53, St. John's Wood Terrace. On Saturday night, the 12th June, I went to bed at 11 o'clock—my daughter went to bed at the same time—we were the last persons up—the doors and windows were all fast, except one window, which was twenty-two feet high—on Sunday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was awoke by a cry of "Thieves!" from my daughter—I jumped out of bed and pursued them, crying, "Stop thief," but did not see the prisoners till they were taken in custody, nearly half a mile off—Matthews was brought back first, with this silver tankard, and Jones a few minutes afterwards.</p>

On this Sunday morning, I was awoke by a noise on the stairs, opposite my bedroom door—I got up, and saw Matthews leaving the dining room—I rushed after him, crying, "Thieves!"—he went out by the front door into the garden—I continued to follow him until my father came—I saw Jones in the garden; they both ran—I know this tankard; it was safe on the sideboard the evening before, in the room in which I saw Matthews—I missed the sugar tongs, sugar spoon, mustard spoon, and salt spoon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my father's property.</p>

Having thus chastized the Coachman, Mr. Doughty went from him into the Court-yard and shut the door after him; but the Coachman not yet satisfied, followed, and clapping his foot to the door, pusht it open: then Mr. Doughty drew his Sword, and gave him several wounds; one Witness seemed to say, Mr. Hambletons Sword was also drawn, but the rest did not see any such thing; but 'twas proved, that the poor man being down, after he had received some wounds, begged very heartily for his Life that he would not kill him, crying out he was wounded; whereupon Doughty desisting from his fury, some people took him up, and opening his Doublet, found abundance of Blood: he had below the left pap a large wound, and as was supposed deep, being run into the Body; but the Witnesses for the Prisoner represented it as onely superficial, that the Rapier glanc'd along on the Ribs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16800707004"></xptr>and so made very little penetration; he was likewise wounded in the Thigh, and on the Nose, and forehead, and a Cut on the hand. Perceiving him in this desperate condition, Doughty presently caused him to be carried to a Surgeon, and all the care imaginable to be taken for him, that he should want nothing necessary for Diet or Cure. The Wounds were given <rs id="t16800707-8-cd47" type="crimeDate">10 April</rs>

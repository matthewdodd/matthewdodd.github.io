                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 94). On the afternoon of 10th September, about 4 o'clock, I was in Fore-street, and saw the prisoner carrying this bale of goods on his shoulder—I asked what he had got carrying there—he said he hardly knew—I asked where he was going to take it—he hesitated for a moment, and said, "To Blackfriars-bridge:"—I said, "Where have you brought it from?"—he said, "I brought it out of Wood-street;"—I said, "Where in Wood-street?"—he said, "I do not know, some man gave it me there to carry"—I was not satisfied with his account and took him to the station, and found the bale contained this property—it is directed to Tweedale and Sons, Wood-street—I found these four memorandum books on the prisoner.</p>

I know Messrs. Tweedale's yard, it is an open yard in the day time—this was about 4 o'clock—he was walking by himself—he made no attempt to get away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Jacob Tweedale and others, 56, Wood-street, flannel manufacturers. This truss produced by the officer, belongs to them, it was brought to our premises about half-past 2 o'clock, or from that to 3, on 10th September, by the South Eastern Railway Van—it was placed just inside the doors up the gateway—I saw it there about 3 o'clock, or a quarter past—I did not see the prisoner there at all—the goods are worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you not know that the prisoner gets his living by carrying things from the steam-boats? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I know nothing of him whatever—I have men under me, but there was no one there at the time the bale was taken away—I had just gone next door, which is an empty house—the bale could not be seen from the Street, because I put it behind the door; any one coming up the yard, would have to walk right in before they could see it—people coming to make inquiries, would go to the front entrance, and not come up the yard; sometimes they may come that way; there is only one porter employed there besides myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he request you to be present at any time or place - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information which you afterwards received, did you attend at <placeName id="t18210411-29-crimeloc182">Chalk Farm</placeName>

I did, at the request of Mr. Patmore - my pupil, Mr. Morris, went with me. On arriving at the end of the lane leading to Chalk Farm, about eight or half-past eight o'clock, we went towards the fields - it was moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you arrived at the spot you afterwards reached, did you hear the report of a pistol - A. I did not; I reached the top of the hill, and saw four gentlemen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110016"></xptr>in the neighbouring field, two of them were walking back wards, and the two others by the side of the hedge, between the bill and the field. I heard the knocking of pistols, the priming of pistols, and the shutting of the pan - soon after shots were exchanged.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean - A. Both pistols were fired. I heard the sound, and saw the flash; I then heard an exclamation from one of the gentlemen on the ground, as if wounded. I got over the hedge, and found Mr. Scott on his knees, on the ground - he pointed out to me that he was wounded on the right side - the other gentlemen were supporting him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between them - A. Not till I had examined Mr. Scott. I partly undressed him, and examined the wound - Mr. Scott was fainting. One of the gentlemen came up to him, and took him by hand - I cannot say which gentleman it was; he expressed a wish that he had himself been in his situation rather that Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. On Mr. Scott's recovery, did he say any thing - A. He addressed those around him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Whatever may be the result of this case, I beg you all to bear in remembrance that every thing has been fair and honourable." During the time I was making further examination of the wound, an altercation commenced between two other gentlemen on the ground, one of them was Mr. Patmore. I am not at all acquainted with the person of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state what passed - A. I did not distinctly hear the whole of the conversation. I heard Mr. Patmore exclaim,</p>
               <p>"Then why was it not communicated to me - I knew nothing of it." During the altercation between the other two, the third, which was the person who first addressed Mr. Scott, came up and enquired what I thought of the wound, whether I regarded it as fatal. Mr. Scott was at that time in a state of fainting. I replied,</p>
               <p>"That conceiving the ball to have perforated the cavity of the abdomen, I feared it was mortal." The gentleman was in great agony, wringing his hands, and exclaimed, in words, as nearly as I can recollect,</p>
               <p>"Good God, why was I permitted to fire a second time, I fired down the field, and could do no more." I cannot recollect any thing else that passed on the spot. I had examined the wound on his recovery from fainting. I thought it best that he should be removed to town, gave orders to that effect, and went to prepare for his reception. I saw him again next day, and every day till his death. In my judgment the wound was the cause of his death. He was not brought to London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. You mentioned that the gentleman said, Good God, &amp;c. did he not add,</p>
               <p>"When I fired down the field, the first time I was compelled to fire in my own defence" - A. He said words to that effect, but the precise words I cannot state. He appeared in the greatest agony that a man could; the attention that all the gentlemen paid to the deceased was all that kind and humane friends could do - it was as great as it possibly could be. I placed him on the shutter, and the gentlemen conveyed him down the field to the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I observe in your deposition you mentioned the gentlemens' names, had you any knowledge of either of them - A. I had not; the night, though moonlight, was particularly foggy. I stated their names from what I understood. On my oath, I have no knowledge of either of the two persons in the field.</p>

             MORRIS. I am pupil to Mr. Pettigrew. I accompanied him to Chalk farm. As we went towards the bill I distinctly heard the report of a pistol - I only heard one sound; I went to the spot from whence it came, and reached the hedge before Mr. Pettigrew, but not the spot in question, till after. I pursued a tract by the side of the hedge, Mr. Pettigrew went on an eminence - I did not arrive on the spot until after him; I heard a noise, like the ramming of pistols, and saw two heads above the hedge; I ascended the hill, and observed two gentlemen at a distance presenting a pistol at each other; at that moment they fired, and the gentleman nearest to me on the left, fell on his knees - I assisted to raise him up with Mr. Pettigrew, and Mr. Pettigrew examined his wound; a gentleman came up at that time, took Mr. Scott's hand, and exclaimed, that he wished he was in Mr. Scott's situation - I should not know that gentleman again, I am certain of it. A conversation ensued between two gentlemen, one of whom was Mr. Patmore, the other I do not know. Mr. Pettigrew ordered me to run and get the postchaise brought up; I brought the chaise - I had to pass the farm, and was there stopped. I remained there sometime, then returned, and found them bringing the deceased on a shutter - there were four or five bringing him - I cannot say who they were; I can only recognize one, and that is Mr. Christie; I recognize him as having been in the room at the house after Mr. Scott was brought in - he must have accompanied Mr. Scott on the shutter; I cannot say whether he was one of the gentlemen in the field. I attended Mr. Scott till further assistance came.</p>

            . I am the landlord of Chalk Farm tavern. On the evening this affair happened, about a quarter past nine o'clock, two gentlemen called, and had a bottle of wine in the parlour. I should not know them again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they disguised - A. No, my Lord; I did not go into the parlour while they were there. I did not serve them.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Very little of the wine was drank - A. Oh, yes; near two-thirds of it; they went away, and went down the lane, towards the Hampstead road, which is the main road to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect after this an alarm being given of an accident happening - A. Yes, it was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the two gentlemen left - Smith, Rutherford, and I think Ryan, the hostler, were in my house at this time; I desired them to take a shutter to assist the gentlemen - the wounded gentleman was afterwards brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any persons accompany him, who had been at your house before. - A. I cannot say whether either of them were the two who had the wine, I remember that these gentlemen, the prisoners, were two who accompanied Mr. Scott into my house, and stopped to assist in getting him into bed, and Mr. Christie soon after went away. They most certainly conducted themselves with the greatest humanity towards Mr. Scott. Mr. Traile went away I think in an hour or more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear an alarm of an accident in the field. - A. Yes, it might be a quarter of an hour after. I went to the field with a shutter; I found Mr. Scott there, and four or five more gentlemen stood together about thirty yards off, I called to them, they came up directly, I put him on a shutter with their assistance, he was taken to Chalk Farm, one or two of the gentlemen held his feet, and I had hold of his shoulder; we conveyed him to the Farm, the gentlemen I found in the field all went with me. I believe every one went into the house.</p>

            . I am a physician, and reside in Brunswick-square. I was called on by Mrs. Scott, to attend Mr. Scott, between twelve and one o'clock on Saturday, in the middle of the night. Mr. Scott's Christian name was John. I found him suffering from the wound he had received; he was sensible, he was certainly in great danger. I communicated my opinion to him, he asked if his wound was necessarily mortal - he was told that it was not necessarily mortal, but it was next to that; he was informed that it was just possible, that his intestines had not been perforated by the ball, in which case there might be a recovery, otherwise there was little hope.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The enquiry now is directed particularly to the communication made to him, not to the opinion you formed. - A. I communicated to him, that it was possible the ball might have passed, without perforating the intestines, in which case, a recovery was possible; he afterwards enquired of Mr. Guthrie, the surgeon, in my presence, his words as near as I can recollect were</p>
               <p>"I have only one question to ask, is my wound necessarily mortal?" Mr. Guthrie answered not necessarily (this was before the ball was extracted). Mr. Guthrie added, that it was a case necessarily of the greatest danger, but he had seen a recovery from similar wounds. Mr. Scott replied</p>
               <p>"I am satisfied," and laid down.</p>
               <p>Q. He had raised himself up then. - A. He had just raised himself up from the pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any further communication made by yourself or Mr. Guthrie, to Mr. Scott, as to the condition he was in. - A. To the best of my knowledge not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some conversation with Mr. Scott, on the subject of what passed in the field. - A. After that I had - he made a statement on that subject to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the statement made immediately after your conversation, or subsequent. - A. My conversation to him was when I first called to see him, and on my visit next morning, he made the statement to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any further conversation relating to the danger of his situation. - A. Nothing that I know of, this was on Saturday - the ball was extracted on Sunday.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that Mr. Scott's statement could not be given in evidence, as it was uncertain that he considered himself at the point of death.</p>
               <p>MR. CHRISTIE. My counsel will call some witnesses who will say, whether through life, from my habits or character, I am likely to have committed murder.</p>
               <p>MR. TRAILL. I am represented by two gentlemen far more experienced than myself, who I shall leave it to.</p>
               <p>(A numerous body of most respectable witnesses gave both the gentlemen an unusually excellent character, for humanity and good temper through life.</p>

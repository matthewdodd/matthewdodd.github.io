                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer in High Street, Staines—on Monday, 17th December, the prisoner came to my shop with a person re<lb></lb>presented to me as Major Lawrence—the prisoner ordered some furniture of me—he said he had taken a house for three years that was occupied by Mr. Kelshara, in Gresham Road, Staines, and wanted me to furnish three rooms—he chose certain articles, and told me the terms would be cash on delivery—Lawrence stood in the background, he looked at the furniture and remarked about the prices, and said some things were cheap—he represented himself as the prisoner's uncle—he asked me which was the best hotel to go to, as he wanted some refreshment—I suppose they were there about an hour or an hour and a half, but they were in such a hurry to get away that I omitted to ask for a reference—the first part of the furniture was to be furnished by Monday, 24th December—Coleman did not give me an address that day—on the 19th he came again—I asked if he had received my two letters and trade almanack (I had written to him on the evening of the 17th, to 14, De Beauvoir Road, Dal<lb></lb>ston, and I went there on the 18th, but did not see Coleman)—he said, no, he had been to Brighton, as his wife was very ill there—I told him the letters were about some furniture that I could not get, and also asking for a reference—he said he thought I should not require a re<lb></lb>ference,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250026"></xptr>
               <p>as the terms would be cash—I said, as the order would be about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I should require a reference, and ho then gave me as a reference the Reverend Alfred Stokes, the Rectory, Hatfield—I made a memo<lb></lb>randum of it at the time—I showed him some designs of couches and chairs, and he chose them, and he also made some alterations in the car<lb></lb>tains—he was alone on that occasion—he then left—I went to the station, for the purpose of going to town to go to Hatfield, I overtook the pri<lb></lb>soner on the way and got into the same carriage with him—on the way I took out a time-table and opened it for the Great Northern, and I asked him if he knew Welling, near Hatfield—he said, "No;" and he said the Hatfield he had given me was not that Hatfield; it was Hat<lb></lb>field, near Doncaster, and I made a note of that in my pocket-book—when I came to town I wrote a letter, directed to the Reverend Alfred Stokes, the Rectory, Hatfield, near Doncaster, and posted it at the General Post Office—on the 23rd I received an answer—I believed it to be true, and that it came from the Rev. Alfred Stokes—after receiving that letter I proceeded to execute the order at once—I had seen Lawrence on 21st or 22nd at the house in Gresham Road with the prisoner—Lawrence spoke about my letters, and said he thought I was rather sharp in writing respecting the reference, as I might have offended many gentle<lb></lb>men, the terms being cash, and they would come down and settle as soon as the order was completed, which would be on the 24th—he spoke then of being a large landowner in the north of England, also that he was trustee of Mrs. Coleman, and that she would come into a large fortune; he spoke to Coleman about altering the stone staircase at the side of the house, and also about having a coach-house and stable built—I saw Sophia Knott; she came to Staines about the 20th or 21st, and I saw her most days after that until the 28th, she was acting as servant; she came down to look after the house, light fires, and sweep the house and look after the furni<lb></lb>ture—on Monday, the 24th, Lawrence came to look over the furniture; Coleman was not with him then—on Wednesday, 26th December, Cole<lb></lb>man introduced me to a lady as Mrs. Coleman—she came down to look at the furniture, and she seemed satisfied with it—part of it had then been moved into the house in Gresham Road; some was moved in on 24th, some on 26th, and we finished moving in on 28th—a workman, named Alexander, was attending to my business—by the 28th about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture was delivered—on the 29th, in consequence of information, I went there and found all my furniture gone, and the people as well—I at once com<lb></lb>municated with the police—on 31st January I received a telegram, and went with the police to 2, Blantyre Street, Chelsea—I went in and there saw Sophia Knott; she was then acting, not as servant, but more as the lady of the house, she had all the keys of the house, and was dressed as the mistress, in a silk dress, a gold chain, and jewellery; she acted the part of mistress, she showed us over the house, and showed us the furniture—Mrs. Coleman had just been confined—I identified part of the furniture as mine, I should think 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—Knott pointed out the different articles, and said, "This is your furniture," and "That is your bed," and so on—while I was there the prisoner came in, about eleven at night, or half-past, I was in the parlour—the sergeant asked me if that was William Coleman—I said, "Yes"—he said his name was Wood—I am quite sure he is the man that ordered the furniture of me—I gave hin into custody—I did not give his wife into custody—I don't know what became of Sophia Knott, she was in the house all the while we were there;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250027"></xptr>
               <p>I don't know what became of her afterwards—on that same day, 31st January, I went to the house of a furniture dealer at Chelsea, named West, and saw about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of my furniture that I had supplied to the house at Staines; that remains there now—the police took possession of that in Blantyre Street—that does not make up all the furniture I supplied, the damask curtains were gone and two or three small things.</p>

Q.</hi> On what day did the prisoner first call on you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 13th, but the 17th was the first time I saw him—Mr. Webb was described to me as the landlord of the house—the prisoner gave me the order for the goods on the 17th for three rooms, not for the whole house—he said he had taken the house—I did not ask him for a reference till the 19th—I showed him designs on the 17th and 19th, and he chose some from both—Mr. Kelsham gave me Coleman's address as 14, De Beauvoir Road—Coleman also gave me that address afterwards, on the 19th, I think in my shop—two of my men went to the house on the 17th to take measurements, and we commenced putting in the furniture on the 24th; we were pressed for time, in consequence of Mrs. Coleman being likely to be put to bed—I recognised the furniture again when I saw it in Blantyre Street, some of it had been altered, some was my own make, and some I had ordered from the manufacturer—I should not have sup<lb></lb>plied the goods ordered on the 17th without a reference, because I wrote on the 17th for a reference—the prisoner told me had not received the letters, but I saw my trade almanack that I had sent to him there, in the kitchen at Blantyre Street—I send those to my customers; I may have given him one at my shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Nash—on 17th December I went to the house in Gresham Road to measure for blinds—no one was in the house then, it was open—I went again on Wednesday, the 19th, no one was there then—I made some other measurements—I went again on the 20th to measure and cut out carpets, and took them away to be made—I went again on the 21st to take some rollers, and again on 22nd to put up some roller blinds—I can't exactly say the day I first saw the servant, Sophia Knott—she occupied a room at the top of the house—she went up there and locked herself in at different times while I was at work there—I saw the prisoner there on the 17th with Mr. Nash, he was there nearly every day after the servant came, looking at the work, the servant generally let him in, and they went up stairs together to the top attic and talked together; they did that most every time he came, and they remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I was at work there nearly every day up to the 28th—the prisoner came down that evening by the five o'clock train—the furniture was delivered first on the 24th, and was finished on the 28th—I left between four and five on the 28th, and I met the prisoner outside the house—I saw Lawrence there three or four times; he did most of the active part in looking over the work I was doing, he did not say much to me—I saw part of the furniture before the Magistrate last Monday, it was the same that had been delivered at the houge at Staines—some of it is now outside the Court.</p>

On 29th December I received information of the removal of this furniture, and tried to find the prisoner Lawrence, and Knott—I got warrants—I could not learn anything of them until 31st January—on that day I went with Mr. Nash to Blantyre Street—I was in plain clothes—I directed the door to be knocked at—it was answered from the area door—after being answered a second time in the same way I caused a constable to get over the railings, and when the door was opened again he got an entrance—I went in and saw Sophia Knott—I went over the house with Mr. Nash, and he identified his furniture—Mrs. Coleman was in a room there—she had been recently confined—while I was there two men and a woman came to the house—the woman went up stairs and spoke to Mrs. Coleman, and remained there some time—about half-past eleven the prisoner came home—he let himself in by a latch-key—I was standing in the passage—he was followed in by police constable Randall—I told him to step into the parlour, and I then asked Mr. Nash if he identified him—he said, "Yes, that is the man representing himself to be William Coleman, at Staines"—I asked him if that was his name—he said no, his name was Wood—I told him I had a warrant for him in the name of Coleman, and I read the principal part of it to him, relating to obtaining the goods, and conspiring with others to obtain them—I then took him to the station—he said he was made a dupe of by the other man—Sophia Knott was left in the house—I did not take her—I had no warrant against her then—I saw her there next day also—on 4th February, after the remand, as I was taking the prisoner to the House of Detention, he said, "What do you think they will do with me?"—I said I thought they would commit him for trial—he said, "What a fool I must be to be made a dupe of by that man!"—I said, "Do you mean the man that represented him<lb></lb>self to be Lawrence, at Staines?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him he ought to tell me where I could find him, so that the innocent might not suffer for the guilty—he said, "I should like to, if I knew where he was"—he said he was merely acting as his agent—I found this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the parlour at Blantyre Street—on 31st December I went with Mr. Nash to De Beauvoir Road, Dalaton—the house was then empty—I went to Hat<lb></lb>field, near Doncaster—I found no such person as the Rev. Mr. Stokes there.</p>

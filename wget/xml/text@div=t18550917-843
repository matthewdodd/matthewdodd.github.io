                  </hi>. I am an attendant at Hampton Court Palace. It is my duty to attend in the withdrawing room—that is a place where articles are placed, to see which the public are admitted by permission of the Queen—there is a model in that room of the Palace of Moorshelabad at Bengal—it is very large—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a drawing</hi>) this correctly represents the rear and portico of it—it is an object of curiosity, and is kept there as such—on 20th Aug., between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in a small room adjoining the withdrawing room, having my dinner—I heard some footsteps in the withdrawing room, and opened the door—I had a very good sight of the model—I saw only one person near it; that was the prisoner—he walked up to the model, and put his hand on a piece of the wire which represents the balcony railing of the palace, and felt it—he took his hand off, and then put it on again directly, and pulled the piece of wire</p>

               <p>from between the columns, and put it into Ms pocket—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was between four and five feet from the ground—his arm was about level with it—he put it into his pocket, and walked away—I put on my hat, and walked quickly after him—he went down the stairs, into the quadrangle before I overtook him—he walked down by himself—there was no person with him—there were some persons talking to him—I stopped him in the yard, and told him I wanted him—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For breaking a piece of the railing off the model; you have got it in your pocket; give it to me; if you don't, I shall take it from you"—he put his hand into his pocket, took it out, and said, "Is this it?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I found it lying on the boards"—I said he must go before the superintendent of the Palace, I had nothing more to do with it—he was then given into custody—I am sure this piece of wire was not lying on the boards; it was fastened to the model, and was torn from it—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon before this happened had you seen the model, to look at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps half an hour; in fact, I had passed it as I was going in to have my dinner, which was much less than that—I am sure the railing was perfectly safe then—it is a very small portion—the model has been there many years—perhaps there had been 500 persons in the room during the morning—there was nothing strange about the prisoner being there—this railing formed a portion of the model—I was in the small dining room—the door was shut until I opened it, on hearing some one walking along, and looked through to see who it was—I saw him put his hand twice to the model—he did not take it the first time—he had not been looking at it before—he was feeling it when I opened the door—he had not been there half a minute—I think it would come away very easily if touched—there were other persons in the room at the time, but nobody could see him do it but myself, because this was the back part of the model—it has a very long front to it, and the prisoner was there by himself—a person standing in front could not see what was done at the back—I think he was intoxicated—he was not drunk at the time he did it—I certainly think he had been drinking, but he was not drunk then, he was very soon after<lb></lb>wards—I am sure he had been drinking—when I spoke to him he appeared quite intoxicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went up to him, and charged him with this offence, he presented the appearance of being drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—he did not present the same appearance up stairs—he had no opportunity of drinking anything in the mean time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were looking through the door, could you see his hand go on to the wire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very plainly—I saw his hand go twice to it—he did not shake it; he merely felt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he appear to have been smoking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, he did not smell of smoke.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was this fastened <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With white lead, I think—the points at the bottom are put into little holes made on purpose.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 138). The prisoner was given into my custody—I took him back to the room in which the model was, and fitted the wire to it—he said nothing at that time—he had the appearance of having been drinking—I should say it was not entirely assumed—I have no doubt he had been drinking—I asked him who he was; he made no reply at the time—in conveying him to the House of Detention, he wrote his wife's name and address in my pocket book—this is it—"Mrs. Howse,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185509170003"></xptr>
               <p>15, New-place, Limehouse"—I found that to be his correct address—he said he worked with Mr. Scapes, at the galvanised iron works, Commercial-road, and that the works were in Copenhagen-place—he also gave his mas<lb></lb>ters office address; I found that correct—he asked me what punishment I thought he would get; I said I could not tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. His friends came round him directly you had charge of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they seemed very decent, respectable people—I was not obliged to hold him up as we went along; he leant on a friend's arm—he was quite capable of walking—he was not smoking—persons are not allowed to smoke there, but they will do it sometimes—he was first charged with taking this feloniously.</p>

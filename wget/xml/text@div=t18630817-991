                  </hi>. I live at John-street, Cambridge-heath-road, and am porter to Mr. George Neave, of 97, Leadenhall-street—about 8 o'clock on Wednesday, 29th July, there were two trucks outside our door—I saw the prisoner looking at them, and about half an hour after one of them was gone—I saw the prisoner again on the Friday following, in Smithfield-market, with the wheels, springs, and axletrees, of the truck that we lost—there were six new spikes, and peculiar marks by which I knew them—I fetched a police<lb></lb>man and gave him into custody—he said he bought them of a man in Shore<lb></lb>ditch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He never saw me near the place—I don't know where it is. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am quite sure he is the man—I recognised him again when I saw him at Smithfield—I saw the wheels were ours before I recognised the man; but I recognised him too.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 322). The last witness gave the prisoner into my custody for stealing the axle, springs, and wheels—he said he bought them in Shoreditch, and gave a sovereign for them—he gave me his address, 6 or 7 Houndsdith—he did not reside there—I went to the house and en<lb></lb>quired—he said it was a coffee-shop, and it was not—there is one on the other side of the road a high number.</p>

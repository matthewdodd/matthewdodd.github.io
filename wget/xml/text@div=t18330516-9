I am the housekeeper; on the night of the 21st of April I retired to bed about eleven o'clock, after seeing my house secure, and about one o'clock in the morning I was awoke by the police, who told me some persons were in the house - I got up, and after a good deal of search, we found the prisoner concealed in the coal-hole; there was two policemen with me - the coal-hole is in the house; he was taken by the policeman and searched - he was brought out of the coalhole - I looked at the coal-hole where he had been concealed, and found a dark lantern, an ash-stick with a piece of lead at the end of it, a case-knife, and various other things - there was a phosphorus-box, a screw-driver, and chisel - I neither threatened nor made him any promise - I have known him for some time; and I asked him the reason why he broke into my house - he told me he was in want of victuals, that he was in a state of starvation, and victuals he must have, and if he was not satisfied down stairs, he should have made his way up, and ransacked the house, or words to that effect; he said he knew every room in my house as well as I did myself - I afterwards examined to see where he could have got in, and found the flap of the cellar forced open by means of a small crow-bar - the cellar broken into joins the house I now reside in; it is part of my house, but being large, I had made it into two houses by a party wall - they are both occupied by myself at present, and the cellar part has never been divided - the cellar is under the house - there are two cellars; one I occupy as a beer and wine-cellar, and the other for coals and lumber - but the cellar has never been divided; it is a vault - there is a communication from my house to the cellar by a staircase.</p>

               <p>Q. Does one cellar open into the other? A. I keep my spirit-cellar locked - there is a door to the spiritcellar - the flap of the cellar that was broken was nailed down, because I had no use for it - I found it broken open by a crow-bar; the person could then get to my house by means of the staircase - the flap was fast and secure at eleven o'clock at night, I saw it then fast for I stood on it- the prisoner was in my house that evening till about eleven o'clock, or it might be a few minutes later, but it was after I had seen the flap fastened; he wished my wife and niece good night, and left the house - he only lives ten doors from me - I did not myself see him go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You know there is no fastening to the flap, it is only laid down as a loose board; where you go in and take up coals, there is neither lock, chain, nor bolt? A. It had been nailed down, and had been so for two or three months, till he broke it open, and it is nailed down now - I used to have occasion to go to it for a quantity of coals once, but I always fastened it down again; I used to take out sufficient coals for a week, and then nailed it down again - I have sometimes taken sufficient for a month, and on this night, at eleven o'clock, it was nailed down and fastened as usual - I told the prisoner he was the last man I should have thought would have done this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I wanted something to eat being out of work four months, and something to satisfy hunger was what I wanted.</p>
               <p>Witness. I told him I had always been exceeding kind to him, and if he had asked for any thing he should have had it; he said if he was not satisfied down stairs he would have gone up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Does the flap fall downwards, or do you lift it up? A. I lift it up; it is flat with the pavement - I did not pull it to see if it was fastened, but I was standing on it, and found it as usual - it rests on a groove - I must lift it up to enter from the street; I don't recollect how many nails I put into it - I think there was two on each side; they were large nails, about two inches long.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see any nail in it, you had not fastened it that night? A. No; nor perhaps for a week, or a month; the nails might have been drawn out before for what I know; if it was frequently open it would injure it certainly - I had not wanted to go to it for two months; but previous to that I went to it once a month, or perhaps oftener - it was dark at the time the prisoner was found, it was one o'clock in the morning, and it was quite dark at eleven - the flap is made of two-inch stuff-there is no ring to lift it with.</p>

I was near the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160018"></xptr>prosecutor's house on the 21st of April - I went on duty about nine o'clock - I know the cellar - I saw it at twelve o'clock at night all safe as it usually is - I tried to see if I could pull it up and I could not - I tried to pull it up by putting my hand to the edge - I had no suspicion on my mind to induce me to try it; but I always try every door and place on my beat.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How could you get your hands in to raise it? A. I just put my finger's ends - I could just touch it with the end of my nails; it was even with the curb, and was closely fitted - I could not get more than my finger nail in; I went to the house again about one o'clock - I then perceived it to be about an inch above the level of the surface; I lifted it up and went down and found there was a communication from the cellar into the prosecutor's house -

             was with me; I went up to the house as far as the bar - I called Mr. Grady, and as soon as he came down, he went into the cellar, and then desired the other constable to remain outside while he and I searched the house, and in the coal-cellar on a level with the bar, we found the prisoner behind the door; I took him from there and dragged him into the passage - and behind the door close where he was standing, I found a dark lanthorn, a phosphorus-box, a screw-driver, a carpenter's chisel, and a stone-chisel, a case-knife; and afterwards Mr. Grady found a bludgeon - we neither threatened nor made him any promise - I asked him what brought him there - he said nothing; I then asked him what he intended to do - he said he was just in the act of going to break a cupboard open when he heard me on the stairs - we asked him what was in the cupboard, he said, it was the provision cupboard; and he said after he had done that his intention was to have got into the bar, and to have taken whatever he could have laid his hands on - as I was taking the things out of the cellar, I saw the case-knife, and said Mr. Grady, is this knife yours? - he said, no - the prisoner directly said "That is mine; I brought it out of my own table-drawer" - I asked him who the screw-driver belonged to? - he said to his wife's father.</p>

            . I was on duty with Davies, on the 21st of April - I went to Grady's house, at one o'clock in the morning - I had observed the cellar-flap at twelve o'clock; it was fastened down then - I did not try it, but Davies did, he carried a lantorn and he tried it; we always try all the fastenings when we come on duty - he and I went together again at one o'clock, and perceived the flap of the cellar had been moved - we opened it and went in; we went up on the ground floor of the house and called Mr. Grady - he came down stairs, and we went down into the cellar with him, he was not satisfied that all was right, and I was placed outside on the flap, while they searched inside, and when they had taken the prisoner, I was called in at the front door - I said it would be better for him to confess - I put the question to him myself; I asked what he meant to do?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, or hear any body tell him it would be better for him to confess what he had done? A. I did not hear them, but after Grady and Davis went up stairs, I had him in custody, and said to him, "What do you mean to do, what brought you here?" he said, "I am in distress," and I said he had better confess; nobody was present then, it was after Grady and Davis had spoken to him; they had given him into my custody while they went up to search the house.</p>

            . I have nailed the flap of this cellar down for Mr. Grady since this happened, I cannot say that I saw whether any nails had been in it before, I did not see any fastening, but as to nails, I cannot say whether there had been any or not, I did not see either lock, chain, or fastening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you nailed it down, you saw no nails? A. I did not, I have been brought up a carpenter; I got the nails myself to nail it down, between six and seven in the evening of the day this happened - I used 20d. nails; I did not lift the flap up to see if it had been nailed before or not, I fastened it to the wooden curb.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If it had been nailed before you would have seen the nail holes? A. I did not perceive any; the neighbours have been served with coals from the cellar, I know, at one time, but whether that was done up to that time, I cannot say - I live within a few doors of Grady.</p>
               <p>Q. How often in the course of a week do you suppose the flap has been opened to sell coals from? A. It has been opened in the course of a week, but I don't know how many times - it was opened daily; I think it has been opened six times in a week; I did not see any mark on the flap as if it had been opened by an instrument.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it used at this time to supply the neighbourhood with coals? A. Not at that time, I dont think it was; it might have been three weeks before.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES GRADY. Q. Had the prisoner been drinking in your house the night you found him in the cellar? A. He had; I cannot say he could be very sober when he left, but he did not appear intoxicated when he was taken, but from the quantity he had taken I should not have expected that he would have been sober - I keep no lodgers; I did not see him go away, and cannot say whether he was tipsy - I never gave him permission to sleep in my house; he was never in my employ; I have known him four or five years, and never knew any harm of him; I would have trusted him any where in my house; he said he knew every part of my house as well as me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160019"></xptr>I asked how he came to know it, as I never knew him beyond the bar - this crow-bar or large chisel was found with the things.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DAVIES re-examined. I observed a mark on the cellar flap, that night - we both went into the house together at first, and as soon as Grady came down, my brother officer was sent out - I examined the flap afterwards, but did not find any nails in it; part of the curb was broken; I saw no nails there; it appeared to have been broken from raising the flap up - I do not know how it is usually raised, unless it is done from the inside, but on this occasion it appeared to have been raised from the outside, as part was broken, and the wood looked fresh where it appeared to have been broken, the splinters were fresh.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRADY re-examined. I blamed the policemen for coming into my house together, because I have reason to believe that two persons escaped while the policemen were in the house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you usually raise the flap from the inside or outside? A.Sometimes one way and sometimes the other - if I cannot open it inside I do it outside, there is no bolt or fastening except the nails.</p>
               <p>GUILTY of entering at the trap-door by lifting it up, but not of breaking the nails.</p>

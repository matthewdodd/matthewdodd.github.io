            . I am a constable. About a quarter before five o'clock in the evening of the 6th of January, I saw the prisoner in St. Martin's-court, in company with another person. They were loitering about the court. I watched them for about three-quarters of an hour, or rather better, they then separated, one went down the court towards Castle-street; the prisoner turned back, and went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140006"></xptr>past Mr. Appleby's, which is in the broad part of <placeName id="t18180114-6-crimeloc32">St. Martin's-court</placeName>

He then went to the corner, turned back again, and passed the shop twice afterwards; he then went into the shop, and I missed him for about half a minute; I saw him go into the shop and come out again with something in his apron. I then came from the place where I was concealed, and took hold of him, about twenty yards from Mr. Appleby's shop - I was in the alley, at the back of Slanghter's Coffee-house, where he could not see me. I took him with one hand, and laid hold of his apron with the other, and took him back to Mr. Appleby's shop-the pelisse was in his apron. Miss Wheeler was in the shop, but no other person.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Mr. James Appleby, the prosecutor. His house is in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields. On the 6th of January last, I remember the last witness bringing the prisoner into the shop, about half-past five o'clock in the evening; I saw the pelisse taken from the prisoner, and knew it to be the prosecutor's; about ten minutes before I saw it hanging with two more, by the counter. I had never left the shop, but had been at the other end, and did not miss it before Gooke brought the prisoner in. There was no other person in the shop besides me. The pelisse is worth 25s.</p>

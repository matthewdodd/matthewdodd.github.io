             re-examined. I went to the place where the prisoner was at work, about three o'clock on the 19th; I inquired for a person of the name of Waller - they said no such person worked there, but there was a Mr. Carter; I said, "Perhaps that is the man"- the prisoner then made his appearance; I told him I understood he had been looking for me the day before - he said if I would come to the back of the premises he would speak to me, and he got down an area.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked three weeks for him, and never got a halfpenny piece; I went to him on the Saturday night for money - he got up, knocked me down into the fire-place, and said."How dare you come into the parlour?" there is still a balance due to me.</p>

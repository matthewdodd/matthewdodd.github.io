                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, Parry-place, Plumstead. On 8th April my niece, Mrs. Hodkiss, went over the water—before she went I gave her five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank notes and some sovereigns—these are the bank notes; they run from Nos. 6133 to 6137, but No. 6136 is missing—she gave me these notes when she came back—I did not examine them then, but I did on the 24th of April, and 6136 was missing.</p>

Early in the morning of the 22nd of April I was on duty in the Uxbridge-road—the prisoner came up to the Coach and Horses, at Ealing, with his cart and horses—he went to the shed to the ostler, and asked if he would buy a sack of beans—the ostler said he had no money—I watched, and saw the prisoner and the ostler come out of the shed, go up to the cart, and awake the boy who was in it—they said, "Where is he gone?" meaning me, I suppose—the boy pointed to where I was gone, and said, "Over there"—the cart went on—I went after it, and stopped it—I asked the prisoner what he had got on the cart—he said twenty-two sacks of split beans—I asked if he had got any more—he said no—I got up into his cart, and found a sack of whole uncleaned beans, and after I got to London I found twenty-two sacks of split beans—I asked where he got the uncleaned beans from—he said he did not know, neither should be satisfy me how they came there—I took him to the station, and found on him a bunch of keys, and one single key which is filed very much at the point.</p>

Champ brought the prisoner to the station, at Ealing—I asked how he came by the beans—he said there was another cart gone up the road with two sacks of beans, under some straw, belonging to Mr. Wilshin—I said, "That is not an answer"—he said, "I have no more, and we were ordered to load them, and there is another cart gone up with two sacks of the same sort under the straw"—I went to Mr. Wilshin, and told him—I then asked him for the key of his barn where the beans were threshed—the barn was open, and there was a man at work there—I tried the key taken from the prisoner, and it opened the look of the barn—I said to the prisoner, "How this key has been filed about"—he said he did it, to make It fit his corn-bin lock—I tried it to his corn-bin lock, and it would not go in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hayes; my father carries on a large farm there; the prisoner was his carman. I saw the sack in which the uncleaned beans were, on the Saturday, at Brentford—it is one of my father's—on Fri<lb></lb>day I had written a ticket for twenty-two sacks of split beans—I laid it on the table, as I always do for the men, if they are gone to bed—it would have been his duty to go with these beans between one and two o'clock in the morning—I have examined the beans found in the prisoner's possession, and compared them with the bulk in the barn—I believe them to be part of the the same beans—they are the same kind in all respects as those in my father's barn—I never sent out beans in that state—the padlock and key produced belong to my father.</p>

I live at 26, King Street, Camden Town—I keep a shop there—I saw my shop safe about 9 o'clock in the morning of the 22nd January—I returned about 11.20 at night—I then found that my house had been entered; the door was broken open, the window was open, and property taken away to the amount of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the jewellery pro<lb></lb>duced is a portion of what I lost.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 25th January I went to 26, Bedfordbury, and saw the prisoner in the passage of the house I asked if his name was Pearce—he said it was—I told him I was an inspector of police, and that I should search his apartments—he took me to the top of the house, to the door of the front room, which was looked—he said "I will go down stairs and get the key"—I said "No you won't, you don't leave here; take me to your rooms"—he then went down to the first floor—I went into the centre room, there are three rooms on a floor—on entering I saw a woman sitting at the fire, who the prisoner stated was his house-keeper, and a man sitting at the table, who I knew, with these articles of jewellery and this handkerchief in front of him, with a bottle of aquafortis, testing the chains—I said to that man, "<hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi> go and sit down then, and remain quiet"—he sat down—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for that property—he said "He brought it," nodding to the other man, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>—I then made a further search in the room, and in this carpet-bag I found a quantity of cigar-tubes and meerschaum pipes—I asked him to account for those—he said "He brought them," nodding to the man <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>—I have a list of the property I found in the room, I made it from the property then in my possession—in a chest of drawers I found a quantity of other cigar-tubes, and in various parts of the room I found the following property.

               <p>Mr. Fielding. After you have entered it then you put it into a book which was a memorandum of the place to which it was to go? - After entering it, it was put into the place where the other bills are usually put till we come to charge them out.</p>
               <p>What is done with the bill after it has gone through that ceremony? - It goes to the person that is to take charge of them the next day.</p>

               <p>I understand from seeing a number of gentlemen standing up here, that a many people have access to the place where these bills are put? - Yes, they are put into one of the back offices, and then given out at evening to the respective clerks.</p>

               <p>I am a clerk in this banking house, I examined these bills on the 19th of August, 1712, which were charged out for the 20th, they were all right when I had sorted and examined my bills, and sorted them regularly according to the walk I was to go, which was the city walk, I then took them round to the place where I usually put them, which was behind the counter; I put them in my own case; not finding the large case which was appointed to put these bills in, I put them in my own case, which I was to go out with the next day, and put them behind the place where I usually put them; there are partitions behind the counter where we used to put them; I did not take any more notice of these bills which I put up, supposing they were safe and right; in the morning when I came to look for my case of bills which I put up on the night before they were missing, I enquired of all the clerks.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there were other bills besides those that were lost? - There were thirty or forty; I did not find my case.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose business was it to put those bills of yours into the tin case? - Mr. Hollingsworth's, or one of the clerks; I enquired of all the clerks if they knew any thing of my bills; and when we could not find the case of bills any where, we agreed to go and stop the payment of the bills which were charged out, the bills for payment, and the bills for acceptance, which were all examined together, on account of going regularly in the walk: we went out to stop the payment of the bills for payment and the bills for acceptance; we found no such bills, nor heard nor learnt any thing during the time we were out concerning the bills; we came home, and the gentleman agreed to advertize the bills that were lost, with the particulars; I was so flurried with the loss of my case, and was so unhappy for myself and my friends who were security for me, that I could not draw up any advertisement or do any thing; I went down into the kitchen and set by the fire, and was lamenting the loss of my case;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100156"></xptr> I was unhappy and uneasy on the account of it, as the gentlemen and the clerks had searched for it; the prisoner stood at the corn er of the kitchen door, and said, he was very willing to go up and seek with me, where I should chose to go; I said it was in vain to seek for it; however, thro' the persuasion of the servants and himself, I went with him to seek for the case; this was between nine and ten o'clock, we began at one part of the office and went on regularly round till we came to where there was a bureau bedstead, which was moved by him or me, and he held down the candle, and looking behind the bedstead, he said he saw something, I looked behind the bedstead with great anxiety, and saw a hair broom which lay towards the ground, and the corner of the case seemed to appear under the hair broom; I drew it out, and to my great surprize, found there were my bills; I did not examine them that night by the book that I had entered them in; I looked them over and supposed they were all right, in the morning I found that one bill which was upon

               <p>Mr. Garrow another Council for the Prisoner. This transaction is near a year and a half ago? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you affect at this distance of time, to speak with all that degree of accuracy as to all these minute circumstances, which you should do in a circumstance of this kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I fancy your situation at this house was, at that time, the situation of an out door clerk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have told us, that there were certain bills charged out to you the 19th of August, to be delivered on the 20th; these were charged out by you to some other person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But it is not your business to charge them out? - No.</p>
               <p>Then these bills were not disposed of in the uniform usual course of your office? - No, the case was not to be found.</p>
               <p>You therefore put them into another case and carried them round behind the counter and placed them there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was this? - In the evening, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>You have a great number of clerks in your house? - We have eleven.</p>
               <p>This place in which you deposited the case was not locked up? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all the partners in this house, and all the clerks in this house, had access to this place, and all the servants, if they pleased, had access? - Nobody is suffered to go behind the counter but the clerks, without it is when the porter locks up the place and shuts up the shutters, which is whilst there are some of the clerks in the office.</p>
               <p>Some of the clerks sleep in the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not it usual for the clerks to have their hair dressed in the shop? - We used to do these things, but we have left it off now.</p>
               <p>Oh, you used to do these things then, but you have left them off now; pray why is it left off now? - The gentlemen did not know what to think, these things being lost, the only reason I believe for that, Mr. Prescott, the head partner came one morning as as we were having our hair dressed, ten minutes before nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was there an old clothes man introduced into the shop? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When the book was found, you say you did not examine it with much minuteness? - I did not with any great degree of accuracy.</p>
               <p>Did you express to the prisoner your satisfaction at having found all the bills right? - I do not recollect particularly, it is possible that I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100157"></xptr>I suppose this transaction made a good deal of noise in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the case was recovered, it became necessary I imagine, to take off the stoppage of those bills that you had recovered. - We stopped the payment at the Bank immediately, and I believe it was advertized.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly notorious in your house and made a great noise? - It did not make a great noise, we were very much alarmed, we did suppose that the case had been in possession of some person or persons by these two bills being missing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester council for Prosecution. You said it was the porter's business to sweep the shop and shut the shutters? - Yes, and rub down the counters and such business as that, and to make our beds and bring our suppers up.</p>

             denies his having ever put his name to the draft, and Lloyd says he never did, I told him I should take him before a magistrate, upon that he then said, why, Sir, if you will keep a secret, I will tell you the whole business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not you say you had threatened to carry him before a magistrate? - I told him that I thought this business a very unlikely one, and unless he gave me a more satisfactory account, I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit to your Lordship whether you will, after what he has told us, hear what Mr. Cole may say, I do not know what he is going to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100159"></xptr>Court. Why to be sure one is always very chaste in these kind of things, I think we had better not hear it, I do not know what Mr. Cole is going to say, but if it is any confession made by him, if it is made immediately after a threat, we should not hear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It is not a threat.</p>
               <p>Court. Why it scarcely amounts to that, but he is hardly a free agent at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is much more efficacious than that, it coaxes him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I never knew the objection but where there was a promise that you would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose Mr. Cole had said I can hang you, you had better confess, if you you do not, I shall certainly carry you before a magistrate; and if the man under the terror of that threat had made a confession, to be sure that is not evidence; now Mr. Cole is much too prudent to do that, he only said, unless I have a more satisfactory account, I shall take you before a magistrate, and then the man says, why then Sir, that is, since you will carry me before a magistrate, if you will keep a secret, I will tell you the whole business, this is the safe side, and I own I never like confessions.</p>
               <p>- COLE sworn.</p>
               <p>In the evening he sent to me to desire I would come to the gaol where he was.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the same thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had been at the prisoner's house before you met him in the street, and when you met him, he went with you without any sort of hesitation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hollingsworth. This note is the property of your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Hollingsworth. How long after this affair did the prisoner continue in your service? - About three weeks.</p>
               <p>I am desired to ask you whether after he left your service, he did not upon some occasion or other, give you notice where he might be heard of, and that he was about to leave London? - He did.</p>
               <p>The payment of the bills were stopped then? - Yes, and they were advertised.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you where? - In Mead's-court, somewhere by Soho.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you begin to search after him? - About a month after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my Council.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You understand we cannot say any thing to the Court or Jury in your defence, we can only examine witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Foster. You remember Sir, when the pocket-book was found, you was with me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. God forbid that you should be hindered from saying any thing in your defence, but if you have only questions to ask, I would advise you to leave them to your Council.</p>
               <p>A WRITTEN DEFENCE OF THE PRISONER's READ.</p>
               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury: In answering this charge which is now made against me, I shall be under the necessity of troubling the Court with some account of myself. Before I came into the service of the prosecutor, I carried on the business of a maltster to a considerable amount, but was reduced by losses, and recommended by Mr. Fothergill to the house of the prosecutors; my duty was that of porter, and in that situation I was neither intrusted with bills or notes nor had the means of secreting them; in September, 1782, I was dismissed the plaintiff's service, on account of these bills being missing; the plaintiff's suspicion did not rest on me alone, since then they discharged another of their servants, whose opportunities seem more calculated to warrant their suspicions; I continued some time in London after my dismission from the plaintiff's service, and when I went into the country I gave notice to Mr. Prescott where I was gone to. If I had been conscious of having stolen these bills from him, your Lordship will not think I should have been so mad as to negotiate them; after I left the plaintiff, I insured lottery tickets with great success,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100160"></xptr> and having got money, I went to pursue my former business, and I was induced to assume another name. In the course of my transactions with lottery offices, I was frequently paid in bank notes, and this note I received at Mr. Palmer's office, in Fleet-street, one night in payment of forty guineas: I hope the bare possession of the bill, at the distance of two years, cannot prove me guilty of the offence of stealing it.</p>
               <p>- FOTHERGILL sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>I believe you are a very considerable corn factor? - I am in that line of business; I have had very considerable concerns with the prisoner, to a very large amount; and since I have been subpoened in this business, I have had reference to our ledgers, and I see I dealt with him from January 1779 to November 1781.</p>
               <p>By what name did he deal with you? - By the name of

               <p>"you know my motive for changing the name of yours, T. J." My dealing with him from Midsummer, 1780, to Midsummer, 1781, was for six thousand and odd pounds.</p>
               <p>In all the dealing you have had with him, have you as reason to look upon him as an honest man? - We has particular reason on this account; he had frequently occasion to over-draw us, he requested the indulgence to accept before asserts came, and we have frequently accepted two or three hundred pounds in advance to him, and when he promised to send asserts he never disappointed us: after he had quitted the service of Mr. Prescott and Co. I heard they had some suspicion about some matter, and in about a week after he called on me; I told him, and desired he would call and clear it up, which I afterwards understood he did; he told me his lodgings were in Meard's-court at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You gave a character of him to this gentleman, in a name that you knew did not belong to him? - I confess I did, and for the reason I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We have many other witnesses to character, but I believe it is totally immaterial to call them.</p>

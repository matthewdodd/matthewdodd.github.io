             a check for 10l. payable to Eliza, for house, or bearer (looks at it), it now appears to be date the 27th of September, 1816, but it is the same check that I drew on the 17th of October, 1815, I have the tally, which exactly fits; the date has been altered, and the alteration, I am positive, is the hand-writing of the prisoner - I have a pertect knowledge of his hand - He had no authority to alter it. It appears by my banking account to have been regularly paid on the 17th of October, 1815, and also to have been paid a second time on the 28th of September, 1816, the day after the altered date. The prisoner, almost invariably fetched my checks from the bankers. I have occasionally missed a few checks, and have asked him about them, he said, "the bankers sometimes will mislay them. On the 8th of April last he absented himself from my service, in the course of my inquiries after him, a letter, in his hand-writing, fell into my hands, addressed to a Mr. Mann; in consequence of which I got a warrant and searched Mann's livery stables in Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, in company with Mr. Warry and Ruthven.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. My checks are numbered altogether.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Snow and Paul. I have known the prisoner about two years (looks at the waste book). On the 17th of October, 1815, there is an entry of the payment of a 10l. check, drawn by Mr. Frowd (looks at the check), this answers the description, all but the date. On the 28th of September, 1816, I find an entry, in my own writing, of a check for 10l. drawn by E. Frowd. I do not know to whom it was paid.</p>

               <p>HENRY GUBBINGS. I am the ledger-keeper; there are my figures on the check, which refer to the folio of the ledger; I there find 101. paid to Eliza - I turn to the 17th of October, 1816, and find 101. paid also to Eliza.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There is only one reference to the figures on the check. I may have omitted it.</p>
               <p>MR. FROWD. I did not draw any check for 10l. payable to Eliza, between July and December, 1816.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RUTHVEN. I am an officer. On the 19th of April, I went with Mr. Frowd and Warry, to Mr. Mann's premises, Mr. Warry found a bundle of papers stuffed into the end of a truss of straw in the stable-there are several checks among them, drawn by Messrs. Frowd and Rose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The checks have not been out of my possession since, except when they were before the Grand Jury.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. He has frequented our house since November last. He gave me the papers on the 7th of April; they laid in my drawer for sometime, and I put them in the stable the evening before Mr. Warry found them. I told them where to find the papers.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KING. I live in High Holborn. The prisoner lodged with me. My house is in Middlesex.</p>

               <p>COURT to WILSON. Do you not usually, when you pay checks, draw your pen through the signature - A. Yes; if a check had been presented with a mark across the name I should not have paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. The check appears to be crossed out only once - A. if it was paid twice it must have been omitted the first time.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Mann-Unless you give the papers, immediately, to my mother, or the bearer, I must give Mr. Frowd a full statement of the transactious between you and myself; I really cannot tell what you mean by keeping the bundle of papers, none of which relate to you, and which I particularly want.

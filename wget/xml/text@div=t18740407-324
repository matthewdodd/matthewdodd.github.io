I am a clothier at 75, High Street, Clapham—on Wednesday, 13th January, the house was all safe when I went to bed—next morning I found the shop in confusion, and my goods carried from the shop into the room adjoining—I missed a large quantity of goods to the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards, and also a knife with a saw—I have seen some of the property since on both the prisoner's when I went to Southwark Police Station, on the Monday after they were apprehended—I think it was on the 5th March—these clothes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were worn by Johnson, and these by Simpson—they are all mine—I found my ladder had been placed against the back window—one of the panes had been cut which would enable anyone to open the window—it was not so when I went to bed—the shop door had been forced and the street door was left open—it had all been shut up about 10 o'clock the night before.</p>

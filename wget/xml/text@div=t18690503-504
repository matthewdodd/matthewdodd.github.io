                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 81, High Holborn—on 17th April I was standing at the foot of Westminster Bridge, about 10 o'clock at night, and the prisoner came up and struck me on the left eye, from the effects of which I fell into a fit (he had stolen a handkerchief from mj breast pocket five or six weeks before, in a pie shop, and I tried to get at him, but his two friends kept me back)—I had said nothing to him on this night, and he struck me without notice—when I came to my senses, I was sitting, and the prisoner's hand was in my trowaers pocket, where I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I laid hold of his hand but he threw it from me, and I heard money fall—I called out that he had robbed me, and he ran away—he was brought back in a few minutes, and I recognized him, and have no doubt of him, having seen him before—I was bruised, and was in King's College Hospital from Tuesday to Saturday—the prisoner struck me three or four times—I have lost my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of 2, Princes Place, Lambeth—on 17th April, I was with Stidder in Westminster Road, and saw the prisoner come out and strike him on the eye; he fell down in a fit, and when he was on the ground the prisoner put his right hand into Stidder's right trowsers pocket, and when he pulled it out I heard money jink on the ground—he ran away, and Stidder called, "Stop thief!"—I ran after him, and the police stopped him—I had seen him standing about, while Stidder and I were talking together.</p>

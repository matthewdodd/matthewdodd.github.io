The Prosecutor's Wife depos'd, That the Prisoner once came and pawn'd a Ring to her, and came and redeemed it. Afterwards came again, and said, Her Husband was in danger of Trouble, and brought two Bundles, which she said were two pieces of Holland, worth 12 l. and borrow'd a Guinea and a half; and at that Time pretended to buy a Cup for an antient Gentlewoman, and she showing her one, the Prisoner told her, that she was a Milliner, kept a Shop in Bow-Lane, and she was to send the Cup there. After the Prisoner was gone she presently missed the Cup, and going to enquire for her, she could not hear of any such Person; and coming home again examined the Bundles, and found they were nothing but Rags made up artificially, with Tickets with Strings like Pieces of Holland. That she could not hear of her till lately, that she heard she was taken up and sent to New Prison for another Fact. The Prisoner pleaded, She had the Cup delivered to her by the Prosecutor with a bill of Parcels, so that it was no more than a Debt. But this was contradicted by the Prosecutor and her Maid; and she calling none to her Reputation, the Jury found her <rs id="t17231204-26-verdict143" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I live in Great Suffolk-street, in the Borough. On the 29th of Nov. I had a copper scale on my premises—I saw it safe about seven o'clock in the evening—I missed it between seven and eight o'clock—the policeman produced it to me at the station the same evening—this is it.</p>

I was on duty in Kent-street, on the evening of the 29th of Nov., about half-past seven o'clock—I saw Turner come to the corner of a marine-store shop—he gave a holloa, and Webb came up with something under bis coat—they both walked into the marine-store shop together—it is about a quarter of a mile from Great Suffolk—street—I saw Webb take this scale from under his coat in the shop, and give it to M'Clatchie, who is the servant—Turner was in the shop at the time—M'Clatchie put it in the scale, but he took it out again and placed it under the counter without weighing it—I went in and took Webb and Turner into custody—I asked them what they had brought, and where the scale was—I said to M'Clatchie "What have you got?"—he said he thought it was not right and gave me the scale—halfpence in his hand—I asked him what he wa§ going to give for it—he said 7 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I was taking Webb and Turner to the station, they both pulled in different directions and Turner got away—I went oo a little further and got a kick behind—I staggered, and Webb got away, but he was retaken—I never lost sight of them.</p>

I am in partnership with William Byron—this marine-store dealer's shop, No. 262, Kent-street, belongs to us—M'Clatchie has been in our employ about three months—I had not known him before that—he did not understand the business, or the purchasing of articles—we took him first to sort rags for us, and that we had to teach him—I was ill for six weeks, and my partner had him to help him, and at times he had him to serve in the shop and then my partner was taken ill before I got well—on the Saturday night this happened he was serving for me—he was in the room and any person that came into the shop he went out to see what they had, and after that he came to me to ask about it, except it was rags or bones, which he knew the price of, and could purchase without assistance—he brought this scale in to show me—I just looked at it and told him if it weighed 1 1/1lbs., exclusive of the iron he</p>

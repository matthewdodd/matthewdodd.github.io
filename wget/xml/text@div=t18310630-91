               <p>FREDERICK BRAITHWAITE. I am in partnership with Henry Nicholson and two others - we <rs id="t18310630-91-viclabel495" type="occupation">keep the Crown Brewery, Regent's-park</rs>

In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's shop, in High-street, St. Pancras, on the 20th of June, and asked him whether, in the course of the afternoon, any boys had been there to offer any metal, or part of a cock for sale; he said, No - I then asked whether he had not been employed as foreman to Mr. Champ, a butcher in the Hampstead-road; he said, Yes -I said, "Then I am right, you have bought part of a cock that was stolen from my premises this afternoon;" I said I had the boy in custody, that I had the key of the cock in my possession, and he had given 4d. for it - he then said,"Oh, yes, I recollect I have purchased such a thing;" he asked his wife for the key of the wash-house - he went backwards, and returned with the barrel of the cock which I had had stolen; I value it as old metal at 1s, but when new it cost me 9s. 6d, with the key - I know this is the one I had lost, as we had three of these made to a particular order, and the other two are safe; it is made of gun-metal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you brought the circumstance more minutely to his memory he said he did remember it? A. Yes; I certainly should not have bought it for any thing but old metal - I did not take the prisoner; I said, "I am going to the Policeoffice to-morrow," and he was there, and met me - I did not go with him to his back premises.</p>

            . I am turned ten years old. I got over some palings into Mr. Braithwaite's stable-yard, and fetched this cock; I dropped the key in carrying it - I gave it to Brooks, who was with me, but did not get over the palings; he staid outside - we went on, and met a sailor-boy, whose name I do not know, we then went on and met Cook in Henry-street - the sailor-boy asked Cook if he knew where to sell this cock, and Brooks and Cook went to sell it; I waited on the opposite side of the way - that was a place in Little Albany-street, near the Police station; it was refused there - we at last sold it at the prisoner's; I did not see what was given for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His wife, I believe, keeps a shop, and deals in little articles? A. Yes; I had not known the prisoner before - he did not set us on this; that was the first thing I ever stole - Brooks persuaded me to go and get it; Brooks went to the prisoner's shop with it.</p>

            . I was with Collins when he got over in Mr. Braithwaite's yard; when he first got over three men hallooed to him, and he dropt the cock, and came out without it - he then put his arm through, and reached it; he carried it to the shop in Little Albany-street, and because they would not buy it he began to swear at the little girl - we then went down the street and met Cook- we asked him where to sell it; Cook and I went in the prisoner, and sold it - Collins was at that time waiting on the other side of the way; Cook asked the prisoner if he bought old brass - he said, Yes, and asked to look at it; he put it into the scale, said it was 1 1/2 lbs. and it came to 4d. - we were coming out of the shop, and the prisoner said, "I will give no more than 4d. for it;" Cook then turned back and took that - the prisoner asked where he got it - Cook said his mother was moving and found it, she had lost the key, and it was not of much use; the prisoner asked if he was quite sure of that - he said,"Yes;" he then asked him where he lived - he said, "At 42. Henry-street:" the prisoner said, "This is 48;" Cook then said, "It is the other Henry-street, up by Regent'spark:" he gave him the 4d. and we came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say, "I hope this has not been stolen?" A. Yes; he said he had been served so many tricks, and the mothers came and claimed the things back, and he must be cautious: I was going to get the cock myself, but Collins said he would go - the sailor-boy and I persuaded him that we had seen it for a month before.</p>

            . I live with my mother, at No. 12, Fitzroy-place, New-road. Brooks and Collins asked if I knew where to sell a brass cock - I took them to the prisoner's, where it was sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went in to sell it? A. Yes; the prisoner asked my name, and where I got it - I said I got it from home; I did not say my mother was removing, and found it and had lost the key - if any one has said I said so, it is false; Brooks said I got it from my mother -I do not know how he knew that; it was for the purpose of deceiving the prisoner; he asked where I lived, and I believe I said, No. 42, Henry-street - that was to deceive him: he did say he hoped it was not stolen; we were going away, because he refused to give us more than 4d.</p>

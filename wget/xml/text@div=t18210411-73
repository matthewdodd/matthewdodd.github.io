On the morning of the 15th of February, before eight o'clock, I missed the plate mentioned in the indictment, which was in use. I had seen it at ten o'clock the night before. It was in a japanned bread basket - the steel was ivory handled, bound with silver. Two metal spoons were found in the road, but nearly a month elapsed before I heard any thing of the rest. I found parts of them broken, in the possession of the prisoner. On the Monday before the prisoner was committed, I got a search-warrant, and went with an officer to the prisoner's parents' house, at Kensington Gravel-pits. He was at my house at the time. I found nothing there Before the constable took him into custody he most positively denied all knowledge of it. In consequence of my having produced to him the broken pieces which were actually in his possession, he took me and the officer into a stable, where he worked and dug up two of the pieces of a silver table-spoon. It was a very little depth under the manger. On the officer's proceeding to handcuff him, he stated there was some more property under the tiling of his mother's wash-house, and the other parts of it were sold at a pawnbroker's and a watchmaker's, at Kensington. I went with the prisoner and the officer to the pawnbroker's and watchmaker's, and received from them portions of two table spoons, broken. He stated he had thrown the knife into a field, and the two castor tops and two salt spoons, into some lime, where some bricklayers were building. He said that he had accomplished the robbery by getting over the front railing, getting round the house, and opening the passage door, after the servants had come down - that he had come to the back of the house, having buried the property, and called at the outside of the gate, as was his custom, for admission. He denied having any participators in the robbery, till he came before the magistrate - he then said a boy, whose name he did not know, received the things from him over the back gate, and assisted him to bury them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HUMPHRIES. I am an officer. I went with Mr. Stockdale to the prisoner's house, and found nothing. I returned and questioned him. I said,</p>
               <p>"Part of the plate is found, I wish you to tell me where the rest is. If you do not tell me, I shall take you to the Office.</p>
               <p>"He took me to the stable, and shewed me two parts of the spoon under the manger, covered over with straw. I searched his mother's wash-house, and found this gravy spoon, and two parts of a tables-poon. I went to a pawnbroker's in Kensington, and found the bowl of a tablespoon. And at the watchmaker's I found two pieces of a table-spoon.</p>

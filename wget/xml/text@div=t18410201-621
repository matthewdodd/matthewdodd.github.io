                  </hi>. I am a gold-lace man, and live in Russell-street, Covent-garden. About five o'clock this evening I was in Holborn—I saw a boy in company with the prisoner—I saw the boy snatch a cloak from the prosecutor's door, and give it to the prisoner, who put it under his great-coat, ran off, and turned down Turnstile—I pursued him till he came to Whetstone-park—I told him to drop the cloak—he ran off about a dozen yards, and then a person came and brought the cloak up, and we pursued and took him—I have every reason to believe he is the person—I could not swear to him—he was dressed in the same way, but I lost sight of him twice.</p>

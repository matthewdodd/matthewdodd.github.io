I have been a porter in the service of Mr. Barnett, a gun maker, in the Minories, for about two years—I have pleaded guilty to stealing some brass—there was a great quantity of it loose about the factory, and it was a very great temptation to anybody—I had been told by Mr. Barnett to knock some stocks off, and this was the remainder of it—I took it to Mr. Warren and sold it—I only went there once; it was twice in one evening—the first time, I think I took about eighteen pounds; but I will not be certain—he did not ask me any questions when I took the first lot; I swear that—I took the second lot about a quarter of an hour afterwards; he did not ask me any questions then—he paid me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the two quantities—I did not tell him where I got it from.</p>

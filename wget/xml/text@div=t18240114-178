On the 22d of December, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in the parlour, behind the shop, and heard a noise - went into the shop, and found the prisoner at the parlour door, just getting off his knees, and going towards the shop door - I followed him, calling Stop thief! he ran out as quick as possible. I gave the alarm, pursued him about sixty yards, and then left the watchman in pursuit, who secured him; and some time after he found the bowl with seven shillings in the mud - it was taken from my till, which contained more than that.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was given into my charge, and in about half an hour, I went in the direction he had come, and found the bowl and six shillings in the mud. He was without shoes, and said his mother was too poor to buy him any. I afterwards found a pair on the prosecutrix's area rails, and he claimed them.</p>

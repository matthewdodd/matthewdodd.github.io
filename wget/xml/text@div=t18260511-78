I let a furnished room to the prisoner, at 5s. per week; another person took it for her first - she lodged in it; she staid ten weeks, and went away on the 11th of April, with a large bundle. I followed her to the Water-works public-house - she came out again with the bundle, and I followed her to the Coach and Horses public-house, with these two pillows behind her. I asked how she came to take my things, and she said she did not. I then got the constable. The room had been taken in the prisoner's name, and she paid the rent for it, or caused it to be paid every Saturday morning, by Mrs. Smith, who fetched 14s. a week from her husband.</p>

               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this done indecently to the young woman, or using her roughly?</p>
               <p>Steping. It was done in such a manner that I really thought he was acquainted with her, it was nothing indecent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go with him freely?</p>
               <p>Steping. She and he went up to the deceased together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go up to him for protection?</p>
               <p>Steping. I did not observe it was for that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that expression about dust ?</p>
               <p>Steping. I understood Passmore meant don't let us have a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased strike the prisoner first?</p>
               <p>Steping. I think the prisoner received a blow on his arm, and then he immediately returned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Westmore was in liquor?</p>
               <p>Steping. I really think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon Westmore to have been a healthful man?</p>
               <p>Steping. I believe he was a weakly man, a little blow might have knock'd him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been a strong man, do you think that blow could have knock'd him down?</p>
               <p>Steping. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Steping. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it was that blow that kill'd him?</p>
               <p>Steping. No, sir, I do not. I believe it was the fall that kill'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after he was dead?</p>
               <p>Steping. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound?</p>
               <p>Steping. It was on the right side upon the temple as I took him up there was a bump arose.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know whether it was by the blow or the fall ?</p>
               <p>Steping. I go by what the surgeon said that bleeded him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Passmore a right or a left handed man?</p>
               <p>Steping. I believe he is a right handed man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blow fall?</p>
               <p>Steping. I believe it fell on the jaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they faceing each other?</p>
               <p>Steping. They were, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you stand?</p>
               <p>Steping. I stood within a yard of the deceas'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Steping. It was between ten and eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the moon shine?</p>
               <p>Steping. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which hand did the prisoner give the blow with that knock'd him down?</p>
               <p>Steping. With his right hand on the deceased's left side. I believe both the blows were given on the jaw.</p>

            . I went into the Temple-walks to see the fire-works, and just as the clock struck ten we look'd for them: as I stood there this gentleman came up to me and took me round the waist, and ask'd me, if I would go take a walk or a run, or drink a glass of wine. I refused him, he pull'd me, and I gave a stagger, which might make the other witness believe I was consenting. Mr. Westmore desir'd he would let me alone, saying I belong'd to him. The prisoner said, I did not, I was his cousin. The deceas'd said, I was no cousin to him, and he would take me home as he brought me out: with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175107030019"></xptr> that the prisoner went very civilly away. He came round again and pull'd Mr. Westmore by the wig, he had taken a little walk in the walks between. Just as he pull'd him by the wig I saw one of the fire-works go up at Cuper's garden, I turn'd round and saw only the blow given by the prisoner, which knock'd Mr. Westmore down with his right hand. I went for a surgeon to bleed him, then I saw him home, and after that I saw his head opened: his scull was crack'd just above the temple, where was a great bump on his head.</p>

            . I am a surgeon : On Wednesday was se'night, about half an hour after ten o'clock, I was call'd to bleed the deceas'd in the Temple, where I found him lying insensible. After I had bled him I sent for another surgeon, and we agreed to lay the scull bare ; there we found a breach about an inch long above the temple bone, and likewise a depression on the right side the head. I apprehend that fracture was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>To his Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard. I have known the prisoner about four years, he has been a kind of a servant to me, and used to shave me and do my wigs. I always took him for a person of a very peaceable disposition, very unlike to run into any quarrel. He is a person of sobriety. I never saw him in liquor in my life; an honest person, I would have trusted him with any some of money, and a good natur'd fellow. I don't think he would, knowingly, kill any man in the world, under any provocation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dryle. He has attended me in the manner he has Mr. Howard. I think him a man very unlikely to commit any crime of this sort, I don't think he would begin a quarrel. I have heard the trial, and don't think, upon these circumstances, he intended to kill the deceas'd.</p>

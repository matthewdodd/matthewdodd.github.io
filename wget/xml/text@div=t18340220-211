               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any gaslight in your room? A. No; but one is opposite my window - my shutters were not shut - I did not hear her open the door - I heard her foot - I did not say anything to her till she was going out - I then called, "Stop thief" - she did not give me time to speak to her when she was in the room - I get my living by labour - I travel the country; and if a gentleman asks me to get a bottle of gin or rum for him, I do so - I should not know whisky in this country from water - I have quarrelled with the prisoner - she never put me into the station - I have been there for getting drunk, but not for anything else - I have been at the Two Bells, Whitechapel - the prisoner did not give me into custody for beating her - my wife was in bed with me when the prisoner took my breeches - the officer had disturbed her when he came in before - I do not know whether she was awake when the prisoner came in - I found her awake when I went up again - the prisoner robbed me twice before - I charged her with the robbery at Lambeth-street - my wife took her there; but she forgave her - my son lived with me; but I turned him out, for his behaviour - he lived with the prisoner in Essex-street - when I called after the prisoner, my next door neighbour put her head out of her window and asked what brought me out so late in the morning - I told her that Carroty Kit had robbed me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know you are on your oath to speak the truth - do you mean to swear that this prisoner came in and took your breeches? A. Yes.</p>

            . I live next door to Flynn; about three o'clock that morning I heard the alarm of "Stop thief" - I got out of bed, opened the window, and saw Flynn and Hickey - she was going across the ruins as if from Flynn's house - he was standing at the door, and he said, "Carroty Kit has been and robbed me of my breeches, and my money and handkerchief" - he was in his shirt and night-cap - the prisoner had a bundle under her arm.</p>

Seven or eight months - I live next door to him - I do not remember the prisoner living there - Flynn's son has lived there - my husband is dead - it is about three months since I saw a man named Maquire - he is in Hertford gaol - he is no relation of mine - he has called at my house - he never passed as my husband - I never lived with him as his wife - he did say when he came out of the country he would marry me, if I wished it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to TIMOTHY FLYNN. Q. Were you ever in custody for an assault? A. Not to my knowledge - this policeman came into my house, as he was told I had some liquor there - he and I fought and beat one another - I was taken to the House of Correction, and was there two months - but I forgot that.</p>

             (police-constable G 144). I went to see for Patrick Flynn, as the prisoner told me he had committed felony, but I could not find him - I disturbed the old man - he got up, and opened the door - I took the prisoner the next night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find the breeches? A. No: Flynn got up, and was a good while opening the door for me - I saw a woman there - she asked what I wanted of her son - they were both awake when I went down - Flynn went with me, and shut the door - the prisoner was there - she went out with me; and he said, "Ah, Carroty Kit, is it you?" I did not stop to hear the door shut.(The prisoner put in a written defence, protesting her innocence; and stating that she had induced the policeman to go to the prosecutor's house, suspecting his son who had deserted her was to be found there.)</p>

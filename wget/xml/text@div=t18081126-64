               <p>Q. Did you keep any fowls - A. Yes; I had upwards of thirty, little and big ones; I kept them in the yard and out houses. On Tuesday the 11th of October I lost five fowls.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them - A. I saw them about four o'clock in the afternoon; they were all safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them - A. At twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they roost - A. In the stable; my brother slept in the place underneath; he heard somebody about the yard; he brought the man up to me, he catched the man in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your fowls - A. In the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the alive or dead - A. We did not find them there; they had been killed and the heads were in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the man in your brother's custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before - A. Yes, he was just a neighbour to me; I found four of the heads, the others were taken away entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of these five fowls - were they fit to go to market with - A. No; they were alive, they run about, they were not worth more than ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This poor man was a neighbour of yours, he lived a short distance from your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober when you took him - A. I think he was drunk; one of the fowls was found at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he has lost his wife lately - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a labouring man, who lodges in his house, you did not find any fowls in his possession - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The heads of the fowls was wrung off - A. Yes, the place was smoothened with blood.</p>
               <p>- JORDAN. Q. Do you live with your brother - A. Yes; about the hour of twelve o'clock, I heard a sad noise of the fowls in the stable: I thought it was the horses knocking them off the rack with their noses; about twelve I heard a man's foot go about the place, he slipped; he ran his hand into my place and I catched hold of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that turn out to be the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep in the stable where the fowls roost - A. Close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the stable at the time - A. No, he was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say - A. He made a bit of a moan,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260040"></xptr>he said he was very much in liquor; he fell down in the brook; I told him I would not let him go, he must see my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor - A. Yes, I think so; when I got hold of him he staggered; I did not go into the stable, I took him to my brother, my brother brought him down and looked in the stable; he ran and said I am off; my brother and I ran and catched him again.</p>

            . I am headborough of Hackney. They took the prisoner on the night of the 11th of October; in the morning a key was brought to me in the cage; they told me they found four heads, they could not find the fowls; I searched the prisoner's house, I found a fowl without a head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lodge with the prisoner - A. They said a man lodged with him; the prisoner did not say any thing: I asked him what he did with the rest of them, there was one in the house and no more; he said he did not know any thing about them; it was tied up in an apron the fowl was; that apron appeared to be the prisoner's apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whose apron it was - A. The prisoner is a carpenter; he said his apron was at the washerwoman's; I asked the washerwoman, she said this apron was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her in his presence - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you must not tell what the washerwoman said.</p>

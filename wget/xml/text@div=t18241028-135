I staid about three hours; I took off my clothes; and when I got up, the articles were gone; she was there when I awoke, but she had been out, and got some gin - she awoke me, and asked me to have some; my money had been in my breeches pocket, which I had put on a chair by the bedside - my snuff-box was in my waistcoat pocket. I was rather the worse for liquor, but know that the property was safe when I went to bed. I told her of my loss, but she made no answer. I went home and told some friends, and we went to her room, and waited till she came in with the ticket in her hand.</p>

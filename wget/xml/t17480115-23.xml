            . The Prisoner brought this holland to my master's shop, Mr. Norman's, a pawnbroker in Covent-Garden, on friday, the 8th of Jan.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Styles . Her business is to carry goods to Covent-Garden market: she offered to pawn it, and asked six shillings upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth?</p>
               <p>Styles . I believe, if it was to be bought out of a linen-draper's shop, it is worth five shillings an ell; but four shillings to be sure. I asked her whose it was, for I said it was not hers; and she said it was her own, three times over: and at last she owned that it was not hers, but that she brought it from a friend of hers to pledge. I asked who that friend was; she said, that was nothing to me, for she was the person that brought it. Said I, if you will let me know your friend, I will go and ask her whether it is her property; I thought she did not appear as if she was the owner of such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150026"></xptr> holland as that; she had that child in her arms, and a boy of about eight or nine years of age with her. Said she to the boy, take the child out of my arms, and I will jump over the compter, and take it from him. I got a constable, and had her before Justice Burdus, but she did not confess any thing that I know of.</p>

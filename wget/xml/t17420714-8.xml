            . I live at the Bird-Cage the corner of Wood street. On the 21st of June I missed some Money out of a Drawer, I cannot justly say how much. I can take upon me to say 2 Guineas positively. - I had counted the Money the Night before, and there were near 50 Guineas. The Drawer was not broke open. I found the Prisoner had Money, and that he had bespoke a new Suit of Cloaths, and a Wigg; I went to the Master he lived with before, to inquire if he knew of his having any Money, he told me he believed he had none, for that he had borrowed half a Crown to buy a pair of Shoes. On Monday I took him into a Room with two or three Neighbours, and put it close to him, and he immediately confessed he had robbed me, desired his Box to be brought down, took his Key and opened it, took the Money out, and said, This is the Money I took from you last Sunday Morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not all the Money he mentions, for I had Half a Guinea and three Sixpences of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any promises of Indulgence before he confessed; for the Jury will consider that.</p>

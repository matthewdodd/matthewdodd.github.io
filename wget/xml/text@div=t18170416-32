               wilful murder of her male bastard child
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>MARY WALSINGHAM. I lodged in the same house with the prisoner. I had observed she was pregnant, but never accused her of it. On Friday, the 21st of February, she was at breakfast in the landlady's room about twelve o'clock. At half-past two o'clock, I was fetched by White, and went to the room with her. The prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160015"></xptr>washing there. I said you was in the family way. She said, yes. I said, are you now? She answered, no. I asked her where her child was? She replied, she had got it. I insisted on knowing where it was, and she took me up into her room, and turned the pillow and bolster back, and took the child up in her arms: it had a cap on, a flannell round its body, and a handkerchief tied round its mouth. I said, "you hussey, you have murdered it;" she said she had not, and appeared flurried. I asked her what the handkerchief was tied round its mouth for; she told me it was to keep its jaw from falling. I then informed her that was not the way. She took it off; it was tied, three times round, a little above the mouth. I do not know whether it was loose or not: the handkerchief was not wet. I went for the parish officer. The child was warm when I saw it-it was quite clean. She called herself a married woman. My room is two pair of stairs above her's. I could not hear any noise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. She confessed that she had been in the family way without hesitation, and shewed me the child directly. It is usual to tie up the jaw of a dead person. The prisoner bore a very good character.</p>

            . On the 21st of February, I slept in the next room to the prisoner. If a child had cried in the night I must have heard it - I did not. I saw the prisoner about one o'clock in the afternoon; she had been poorly for sometime. About ten o'clock, I asked her if she would help me to wash - She said she was poorly. I went into her room again; she was in bed; she got up and had breakfast. I went into her room about two o'clock, and experienced an unpleasant smell. She was washing in my room. In consequence of what my mother said to me, I looked under her pillow and bolster, and saw the child's head. I went away, and afterwards went into the room with Mrs. Walsingham-the prisoner shewed her the child. The account Mrs. Walsingham has given is correct. The child had no marks of violence on it. I knew nothing about the handkerchief, for I was frightened, and ran out of the room. When she was accused of the murder, she ran through our room with her bonnet and shawl on, and a bundle in her hands. I stopped her; she said she was going away, because they said she had murdered the child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The child looked quite composed-there was no distortion of features.</p>

            . I am an overseer of the parish of St. Andrew and St. George. On Friday, the 21st of February, about four o'clock, White fetched me to the house; I took Mr. Taylor with me. About six o'clock in the evening, I took the prisoner to the workhouse; on our way there, I asked her why she had tied the handkerchief round the child's neck; she said, to keep its jaw from falling. I asked her what time she delivered herself; she said, between five and six o'clock, and that she heard the watchman call half past five. I asked her if it cried - She said it did not.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES TAYLOR. I am surgeon and apothecary to the Parish. I accompanied Mr. Povah to the house, and carefully examined the child externally. The flannel and cap were taken off before me; there was no appearance whatever of injury, nor any marks of violence on its face and neck. If a handkerchief had been tied round its throat to destroy it, I should suppose it would have shown symptoms by which I should have known it. I carefully examined the body internally-there was nothing that denoted violence. From the state of the lungs, I considered that it never could have breathed - They were collapsed. Mr. Vincent saw it after me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The lungs appeared never to have been inflated.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Mr. Taylor's opinion perfectly agrees with mine; it is my opinion, that the functions of respiration had never been duly performed-the child could not have been born alive.</p>

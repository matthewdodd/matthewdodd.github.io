On the 21st of May I lived at No. 7, Chequer-alley, Bunhill-row - I was eating my dinner about half-past one o'clock, and saw the prisoner pass by our window; I had known him about three months - in less than five minutes after he passed I heard a cry of Policeman! Stop thief! I got up from my dinner, and ran out; I saw the prisoner running past me- he had the bundle under his arm, and the sleeve of the coat hanging out of the handkerchief; I ran after him along with the rest, but we missed him after he went into Gloucester-buildings - I did not see him go into any house; I did not see him again till he was in custody at Worship-street - when he first passed our house he was walking, and had no bundle; the last witness lost his bundle at the corner of George-court - the wall of that court faces our window: the prisoner had a white flannel jacket on, corderoy trousers, and a yellow handkerchief - I am sure I knew him; he had lodged at my father's house for a fortnight, but not at that time.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Jenkins, and live in Gloucester-buildings, Whitecross-street. On the 21st of May Sivewright called me in; I saw the prisoner behind the door, with a bundle in his hand - he said,"Don't say a word, mistress, don't say a word - I am a poor man out of work;" I said, "From where did you steal this coat?" he said, "From a shop in Bunhill-row;" he also said, "If I leave the coat I will come in the evening for it, and pay you for your trouble;" I said No, and told him to get out of the house with it - he went away.</p>
               <p>JOHN CUMMINGS. I am the witness' father. I sent my son to get a coat on Saturday, the 21st of May, from Mr. Boys, Church-court, Strand; he came back with two women, without the coat, which was new, and worth 3l. 12s.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOOPER. I am a constable of St. Luke's. -In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner, on Monday morning, the 13th of June, at No. 10 or 11, Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street; I went up stairs to him, and said, "Tom, you are the man I want;" he asked me what for - I said, "For the coat;" he said he knew nothing whatever of it; he had a yellow handkerchief on at the time - I have not got it here: he called to a female in the adjoining room, to give him the handkerchief which he had lent her; she brought him a black handkerchief - he pulled the yellow one off his neck, and put a black one on; he had corderoy trousers on, and a waistcoat with sleeves - he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Monday three weeks, in the morning, I was at home - the officer came up to where I lodged; he locked the door, and said he wanted me - he took me to the office, and stated the case to the Magistrate, but I knew no more about it than a child; at the time of the robbery I was twenty-seven miles from here, at work at my trade at Bagshot - I came to town, and was taken; the witnesses have sworn they saw me take the coat from the boy in the street, but I never saw the boy before, nor these two women; I had not been in town for two months - I have got no witnesses, for I was ashamed to send for any.</p>

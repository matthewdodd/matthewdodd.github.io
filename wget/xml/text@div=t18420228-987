                  </hi>. I am under beadle at the coal market. On the 24th of February, I was in a room at the end of the passage, and my atten<lb></lb>tion was attracted to the passage—on coming out of my room, I looked up and missed the gas-bracket—I saw the prisoner at a little distance from my room—I asked him who he wanted—he said, "Mr. Russell" I went with him to Mr. Russell's room—when he got there he went into the room—I was outside—he came out of the room—I said, "You said you wanted Mr. Russell"—he said, "Yes, I did," and then he said be wanted two coal merchants—I then put my hand to his coat pocket, and felt something, which I believe was the rack—he turned, and I heard something put down on a wooden stand—I put my hand down and it was this gas-rack—I said, "This is what you had in your pocket"—I had not noticed it in its place that morning—I had seen it the day before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable No.</hi> 547.) The prisoner was given into my charge—I took him to the station, and found on him this small screw, by which the burner had been fixed to the apparatus—he said it must have dropped into his pocket.</p>

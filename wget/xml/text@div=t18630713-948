                  </hi>. I am a barman residing at Barking—on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, 15th June, about half-past 9, I was going along the Barking-road, and hearing a noise in a place called Palsy-lane, I ran across the fields, and saw two gipsies fighting, Lee and Nicholls—Chilcot was there acting as second to Nicholls—I saw Young there with a sponge and a lemon—I saw him sponge Nicholls between the rounds—I remained there about three-quarters of an hour—I then saw Nicholls struck a blow by Lee, and he fell down—he died in about half an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gipsy, and am encamped at North Woolwich—on 15th June I saw the fight between Lee and Nicholls—I was only staying there—I was on neither side in particular; more on Lee's side than Nicholls'—they had the words on the 4th; what began it was, Nicholls' mother, Happy Nicholls, and Lee's wife had a disagreement, and Happy Nicholls struck her, and the two women had a fight—the men came and parted them, and they had words, and had three or four rounds; but the policeman came and stopped them—a day or two afterwards they agreed to fight on the 15th—they shook hands, and then commenced fighting; there were no ap<lb></lb>pointed seconds—sometimes they would pick themselves up, and sometimes one and another would pick them up—Chilcot and Young might have picked them up in their turns, but no more than the others that I saw—I don't know that I saw a sponge in either of their hands—Nicholls threw himself down several times to avoid being hit—I saw them both strike in the last round, and Nicholls fell—he did not fall apparently from the blow—he appeared to fall down; he had got a blow in the jaw before that—he never got up—I saw Young there at the time.</p>

From his head—it caused a turn in his eye for about twelvemonths afterwards, and he carried his head on one side—on the occasion of this last fight Nicholls' and Lee's tribes were drawn out; there were about thirteen women and thirty men altogether—I believe the women assisted in taking them up—Nicholls was very much cleverer in fighting than Lee—he used to practice with the gloves, and if ever there was a set-to in a booth at a fair, he would go in.</p>

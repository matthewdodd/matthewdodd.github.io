                  </hi>. I am going on for twelve years old, and am the daughter of William Parker, of 20, Baker-street, Bethnal-green. On Saturday afternoon, 27th Sept., I went to my uncle's, the prisoner's, to clean his rooms, it was about 1 o'clock—the prisoner was at home and my aunt, the deceased; they were up-stairs—I went into the room down-stairs immediately under them, and heard some quarrelling going on, and some blows—I went up; the door was open; I went in, and saw the prisoner strike my aunt in the back, once or twice, and she buried her face in the bed—I did not remain long; I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tin-plate worker, of 1, Denmark-place, Old-street-road, four doors from the prisoner's house. On the afternoon of 27th Sept., between 3 and 4 o'clock, the deceased came to my house by her<lb></lb>self; the prisoner followed very soon after her—on his coming in, she appeared rather excited—he attempted to strike her, but I went between them—he ordered her out of my place, and wished her to go home—she said she would not; she was in danger of her life—he said again, "Will you come? say the word"—she made no reply—they had both been drinking in the fore-part of the day, but had partially recovered, and were neither drunk or sober—I per<lb></lb>suaded the prisoner to leave my house; he did so—the deceased did not remain long in my house; my wife went home with her about 4—about half-past 5, the prisoner came out of his house towards my door, where I was standing—he said, "I have given her something that will learn her not to tell my brother that I was the cause of the <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> "—I said, "I think you had better leave her alone; some of these days you will do her a mischief, and then you will be sorry for it"—when the deceased left my house, she was perfectly free from any injury, that I could see.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 24th Sept., about 4 o'clock, the prisoner and deceased were in our house; they were both tipsy—I took her home; she walked by herself—I undressed her all but her cap, and put her into bed—the prisoner was not in the room then—there was no injury on her face then—I left her between 6 and 7—as the little girl came to me, I went, and saw a wound on the deceased's head, and blood running from it into her mouth; her eyes were quite closed; I did not speak to her; she appeared to be quite insensible; her relations were there—about a fortnight previous, she had a fit, and had complained of her head—she was in her usual state of health, all but the drink; she bad been tipsy, but had recovered.</p>

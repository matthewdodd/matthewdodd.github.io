I asked him where, he said at Bath - I said I had been at Bath about four years ago, but I never recollected seeing him before. I said I was a servant, he said, he was also a servant out of place, and asked me to give him something to drink. I called for a pot of ale and paid for it - we drank it, and I left him there. The next time that I saw him, was about three months after, I met him accidentally in Bond-street, he asked me if I would give him anything to drink; I told him he was already tipsy, and did not want any more. He said he was in great need of something, and I gave him a glass of gin. I saw no more of him until the 17th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. State distinctly what passed then - A. On the 17th of November, about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, I was shutting up my master's dining-room shutters, and two men passed the door with the prisoner - I did not know that he knew where I lived. The prisoner returned, and rang at the door, I suppose he must have seen me - I went to the door. He asked if a person of the name of Randall lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know your name before - A. Not that I know; I had not told him, I said there was; he asked if I was the person. I said I was the person; he said then he wanted 5 l. of me - I asked him what demand he had on me for 5 l. He said he was in great distress, and money he wanted, and money he would have, and that of me. I said I had not got 5 l., or half that sum - he desired me then to get him 1 l. I said I had not got 1 l., he said if I had not got the money, I had the means to raise it. I told him I had no means to raise it. He then called me a b - y thundering b - g - r, and said if I did not instantly get it him, he would instantly dish me. He said that he would go in to my master, and ruin my character, and that he would swear to my master that I wanted to take diabolical liberties with him. I told him I had nothing but my character to depend upon for my living. He said that he knew, and if I valued my character more than a 1 l. note, I must stand by consequence. I again said I had no money to give him. He then hit my breeches-pocket, and said he heard money gingle there, and desired me to give him what I had got, which I did - it was 1 s., and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it induced you to give him that money - A. Under the idea of being charged with a diabolical act, which I feared would ruin my character - I was afraid of losing my character.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any fear of your person - A. No. I was afraid of losing my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any fear that he would go in to your master, and make the charge against you if you did not give it him - A. Yes - I was not afraid of being taken up for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did he say - A. On my giving him the money, he said you have got a watch - I said if I had, I should not give it to him - I had not got it about me. He desired me to go down and get some of my master's plate. I said I should not make away with my master's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020022"></xptr>property. He said he knew I had some clothes - I said I had only one suit out of livery. He said he did not care what I had got, but money he would have or the value of it before he left the house, I then went down, and got him a blue frock-coat, which I gave him and he went away with it.</p>

               <p>Q. What induced you to give him the coat - A. The same cause I stated before - I was down stairs about five minutes getting the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of your fellow-servants during that time - A. No - I did not go to consult them, I was so agitated at the time, and a party of gentlemen were coming to dinner - I had not a minute to spare, when I took him the coat. He said he would pawn it, and return me the duplicate, nothing more passed - he went away, and was joined by his two companions, who were in Manchester-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On the following evening, while you was waiting at dinner, was there a ring at the bell - A. Yes, I was called out, and saw one of the people who accompanied the prisoner the night before. He said something to me - I answered him. I went outside the door, and saw the prisoner - in about a minute he said he had brought the duplicate of my coat, but he should not leave it until he had got a 1 l. note. I told him I had no money, and I should charge the first watchman who came by, with him. He said he did not care a d - n for the watchman or me either, and he was not going to be frightened. He then entered the door, and said he would be d - d if he would not remain there until I got him some money. I shut the inner door, and left him in the hall, between the street, and the inner door - the street door was open. I returned, and waited at dinner - in about an hour after, I went up and found him still there in the hall - he asked if I had got the money, I told him No. He said he was not going to be humbugged. I said if he would go out with me, I would see if I could get some for him. I then went out, and saw two persons standing at the corner of Manchester-street - my master's house is at the corner of the street. On my coming out, they went one way, and the prisoner, and I went together to Marshall-street, Carnaby-market. Not finding my acquaintance at home, I called upon Harrison, in Shepherd's-court, Brook-street, I saw him - I left the prisoner at the door. I came out in about two minutes, and found him waiting at the door - he asked me if I had got the money. I said, I had not got it, I could not, nor would not get it. When we got into Brook-street, he put himself in a posture before me, and said, d - n me, if you move until you have given me the money, and that he would go home to the house and blow up, if I did not instantly give him the money - I thought he meant he would go to my master's house. He said if he did not go himself, he would send one of his companions.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time were any persons at hand - A. Two soldiers were passing at the time. They stopped, and asked what he wanted with me. I said he wanted money - one of them said something to him, which I did not hear - one went and got a watchman, and advised me to have him taken up - the prisoner said something, which I did not hear, and the watchman took him. I went to the watch-house, in Mount-street, with him.</p>
               <p>Q. In going from Brook-street to Mount-street, did he say anything - A. I could not hear. A great mob were collected, and they were some way before me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What did you go so far with him for - A. To consult some person what I had better do. I saw Harrison who advised me to have him taken up, which I did immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever seen him before you met him at the public-house - A. Never. I am quite certain I never had any communication, or spoke to him before; nor have I had any communication whatever with him of any kind, except what I have mentioned; nor have I seen him at any other times. His threat was falsely to charge me with what I have stated.</p>

            . I am a private in the second regiment of Guards. On the 18th of November, about ten minutes after eight o'clock in the evening, I was passing at the corner of Brook-street, leading into Grosvenor-square, and heard the prisoner making use of very improper words to Randall. Nobody else was within hearing at that time. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Is that the way you speak to any person in the street?". He said,</p>
               <p>"Go along. I want to have nothing to say to you." I told him if that was the case, if he was speaking to me in that manner, I would take other methods with him. I told Randall he had better go along with me, as I was going towards Knightsbridge barracks; he appeared willing to go, and came a few paces with me, the prisoner immediately stopped him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are not going to go off in that manner, Randall. I want some money; I know you have some money, and a 1 l. note I must have." Randall said he had no 1 l. note to give him. The prisoner said he knew where Randall lived, and he would go and blow up there. I turned round and saw a watchman coming, with a gentleman, towards me. I gave him in charge. He went on towards Grosvenor-square, in the custody of myself and the watchman, a little way, when the prisoner said to the watchman,</p>
               <p>"This is not the man I have demanded the money of (meaning me); it is the other man. Let me go." Randall was following. I suppose he meant Randall, nobody else was by. I said,</p>
               <p>"No; watchman do your duty, and I will go with you to the watch-house." We took him there. When we got there, the prosecutor said the prisoner had pledged a coat of his; he heard it, and produced the duplicate, and offered it to Randall. I said</p>
               <p>"Do not take it. Give it to the constable," which was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not come out of the house in the court, with Randall, in coloured clothes - A. No; I came quite accidentally. I did not know the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in your regimentals - A. No. I had every thing on, except my regimental coat and hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words you heard at first - A. He was only swearing at him.</p>

            . I am in the third regiment of Guards. On the 18th of November, a little after eight o'clock, I came across Grosvenor-square by accident. I heard a noise, and found the prisoner speaking to the prosecutor. They were strangers to me. I heard the prisoner say to the prosecutor,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, give me some money, for I am not going to stand here all day. I know where you live, and I will follow you home, if you do not give it to me now, and then I shall get it." I said to him,</p>
               <p>"That is very rough usage to give to a gentleman in the street;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020023"></xptr>and told the prosecutor, if I was him, I would give him in charge of a watchman. There was none by at the time. The prisoner stood with his arms before him, and put himself in a posture. I thought he was going to strike me or the prosecutor. I put my hand up and pushed him back. He said he had nothing to do with such a blackguard as me. The watchman came directly and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you dressed - A. I had white trowsers and my drill jacket on.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Wednesday night, the 18th of November, a little after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner nearly at the corner of Upper Brook-street and Grosvenor-square, the prosecutor and two soldiers were there also, and some more persons round.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner doing - A. He stood with his back against the railing. I heard one of the people say,</p>
               <p>"You are a d - d scoundrel, and ought to be given in charge of the watch." As soon as I got up, I asked what was the matter? Nabb, I believe, who was one of the soldiers, ordered me take him in charge. I laid hold of his arm. He went on with me towards Mount-street watch-house. As we went along the square he said</p>
               <p>"What business have you with me? I did not ask you for anything, nor demand any thing of you." That was all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not somebody make an answer to it - A. Not that I heard. The prosecutor gave him in charge at the watch-house, for wanting to extort money from him, by pretending to lay a diabolical charge against him. The prisoner produced a duplicate to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody say anything to induce him to give it - A. Not that I know. I heard nothing said. It was given to the constable of the night by request of the prosecutor, and some other people that were present.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor met me in Covent-Garden, and asked if I had not been at Bath? I said I left there in February last, and had lived with Mrs. Jackson there. He said he knew her very well. He took me to a public-house. We came out at one o'clock. He asked me to walk down the Strand with him. I said I should be locked out if I did. He took me to Manchester-square, where he lived. I slept there in the servants' hall till the morning, and breakfasted with him and the cook. It rained, and I stopped there till one o'clock. He invited me to drink tea with him. I met him again in Fitzroy-square; after that in Bond-street, and, about two months ago I met him in Oxford-street. He said if I wanted 10 s. at any time he would give it to me. I went to him on this evening, and asked him to lend me a 1 l. note. He said he had not got it, but he should have it in a few days, as he was going to leave his place, which he has. He lent me his coat to pledge. I was to return him the ticket. Another person pledged it, and I took him the duplicate. He said if I would wait till he had done dinner, he would get me the remainder of the 1 l, I walked to a house with him, he went in and returned out of the house with the soldier. He said he wanted to go home. I asked him for the note he promised me. He called the watch, and gave me in charge. I never charged him with anything like what he has said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boat builder, and live at 4, Mill-place, in the parish of Lime House—on the night of 11th May, I was the last person up in the house—the doors and windows were all safe—I particularly noticed the landing window, because I had an engagement with a friend that evening, and I looked out of the landing window to see whether he had a light in his window—I can swear that it was shut—next morning I found it open, and found a piece of candle, a knife, and a piece of a bolt—I came down about 6 o'clock—my father made the alarm—I missed a neck<lb></lb>tie from my room—I had hung it across the glass the night before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had nothing at all to do with this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the house open, and 1 went inside—it is true I picked up the cravat—I had not got any place to sleep in; I went inside and picked them up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my brother at 4, Mill-place, Limehouse—on the morning of 12th May I missed a sixpence, a little key and a locket on it, two blue brooches, and several bits of chain, and two copper coins—they were all safe the night before.</p>

He said, if I did not give it him immediately, he would knock my brains out. It was light enough to see him, I could see him very plain. I took a nutmeg-grater out, in which the money had been, but I found it open, and the piece of money was loose in my pocket. While I was feeling for it, I had a little girl, named

               <p>Q. Had he any weapon?</p>
               <p>E. Alderman. He had a large stick, which he held up, but never struck me. He had a kind of a drab-coloured coat on, and the same kind of a wig as he has on now. I am as sure of knowing him, as I am of knowing any man.</p>

When we came to the turnpike on the other side Buckingham-gate, I sent Mr. Taylor to keep about an hundred yards before me; and if any thing should happen, I would be up before he was attacked. Going on, I met the prisoner. I said to the person with me, I believe that is he that is gone by. I observed he had a stick under his arm. We went to the other end of the field, where I had ordered Mr. Taylor to wait. Then I told him, I believed I had met the man. We went back again. When we came near the spot where I met him, I saw a man's head looking just over the bank. I took no notice to them with me. I jumped over the bank, and saw his full body. He was leaning against a bank, looking over a hedge about five yards from me. I went up to him and said, What do you do here? He made no answer. This was about seven in the evening; it was a moon-light night. I called the others to me, and ordered them to hand-cuff him. At last he said, he was easing himself. He had this stick in his hand.

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Middlesex Street—on Sunday evening, 25th April, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was with two friends, in High Street, Whitechapel—the prisoner came up, got hold of me by my throat and chain, and put his knuckles into my throat, so that I could hardly speak—I called "Police!" and "Murder!" and so did my friends, and the police took the prisoner—he hurt me very much—my chain did not give way as the prisoner ran away, when he saw the mob—I lost sight of him; but saw him again in three minutes, and am certain of him.</p>

On Sunday evening, 24th April, I was in Aldgate, watching, and at a few minutes past 8 o'clock I saw the prisoner, and two men not in custody, together—I watched them three quarters of an hour; they walked backwards and forwards, and at about 8.45 I saw the prisoner lay hold of the prosecutrix's watch chain—he had his right hand to her neck, and pressed his knuckles into it—her friend cried "Murder!" and "Police!" and they ran away—I caught the prisoner a few yards from the prosecutrix, and took him to the station—only an old knife was found on him—he gave his address 10, Dorset Street, Spitalfields, where I found his mother and step-father.</p>

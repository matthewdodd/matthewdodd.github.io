               <p>I am a publican, and have dealt in horses. I bought a mare of Holbrook; the prisoner Mead was in company. I gave 19 guineas and another horse for her; I sold her to the Reverend Dr. Bishop, and in three or four days I was applied to by Mr. Wakefield, and got her back from the doctor. I went into Newgate to see the prisoners, and I said in the gaol I did not know either of the prisoners, but I was frightened.</p>

               <p>I have been a Lawyer. I have known the prisoner five years; I stole Mr. Wakefield's mare on the 14th of July out of Mr. Wakefield's field, and put her into a stable till I could get another, which I did immediately, and at one the same morning we set off and came to Taddle House, near Frome in Somersetshire. When we came to Mr. Bowell's, he said, You have a fine mare, will you sell her? I said I would;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179207040020"></xptr>but if he had another horse, I would rather make a chop with him; I asked him 35 guineas; he said the money was too much; he gave me 19 guineas and a poney; the 19 guineas was shared among four of us; we went into the country to commit a robbery. I have been in this line of thieving 18 months; I believe I have stolen 12 or 13 horses; I never said I did not mean to hurt the prisoner Mead; I never said so to Dixon or Bruce; I never was in custody in my life before.</p>

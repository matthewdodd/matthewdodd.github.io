                  </hi>. I live in Russell-court, Brydges-street, the prisoner was my servant. On the 3rd of April I had a leather purse, which con<lb></lb>tained two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—I thought I put it into the desk, but it was not there—I told the prisoner to look for it—she said she could not find it—I had my suspicion—she was taken, and the purse found on her—this watch-guard, neck-chain, and other things, were found in her box—I had not missed them, but they are mine—this is my purse—it contained two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns (<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

In consequence of what the prosecutor said to me, I went to the prisoner, and told her her master had been robbed of some money—I asked if she had any money by her—she said, "No," where should she get it?—I said, "You have got money by you, feel in your pocket"—she then said, "I think I have got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by me"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—she said, "If you don't take me away from here I will tell you; I robbed my master of it"—she went on her knees, and begged I would not do any thing to her—I called the officer—she took the money out, and said, "There, that is my master's money; don't say any more about it."</p>

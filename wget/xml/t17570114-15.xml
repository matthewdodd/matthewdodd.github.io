             got her hand into my side pocket where my gold was. I pulled it out three times. Then she got her hand into that pocket where my silver was, and took the 4 s. out and two bad half-pence. I got up and ran to the Glass-house and got assistance, returned and found them in the same house, and took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give them the money?</p>
               <p>Brinton. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both pull you into the house?</p>
               <p>Brinton. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you on the bed?</p>
               <p>Brinton. There was no bed, it was only a bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Brinton. I was not much in liquor, I was sensible of what they did.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you able to walk ?</p>
               <p>Brinton. Yes I was, but not to make a very good walk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know these women again?</p>
               <p>Brinton. I came by the very same house, backwards and forwards, to and from work these two years, and have seen them at that door many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Plunket do any thing to you after you was in the house?</p>
               <p>Brinton. She was by all the time, but did not rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she help to fling you on the bedstead?</p>
               <p>Brinton. She joined with the other in doing it.</p>

            ; as we had some beer, he said. I'll join with you, I have a shilling and am willing to spend it. He called for a pint of beer, and we drank out of it. He gave Mrs. Murphy a guinea instead of a shilling. The woman said, take care of your money, for I believe that is a guinea which you gave Mrs. Murphy; which appeared to be so.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, upon your oath, see either of these women there?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear I did.</p>
               <p>Q. From M. Williams. Did not you offer Mrs. Murphy a guinea to change instead of a shilling ?</p>
               <p>Brinton. I did. I had a guinea amongst my silver, and I gave her the guinea instead of a shilling to change, to pay for a pint of hot, but these women did not go along with me into the house as I know of.</p>
               <p>M. Williams. The woman that was with him said, that is a guinea. He catched it out of Mrs. Murphy's hand, and took out a shilling and half a guinea; and as sure as God almighty is my judge he had but that shilling in silver.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had four shillings and two bad halfpence in one pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the same women that you drank with?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot say these are the same. I gave some women some hot I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a woman in company with you in that alehouse?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I had no call for one, for I have a wife and family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit down in the house ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get so drunk?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I got drunk at the Black-Boy, at Salt-petre-bank, in taking my money. I am a glass-blower.</p>

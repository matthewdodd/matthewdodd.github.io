               <p>Here his Council remark'd, That the tender Age of the Witnesses and his Character being justly weigh'd , the latter might be thought to counterpoise the former.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Council for the Prosecutors call'd the following additional Evidences.</p>

             depos'd, That he was in the 11th Year of his Age, and being examin'd as to what Sense he had of the Nature of an Oath, gave so Satisfactory an Account to the Court, that he was permitted to be sworn, and depos'd, That about a Month since, the Prisoner sent him up to look after a Carpenter who was at work in the House, to ask him if he had done work, that he came down and told him that he had not done, and after that he bid him go up again, and he came up after him, and pull'd down his Breeches, and stroaked all about his Body.</p>

             depos'd, That the Prisoner bid him go up and see for a String, that he went down and told him that there was no String, that he said there was, and came up himself and bid him go into the Chamber, and being there, he ask'd him (this Evidence) what he ow'd him? He reply'd he could not tell what he meant, that then he took a Sprig of a Rod, and laid him over his Knee and whipp'd him a little: That another time he bid him down with his Breeches, but he ran away and the Prisoner caught him, that he got away again, and his Coat gave way, and he ran down into the School.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner deny'd the Facts, inveigh'd against the Parents of the Boys, who had been Evidences against him; said, they were Persons of so vile a Character, that their good Word was a Scandal, and that the Prosecution was malicious, being carried on by his Enemies who had voted for Mr. Veer , the present Master of the School, now in his Place, and called the following Evidences.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Sister depos'd, That upon hearing the Charge laid upon her Brother, she went without any Knowledge of the Prisoner to Mrs Ham, the Mother of the first Evidence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173005130012"></xptr> and ask'd her what was the Ground of the Clamour rais'd against him? And she answer'd her she could not tell; that she ask'd for the Child, and when he came, she ask'd him what his Master had done to him? That he answered nothing. That she said to Mrs. Ham, is it fit a Man should loose his Reputation for nothing? That she made answer, that Mrs. Allen would tear the House down about our Ears if we don't be Evidences; that she desir'd a Surgeon might be sent for, to examine the Child, and did name Mr. Martin; that she reply'd, God forbid , for her Child had got no harm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Day depos'd, That he had known the Prisoner for some Years, and he used to come to his Master's House, and lie with him, and he never saw any thing but what was handsome by him.</p>

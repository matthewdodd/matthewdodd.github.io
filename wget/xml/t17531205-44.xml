            . On the 22d of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I had carried a pot of beer to my lord Harrington's stable yard; but coming back again, the prisoner stopped me and took my cloak, and I cried out murder.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it tied on?</p>
               <p>E. Keene. No, it was pinned: When I cried out he took it, and threw it four yards from him; and a century came and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to the centinel?</p>
               <p>E. Keene. He said do not tare my rags quite off.</p>

            . On the 22d of November I was centinel at the stable yard, and heard the girl cry out; I ran; she said she had been robbed by that man (meaning the prisoner) of her cloak. Then I laid hold on him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the cloak in his possession?</p>
               <p>J. Copping. I saw it fall to the ground, but cannot say whether it was from her shoulder or his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>J. Copping. He said he did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched?</p>
               <p>J. Copping. He was; but we found no arms upon him.</p>

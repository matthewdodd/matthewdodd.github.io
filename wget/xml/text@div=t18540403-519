                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist. On 21st March, the prisoner came to my shop for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco, and paid with an old shilling—I gave him 11 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—after he had left, I examined the shilling; it was rather dirty; I rubbed the dirt off, and found it to be counterfeit—I put it in my pocket by itself and kept it till the 23rd, when the prisoner came again—I was standing at my door and saw him coming along the street—I recognised him instantly—he came in and asked my mother for half an ounce of tobacco—he gave her a shilling—she looked at it, and handed it to me—I examined it, and found it was bad—I charged him with its being bad, and being the party who had tendered a shilling on the 21st; he said so help him God, he had never been in the shop before—he threw down a good shilling, and wanted the bad one back; I would not give it him—he left, and I followed him till I saw a policeman, and I gave him into custody—when he came the first time, I put the tobacco in an iron box, and when he was taken, the same box was found on him at the station, while he was denying that he was the man.</p>

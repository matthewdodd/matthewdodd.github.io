               <p>Q. Did you miss any watch or seals on Monday the 9th of February. - A. Yes, it was a metal watch and two gold seals. The watch was sent to us by a silversmith of the name of Emanuel; it was not sold in the sale; after the sale we generally returned to that gentleman some lots that were unsold immediately; and we thought it was returned to him, so that we did not miss it for three or four days afterwards. This gentleman made application to me, that I did not put it in my account; he suggested to me that it was at a pawnbrokers in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there. - A. I saw the watch there about three weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go immediately. - A. I had no suspicion of the prisoner; I did not suppose he had taken it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, 178, Drury-lane. I bought the watch of the prisoner, I gave him two guineas for it, he said he was a hatter, and was going to Bristol; that he found business very slack in London; he said it was is own watch. In a few days after I had bought it, Mr. Emanuel called in, he said it was his watch. I produce the watch.</p>

            . Mr. Winfield sent for me to purchase some goods. I saw the watch, I knew it to be my property. I told Mr. Edney of it; he would not go when I wanted him.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Edney) Do you know the watch. - A. Generally I should know it, particularly by the chain; it is more like a jack chain than a watch chain. I should not be able to swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. (to Emanuel). Do you know the watch. - A. I could not swear to the watch, I can swear to the chain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. Can you swear that this is the watch you sent to Mr. Edney's. - A. I do not wish to swear it, if I had my book here I could produce the number upon the watch. I never buy a watch without entering it in my book.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

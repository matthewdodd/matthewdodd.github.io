            . I live with Mr. Wright, in Glocester-place, Commercial-road, and live on my property. On the evening of the 7th of May, I had been to Cow-cross for Mr. Wright, with some medicine, as his boy was not at home. I was returning home through Moorfields. About a quarter after ten o'clock, as I was going by Old Bedlam, I heard some person following me. I turned round, and found it was the prisoner. He followed me about thirty yards. I crossed over to go to <placeName id="t18170521-44-crimeloc230">Bell-alley</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18170521-44-crimeloc230" type="placeName" value="Bell-alley"></interp>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18170521-44-off228 t18170521-44-crimeloc230"></join> - He jumped up to me, and collared me all at once - He held a knife to me, and asked me for my money, saying, "d-n you, do you see this? - deliver your money," holding the knife in one hand, and my collar with the other. It was a little while before I could speak. I then told him I had no money. He then said, "d-n you, where is your watch?" and stroked me down to feel for it. I had no watch about me. He felt in my coat pocket, and took my handkerchief out.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How did he do it - A. He let go my collar, and felt me down with that hand, and he held the knife in my face. I had a parcel in my pocket, and he took the handkerchief out of my pocket. While his eye was off me, I caught hold of the wrist of that hand which held the knife - I got hold of his collar with the other hand, and called out "watch!" loudly; it was a great while before the watchman came-when he got near us, the prisoner also called "watch!" twice-the watchman was an old man. I delivered him to his care, but still held him myself till another came up. I gave him in charge, and he made a charge against me; we took him to the watch-house, and there gave him in charge. I saw him searched-my handkerchief was not found on him, but the knife was found tucked down in his apron. In searching him, we found the flap of his breeches was open-upon that he charged me with indecency - He had not made any such charge before. On my oath I had not done any such thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have been eight or nine years in London. I came from Otley, in Yorkshire; I am independent. I was a merchant at New York, and came from there thirteen years ago. I have lived in and about London eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210015"></xptr>Q. How many prisons in London have you been in?</p>
               <p>Q. How many years is it since you were in the King's Bench - A. Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you in the Fleet - A. Never. The prisoner was quite a stranger to me. He had a dark apron on-it was a butcher's knife. I never asked the watchmen to go back and look for the handkerchief - I told them I had lost it, and that the prisoner had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, before he got to the watch-house, that you had lost your handkerchief - A. Yes, I did, and described it to be yellow. The place where I was robbed is about a quarter of a mile from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you say one single word about the knife to the watchman till you got to the watchhouse - A. Yes, I told the first watchman he had a knife, that he held it up to me, and robbed me of my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word about a knife either before or in the watch-house, till one was found on the prisoner - A. I mean to swear I did tell the watchman as I was going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner called out "watch," and charged you with indecency upon his person, before you called out "watch" - A. It is not true. He did not call"watch" until we got to the watch-house. He had a butcher's jacket on. I know nothing about a reward.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did the prisoner first call out"watch" - A. As the watchman was coming up. I had called a dozen times before he called out once. He wanted to run away. We dragged one another full twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any pocket-book - A. No. I had a few shillings in my waistcoat pocket - He did not search that; he only put his hand into my coat pocket. I never found my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>CHARLES TURNER. I am a watchman. On the night of the 7th of May, about a quarter before eleven, I heard the cry of "watch." I suppose I heard it ten times before I could get up; it was called by two different voices-one called after the other. I came up to the prosecutor and prisoner, in Long-alley; they had hold of each other; the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge, he did not say what for - He did not say what he had done - I took him to the watch-house directly; as they were going there nothing passed, not a word, either by the prosecutor or the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor, as he was going to the watchhouse, tell you that the prisoner had robbed him, and had a knife in his hand - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. My Lord, after this, I certainly cannot proceed any further in this prosecution.</p>

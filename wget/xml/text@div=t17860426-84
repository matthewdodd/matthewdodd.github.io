             and a man came home at one o'clock, on a Saturday night, about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Were they sober when they came home? - Middling sober.</p>
               <p>Did any body come home with them? - Nobody but their two selves.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - At home.</p>
               <p>How near do you live to them? - At that time I lived in the house with them; and in about an hour after the prisoner and her husband came in.</p>
               <p>Do they lodge in the same house too? - No, the man that lived with the deceased is brother to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did they come about? - About a son that she has at sea, to tell her brother of it.</p>
               <p>Was you in the room with them? - Yes; and the words began about the boy that is at sea; and this woman, the prisoner, put the deceased in a passion.</p>
               <p>What did she do or say, to put her in a passion? - She was talking about the boy that is at sea, and she said he was dead.</p>
               <p>Why should that put the deceased in a passion? - Because the deceased said, he had better be dead, than come home, for he had no house nor habitation; and the prisoner said, why was it so; and the deceased said, it would be a happy turn, if please God to take him; and so the prisoner called the deceased a b - h, or something or another; and she put her in such a big passion, that she up with her hand and slapped her face; the deceased slapped the prisoner's face; then after, the prisoner took and held her hands, and shook her; I fancy she took and shook her; and the deceased fell down; and she got some hurt in her back; I do not know how she came by it, without she fell against the box.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether she fell against the box or no? - Sir, she fell down, but whether she hit herself against the box or no, I cannot say; but she said, she did hurt herself against the box; her husband picked her up, and she complained of her back, most monsirous of a pain in her back; and afterwards there were words between them, and they went at it again; and they went out into the yard.</p>
               <p>What do you call going at it? - Why, fighting, and shaking one another.</p>
               <p>Did they strike? - The deceased had the most blows; this woman did not fight her; she held her hands, and shook her well.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased do, did she try to fight? - Oh yes; she fought again, to take her own part.</p>
               <p>Who was it that began the second time? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What did she say or do, to begin the second time? - It was about the boy; I sat by the fire, and in about a quarter of an hour I heard the cry of murder; what they were doing in the yard I cannot tell; they went out after the two men; I got up and went out, and this prisoner had hold of her by her hand; and held her hands, and shook her well.</p>
               <p>Was the deceased at that time standing, or was she on the ground? - Standing both of them; it was the deceased cried murder; I knew her voice.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased do, while the prisoner had hold of her hand? - She strove to strike as well as she could with her hand.</p>
               <p>Did you interpose to put a stop to this? - They soon let one another go, and the deceased complained of her back and they did not go to it any more; they both came in.</p>
               <p>What became of the husbands of those two people? - They were in the yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260131"></xptr> and drinking; they were trying to part them when I went out.</p>
               <p>Did she complain of her back before she went out the second time? - Yes; and she complained of her back when she came in; and when her husband came in, her passion was so great, that she took some red hot fire out with her hand, and hove it at him.</p>
               <p>What did she take the fire out with? - In her hand.</p>
               <p>Was it wood or coal? - Coal; and then afterwards she took up the poker, and she hit him over his head; then after he took a stick, and was going to lick her; and I took the stick from him and broke it; and then I believe it was all over; then they made it all up again; and then the prisoner called the deceased out, and told her she wanted to speak to her, and the deceased said, what do you want to speak to me, how you have almost killed me? and the prisoner said, says she, almost killed you, if it had not been for your brother, I would have laid you for dead; and then afterwards they went home together to the prisoner's house in Old-street.</p>
               <p>The deceased did not live at the prisoner's house at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What did they go home for? - They went to get some victuals for the man; the deceased brought some meat home with her.</p>
               <p>How long after did the deceased come back again with the meat? - I take it, she went home about six, and returned about half after six or seven; this was in the morning.</p>
               <p>So then you set up all night in this affray? - Yes; the deceased and the prisoner came home, and the deceased told me where she got it; I dressed the pork; we had it for breakfast; and the deceased eat very heartily; but she still complained of her back and her belly till she died; she eat nothing more; she kept about till she went to bed; and she got up no more till she was brought to bed.</p>
               <p>When was she brought to bed? - On the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did you see the child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any judgment, can you tell me whether it was at its full time? - No Sir, it was about six months; it lived about three hours after she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Did you apprehend she was not more than six months gone? - No; I believe she was not.</p>
               <p>How soon did you discover that she had labour pains upon her, and was likely to be brought to bed? - I cannot say how soon, she complained all day of the Monday and all night; and she was brought to bed at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had she any assistance? - Yes, a midwife.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in liquor; as well as the deceased? - Yes, the prisoner was very much in liquor; the deceased was not so much in liquor.</p>
               <p>How long have you known them? - I was with them a twelvemonth constant.</p>
               <p>What business did the husband follow? - He is a wheelwright.</p>
               <p>How had they lived together, were they good friends, or did they live jangling? - They agreed very well.</p>
               <p>They did not bear any ill will to one another that you observed? - I cannot say; the deceased said, if ever she got over it, as her child was dead, that she would get a warrant for this woman, and keep it by her, they did not bear any will to one another that I observed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you remember any conversation between these two women about the deceased having no bread for her children? - The prisoner's husband cut two slices of bread off for the deceased and some butter.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation with her after she had got the pork and things, about coals? - Yes; she borrowed seven farthings of the prisoner for coals after the quarrel.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it known among you that the deceased was with child? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260132"></xptr>She complained in general that she had been ill used? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether she was ill or not? - Yes, she was ill, she complained of a violent pain in her back.</p>
               <p>Was you with her after that? - I saw her on the Monday, about five or six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was she then in bed, or up? - She then was in bed; when I went in, she said, she was very bad, I asked her what was the matter, she told me, she had been in a violent pain, and she believed it was through the ill usage that this woman had given her.</p>
               <p>I do not ask the account of what the woman did to her, but I want to know her condition; when did you apprehend that she might be likely to be brought to bed? - On the Tuesday morning she sent for me in, and when I went in, she says to me, Oh, Betty, I am very bad, and I asked her a few private questions, and she told me, as I could understand, that she was going to be delivered, or at least to miscarry; I said, if please God, I will go and ask Mrs. Martin to come to you, she is your landlady, and is a midwife, and she came immediately half dressed and half undressed, and when she in, I said, Mrs. Martin, I believe every things is ready for you.</p>
               <p>When was she delivered? - On that Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>How soon after Mrs. Martin came? - Why Sir, the deceased was delivered I may say before she came in; the child was born before the midwife came.</p>
               <p>The child died soon I understand? - The child lived about three hours, and the woman died the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Did she apprehend herself to be in danger before she died? - She said, from the beginning to the last, that she thought she never could recover it; she said, if please God she went to bed, she thought never to get out of it, she said, I shall be worse to-morrow than I am now.</p>
               <p>After she was brought to bed, did she tell you any particulars? - After she was brought to bed, and the child died, she said, Betty, if please God I die, I hope you will do your endeavour to see justice done me, and take up that wicked hussey for murdering me and my child.</p>
               <p>Now at this time, did she tell you what it was in particular that the woman had done to her? - She had told me all before.</p>
               <p>Did she repeat it at that time? - I cannot say she did, she said to me as thus, says she, Betty, I wish I had some relief; that was after the child lay dead on the table, I said, I will go to the parish officers and see if I cannot get you some; I went to the gentlemen, and got a note for the apothecary; the apothecary was not at home, I went again at two o'clock, and the apothecary said, he could not come till ten o'clock the next day.</p>
               <p>Had you a note from the parish officer to the apothecary? - Yes, Sir, I delivered it into the apothecary's house; with that the gentlemen of the parish said, if we would stay till about five at night, they would see what was the reason he could not come, and they would make him; between five and six they came and saw her, and went out again, and said, provided he did not come, they would bring another within half an hour or an hour; and as they said, so they did, about six on the Wednesday afternoon.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a carpenter by trade; I happened to be in the room at the same time.</p>
               <p>You are the person that they call the prisoner's husband? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It seems you are not her husband? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor the deceased's man was not her husband neither it seems? - No.</p>
               <p>A scandalous state you all live in! relate what you know of this? - The prisoner went to see her brother on account of her son, to know if he knew any thing of the Rattlesnake being blow up, in which he was; I was very unwilling to let her go, but she prevailed upon me; when we went there first, she spoke to her brother; he said, no; the deceased said, I am glad to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260133"></xptr> hear he is blown up; the prisoner made answer, I think it is a very cruel thing to have a person blown up into the air, without having time to say, Lord have mercy upon me! They discoursed of this some time, and at last bad words arose; at last the deceased flew into a very great rage, and with a very bad word in her mouth, which was, d - n your eyes, you b - ch, I will murder you; upon which, she took up something to strike her with, which I think was a dish, or something of that sort; the prisoner wrenched it from her hand, and held her for some time; then she let her go; she took up a brick, and swore she would put her eyes out with the brick; upon which the prisoner laid hold of that, and took it away from her, and after that she held her hands, the deceased endeavouring to beat the prisoner; and the deceased offered to kick the prisoner; and there was a box lay pretty near to the bed's foot, which she tumbled over; I saw her, and I believe she fell against the bed-side, and hit herself; in a little time after, they went into the yard, we all did, to drink a couple of pots of beer, which I had sent for.</p>
               <p>What, did you drink your beer in the yard? - It is a kind of a garden.</p>
               <p>What, go out into the yard to drink in the night, in the middle of April? - Yes; we had the beer out, and could not drink it on this happening; when we had been in the yard a little while, some words arose again, and the deceased was going to throw something at the prisoner, and the prisoner took hold of her hands, and gave her a shake; we came into the house again; I did not imagine any thing happening, I called to them several times; says I, you will hurt one another, and then you will be sorry for it; I endeavoured for some time to separate them, which I could not obtain.</p>
               <p>So you and Mr. Lewis, that lived with these two women, you stood by, and suffered them to pull themselves to pieces in this manner? - They often had words in this manner before, but they did not hurt one another, and then they went to drink after it.</p>
               <p>Why, you all knew she was with child? - No, I did not; she was a woman that I did not altogether like, and I told the prisoner not to let her come into our room several times, for I did not like her, she had very bad expressions.</p>
               <p>You were both of you two abominable brutes, to let these people tear one another to pieces in this manner? - The deceased cried out murder in the yard, and the prisoner said to her brother, Richard, go and give that woman good words, for she makes a shameful noise; in a very few minutes, we were all friends; I insisted upon the prisoner's coming home, and staying no longer. As we were coming to go home, the deceased said to the prisoner, Fanny, you have got a good loaf to carry home to your children, but I have not got a bit of bread for mine; the prisoner said, you shall have some, and she said to me, Jem, cut her some; I cut three slices, but she thought it was not enough, and she cut a fourth off it; I likewise gave her some butter; then we went to the Crown, and had another pot of beer, to depart in peace; then the deceased said to the prisoner, Fanny, you promised me a hat when your child died; and the prisoner said, that I did; if you will go with me, you shall have it now; and they both went home together; and there happened to lay a piece of pork, which I had bought for dinner, and she seemed to have some kind of inclination to this pork; upon which the prisoner lighted a fire, and broiled some, as I understood, and came and gave it her; I and the other man were at the Crown, drinking the beer.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Crown? - We might stay an hour and a half, or two hours; when we parted from the Crown, we went home alone, and these two women came back to the Crown to us.</p>
               <p>Did any body come back with the two women? - They came by themselves; then we staid a little while, and each went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260134"></xptr> to her own home, all in friendship; I did hear the deceased s ay, I think it was at the Crown, that she had hurt herself by tumbling over that d - ned box; I do not remember hearing her say any thing of it in the house or in the yard; I think it was there; however, that was the expression, and all I heard her say of it.</p>
               <p>So, you do not remember her complaining in the house, or in the yard, of being hurt? - No, I did not take notice, there was a noise; and I thought as the prisoner did not strike her, there could be no damage; all I minded was that the prisoner did not strike her; I saw the deceased again on Tuesday night; that was after she was brought to-bed.</p>

On the 12th of April, between six and seven, or thereabout, Mr. Briant, and the other overseer of the parish, came to my house, and desired me to go with them to see a poor distressed woman, because they said they had sent for the apothecary of the parish, and he would not come; I went with them, and found her in a dying state, with a putrid fever; I told them, this woman is a dead woman, and they desired me to send a trifle in; I sent in a balsamic, that was not taken, and the next day they told me she died, between seven and eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was she at that time in her senses? - She was in her senses, but as low as could be to be alive.</p>
               <p>Had you been informed she had been delivered lately? - Yes; they did not tell me she was ill treated.</p>
               <p>I suppose, in the state she was in, you did not think it of any use to make any enquiry respecting that? - On Friday, Mr. Riley and me examined the body, and we found several bruises and contusions in different parts of the body, and particularly on the os sacrum, and between the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260136"></xptr> shoulders, and the upper part and the lower part of the left arm; then, according to my own opinion, it was by violent passions, and by struggling, each of them, which brought on a premature delivery, which was the occasion of her death.</p>

               <p>Are those putrid fevers often the consequence, or do they accompany deliveries? - Always in such cases they cause mortifications.</p>

               <p>Would bruises that have been received a few days before, acquire a worse appearance, in consequence of a putrid fever happening? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>That bruise in the os sacrum, is that a likely thing to happen by a fall against the corner of a box? - Yes, or against the floor.</p>
               <p>This species of fevers, is that the species of fever that ordinarily attends child-bearing? - Generally, it first arises from an inflammatory fever, which is what we call a puerperal fever.</p>
               <p>Where the party is delivered on Tuesday, and is in a dying state on Thursday, is that the puerperal fever? - I took upon it, that this fever was brought on by passion.</p>
               <p>I want to know, whether this kind of fever is a common circumstance that happens upon premature births the day before? - It is common for a fever to attend persons in this state.</p>
               <p>Is it this sort of fever? - The same fever but not so violent.</p>
               <p>An inflammatory fever that degenerates into a putrid fever, I should apprehend would require some time? - Not much, my Lord.</p>
               <p>These puerperal fevers are brought on I suppose by a variety of causes? - Yes; either from pains of delivery or the state of discharges after delivery.</p>
               <p>It is natural enough, when you are informed that there has been a great affray, and that there has been blows, to take that into your consideration, and to ascribe it to that.</p>

            , and on the Coroner's inquisition, she stands charged not with the murder, but with manslaughter; the circumstances or the case, as well as we can collect them from witnesses, who either do not speak so correctly as one would wish them to do, or have their reasons for not stating accurately the whole that is past, are these. [Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260137"></xptr> then added.] This is the whole of the evidence; the prisoner could not in the nature of things, have any witnesses, unless it was the people whom I should have been glad to have seen that kept the Crown. Upon these circumstances you are to say, in the first place, whether this woman's death is at all imputable to any thing that was done by the prisoner, on the Saturday night, and if it was, what is the nature of the offence, of which she is guilty, in consequence of her having produced the death of this woman; with respect at all, to its being imputable to the prisoner; the deceased appears from all I can collect to the contrary to have been in health, before this affray happened; it is agreed on all hands, that there was a violent affray, that the deceased was in a great passion, in consequence of something that had passed; and that in the course of that, her hands were held, there was a struggle, a scuffle, and she fell down, or was thrown down, and was certainly hurt in a part that would have caused the consequences that followed; the contusion on the os sacrum; nothing was more likely to have produced a premature delivery; she complained of this contusion on the os sacrum: upon the whole of the evidence, though undoubtedly these fevers are no uncommon consequences of all kinds of births natural, as well as premature; yet, when you find the woman does not appear to be in ill health before a premature birth, brought on soon after this affray, I think you can hardly doubt much, but that that affray which happened on Saturday night, did contribute to bring on that premature birth, which was followed by this fever, of which the woman died. Whether any degree of crime, whether any share of the injury that was brought on this woman, is to be imputed to the prisoner may depend on this; whether on the whole of the evidence, upon which it appears, as well as we can judge, that the deceased was the aggrestor, by provoking this woman in the very tenderest point, in which a woman could be urged to passion, by throwing out, that it was a good thing that her son was blown up; that sort of inhumanity, that must awaken the feelings of a mother; whether after that it does appear to you that the prisoner did any thing more than restrain the deceased from doing her a mischief; and according to the representation of it by some of the witnesses, they would have you understand, that the prisoner did nothing more, than when the deceased flew into a violent passion, and caught up first a dish, then a brick, and attempted to strike the prisoner; that the prisoner did nothing more than lay hold on her hands, and endeavour to make her quiet; and if she had done no more than that, and it appeared in that scuffle, that the prisoner did no other than that, and the deceased fell down, and that that fall was not imputable to the prisoner, but by holding her hands prevented her doing her any mischief; I should be of opinion, no share of the mischief was occasioned by the prisoner; on the other hand, the prisoner though provoked to a considerable degree by this sort of language, if she entered further into the affray, and was herself active in attacking the deceased, and if she did, what one of the witnesses described to you, after she held her hands, shook her well, if shaking well means that she offered any violence to her; and particularly if she threw her down, in consequence of which her back was so much hurt; I think, considering her situation, who was then six months gone with child, considering the extreme probability that this might produce mischief, and bring on a premature birth, which was so likely to be followed by a fever, and death; I think then there will be some reason to impute to the prisoner some share of these consequences, and which we shall be obliged to enquire into, in the second part of the discussion which I propose to offer to your consideration; I propose first to enquire, whether any share of guilt was imputable to the prisoner, and second, what degree of guilt be imputable to her: If you should be of opinion, this fever was not brought on by any thing that was done to the deceased, or that the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260138"></xptr> did nothing more than defend herself, then you will be disposed to acquit the prisoner entirely; but supposing that was not the case, then what is the nature of the crime she is guilty of; with respect to that, I think there cannot be two opinions; there certainly was no such precedent malice, or ill-will between the deceased and the prisoner, as to lead you to think that the prisoner did what she did with any serious and formed intention, to injure a woman in the circumstances in which she was; to be sure, if in deliberate malice, one woman was to attack another, who was known to be six months gone with child, and was to beat her, and abuse her for the purpose of forcing miscarriage, of which she should die, that would unquestionably be as much murder, as if she stabbed her to the heart; but if this affray was such an one, as plainly arose from a sudden quarrel, in consequence of the deceased being the aggressor, and the prisoner being provoked; if this woman used more force that she should have used, it is impossible to carry it any further than manslaughter, which is a homicide, though committed under circumstances which screen it from that crime of murder; if any blame is imputable to this woman, it is, that this misfortune has been brought on in consequence of some an act of violence on the person of the deceased; but still I think it can go no further that what the Coroner's inquest have made it, supposing they are right in attributing any crime to the deceased, namely the crime of manslaughter. But the points for your consideration are, whether this woman's death has been brought on by this affray, that happened on Saturday evening; and if it was, whether, in the course of this affray, any blame is imputable to the prisoner; in the event of this not being so brought on, or that the prisoner did nothing but hold her hands to prevent her doing mischief, then certainly you ought to acquit the prisoner: but if you think that the prisoner did use violence to this woman, and shook her, and threw her down with violence, by which she was hurt, in that case you will find her guilty of manslaughter.</p>

Gentlemen, this is, you easily perceive, another method of bringing the case before you; I shall recommend to you in this case, to find a general verdict of not guilty; it is a great deal too much to charge, on the circumstance of the child being alive, the death of the child to the prisoner at the bar, in any shape at all; to be sure the child perished merely in consequence of a premature birth; therefore publick justice is satisfied with what you have done already, and it would be an improper verdict to find her guilty.</p>

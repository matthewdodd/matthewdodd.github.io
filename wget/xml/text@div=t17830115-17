               <p>I observed as the prisoner went out of my brother's shop, something dragged after her from under her petticoat, I followed her into a publick-house a few doors off; I saw a piece of muslin partly under her cloak, and part of it was exposed; the muslin had been in the shop before: moving her cloak, I took it from her; she had a little child, which she said, dragged it out after it; when she went out she had the child in one hand, and bid it kiss the other hand, and say tah, which it did; so that it was impossible that the child could take it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the muslin on the same side that the child was, or on the other? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150029"></xptr> When I first saw it, it was dragged behind her.</p>
               <p>Then it was not the child that was dragging it out? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you see the muslin before? - I do not recollect when: twenty yards is a piece, it is valued at 5 l.</p>

               <p>I went into the gentleman's shop, and asked him for a remnant of cotton to make my child a frock, and he had no remnants: the child was dragging the muslin across the shop; I have no witnesses.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">expressed a doubt whether this was the correct form of proceeding, as the record had not been properly made up, but upon Counsel consenting to take the record as completed, it was adopted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

It was true that this was not</hi> in totidem verbis <hi rend="italic">the same offence, but it was not necessary that it should be so in so many words: for upon a charge of murder a verdict of manslaughter might be found, although that was not the charge in the indictment.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE TALFOURD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">inquired whether it was contended that under the first indictment the prisoner might have been convicted of the Statutable felony now charged?</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">did so contend; the charge was an attempt to murder; if a person fired a loaded gun at another with intent to murder him, he would certainly commit an attempt to murder, and that was identical with the present case, which he thought was widely distinguishable from Reg. v. Bird, Reg. v. Phelps, and others of that description. Upon these grounds he submitted that there was such a record before the Court as had been denied by the Crown.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. B. THOMPSON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on the same side, said that the real question was, whether the prisoner had been in jeopardy before, on the charge contained in the two first Counts; he contended that she had, because, upon the previous indictment, she might have been found guilty of an attempt to murder, if the facts had warranted it. The word "attempt" in the</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th section was to be taken in a broad and general sense: and from two cases referred to by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON MARTIN</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in Reg. v. Bird, it might be taken as including all those Statutable crimes which commenced by an attempt to destroy life, but which failed in destroying it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for the Crown, did not desire to dispute the proposition, that under the former indictment the prisoner might have been convicted of an attempt to murder, but that attempt would have amounted only to a misdemeanour, which was a totally different offence to the present. The</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th section was evidently intended to provide for the non<lb></lb>escape of persons charged with felony, which felony included a misdemeanour; and could not have been designed to preclude a person, acquitted of an aggravated felony, from being afterwards indicted for another felony of a less serious character. This was evident, from the wording of the</hi> 11 <hi rend="italic">th section, which would have been altogether unnecessary had the</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th given a general authority for such a finding as was now suggested.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, urged that there was nothing to warrant the assumption that the finding of an attempt to murder would be only a misdemeanour: that</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">was a question to be decided; and as to the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th section, it was a special clause, framed to meet a special state of circumstances arising in the caseof Reg. v.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Felt some difficulty in saying that the form of replication which had been permitted here, was one that the case required; but Counsel having consented to treat the issue of</hi> nul tiel record (<hi rend="italic">raised upon this record</hi>) <hi rend="italic">as one which raised the question whether the prisoner could have been convicted under the former indicatiment of the charge contained in the first and second Counts of the present, he was content to rest his judgment upon that footing. It had not been contended, on the part oofthe prisoner, that at Common Law she could, under the former indictment, have been convicted of the charge, which was the subject of the first and second Counts of the present indictment; but it was said tht she was in jeopardy, because she might have been convicted under the 9th section of 14 and 15 Vic. He was of opinion that she owas in no such jeopardy; for that section would only enable the Jury to convict of a charge, simpliciter, of an attempt to commit a felony, which wuld only amount to a misdemeanour. The various portions of the section seemed to warrow the expression, "Attempt to commit, "to an attempt, simpliciter, to commit the felony; the only verdict the Jury were authorized to find was simply a verdict of guility of an attempt t commit the felony, while on the record there was nothing to authorize any punishment further than punishment for misdemeanour. The 11th section was different, and carefully provided for a punishment in the same way as in a cinviction of felony. For these reasons he was of opinion that the judgment should be for the Crown.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Lapham, of No. 57, Lower Marsh, Lambeth. Some time before 5th Nov. I had a child named George William Lapham—it died on 5th Nov., and was then about seven weeks old—the prisoner was in our service seven weeks, up to 20th Nov.; I do not know the day of the month she came—the child had been ill with inflammation on the chest; it was attended by a medical gentleman named Sewell, and was getting better—on 20th Oct., about 7o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up into my bedroom, saying, "My master wants you"—I sent her out to get some tape, and she and me went downstairs together—when she returned, I and Mr. Lapham were in the shop, still talking; she passed us, and went straight upstairs—about five minutes afterwards she came down, saying that the baby owas crying—I and my husband had remained in the shop all the time she was gone on the errand, and during that time no other person had gone upstairs—I had ledt a candle in my bedroom, which was where the child was sleeping; when the prisoner came down to me, she had a condle alight; I went upstairs with the prisoner; I am not sure whether she was behind or before me—the child was screaming violently; when I took it out of bed I could scarcely hold it in my arms, it <hi rend="italic">wriggled</hi> and twisted so with pain, and was foaming at the mouth—as I was wiping its mouth, I perceived a large hole in the linene handkerchief which was round its neck; after I wiped the foam from its mouth, I perceived that the inside of its mouth was a mass of white; its lips were white also—I had put the handkerchief on its neck in the morning; there were no holes in it then; it was perfectly new—when I saw the hole in the handkerchief, I said, "You have burnt the child with a candle; and after wiping the foam from its mouth, I said, "You creature, you have put.</p>

I went to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Lapham my sister—I was there on 5th Nov., and went with Underwood to search the water closet—first of all this bottle was found; I took it out of the apprentice's hand, who had picked it out, and took it and showed it to my sister—in consequence of what my sister said I went again to the water closet, when Underwood found this other bottle—one of these bottles has a seal on it; that was put on by the policeman by the directions of the Coroner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the nurse who attended Mrs. Lapham in her confinement—I left her service on 19th Oct., and returned on 20th; I had attended her three weeks—I know her bedroom; that is where the child slept—I noticed a one ounce phial on the mantelpiece—it was used for the baby; it is not either of these produced—I afterwards missed that bottle—I inquired all over the house about it, and asked the prisoner if she had seen it; she said she had not—when I was searching for it I missed this bottle from her bedroom mantelpiece, which was the next room—I had been in the habit of seeing it there the whole time I was there—she had told me that it contained holy water—the medicine bottle that was missed was a larger one; it was higher—I asked the prisoner where her holy water bottle was—she said she did not know; she supposed them that had got the medicine bottle had got that, and said nothing farther about it—a few days after Mrs. Lapham's confinement I took the children down rather earlier in the morning than the prisoner thought proper, and she said, "D—n and b—t the children!"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was one of the children, regarding whom she made that remark, the child who is dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was the two children whom I took downstairs—during the time I was there I lived on the best of terms with the prisoner; we never had any quarrels or any disagreement between us; there was nothing about holy water, not in anger; I might have said, "There is your holy water"—I have seen her make use of it, and have heard her, when she was faint, talk about the use holy water is to people who are ill—I never said to her that I hated her because she was Irish, and never said so of her to any other person—I never said to any person in Mr. Lapham's house that I hated Irish people; if any person were to say that I did say so, they would state that which is false—I know the boy Underwood; I never said to him that I hated the prisoner because she was Irish, and I hated Irish people—I swear solemnly on the oath I have taken that I never used words to that effect to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Lambeth-terrace. Mrs. Lapham was one of my patients; I attended her in her recent confinement—the child was healthy until 10th Oct., when it was seized with inflammation of the windpipe—it had recovered on 20th Oct., although it was yet weak from that attack—I considered the child some day or two before quite out of danger, and told the parents so; but it was not without that sort of weakness which would attend an inflammatory disorder—there was no appearance</p>

               <p>of any injury in the lips, mouth, tongue, or roof, the result of any caustical application up to 20th Oct.—on the evening of that day I was sent for by Mr. and Mrs. Lapham, but was absent from home, and did not arrive until between 10 and 11 o'clock—I went to the house, and took the handkerchief off the child's neck; it was burnt in holes, through the folds to the night dress, and also the strings of the nightcap—there were not so many holes in the handkerchief then, it is now all to pieces, the acid has worked upon it ever since—I put my tongue to the handkerchief, and at once said that a corrosive acid had been given to the child—there was nothing about the appearance of the child or its linen that could lead to the possibility of its being burnt by a candle; it was the burning of an acid which had eaten it away, and which has eaten the handkerchief ever since—I saw the night dress, that presented the same appearance—I found two-thirds of the child's tongue on the right side covered with thick white fur; the inside of the mouth and lips were in the same state—the tongue was inside the mouth—the inside of the cheek and the lips were in the same state, and on the outside of the right cheek the skin was destroyed by the same acid; it did not present the same appearance quite, but it was from the same cause; and at the side of the mouth the skin was destroyed, and there was a kind of blueish appearance—if an acid had been applied to the side of the mouth, and the saliva had ran down, that would, in my judgment, have produced the appearance I saw—oil of vitriol is a strong corrosive acid, and is unquestionably calculated to produce the state I found—I applied my tongue to part of the handkerchief, and it presented such a taste as vitriolic acid would, which I have often tasted—the child's thumb was in the same state as the inside of the cheek, there was a small spot—it was a sucking child, the mother brought it up herself—it became almost incapacitated from sucking, but I recommended the mother to apply the breast as the most healing thing—the state of the child's mouth rendered it more feeble in drawing the breast.</p>

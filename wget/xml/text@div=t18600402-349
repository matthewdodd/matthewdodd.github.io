I am an hotel keeper of 59, St. James-street—on 7th March about 10 o'clock in the morning I was standing in Great Tower-street—the prisoner stood by my side—I felt my watch chain move, looked down, saw my chain hanging down, and said to the prisoner, "You have taken my watch;" he said, "I have not"—I saw him pass his hand behind him with the watch in it—I attempted to take it from his hand—he dropped it behind him, and I saw it picked up—it was given to a policeman, and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

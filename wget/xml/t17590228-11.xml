            . I work for the prosecutor: Chatlin came into our Glass-house, and lay there a night or two, and took a chain away with him, and came on the Sunday night following, and I challenged him with taking it; he owned he had taken it, and carried it to the house of Cavenhaugh where he lodged; I went to Cavenhaugh's and asked him about it; he told me he had carried it to one Hawkins a Smith to make him a poker of it; he owned he had let him have something for victuals and drink; he said he was in bed when it was brought to his house, and that his wife had let him have three pence on it: I went to Hawkins's and found part of the chain. Produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it if sold for old iron?</p>
               <p>Bowler. About two shilling or half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Bowler. There might be about ten pounds of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the price per pound for old iron?</p>
               <p>Bowler. The common price is a penny a pound, but this cost my master above half a guinea.</p>
               <p>For Cavenhaugh.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawkins. The prisoner Cavenhaugh gave me this chain to make a poker of: he has always bore the character of an honest man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Cavenhaugh bears the character of an honest man, I understand since he was taken up; I would not have prosecuted him, had I not been bound over.</p>

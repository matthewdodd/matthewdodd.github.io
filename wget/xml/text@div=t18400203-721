                  </hi>. I am mate of the brig <hi rend="italic">Walker</hi>, which is in the Re<lb></lb>gent's Canal. On the 2nd of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was going to my ship—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I stopped to see it—the prisoner came alongside of me, and asked what was the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I said I did not know—some more persons came up, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her hand into my pocket, and ran off to a door, where there were other women—I caught the prisoner, but the other women got in, and the door was shut—I had had one five-shilling-piece in my pocket, and that was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. We walked down the Butcher-row, and we stood talking—he said he would not come with me—I went up towards School-house-lane again, and he came and said I had robbed him of a five-shilling-piece. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not walk with her.</p>

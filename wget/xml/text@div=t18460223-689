I live at No. 20, Vere-street, and am a boot and shoemaker—the prisoner was in my service—I missed money, and marked one shilling, which I put into a drawer in my desk, on Saturday night, the 7th of Feb.—I locked it, and put my keys into my pocket—on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing the prisoner came to my room, and took my trowsers down, and the keys were in my pocket—he went down about nine o'clock—he came up after<lb></lb>wards, and begged my pardon, and hoped I would forgive him—he said he had a temptation to open my drawer that morning with the keys—I said, "I will come down and see"—I went down, opened the drawer, and missed the money that had been there—I asked what had become of several things that I had missed—he said he did not take them—I gave him in charge at the station for stealing the three shillings which I missed from the drawer—the policeman brought him back, and this shilling was found in his jacket pocket, which was down stairs—it is the shilling I had marked—the other two are not found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bragg, of No. 1, Porchester-Gardens, Bays water—the prisoner, John Glynn, was in our service as foot-man, and Elizabeth Glynn as cook—on their applying for the situation in the beginning of October, they referred me to Mrs. Wheeler, 55, Cambridge-place—they told me they had been in the house for eighteen months with a Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell, who were gone to Italy with an invalid daughter—they were both together—I went to 35, Cambridge-place, saw Wheeler there, and said, "Mrs. Wheeler I have come about two servants who, I understand, have lived at this house-eighteen months with a Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell"—she told me they had done so, and that Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell had gone to Italy with an invalid daughter—I said, "Then you must know the servants as well as Mrs. Mitchell herself would"—she said, yes, she did, and better—she spoke very highly of them, gave them both a very good character, and from that character I took them—they entered my service on 14th October in the evening—the next day, being very wet, I put my drawers all tidy—that was the 15th—the articles that I subsequently missed were then safe—I knew exactly what I had in my drawers—the articles mentioned in the indictment were there—I mean such articles as would be kept in drawers; not the spirits, and wine, and so on—on Thursday, 22d October, I missed a light silk dress, trimmed with black velvet—I mentioned it that evening at the dinner-table—the male prisoner was present—I went to a con<lb></lb>cert that evening with my cousin, Mr. Wilson, a clergyman, who was stopping in the house, and my little girl—Mr. Bragg is an invalid, he very seldom goes out now—I put my keys down by him on the table in the drawing-room—I always leave them with him when I go out—he is in the habit of sleeping in the evening in his chair—he is very drowsy—on my return I found my keys on the mantel piece—when I went down in the kitchen I mentioned the loss of my dress—the woman told me that the man was ill, and that he must leave—on the following day, the 23d, I went out for a drive directly after lunch, between 2 and 3—on my return I found the male prisoner had left, and taken his luggage—I made a search, but not till after I had appeared in Court against him the first time—on Saturday, 24th October, I went to my jewel-drawer—that was the day I first appeared in Court against him—I missed the jewels which the officer Pink afterwards produced to me, and in the course of the week I missed a great quantity of wine and spirits, and several other things—at the second hearing I heard Mrs. Wheeler give evidence against Glynn—that was the Thursday following the first hearing.</p>

I live at 5, St. Stephen-square, Westbourne-park—on Friday, 23d October, I called upon Mr. Bragg about half-past 4 in the afternoon—I had some conversation with him—I saw a cab at the door, and saw the male prisoner—after Mr. Bragg told me his suspicions, I went to the door, expecting Mrs. Bragg back, and I saw the prisoner come up in a Hansom cab, run across the garden, and call the labouring gardener after him—I then waited outside, and saw coming across the garden, the gardener and Glynn; the gardener with a black bag, and Glynn with a new portman<lb></lb>teau immediately behind him—I said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "I am going to leave, Sir"—I said, "You have already told Mr. Bragg that you are going to leave to-morrow for Scotland; have you his permission to take those things away to-night?"—he said he had not—I then told him that he should not have in that suspicious manner, and requested him to take the things back again—he put the portmanteau down alone, and came forward and offered to open the black bag, and said he had nothing there but what belonged to him—I told him I did not accuse him of having anything wrong, indeed, the bag was open at the top; he offered to show it—I said, "No, I have no authority to search, I do not accuse you of anything; take them back and discharge the cab," which he did—he took them round the corner of the house, and went and paid the cab.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you remember the Wednesday night my wife and I entered Mrs. Bragg's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I remember on the Thursday morning a young woman being there as housemaid—I do not remember being at the door and asking for you—she came at 7 o'clock and rang the bell—you said you would not ring the bell; you said that we must tell Mrs. Bragg it was the milkman, and that she need not know any difference—I said, "No, she need not"—I do not remember a young woman coming there about being parlourmaid—I do not remember seeing one in the kitchen, and a tall young woman with her—I remember Miss Bragg coming down to dessert at 7 o'clock, as a general rule—I do not remember coming down any night because I had no work, and saying that it was lonely—I was ironing one night during this week in question—I was not washing one night; I wash in the morning—I remember seeing some reindeer's tongues, and ask<lb></lb>ing what they were, but I do not know what night it was—I remember a hamper of apples coming the same night—I remember you bringing some of those apples up for dessert—I was going to the post-office at the time—I had my bonnet and shawl on to go out—I was going through the scullery, to go out that way—it was about 7 or 8 o'clock—I know that Mr. Bragg goes to the City to business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE REV. MR. WILSON</hi>. I am a clergyman from Preston—I was staying at Mr. Bragg's house on a visit, at the time the male prisoner left—after he left I saw a bar of soap found in a drawer in the pantry—I wore a dress<lb></lb>coat on the Wednesday night—I did not look for it again till a week after—I did not find it then; it was missing—I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">John Glynn. Q.</hi> Did you not state at the Court that on the Wednesday you had worn your coat, and that it was a general rule for me to take your clothes and brush them, which you said I had not done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not, to my knowledge, on that night beg to be excused from going up stairs—I wore a dress-coat one or two nights in the week, and I will not be quite certain as to the days—I think I did wear it that Wednesday or Thursday, because the other has some grease from the candle—I did not bring a very small black bag, containing some collars and a shirt or two, to Mrs. Bragg's house—the boy brought a carpet bag; it was not particularly small—I had a change in my carpet bag.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Glynn remain in your service a week after the 23d October, when John left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we took him with us that night when I gave the man in charge—that was the same night, Friday—she did not remain in charge—we took her to the station because we did not wish her to remain in the house—I believe she went to her lodgings—she came with the policeman the next night.</p>

               <p>been in your service, there had been a lot of empty bottles in the pantry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I gave you a commission to put them out of doors into the potting-house, and to put the pantry tidy—there were some other bottles—you put them into the mushroom-shed; I remember bringing them there to you—an extinguisher belonging to one of the kettles was lost before you come—I remember looking in the pantry for it on the morning you were there—I came into the pantry every morning—I do not recollect searching for it while you were out—your wife followed me about—I was about the pantry with your wife when you came into the pantry—I remember a small chest in the pantry, with three drawers; it was where any persons that came into the house could come if they thought proper—the bar of soap was not in those drawers; they were open to anybody who came into the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">John Glynn's Defence.</hi> "I found those two parcels in this potting-house. I put the first into my box. I sent it to Mrs. Wheeler. The contents she knew nothing of; and the second I gave her to take to Miss Cox, and she didn't know what was in it, or anything at all about it. She didn't know whether it was clothes Mr. Bragg had given me. I did not return them, which I did not know the evil of until now, or I should have given it to Mrs. Bragg. A week after Mrs. Bragg talked to me about it being stolen, and I went to Mrs. Wheeler's to get the property back, but I could not get it, or I should have done so. I never took the property from the drawers, or any other portion of her house. In other places where I have been living, had I had a mind to be a thief, I could have taken away the plate, but I have given up my place, to the satisfaction of Mr. Bragg and Mrs. Bragg. There was nothing even to show fraud against me. My wife had not the least knowledge of anything that was going on."</p>

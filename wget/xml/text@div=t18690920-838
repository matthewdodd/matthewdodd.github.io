                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 21, Kirby Street. Poplar—on Saturday night, 4th September, I called at the Tam o'shanter beer-house, in Westminster Road, to get a glass of beer and a light—the prisoner came in—I did not know him before—he sat down and interfered in an argument between me and a black man—I was knocked down by a man, and kicked—after I got up the prisoner knocked me down—there was no quarrelling—the black man said, "You should be in America, that is the best country," and I said, "I do not think so; what is the next best country?" he said, "Europe"—I was kicked in the face "both by the prisoner and the other man, and my nose was broken—the prisoner held me down and pulled nay watch from my fob—the fob came out, he gave the chain a snap, got up and ran out at the door, with his right hand closed, and part of my chain hanging from it—I missed my watch, which, with the part of the chain taken, was worth 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—six or seven people were there.</p>

               <p>—on Saturday night, 4th September, I was in the bar—the prosecutor and prisoner were there, arguing—I saw Robinson first put his hand in the prisoner's face, saying, "I will strike you, young man!"—a negro was there arguing about the country of Mr. Samuel, and I saw the prisoner get up, strike the prosecutor, knock him down, and kick him—I then saw the black man kick him, and the prisoner ran out of the house, and came back again, saying that he had lost his hat—he asked me if I knew where it was—I said, "I know nothing about your hat," and then he kicked the prosecutor again, knocked him down and knelt on him, with his right hand hunting about the button-holes of the prosecutor's waistcoat, trying to get his Albert chain away without breaking it—my mother was knocked down—I cannot say by who—I saw the prisoner leave the house—his right hand was shut, but I could not see what was in it—I then saw a portion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in the military department at the East India House. In April last there was a large sum of money in the course of payment in this country to sailors engaged in operations against China—it is called "donation batta"—a greater portion of it had been paid—the amount altogether was somewhere about 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was payable to a great number of persons—there was a scale, showings what persons were entitled to, according to their rank—a second class boy was entitled either to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Conway</hi> was one of the ships entitled to the money—John Foley was entitled to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., twelve months' donation batta—the ship <hi rend="italic">Dido</hi> was not entitled to any of this particular grant—on the 3rd of April the prisoner came to the office—he stated that his name was John Foley, and he came for the batta money—to claim the donation batta money—he produced this certificate—it is necessary to bring such a certificate—it is usual to bring a prize ticket, showing their period of being in the service, which is signed by the commander of the vessel, and also a discharge from the Royal Navy, in which the service would appear, and a description of the lad—as he did not produce any such instrument I asked where his prize-ticket was, or his</p>

               <p>discharge from the navy—he said he had not got it, that he had lost it—I said, "Have you anything to prove you are the person you represent?" and on that he produced the ticket I have in my hand—I read it, and asked him on what ship he claimed the share for the batta-money—after hesitating, he said he did not know the name of the ship—that excited my suspicion—I said, "What! say you are entitled to batta-money and do not know in what ship you served? can you tell me anything about it? do you know the name of the officer you served under, or any of the officers, the Cap<lb></lb>tain, lieutenant, carpenter, boatswain, or any of them?"—he said he did not know—I then desired the attendant to take him outside, that I might investigate the case, and send for the batta-book, which happened not to be in the room at the time—I told the attendant before he took him out I thought there, was something wrong in his application, and not to let him go—I did not hear him say anything to that—I examined the books—there was a John Foley, a second class boy, on board the <hi rend="italic">Conway</hi>—I found he bad been paid already—when I was examining the books the prisoner was brought in, and said his name was not John Foley—I asked him where he, got this certificate from—he said he got it from some person or other in Rat<lb></lb>cliff-highway who he had never seen before—he was then given into custody.</p>

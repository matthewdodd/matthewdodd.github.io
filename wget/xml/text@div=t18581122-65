                  </hi>. I live at Brewer-street, Woolwich, and am agent to Ben<lb></lb>jamin Bloomfield Baker, contractor for forage for the troops at Woolwich. On Monday, November 1st, I was at Charlton-wharf, and saw the prisoner in charge of a barge, which had come in on the Saturday—I spoke to him twice during the day—I went to him about 5 o'clock, and asked him if he had got all the oats ashore—he said, "Yes; every sack of it"—there were 450 sacks of oats—there had been a cargo of 800 sacks—we had a bill, saying that there were 800; that was the only way we knew it at that time—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the sweepings—he said that there were not many of them; he had put them in a sack which had burst, to fill it up—I said, "What did you do that for? I was down here this morning, and told you to put all the sweepings in a sack by themselves, that I might see what quantity there were"—I had told him that two or three times over—I then began to walk down the plank; and directly he saw me coming, he drew the ladder up—I told him to bring the ladder back—he did not do so; I repeated it, and he very reluctantly brought it back—I then went down into the barge, and saw a sack of oats—I asked him three times how that came there, and he gave me no answer; at last he muttered out that that was the last sack of the cargo—I told him it was no such thing—I then went on shore, and the man who we had to assist us in unloading, came out of the store-room—I asked him, in the prisoner's hearing, what that sack was in the barge—he said it was a sack of sweepings of the barge, which Forsdick and he had swept up and put in the sack—I said, "Why, how is this? one tells me that he put the sweepings into a sack to fill it up; and the other, that this is the sweepings of the barge; what have you to say to that?"—the prisoner said, "It is one of the cargo; I will go and fetch it up"—I said, "If this is one of the cargo, why did you tell me that you had taken all the sacks ashore, and why did you take the ladder away?"—he made no reply—I said that he should not fetch it up, but he did, and I had it put in the store-house, made a chalk mark on it, and locked it up—I told the prisoner I should give him in charge; that I had suspected it for a long time, and had stopped a man last week with two bushels—he said that he did not know anything about that; he was not going to steal it—I gave him in charge—I compared the oats with the cargo, and they corresponded—they are worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner said that he had brought down 400 quarters.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he say this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Monday morning—he brought a bill with the oats, and I always ask them the quantity—they are Swedish oats, and come over in ship-loads—a ship-load varies according to the tonnage of the vessel—two of my men unloaded the barge with the prisoner's assistance—the barge's hold is more than five feet deep—the hatches were off at that particular part, and I could see down—801 sacks came to hand—I should not have liked to jump down into the hold when there was a ladder at hand—I have known the prisoner for the last</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185811220106"></xptr>
               <p>six months—I have seen him three or four journeys—I do not know that he hesitates; I have always found him with a great deal of freedom of speech before—when I got down the hatches I saw the sack, but not as I stood on deck; it was nearly at the end of the barge—I gave our own man in custody also, and he was discharged—on a previous occasion I fouud three bushels of oats in the cabin after the prisoner was gone—I have not lost any since this occasion, but I did previously—each sack is weighed to us; we buy by weight; the weight is made up—there is not sometimes a deficiency of 15lbs. in a sack to my knowledge—several were weighed, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this sack removed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not one of the cargo; it is one which had been filled—I know that by the tie; it has been recently tied; it is different from a sack which has been pressed in the cargo—the oats exactly corresponded with those in the other sacks, but there were a great many oats about the barge—there would not be a great deal of dust with the sweepings if the barge was clean; but these were not sweepings—I did not examine all the sacks to see whether any of them had been opened; we take them direct to the barracks, where they are shot.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LANGFORD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whose barge was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Keene's; they were all in Mr. Keene's bags—the greater portion of the sacks had been de<lb></lb>livered at the barracks before I found this sack.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Thomas Reeves, a lighterman of Horsley<lb></lb>down. On 1st November I went from Horsleydown to Charlton-wharf in Mr. Keene's barge, laden with oats—the prisoner had charge of her—I went on board again about 1 o'clock, and the cargo was then discharged—I did not look in her hold till the next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you accustomed to the trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have received corn from the vessels that brought it; it sometimes comes in bulk and sometimes in sacks—sacks may sometimes differ two or three, or even five pounds in weight—we got down to Woolwich just upon 1 o'clock on Monday—it was 1 o'clock in the night when I went to the barge again; the prisoner had then been taken away.</p>

               <p>Q. Does anybody else live there - A. No. My family go there now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the offence was committed did anybody sleep there - A. A week before, I slept there. I have a bed, and every thing there comfortable. I slept in that bed a week before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover these things taken away - A. Between five and six o'clock on the evening of the 6th of March. I discovered one of the shutters were open; a piece was cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it before that - A. I had been actually in the house a week before that, and on the 6th of March, when I opened the street door, I saw my kitchen door open. When I got on the stair-case, I saw the bed-room door open; then I saw the bed furniture was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for thinking it was done in the night time or day - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the burglary is out of the question. You saw some of your things that were taken away - A. Yes; the furniture of a bed, a counterpane, were taken from the bedstead, and three or four chair covers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the furniture here - A. Yes, this is it, it is mine, and the counterpane and chair covers are mine. I left them in my house when I had been there and slept there last, before I discovered the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. BURFORD. I produced the bed furniture, the counterpane, and chair covers.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by them - A. The prisoner brought them to my house on the 6th of March, and said he wanted to pledge them for Mr. Battesby. I told him I could not take them in of him; Mr. Battesby must come himself. He said, Mr. Battesby could not come, but Mrs. Battesby would.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070006"></xptr>He went away to fetch one of them. He never came back again to claim the things for Mr. Battesby. I advanced him nothing upon them. He asked me two pound or guineas upon them. Mr. Israel came the same night, and took them away from my house. My wife went to Mr. Israel first, and then to Mr. Battesby. Mr. Battesby said, he knew where the prisoner lived. The prisoner came to me between four and five.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Q.to Mr. Burford. What is the value of these things - A. Between six and seven pounds.</p>

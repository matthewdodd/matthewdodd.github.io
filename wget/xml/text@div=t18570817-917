I was on duty on the morning of 12th Aug. in the neighbourhood of Green Street, Blackfriars Road, and saw the prisoner carrying a bag under his right arm—I asked him what he was carrying—he said, "Copper"—I examined the bag, and found it contained copper bolts and sheathing—I asked how he had got it; he said his mate found it in a bag of bones belonging to his master, that he fetched from Gun and Shot Wharf—he said he was going to take it home—I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>his master said he knew nothing about the metal, but it was true that he had been carting bones for him the day before—I do not know that these things came from Sheerness—the prisoner and his master both said that all kind of metal that was found among the bones was the men's perquisite.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Dock Yard at Deptford. I have examined these copper bolts and other articles—I selected a certain quantity out from the others, as not having the mark of the arrow on them—all the others have it—some of the things are parts of nails—they are all such things as are used in the Government Yard—on the bolts and nails I have found the mark of the arrow.</p>

Q.</hi> These are cuttings from pieces of sheathing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the Government would re-manufacture them—I have never known copper or metal to be sold by the Government—these sort of things are not sold by auction—I have never known them to be sold during twenty years that I have been in the Government service, neither at Greenwich, Woolwich, or Deptford—some Government stores are sold by auction, all descriptions of stores except copper and metal—old rope is sold—these kind of things are never sold—these bolts have been used for refitting the ships—they are re-manufactured when they have been once used—all the bolts are old, the sheathing only is new: it has never been on a ship's bottom—it was doubled up when I saw it—I did not polish it up—I wiped the things, and then I discovered the arrow on some of them—they are sometimes <hi rend="italic">doctored</hi> a little.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Ray. I have been with him seven years altogether—he is a bone merchant, in a large way of business—the prisoner is also in his employment; he has been with him about a year and a half—the day before this matter was found out, we were drawing bones to the railway from our yard—I did not go to the wharf for the bones, but the prisoner did—I saw him bringing home ten sacks of bones—they are large sacks; they might be more thin four feet high—they were tied up; we had to get a knife to undo them—the practice is to shoot them out in the yard—I shot them out—in one of the bags we found this bag of copper; it was tied up, and laid lengthways—I took it out of the bones—I picked it up, and said, "Why, mate, look what I have found"—I have been before the Magistrate—I believe it was in the same bag as it now is—I did not weigh it—the bag of bones weighs 1 cwt. 3 qrs. and some odd pounds—that night I put it into the stable—on the next morning the prisoner was found taking it home—these things are looked on as the perquisites of the men—there is no rule whether it be an ounce or a cwt. that is found—we always take all we can find.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bone merchant, in Green Street, Southwark. The prisoner had been in my service about twelve months; during that time he has borne the character of an honest and respectable man—I had no character with him—we never inquire into the character of the men in our line; it is not the custom—as far as I know, he has borne a good character—I should be willing to take him back again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did these bones come from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Sheerness, to a person of the name of Wolfe, at Whitechapel—I got them from Griffin's Wharf—that was the order given to my men—Wolfe got them from Sheerness—I believe the name of the consignor is Wolfe—this is the second lot I have had from Sheerness through Mr. Wolfe—if I had not heard about this I should have had a deficiency of the 36 lbs.—I only heard about it after the examination before the Magistrate—I deal in nothing but bones and fat—I first heard of this affair on the morning after it happened, when the officer brought the prisoner back to me.</p>

(the weight of the metal)—it is not unusual for deductions to be made if there is any quantity—we send it back, we will not have it, only if there is any copper the men would take care to have it out—I never saw the broad arrow before in my life.</p>

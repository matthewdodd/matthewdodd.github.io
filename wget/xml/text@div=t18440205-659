                  </hi>. I keep the Two Brewers public-house, Brewer's-green, Westminster. About three, on the 11th of Jan., the prisoner came for a glass of gin—I gave it him—he fumbled about his pockets, and pulled out a penny—I said it would not pay for it—he then felt all his pockets, took up the penny, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down a bad shilling, and said, "That will pay for it"—I took it up, bent it, and flung it at him—it fell on the floor—he picked it up, and went out—he came again, about ten minutes after, for a pint of beer—I drew it—, he took another counterfeit shilling out of his pocket, and threw it down on the counter—it was a straight one—I took it in my hand—I called my man to get a policeman—the prisoner went out—I followed him, and he was taken—I saw the officer search him, and a good many counterfeit shillings were taken from his mouth—I gave the officer the second shilling that the prisoner gave me.</p>

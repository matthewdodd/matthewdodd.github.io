                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 365, East India Road—on the afternoon of 21st August, about 2.30, I was in a crowd on Tower Hill—I felt a pressure on my right side and saw Smith there—I put my hand into my pocket and missed about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I had seen safe a short time before—I went over the road after Smith, collared him, and said "You have stolen my money out of my pocket"—he said "I have not your money, don't give me into custody, feel my pockets"—I gave him into custody—I saw Cain at my right side before I ran after Smith.</p>

On the afternoon of the 21st August I saw the three prisoners together on Tower Hill, pushing in against a crowd where a man was selling rings—I watched them for a quarter of an hour—I saw Smith place himself by the side of several gentlemen, covered by the other prisoners—Cain was on the right of the gentlemen, pushing against them, and Heenan closed up behind to cover what Smith was doing—after, repeating that to several persons they went to the prosecutor—Smith placed himself on his right side, Cain on his left, and Heenan was pushing against</p>

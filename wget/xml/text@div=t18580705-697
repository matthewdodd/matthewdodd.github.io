                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Post Office, at Charing Cross. I supply the public there with postage stamps—on 11th June, the prisoner came for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps—she put down a crown and a shilling on it—she had been there a short time before, and I knew her voice—I found the crown was bad, sent for a constable, and she was given in custody—I said in her presence that she had been there before, and uttered a bad half crown—the prisoner said she had never been in the shop before—she took out two good half-crowns, and offered to pay for the stamps—I said no, I should not do that, I would give her into custody—she had come on two previous occasions—the first time I did not see her face, but I heard her voice—she came again on 4th June—I served her on both of those previous occasions—she asked for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps, and paid with a half crown, a shilling, and a sixpence—I discovered, on both of those occasions, that the half crowns were bad, and the shillings and sixpences were good—on 4th June, I attempted to have her followed, but she got too far—the half crown that I took of her on 4th June I gave to the constable—the one that I took first is not produced.</p>

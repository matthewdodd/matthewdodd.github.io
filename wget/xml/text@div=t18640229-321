I am manager to Mr. Alfred Mumford, who trades under the firm of Bartram and Co., copper-nail manufacturer, at 168, Upper Thames-street—Sutton was in our employment as packer—on the night of Friday, 12th February, I was shown a bag containing about half a cwt, of copper nails—they were the property of my employers, and worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen Wetherall hanging about the place, I should think a dozen to twenty times, when I have been going to the office—he was not in our employment—I know nothing of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the machinery department at Messrs. Bartram's—on Friday night, 12th February, about half-past 5, I saw the prisoner Wetherall standing close to the step of our front entrance—Sutton came down to him while I was passing, with a bag on his shoulder, and put it on Wetherall's shoulder—I saw him take it and put it on a trolly, which is a low cart with four wheels, and pull a covering over it—I asked him what he had got there—he made me no answer, but went away—I put my hand on the bag, felt it was something weighty, and I took it up, put it on my shoulder, and took it up into the office to Mr. Bramley, our manager—I saw nothing more of Wetherall that night—I examined the nails before Mr. Bramley; they were the property of my employers—I had seen Wetherall before standing about outside our establishment.</p>

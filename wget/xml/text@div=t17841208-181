               <p>What money did you lose? - Half a guinea, one shilling, and two half crowns, I know I had the money in my pocket, they had no weapons, I cried out, and the prisoner Mitchell wanted to murder me.</p>
               <p>How do you mean? - He cried out, kill the old buggerer, kill him, three times.</p>
               <p>But he had no weapon to kill you with? - He was going to take a knife out of his pocket, and the neighbours got up, and cried out of their windows, for shame; there were many neighbours.</p>
               <p>Did he take out his knife? - He had got his knife in his hand, and would have done it, if it had not been for the neighbours, who cried out for shame, and begged him to have merey upon me; I am sure he had a knife out, I saw it.</p>
               <p>When the neighbours cried out, what became of them? - They ran off, they were with me the space of half an hour.</p>
               <p>What were they doing all that time? - They were dragging me about the yard, and beating me like a dog, as I had no more for them, and knocked my teeth out of my head.</p>
               <p>How many teeth did they knock out? - One.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour before you could alarm any body with your cries to get any assistance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make any resistance all this time? - I begged for mercy, I fought and struggled as much as I could; when they ran away, I went to my neighbours, and told them what accident I had met with; they were taken up the same morning out of their beds; I told them who to take, I knew them both from children.</p>
               <p>And they knew you well enough too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080171"></xptr>You knew where they lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And they knew that you knew where they lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did they first say to you when they attacked you? - They said nothing to me till they got me down to the ground.</p>
               <p>How far did they live from you? - About twenty or thirty yards, one of them did; and the other lived further off.</p>
               <p>What are they? - One was a lamplighter, the other used to mangle for people, and used to carry burthens.</p>
               <p>What time had you gone to bed that night? - About seven.</p>
               <p>So these people that knew you so well, and knew that you knew them so well, robbed you and went home to their beds: did you lose any thing else but money? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any watch? - No, I had nothing but money; when they were taken up they said they knew nothing about it, they were not concerned in it, they denied being there.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - It was a very good star-light.</p>
               <p>Any lamps near? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could the neighbours see them as well as you from the windows? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was at the beginning of this struggle that they got the money from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was before the neighbours were alarmed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So all that the neighbours saw, was them and you struggling and fighting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you cry out, when you did cry out? - I cried out, pray Bob, do not murder me, have mercy upon me.</p>
               <p>You called him by his name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What words did you use? - I cried out, murder.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Here my old friend, a word with you; so they beat you for half an hour? - They beat me like a dog.</p>
               <p>Was it with a knife that they beat you? - No, with their fists, and kicked me with his foot, he knocked out my teeth with the toe of his shoe; one tooth, Sir.</p>
               <p>What sort of a knife had he? - A long snig-a-snee knife, a spring knife.</p>
               <p>He took it out deliberately, and opened it before all the people? - Not before all the people, but before the people in the yard.</p>
               <p>How long might these people be looking out of their windows? - Ten or a dozen minutes.</p>
               <p>They made such a noise, that the people were waked out of their beds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, they threw up their sashes, and called out, have mercy on the poor old man, do not kill him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they saw these lads kicking you in this unmerciful way, as if you was a dog? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often have you had the misfortune to be robbed in your life? - Four or five times.</p>
               <p>So I thought: how often have you been a witness here of robberies on your own person? - Two times.</p>
               <p>How many of the people you have prosecuted have died in Newgate? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Upon an average, how many prosecutions had you in the course of the last two years? - One before this.</p>
               <p>They have been both within the year? - Yes.</p>

             made answer to him when he cried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080173"></xptr> for mercy, says he, damn him, an old buggerer, kill him, kill him, kill him, three times.</p>
               <p>Did you understand by their talk what they had quarrelled about? - No, I could not, they ran away directly after they had made that answer.</p>
               <p>Had you time enough to see who they were? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that; how long might you stand looking? - I think about four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Then when your friend and bedfellow was crying murder, and three men upon him, you stood looking at them till they ran away? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What became of you after? - Simon went to his business, and I went to bed again, I could not get out any where, because I was locked in.</p>
               <p>How were you locked in? - I could not get into the street no way.</p>
               <p>Was this in the yard? - It is a street, because there is no gateway to stop any person going up.</p>
               <p>What hindered you from getting out? - Because after he came out of his own room at the back door, he locked it after him.</p>
               <p>Where does this ladder come down to? - It comes down, by lifting up the trap door, it comes upon the ground, the back place from the dwelling house.</p>
               <p>How is that surrounded? - It is behind the dwelling house, going into a back opening, and there is a door from the little yard into the other yard.</p>
               <p>Did you try that door? - Yes, I wanted to get out to help him.</p>
               <p>Did you call to him? - No; when I saw him in that situation I was afraid, for fear they should break in, the boards were very thin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I suppose it was the pistol that Lucas had that frightened you? - I saw no pistol at all.</p>
               <p>What sort of pistol had the prisoner? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>If he had had one, you must have seen it, if he had beat Simon's eyes about; what was it he beat Simon's tooth out with? - I do not know, I did not see.</p>
               <p>Which of his eyes was it that was so black and blue? - It was the right eye, that was the only thing he complained of.</p>
               <p>His right eye was very much swelled? - Very much, and all scratched down the right cheek.</p>
               <p>How long had you and Simon been bedfellows? - About a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>What sort of lodging is this? - It is very well for such as we.</p>
               <p>What business may you be? - I am a groom when I am in business.</p>
               <p>What are you when you are not a groom? - I draw beer for Litchfield: this is not a hay-lost, it has a bed in it, but I have seen many a better hay-loft.</p>
               <p>Simon is worth a good deal of money? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>He gets up early? - He always gets up about that time.</p>
               <p>They had nothing but a pitch-fork? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>Is not that honest man, Mr. Warren, what they call a running dustman? - Sometime he is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of De La Rue and Company—my father, Thomas De La Rue, is one of the firm—we are stationers, and it is part of our business to manufacture coloured cards—I have turned my attention to the manufacture of Chinese blue—there are a great number of blues, which are called Chinese, in which all the trade deal; but I have pro<lb></lb>duced one of a superior colour, and of a durable tint—one of the defects of other blues is that they do not stand—in the manufacture of this article I am obliged to use a variety of materials, and it is necessary it should be made in vats, in large quantities—it requires very large apparatus to manufacture it—it could not be made in a house in which any persons lived, by the process which we use—there is no person out of our firm, to my knowledge, who is acquainted with the means by which I prepare this colour—in Sept., I</p>

               <p>received information which induced me to send for the prisoner, who was an in<lb></lb>grinder and confidential storekeeper in our employ—he used to assist me in making the colour—I asked him if he had sold any blue to any person in the trade—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had sold any to Messrs. Dick<lb></lb>enson—he said, "No"—I asked him whether he had ever made any blue, and he denied it—I told him we had a person in the next counting-house who could prove that he had sold some blue—he then said he had sold some, and he had made it at home—I asked him to describe the process by which he had made it at home, and the quantity of materials that he had used; and he gave me wrong proportions, which I wrote down—he said, 71bs. of prussiate of potass, one-third of 14lbs. of copperas, one<lb></lb>fourth of 14Ibs. of sulphuric acid, and one-fourth of 11lbs. of nitrous acid—I asked him to describe the apparatus he made it in, and he described making use of an iron pot and a few tubs which he had by him—I asked him whether anybody in the house knew that he made it—he said, "No"—I asked him whether his wife knew it—he said no, he made it when she was in bed—as I knew that in one part of the processi a vast quantity of nitrous fumes are given out, so that any person in the house would be almost suffocated, we sent for the police and gave him into custody—we sent the officers down to King's-Langley, to see some goods that we understood he had sold to Dickensons—this is such a tub as we put our blue in, and I have not the slightest doubt that this blue is our manufacture—I am a member of the Chemical Society—blue could not have been produced by what the prisoner described—it would have turned to green.</p>

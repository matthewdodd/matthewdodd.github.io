               <p>John Wimble. The two prisoners came into the house where I was drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Where.</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. It was at the Chequers in the Ambury.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. This was on the last Lord-Mayor's day at night; I went with them from the Chequers to a room belonging to one of them about 11 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to the Chequers ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. I believe I went in there between 7 and 8.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoners come into your company?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. I believe that was hard upon ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. I lost ten 36 s. pieces, 19 guineas, and 4 half guineas; it was wrapt up in a rag, one piece over another, and put into an old silk handkerchief, and put into my fobb-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you had this money in your pocket when you went into the Chequers ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you had it when the prisoners came into your company?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went with them to a room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175812060005"></xptr> were room ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. No, there were none but they and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had it in your pocket when you was in that room?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. I am sure I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay together.</p>

             I fell asleep, and I awak'd between 4 and 5 the next morning, then my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the prisoners when you awaked ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. McCay was in the room with me, but the other was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any of your money since ?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. No, not one shilling of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did McCay say for herself when you said your money was gone?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. She said Hush; and immediately fled out of the room, and was taken at the Coach and Horses in King's-Street; we took her before Justice Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say there?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. She said,

               <p>Q. Did you go to bed in that room?</p>
               <p>J. Wimble. No, I slept on the bed in my cloaths.</p>

             came between 12 and 1 in the morning, the day after Lord-Mayor's day; she had a little bit of candle in her hand, she pull'd out of her bosom two guineas and four or five shillings in silver, and said she had made a little sort of a move.</p>

             McCay was along with her, it being done in her room.</p>
               <p>you a day at night I broke a little loose seeing the show; I happened to come into the Chequer ale-house in the Ambury, where this man was sitting by the fire-side; I call'd for half a quartern of gin between Lee and me; he got up and ask'd her to drink, she drank to me, he call'd for another pint of beer, and ask'd her several questions, then we sat down in company, he ask'd her to go home: No, said she, I don't want any company at all; I took my candle and went home, and he follow'd us to the door; then he came in and flung six-pence down on the table, and said he had no more money in the world; but he would give us that to have to say to us both. Then he sent out Lee for a pot of beer and a halfpenny candle, she came and returned the two-pence-halfpenny to him.</p>
               <p>Lee's defence. We had some gin together, after that he gave us a pint of beer, then he follow'd us home, and toss'd down a six-pence, and sent for a pot of beer and a halfpenny candle. I fetch'd it, and gave him the two-pence-halfpenny out of it, he wanted to have to do with us both.</p>

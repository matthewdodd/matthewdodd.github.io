The prisoner was my <rs id="t18170917-122-deflabel609" type="occupation">footboy</rs>, and waited upon the gentlemen - He had lived a fortnight with me. On the 21st of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, he absconded - I missed the gold snuff-box, silver fruit-knife, and 15s. in money, about an hour after-the fruit-knife was Mr. Packer's, who lodged with me, he had been sent on an errand. I applied for an officer, and the prisoner was brought to me at two o'clock on Tuesday morning; on the 22d of July, which was the next morning, he was examined, and committed for trial. I found the snuff-box with the book-keeper of the Black Bear, Piccadilly, and the knife at a pawnbroker's in Tottenham-court-road. When the prisoner was brought to me I took him there at five o'clock in the morning. I have the property.</p>
               <p>JOHN DANIEL SMITH. I am a waterman at the coach-stand, Cheapside. On the 21st of July I went in search of the prisoner, and found him between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 22d, behind a hackney coach, with four or five more, and took him into custody - I knew Lim before. I asked him why he left his mistress, and he said he would not be brow beat by the servants any longer. I told him his mistress wished to see him, he said, very well, I will go and see her. I took him to her house immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not say if I told you where the property was, you would not hurt a hair of my head - A. I told him that if he told where the property was, and it could be recovered, he might go about his business. His mistress told me to say so. He told me where it was.</p>

               <p>JOHN COXETER. I am book-keeper at the Black Bear, Piccadilly. On the 21st of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our counting-house over the booking-office, he was accustomed to come there when he was an hackney coachman; he said he had had a lucky find on Monday before, he was driving a hackney coach and took up a gentleman, set him down in Cheapside, and he had left a snuff-box in the coach, on the back seat; I asked him to show it me - He did - I said it was a very valuable one, it would be sure to be owned or advertised; I asked him if he had got any body to look at the papers, he said he had done that himself; I told him it was worth ten guineas second-hand; he asked me if I would give him five for it - I told him I would not buy it at any price, and begged of him to keep it; he took it away and went up stairs and sent my porter down to ask me to lend him 5s., on it as he had no money; my man said he knew the man very well, it was all right; I refused to lend the money on it; about half an hour after he came down again himself and asked me to lend him 3s., on it, as he had had no victuals that day, I lent him 3s., and said I would search the papers myself; I locked it up in my desk one night, and the next morning at a quarter before six, the prisoner, the prosecutrix, and J.D. Smith, sent for me to the Boltin-Tun, Fleet-street; we all rode up to our office, and I gave her the box.</p>

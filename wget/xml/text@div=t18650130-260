On 27th January, at a quarter part 11 in the morning, I was on duty in Euston-street, and saw the prisoner and ten or twelve others standing just inside the door of the Adam and Eve public-house—I ordered them all to move from there as they were obstructing the door—they all stepped out on the pavement—I told them they could not remain there, they must go over the way to the soup kitchen if they had come there for soup—they all left but the prisoner, who said he would see me b----before he left—I said that I must remove him if he did not, and put my hand on him to shove him into the road—he came on to the pavement and said, "You move me away from here again if you dare; I will stand here as long as I like"—the landlord came out, and asked me to remove the people, as he could not carry on his business—I told the prisoner he must go away, and he used very bad language, and said, "Now I will give you something;" and struck me on the face several times for five or six minutes—I closed with him, and we had a severe scuffle, during which somebody shouted out, "Mind, policeman, he has got a knife;" and I felt something sharp under my cheek—he was seized by several people, and with assistance, we got him to the station—I was cut through my cheek, and on the side of the nose—my cape was also scratched.</p>

I am the landlord of the Adam and Eve, Euston-road—the prisoner was standing on the step of my private entrance—I had occasion to ask him to get away twice before, and several others as well—when Haywood interfered the others all went away, but the prisoner said he would not go away, he had a right to stand there—Haywood pushed him, and he came back on the pavement; Haywood was going to push him again, bat he struck at him, and they closed together—I heard an alarm of</p>

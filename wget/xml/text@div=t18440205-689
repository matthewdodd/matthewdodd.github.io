                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Hunt and Co., of Harrison-street, Gray's Inn-lane-road. I was private watchman to the establishment. I received instructions, and on the 13th of Jan. I watched the chasing-room—I got into an adjoining room, in which was a trap, which enabled me to command a view of the chasers' benches—there are two rows of benches in that room where the men work, and a trough runs along to catch the silver filings—I stationed myself there about a quarter before six, I saw the prisoner and a number of men at work—when the bell rung the other men left the room—one person remained to clear up the shop, and the prisoner remained dawdling about the shop—I thought he was filing his nails, but I did not see the file in his hand—I watched him narrowly—he stationed himself near the forge—he then took a gallipot, as I thought, and I saw him pour something from it into a piece of white printed paper—he folded or screwed the paper up, and put it into his pocket or about his person—I proceeded down to the counting-house to get teil clerk to go to Mr. Hunt—I stationed myself near the door—the prisoner came down almost immediately—I top ped him—he seemed confused, and asked me to let him go up again—I fused—he broke out of my custody, and ran up stairs into the chasing-rooidi from whence he came—I got up close to him—he was standing directly opposite me in the middle of the shop—I watched him—Mr. Hunt came inta the shop, and ordered him and me into Mr. Day's room at the end of the</p>

               <p>shop—before he went into the room I observed him lay down his umbrella on a work-bench near Mr. Day's room—a policeman was sent for—the pri<lb></lb>soner was searched, and I was astonished that nothing was found on him—he dressed himself again, and I went back to search the chasers' shop—I found a paper containing what I supposed was silver dust—I took it to Mr. Hunt, and said, "This is what I suspected"—the paper was opened, and it contained silver dust, called limmell in the trade—after the prisoner was lodged in the station, I went back to the shop, and under the bench where I had seen him standing, I found the mug, which was what I thought looked like a gallipot—I found some fine silver dust hanging about it, corresponding with that in the paper.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">WILLIAM FRAMPTON</hi>. I am apprentice to Messrs. Hunt and Co. I was in the chasing-room—the men left work at six o'clock in the evening—the bench where Fines and Nicholls worked if near Mr. Day's room—they left work at a quarter past six o'clock—I cleared out the trough at the edge of their bench after they left work, but before they were gone—there was no paper screwed up containing silver dust at that time—if there had been I must have seen it—I left nothing in the trough—I swept it clean out—in about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour after, I saw the prisoner leave his bench, and he walked about the shop till half-past six, and then left—I do not know why he should stay—when he left there was nobody in the shop but me and a man named Rothing—some of the gas-lights were still burning in the shop—in a few minutes the prisoner returned, and the watchman followed him—they stood three or four yards from each other—Mr. Hunt then came in, and sent me for the key of Mr. Day's room—he and the prisoner went into Mr. Day's room—I then went to the bench where Fines and Nicholls had been working, to turn a stool down that I had turned up, and, in so doing, I knocked down an umbrella—I took it up, placed it on the bench, and then I saw a little bit of paper screwed up, which I had not seen when I cleared out the trough—I saw the watchman come and take the piece of paper into Mr. Day's room, and then the policeman came—I know that the prisoner takes in a publication called <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>—it used to lie between his bench and another man's—I have seen a pile of them on his board.</p>

                  </hi>. I have more than one partner. The prisoner was one of my apprentices—on this evening, in consequence of information, I went into the chasing-room—I found Dixon and the prisoner there—I went into Mr. Day's room, and told the prisoner I should send for his father, bat I tent for the policeman—I told the prisoner I had long suspected him of robbing me, and asked if he had any objection to be searched—he said, "No"—he was searched—Dixon went back to the chasing shop, and brought a piece of paper screwed up, containing silver dust—I gave the prisoner and the paper in charge of the policeman—he begged me not to send for his father, and said, "Oh, pray, forgive me"—he was taken to the station—I saw a sheet of paper which was found on the right hand side of the prisoner's bench—it turned out to be <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>, and the piece of paper which Dixon brought in with the</p>

               <p>silver dust in it corresponded exactly with it—it matched exactly—the average quantity of filings in that particular shop is from fifteen to twenty ounces—I had missed silver and silver dust, and set Dixon to watch—this dust is worth 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was present when Dixon found this mug—I have examined the silver dust in the paper, and that which stuck round the mug, and they are the same.</p>

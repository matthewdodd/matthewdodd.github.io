                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live with my parents in Bell-street, Greenwich. On the 21st of October, I went with a friend to Charlton fair—I saw the prisoner there—he asked me to go into a show—he is an artillery-man—I went into the show, and, when we came out, he asked me to go and have something to drink—we had some rum and water at a public-house—he was quite a stranger to me, but he said he would see me home, and we walked arm-in-arm till we got to Black heath—he then threw me down—he had kissed me before he threw me down—I did not resist when he kissed me, but I resisted when he threw me down—I called to him to let me get up, but he would not—I called for assis<lb></lb>tance—he did not take any liberties with me of any kind, but he threw me down, and put his hand on my mouth—he was taken immediately, and has been in custody ever since—Mr. Pershouse came to my assistance—I did not know him before he came up, but he knew me—I had been thrown down against my consent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper and farmer, and live at Greenwich. I did not know this witness till she recognized me—I know her father—I was coming home in my gig, and saw two persons come across the road, making to this spot—I looked back and saw the prisoner and this witness on the ground—she screamed out, "For God's sake, come to my assistance"—I must have passed just by them, within half a dozen yards, as I had just come out of the main road under the fence, but my horse had shyed at something at the time I saw the persons running to the place: had it not been for that, I could not have passed without seeing the prisoner and the woman—she might have screamed at the time I passed without my hearing her, as my gig made a noise—the moment I stopped I heard her—I went to her, and found her dress very disorderly; her belt was undone, and the back of her clothes very disorderly—the prisoner's dress was not at all undone.</p>

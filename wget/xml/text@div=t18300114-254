On the 2nd of January the prisoner came and asked for a peck of coals -I served him; they came to 4 1/2d. - he offered me a crown-piece: I knew it to be bad, and said I had not got change- my father came forward; I said, "This man has tendered me a bad crown-piece" - he shut the door and asked where he got it; he refused to tell, but after some time he said, he took it in change from a woman whom he had slept with the night previous - I said if he wanted the coals to burn he must live in the neighbourhood: he repeatedly refused to say where he lived: and then said he had come from a place close by Edmonton, had just come to town, and had borrowed an apron to fetch the coals, but would not tell where they were to be taken - we sent for Dell, who searched him; I marked the crown, gave it to my father, who marked it, and I saw him give it to the officer; it was not out of my sight.</p>
               <p>JOHN DELL. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner, and found two good shillings on him: Godfrey, senior, marked the crown-piece in my presence and gave it to me - I have had it ever since.</p>

            . I am Godfrey's grand-daughter. The prisoner came into the shop on the 1st of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, for four bundles of wood and gave me half a crown; I gave him change, and put the half-crown in front of the drawer, which is about three feet long - there were then two sixpence and two shillings in the drawer; there was one half-crown besides, but that was at the further end of the drawer - nobody but me had access to the drawer; my aunt sat by me, and before I shut the drawer, in consequence of what she said, I took the half-crown out and gave it her, immediatley after the prisoner was gone; it was quite at a distance from the other half-crown, and I am sure it was the one he gave me - I made a mark on it with my teeth; it was given to my grandfather, who is dead - I saw him wrap it in paper, and put it into a drawer in the bureau, which is up stairs, the bottom drawer on the right-hand - there was no other money there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.You told the officer I was not the person, and that it was a man of a dark complexion? A. When I first looked at him I thought he was not the person, as he was dressed quite different, and I was not close to him; I thought it was him afterwards - it was five days after when I said he was the person.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH VICKRESS. I am the witness' aunt. I was in the room close to the shop, and saw the prisoner give her the half-crown: she put it in front of the drawer - I was sitting close to the drawer and thought it looked suspicious; she took it out and gave it to me - I know it to be the same as he gave her; it had a black mark on it - I told her to wrap it up and give it to her father when he came in; she put it in front of the drawer, away from the other.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Islington; I was going to Colbrook-row at the time I was robbed, which was a very few minutes before nine in the evening of the 15th of December; I was within fifty or sixty yards of <placeName id="t17970111-36-crimeloc226">Colbrook-row, in the foot-path, by the side of the New-River</placeName>

               <p>Q. To whom did you address youself? - A. Always to the prisoner at the bar, as he was the person that spoke to me first; his reply was, give the gentleman his papers, which the third person did, the man that rifled me, and he left one upon the ground, which he afterwards gave me, saying, sir, here is another, they then all left me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have named the prisoner at the bar, had you any opportunity of observing him in particular? - A. Yes; it was a remarkable clear, moon-light night, it was the night after the full-moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whatever, that he was one of the three men that robbed you? - A. I have no doubt at all; he is not dressed now as he was when he robbed me; when I saw him at Bow-street, he was in the same dress that he was in when he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time that you saw the prisoner after the robbery? - A. Last Saturday, about twenty-three days after the robbery; I immediately pointed him out as the man that robbed me; I have never recovered any of my property; a particular friend of mine, Mr. Oldham of Edmonton, asked me to go to Bow-street with him, and there I saw five men at the bar, one of whom I pointed out to Mr. Oldham, namely, the prisoner, as being the man that first laid hold of me; I went, the morning after the robbery, to Worship-street to give information, and have the property advertised; I described the men as being dressed, particularly the prisoner, in a drab great coat, with his hair loose in his neck, and from their appearance, I thought they were soldiers; I described the articles in the indictment, but I heard nothing from the office whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. There is no doubt at all that you were robbed? - A. I believe not, sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110054"></xptr>Q. Whoever committed the robbery, behaved extremely civil to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner at the bar again, till you saw him at Bow-street? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was at the distance of three weeks afterwards? - A. Rather more, twenty-three days.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see him again, you saw him together with other persons put to the bar, at Bow-street? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not intermixed with other persons, but put at the bar with other persons, to be examined for robberies? - A. Had he been standing indiscriminately among the crowd, I should have had no hesitation in saying he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not put at the bar as a person to be examined for a robbery? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go there, with a knowledge in your mind, that you should find the person that had committed a robbery upon you? - A. Certainly, from hearing that five men were apprehended for footpad robberies, but from nothing else, I thought from that I might have a chance of seeing one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you given to understand that the person who had committed the robbery upon you, was a person to be examined at Bow-street? - A No; I merely knew that five men, who had been examined the on Wednesday, were to be examined again on the Saturday, and I told my friend, Mr. Oldham, I would attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not given to understand, that you should meet a person answering the description you had given of the person who had robbed you? - A. No; when I went into the room, I did not know who they were, till I saw the prisoner's back.</p>

               <p>Q. How long do you think this robbery might occupy? - A. It could not exceed three minutes; I assure you they did their business quickly.</p>
               <p>Q. Three persons attacked you? - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. You did not know the prisoner's person before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In so short a space of time, can you take upon yourself to swear, positively, that the prisoner is the man? - A. I have not the least hesitation in saying the prisoner was the first man that attacked me; I have some recollection that I have seen him before, I am not certain, I think he was one of those bruising gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not certain he was a bruiser? - A. No</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you take upon yourself to swear he was the man who robbed you? - A. That I certainly do.</p>

I saw Welbey take a piece of gold under his thumb, and put it in his pocket twice—I saw a gold thimble as plain as I see you—I did not give any alarm, nor say anything about it at that time—he proceeded to weight the whole of it—he put it altogether, and agreed with me at a price—it was then weighted.</p>

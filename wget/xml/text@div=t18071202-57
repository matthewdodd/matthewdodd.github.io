            . I am a painter and glazier, I live at No. 2, Marmaduke-street, St. George's in the East. On the 28th of October near two o'clock, I was in Mr. Lawrence's tap room, I saw the prisoner take one pot; then I saw him take another. The first pot he put in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the tap room besides you and him. - A. Yes, two people; I do not think any body sat in the same box with him; in about four or five minutes he took another pot and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before. - A. Yes, I had often seen him in the tap room, but never to have any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing him take one pot and then another, what did you do. - A. Nothing; he went out of the tap room into the privy, he was there some time; he returned into the tap room again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform the people of the house or speak to him. - A. No, he got up and went into the street; I followed him till he came to an iron shop, near a quarter of a mile from the public house; I followed him into the shop; I saw him in conversation with the mistress of the shop inside of the counter, I accused him of taking Mr. Lawrence's pots; I laid hold of him and searched him, and a bricklayer I met, I asked him to go with me as a witness, to see me take the property from him; I took the half pint out of his pocket and the bricklayer took the pint out; some gentlemen came up and asked me whether I had any authority to take him; we let him go and told Mr. Lawrence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever you see a felony committed, always take them up, you have as much right as a constable - what did the prisoner say. - A. Not a word; he went away as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

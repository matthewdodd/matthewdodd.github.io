On the 1st of October, about one o'clock in the morning, I was going out, and thought it was going to rain - I turned back, and stood under a shed; the prisoner came up, and said, Broadie - I missed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200056"></xptr>my watch at that moment; I pursued him to the corner of Wentworth-street, and saw the watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Where did this occur? A. At Mr. Creswell's door, next to my own house but two; he said Broadie, and the watch went - he might be a little fresh; I have known him for three or four years - he has borne the character of an honest, hard-working man: I did not know him that night, but I did the next morning, when I came to look at him.</p>

I was on duty in Wentworth-street. and heard the prosecutor call out "I know you;" we saw the prisoner running - my brother-officer caught hold of his right arm; the prosecutor was about twenty yards behind him - I fell back a little, and saw the prisoner put his hand into his right-hand pocket; I caught his arm, and he threw this watch out of his hand.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

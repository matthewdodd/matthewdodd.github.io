               <p>Where does she live? - In the same house.</p>
               <p>How old is she? - Turned of eleven years; the child brought the shrub.</p>
               <p>Court. Then she was twice in the house after you took out your money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you sit still all the time on your chair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you not to put your money back in your pocket? - I did not know that any body was with me but what was honest, I did not know but I had it in my apron till after she was gone, my apron was turned over.</p>
               <p>Where did this woman stand? - She stood close to me till I sent for the shrub.</p>
               <p>How long might it be altogether the prisoner staid in the room? - About five minutes.</p>
               <p>How long after the prisoner went away was it that you missed the money? - Presently.</p>
               <p>Five, ten, or fifteen minutes? - It was not so long as fifteen minutes, it might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room when you missed your money? - Not a soul.</p>
               <p>What did you do when you missed the money? - I was taken so ill I kept my bed four days.</p>
               <p>Who did you first tell? - I told my husband when he came home at night.</p>
               <p>But did you tell nobody else? - I had nobody else to tell.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell your sister or the little girl? - I did not know who to speak to.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of that? - I was so very ill that I could not speak to them.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that when they came into the room that you was speechless? - I was struck very much.</p>
               <p>Did not you speak to your sister at all during that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did nobody come into the room all that time? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290044"></xptr>Did you stay alone in the room from one o'clock till dusk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you dine? - I had a little bit of dinner before this happened.</p>
               <p>Was not it natural for you when you missed your money, to run out of the room and call the little girl? - I was so frightened I made no enquiry.</p>
               <p>Did you sit on the same chair till your husband came home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did not you even get up to look if the money had dropped? - I looked all over the room.</p>
               <p>Then you did not sit still you know. - My sister saw me have the money, I cannot account for my telling nobody, I was taken very ill.</p>
               <p>Then it was natural to call to your sister for assistance: upon your oath, was not the reason that you did not speak to your sister before your husband came home that you had a suspicion of the girl? - I could not speak.</p>
               <p>If you were able to walk you were able to speak. - I could not walk.</p>
               <p>Why you have said already you looked all about the room? - I looked where I sat.</p>
               <p>What time did your husband come home in the evening? - I cannot tell, it was about duskish.</p>
               <p>(The other Witnesses ordered out of Court.)</p>
               <p>Jury. When this woman stood by you, was it possible she could take this money out of your lap without your perceiving it, fourteen guineas is heavy? - I was a little tired and drousy.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes, I never drink.</p>
               <p>It was before one o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you fell asleep while this woman was by you? - I just dropped.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Court. When your husband came home you told him what had happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him the same story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - This was night, and the next day was Sunday, and my brother and sister went out of town on Sunday and took the little girl with them.</p>
               <p>Has the bank note ever been found? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did your brother and sister stay out of town? - Pretty near a week or four days.</p>
               <p>How soon was the prisoner taken up? - She was taken up upon suspicion.</p>
               <p>When? - I do not recollect, my sister will tell you, she was taken up when my sister came back.</p>
               <p>Why not before your sister came back, why did not your husband take her up? - Because my sister knew of the money.</p>
               <p>Why did not your husband take her up? - Because my husband was out when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Then your sister was so material a person that you waited for her coming back from the country, and yet you never told your sister about the loss at the first? - I did not, I could not speak to her I was struck so.</p>
               <p>Why could not your husband and you act without your sister? - Because my sister knew about it.</p>
               <p>Did not your husband know as much as she? - He knew I had the money.</p>
               <p>Why did you wait for your sister's coming home to know about it? - Because she knew I had the money.</p>
               <p>And so did your husband; upon your oath was not the reason both of your not speaking to your sister that day, and of your waiting till they came back for a week, because you suspected the girl? - No.</p>
               <p>Then can you give me any reason why you waited for your sister coming back? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>How long was it after your sister came back that you looked after the woman? - As soon as she came back.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your sister of the loss before she went into the country? - No, I was to go with her.</p>
               <p>Did you see her before she went? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her then? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you give any reason for that? - I cannot upon my honour, I was so very ill.</p>
               <p>Then though you lost this money at one o'clock on Saurday, and your sister's girl<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290045"></xptr> had been twice in the room while you had it in your lap, you never told your sister of the loss till she came out of the country? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What time did you go out on the Saturday that this money was lost? - About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where was your wife when you went out? - She was in her own room.</p>
               <p>What is your most usual time of dining? - About twelve.</p>
               <p>Did you come home to dinner that day? - No, she had dined before I came home, I came home pretty near five.</p>

               <p>What does your family consist of? - Only my wife and myself.</p>
               <p>Who lives in the house? - There are a good many families, I cannot say their names, there is my brother and his wife and three children, one is quite an infant, and the other between eleven and twelve, and the other about eight.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A day labourer.</p>
               <p>What was your wife doing when you came home? - She was not doing any thing, she was leaning upon her elbow at the sill of the window.</p>
               <p>Sitting in the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she asleep or awake? - Awake.</p>
               <p>Was she in liquor or sober? - She was not in liquor, she had drank a glass of brandy, as she told me.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not she in liquor when you came home? - I am sure she was not.</p>
               <p>How came you to ask her what she had drank? - I did not ask her any questions about it, she told me of the loss of the money.</p>
               <p>What connection had her drinking with the loss of the money? - She said a glass of brandy was the only thing she had drank, because she was telling me that she had lost so much money, as she had taken out her money to give to the little girl to go for a quartern of shrub, to treat this washerwoman.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you what money she had lost? - She told me, she had lost fourteen guineas and a ten pound bank note, which I knew she had.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon that? - Nothing, because my brother and sister were gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Why they were not gone before you came home? - No, my brother was with me.</p>
               <p>Did not you enquire of your sister's girl? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you told your sister and brother, and the little girl, all about it that afternoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go down stairs to tell them, or did you call them up? - I called them up stairs.</p>
               <p>To the room where your wife was? - To the room where my wife was.</p>
               <p>Then your wife heard you tell them all about it? - She was present.</p>
               <p>Did she tell them how she had lost it? - She told them how she had lost it, and me too.</p>
               <p>That was that afternoon when you came home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had your wife told your brother and sister about it before you came home? - My brother was out with me.</p>
               <p>Had she told your sister before you came home? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was there no suspicion entertained of the little girl at that time? - Not the least in the world, the little girl went out of the room before the prisoner went out of the room, as my wife told me.</p>
               <p>Did you go immediately after this woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Why not? - Because we had no suspicion of the woman.</p>
               <p>What, when nobody else was in the room? - We could not think it was the woman, we could not say any thing that it was that woman.</p>

               <p>You knew as much about it then as you do now? - No, because before they had</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290046"></xptr>not a sixpenny-piece to help themselves, and the week after we lost it, her husband bought him a new watch, and new clothes.</p>
               <p>Then you did not suspect this woman till after the things were bought? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner's husband? - He is no trade, he was a gentleman's servant on board a ship, he rented a little shop, and set up a penny-barber, and he bought a new watch, and clothes, shoes and buckles, and gowns for her, and every thing of that.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiries at the places where these things were bought whether she had changed any bank notes or not? - No, where he bought the watch the man said he pulled out a handfull of guineas.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you had her taken up? - As near as I can guess about five days, when my sister came home she was the person that found out every thing, or else we had no suspicion of this woman.</p>
               <p>Were you present when this woman was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - She said, she knew nothing at all of it so help her God, and she said before Justice Blackborough, that she would be damned if she owned it.</p>
               <p>She always denyed the charge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who brought your wife the glass of brandy that she said she drank? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came to our house, and he brought me a shirt after his wife went away from him, and she never came home till Friday, that was after her brother and sister was gone into the country, they went away the Sunday, and the Monday she went after them, I was to go there to clean the stairs down, and I went, he then said, that his wife was gone out.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that true? - That is very true.</p>
               <p>When did your wife go from home? - I cannot tell what day it was.</p>
               <p>When did she go from home? - It was on Monday.</p>
               <p>What purpose did she say, she went out for? - She went out to buy some things for herself.</p>
               <p>When did she return? - She was out three days, and the fourth day she came home.</p>
               <p>All that time did you know what was become of her? - I did not know what was become of her, for she was taken very ill.</p>
               <p>That is as she told you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did she say she had been? - She had been to a tallow-chandler's in some court near Temple-bar, and she said, she had sent a porter four times, and paid him sixpence a time, but he had never been near the place.</p>
               <p>Did you go to that place to see whether she had been there? - No, but she said, if I would go, she would go with me.</p>
               <p>You chose to take her word? - I did.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself that you are upon your oath, did she tell you of the loss of your money on the Saturday, or after she came home? - She told me of the loss of the money immediately, as I came home on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>And she told your brother, and sister, and all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know what money she had? - I know that was the money she had when I went out.</p>
               <p>Exactly that money? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>She had more than that? - She had about ten pounds more, that remained when she went out on Monday to buy her some things.</p>
               <p>Is not she a good deal given to drinking? Not that ever I saw, she loves a glass or so.</p>
               <p>So you were satisfied with the story that she told you, of the four days that she was out, sending to you four times without making any enquiry? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. You live in the house, you married this man's brother? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you at home when this affair happened? - Yes, I employed the prisoner to wash for me.</p>
               <p>Then you employed her? - Yes, I went up stairs to my sister, and she asked me to have a drop of brandy, I had a little drop, and my sister had a drop, the washer-woman would not drink any.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear of the robbery? - Some time in the day.</p>
               <p>Who told you of it? - My sister told my brother of it, and I heard of it, I was not in my sister's room till her husband came home.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - About five or six, I cannot say to the hour.</p>
               <p>You never saw your sister all the time? - No, my Lord, I gave this washerwoman three pence to get a peck of coals as I was going in the country the next day, she returned between eight and nine with some things.</p>
               <p>You had heard of the robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your sister had told you all about it? - Yes, that she had lost the money, and that there was no other person in the room but this woman.</p>
               <p>How long did the prisoner stay? - She did not stay five minutes, I paid her fifteen pence for what she had done for me.</p>
               <p>Did you tell her what had happened? - No, as it was Saturday night, we thought we could do nothing on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>You asked her no questions? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - We were persuaded to say nothing about it, till we could do something in it, on the Sunday I was obliged to go out of town, and they let it alone till I returned.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it proper to ask her some questions that evening? - No, my Lord, because they desired I would say nothing about it till my return.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect this woman at that time? - Yes, because there was nobody else in the place.</p>
               <p>Did you talk with your sister and your brother about your suspicions of that woman that evening. - On the Saturday morning my sister's son, who had been at sea asked her for seven guineas, she gave it to him, and she told her money in my presence, and I saw her put it in her pocket again before I went up stairs, the son was gone then for hours.</p>
               <p>How came she to have the money out for hours after he was gone? - She took it out to send for some shrub, I was present when she took out her money to see whether it was all right, she was telling her money when I went into the room about ten minutes before the prisoner came into the room.</p>
               <p>How much had she got then? - Fourteen guineas and some silver, and a bank note which was wrapped up in a paper.</p>
               <p>Was that exactly the gold? - That was exactly the gold.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - That was all I saw, whether she had any more any where else, I know nothing at all about that, she told me, she was going to pay some money away.</p>
               <p>Did you see it told? - I saw her tell fourteen guineas, and some silver, and a bank note.</p>
               <p>Was there any more? - She did not pull any more out of her pocket before my face.</p>
               <p>After you came home what was done with this woman? - We sent for her and asked her to return the money and we would not hurt her, she said, the watch her husband took out of pawn, at the pawnbroker's in Bell Court, she said, she had a new gown that she changed with her sister, which her sister denied, she denied ever seeing the money; then we had a warrant of Justice Blackborough, and she was in prison six days, and he acquitted her, then there was an indictment for some trifling things of mine, I missed them the next morning.</p>
               <p>Were they ever found? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your girl here? - No she is turned of eleven.</p>
               <p>Why did not she come here? - I did not know she was old enough.</p>

               <p>JAMES BIRCHALL. I am an officer and took the prisoner- he said he had hard work to get the handkerchief out; that he saw them eating some dinner in the cookshop, and he thought he would take the handkerchief to get some.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He says he saw me following him, and I was looking into a cookshop; I saw his handkerchief hanging partly out of his pocket and it was pinned with this pin - I took hold of it to make him ashamed of himself for having it pinned; I saw the people eating and making mouths one at another, and I thought I would have some. <rs id="t18290115-227-verdict1223" type="verdictDescription">

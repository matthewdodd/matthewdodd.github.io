            . Q. What are you - A. I am a carpenter; I worked with the prisoner seven weeks, part of the month of April, and part of the month of May. On a Sunday evening I called in at a public house in Oxford road, I met with a few friends, they asked me what tools Maydew had; I said he had but one trying plane. I said that I saw the prisoner deface a rabbit plane and seven bead planes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw these things in possession of the prisoner - A. Yes, and I saw him plane the name off at the end of all the planes in a room, where he and I was at work for Mr. Shillitoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him at the time he did it - A. No; I reported it to the public house, and took particular notice that I should know the rabbit plane again; I was requested to bring the rabbit plane to the public house, I did; the prosecutor said, I will swear it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body at the time you saw this done - A. Yes, I told this gentleman at the King's Arms opposite the Pantheon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw the prosecutor examine the plane - A. At the King's Arms; I was desired to bring it there for inspection, on that day I said to Magdew is this rabbit plane yours; he said yes; I took it without his observation and took it to the King's Arms in Oxford road.</p>

I am a stone mason, I live at No. 12, Gate street, Lincoln's Inn Fields,; I have known the prisoner eleven months, he hears a good character for honesty; Bassam said first, before he took a slip out of his pocket, that it was his property; the slip had been worked with a plane, it would not fit, and then he said it was not his property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

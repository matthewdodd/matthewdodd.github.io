            . On the 23rd of January I lost a shawl, a cap, and two pieces of lace - I am out at work from half-past six o'clock in the morning till eight at night; I leave my mother-in-law in care of my place and children - I had seen these things on the Monday. and missed them on the Sunday afterwards - I have known the prisoner ever since August last.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH FREEMAN. The prisoner sent my mother out on an errand from the prosecutor's house on that Saturday - she then told me to take up the baby, light a candle, and play with him - she then went down to the yard, as I thought; I heard somebody at my sister's door - I went into the passage, and inquired who was there; no one answered - I then opened my mother's door, saw my sister's door open. and the prisoner near her bed-side; she said, "Lork, Betsey I thought your mother was here;" I said, "You know very well she is not, you sent her out on an errand;" we then both came into the room together, and she told me to go and lock my sister's door - I went to lock it; the key was not in it - I took the key from the nail, locked the door, and came in again.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH FREEMAN, SEN. I am the mother of this witness, and mother-in-law of the prosecutrix. The prisoner asked me to go into Brick-lane for her - I was washing a gown at the time; I might be gone about half an hour - I delivered my message, and she was to go in the evening to the place for an answer; when I returned she said, "Your daughter's door was open;" I said, "It was not when I went down stairs."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do own to taking the things. but not with an intent to steal - this witness has pawned many of my things. Witness. Yes, but I always fetched them out again.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MILLAR. I am an officer of St. Luke's. I took the prisoner - she said she knew nothing at all about the robbery; she afterwards gave up the duplicates out of her bosom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did she not say she would take 6d. per week if I would give it her? A. Not in my hearing.</p>

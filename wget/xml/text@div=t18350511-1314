                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Champion. On the 15th of May, the prisoner and her elder sister came into the shop about twelve o'clock—they asked to look at some stays—they then asked to look at some shoes—I shewed them some—the prisoner, who was at the other side of the shop, came to the counter where I was shewing the other the shoes—she took three pairs and put them on the ground, and in about five minutes she put them on the counter—she then put one pair under her shawl, and said to the other, "Come, make haste"—the other female then said, she would have one pair, and gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence, and a half-crown, and told me to give her a shilling—they then left the shop; I followed and brought the prisoner back—I found the shoes under her left arm.</p>

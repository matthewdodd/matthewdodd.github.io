            . I attend the Paddington stages, which stand in Princes-street. On the 14th of December, about a quarter-past four o'clock, I was going to see what was booked for the stage, and as I came out of Founders' Hall-court I saw the prisoner; he asked if I wanted a job - I said Yes: he asked if I ever got a cheque changed - I said Yes: he asked if I would go and change one for him- I said I would. He had a cheque in his hand, and asked what o'clock it was - I said, about four: he stood about a minute, and then said, "Come along;" he walked a little way out of the court with me - he was in the court all this time; he came as far as the court next before you come to Tokenhouse-yard - he there gave me the cheque; I asked what I was to get for it - he said, two notes, and that he would wait up the court; I ran into the banking-house, and presented the cheque; the gentleman came out with me - I ran on before the gentleman, to Founders' Hall-court, where he said he would be; I did not find him there; I then went into the middle of the road, and saw him up the next gate-way - I went up to him, and said,"Sir, you have given me a wrong cheque;" he made a dash away from me directly, but I caught hold of him by the collar, and held him till the gentleman came up; I am sure he is the person from whom I received the cheque.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know him before? A. I never saw him before; when he darted from me, the gate was shut, and I shoved him right up against it; he shoved right away from me; he had told me he would be up the court, and I thought he meant Founders' Hall-court; he spoke plain English to me - I did not take him for a foreigner; the cheque was stopped at the banking-house - I did not get the money.</p>

            . I am cashier to Messrs. Lewis Lloyd and others - there are four partners; Mr. Charles Fothergill, of the Stock Exchange, keeps cash at our house; we have no other customer of the name of Fothergill, whose Christian name begins with the letter C. On the 14th of December the last witness presented a cheque to me, which I marked- this is it; I saw at once that it was nothing like Mr. Fothergill's hand-writing - I did not pay it; I said nothing to the lad myself; Mr. Gallatly, another cashier, was just behind me, and I showed it to him; he was of the same opinion, and went out with the boy.</p>

            . I am cashier to Messrs. Jones and Lloyd; Wood showed me the cheque; I went round the counter, to the boy, sent him out, and followed him to the court next beyond Founders' Hall-court, and when opposite the court, in the road, I saw him lift his hand, and go into the court: I instantly saw the prisoner dart out of the court, the boy holding him by the collar; our porter, being nearer than me, seized him; I was about twelve yards off; we took him to the banking-house: I sent for Mr. Brown, the marshall, whom I saw find a number of papers on him; the cheque is not Mr. Fothergill's handwriting, nor any thing like it.</p>

            . This cheque is not Mr. Fothergill's writing - he has kept cash with us about two years; I see a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100031"></xptr>good many of his drafts. When the cheque was presented it was as clean as it is now.</p>
               <p>MR. NEVILLE BROWN. I am a City marshall. An officer was sent for to the Mansion-house, and I went to the banking-house, about a quarter to five o'clock; I searched the prisoner, and found several papers on him, one of which I produce; he was then asked how he became possessed of the cheque, which was either in Mr. Gates'(the solicitor) hand, or lying on the desk; he said he had picked it up, I think, in Bartholomew-lane; he was asked in what part of the lane; he said, in the court leading to the Stock Exchange, near the center of the court - it was a damp mizling evening, and the streets were very dirty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say in what form he had picked it up? A. No - he made no remark about the paper; his answer was directed to the cheque, and nothing else; he said he picked it up about four o'clock - it is a paved court, but I should think it could not be clean, as so many persons pass up and down it - it is not a covered court.</p>

            . I am a stock-broker. I know the handwriting of Mr. Charles Fothergill, of the Stock Exchange - this cheque is not his hand-writing, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>The cheque was here put in and read, also the paper found on the prisoner, which was as follows: - "Mr. Saldos to N. Nathan, - to two weeks' rent, from the 21st of November to the 5th of December, for shop and furnished room, 1l. 16s." On the back of this bill was the name of C. Fothergill, written three times, and the name of Fothergill once without the letter C.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I stand charged with uttering as true a bill, signed C. Fothergill, for 110l. Upon the 13th of December, being in the City, on business, and passing through Bartholomew-court, I found the instrument alluded to, enclosed in a paper, with the name of Fothergill written on it; in consequence of my being a foreigner, and not acquainted with the laws of this country, I considered I was fully entitled to the same, and, without consulting any friend, or giving it a moment's consideration, I employed a messenger to present it for payment, not entertaining the most distant idea of its being a forgery: the event of that step has unfortunately placed me in the situation I now stand before you. I am a native of Spain, and have been in this country only three years, and during that period have been in the employment of two most respectable firms in London, in the silk trade, independent of which I am in the receipt of 35l. per annum, as a Spanish Refugee, and therefore there could be no possible inducement for me to commit such an offence; by such a step I should deprive myself of every thing which is most valuable and dear to men, namely, my character, which will appear, by witnesses; and I entreat you to lay aside all prejudice against me: I beg to call your attention to these various circumstances, and trust, after the most serious consideration, you will come to such a conclusion as will restore me to liberty and my friends.</p>

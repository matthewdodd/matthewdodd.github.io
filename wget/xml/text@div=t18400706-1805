About six o'clock in the morning of the 1st of July I was in Leadenhall-street, and saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from a gentleman—I acquainted the gentleman of it—the prisoner turned and saw me, and made off—I directly pursued him round Billiter-street, down Mincing-lane, and lost sight of him—he was taken into custody coming up St. Dunstan's-hill within ten minutes—this is the handkerchief I saw him take—I am sure he is the man—I lost the gentleman, and do not know his name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of Charlotte Rees—she was seven<lb></lb>teen years old, and lived with me in a cottage at Woolwich. On Monty, the 4th of March, I went out to take my husband's dinner—my daughter was not at home when I went out—I saw her last alive at seven o'clock that morning—I came home about seven o'clock in the evening, and on entering the cottage found her lying near the fire-place dead—I sent for Mr. M'Donald—I would humbly beg pardon for the prisoner—I am very sorry for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and work for Mr. Furlong, at Woolwich. The prisoner also worked for him, and M'Connell also—we were all three in the garden, on the evening of the 4th of March, at half-past five o'clock—M'Connell loaded the gun with powder and ball in my presence—after it was loaded, the prisoner came up and joined us—it was proposed that it should be fired at a mark, and a block of wood was put up for the purpose—the prisoner fired the gun at that block of wood, which was between him and Rees's cottage—the block was about twelve yards from the cottage, as near as I can judge—the prisoner stood between five or six yards from the block when he fired—it was a chopping-block, a sort of stool, which stood on three legs—it was from twelve to thirteen inches thick, or eighteen or twenty inches in diameter—he fired at the centre of it—there was a piece of paper on it as a mark—we were not aware of any mis<lb></lb>chief having happened—the gun was only fired once that evening—in the course of the evening we heard of the death of the young woman, and as we were going to bed, the prisoner told me he was afraid that something had been done with the shot of the gun that night.</p>

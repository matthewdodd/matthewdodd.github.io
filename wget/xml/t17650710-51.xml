            . On Thursday morning the watchman came and knock'd me out of bed at three in the morning; I went down, and saw the watchman had brought my mother's two sows.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your mother live?</p>
               <p>Turner. In Berwick-street; I live there also. The watchman said, the man that had them was in the round-house; I went there, and ask'd the prisoner what his name was; he said his name was Pickering: I ask'd him if it was not Prince; he said, No: I ask'd him if he could read or write; he said, No: I ask'd him if he was not clear'd on Wednesday; he said he was: I ask'd what he was doing with the two sows; he said he was going to drive them to the Green yard: I ask'd him if he was not ashamed of committing so rash an act, just after his being accused with a crime of the same sort; he said he wanted some money to buy him some shoes, or to sole his shoes; I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the hogs lost from out of a stye, or where?</p>
               <p>Turner. We always lock them up; but I believe the man was a little in liquor that night, and did not lock them up; it is always my order that they should be lock'd up.</p>

            . I am a watchman belonging to St. James's; the prisoner came by a little before two in the morning; I knowing the two sows, stopt him, and ask'd him where he was driving the two hogs; he said to St. James's market: after that he said he was going to drive them to Tothilfields Pound: I told him he should drive them no farther; he swore he would; I said he should not: I took him to the watch-house, and drove the hogs home to Mr. Turner's. The prisoner told me he had been confined some time, and had been acquitted that day.</p>

               <p>I have nothing farther to say than what I have said; I have no friend in the world; I saw the two sows in the street, and was going to take them to the Pound, to get a little money to put some shoes upon my feet to go into the country, as I heard there was an act of parliament against their going in the street.</p>

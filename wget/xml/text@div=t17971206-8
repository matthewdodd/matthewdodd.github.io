Stubbs lived in the lower part of the same house; he had left the house a few days before the accident happened, which was on the 3d of October.</p>
               <p>Q.what occasioned him to leave your house at that time? - A. A little dispute arose between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any blows pass? - A. Not much of that, he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he beat you? - A. He struck me once, there was a blow or so passed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he beat you with? - A.With a bit of iron that he presses his wigs with.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of an iron was it? - A. It was fixed in a wooden handle.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that piece of iron? - A. I do not know; it laid in the window of the room that I live in for a day or two, and then he took it away to do his work with.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, on the night of this quarrel, he left your house? - A. Yes; I do not know whether it was the Friday before the 3d of October, or the Friday week, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. On the Friday morning after, he called for a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come on the 3d of October? - A. Yes; I w the fore parlour with the deceased, George W.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he about? - A. Only sitting in the chair; I was busy at work; Stubbs came in and said, he was come to his lodging, and I told him he must not come there any more; he said, he would; I told him he should not; he said, he should, for where his work was, he would be; he said he had left a black handkerchief; I told him I did not know any thing of it, if he had left it, to go and look for it; he went to look for his handkerchief; says he, I thought I had not left it here, or else I should have found it, but I must have lost it. He used to make his wigs in the back room; when he came out of the back room, the deceased was sitting in my room, and he was rather angry with my denying him his lodging, and said, rogues and thieves could sit there, although he could not sit there; then he went round to the back of the seat, where he was sitting, and I was standing just by doing my work, and he went out; I was watching to see if he would go out at the door, and I saw his hand go gently, not, knowing he was going to hit him; he gave him a blow, with his hand only indeed; his hand was open when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q.When he struck him, was his hand open or shut then? - A. That I cannot say; I suppose it must be shut.</p>
               <p>Q.The right hand or the left? - A. The right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that he struck him? - A. Near the middle of his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, had Ware interfered at all in the dispute between you and Stubbs? - A. Not that I heard, I do not think he said much; if there was any words passed, it is more than I know.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Stubbs then? - A. He directly went out of my apartment; I went to the street-door myself to look after him, and when I returned into the room,

             was standing up; I observed his forehead to blood in that part where Stubbs's hand had been, and I said to him, Lord bless me, does it bleed; he said, Yes; and I told him I would get a little flower, and stop it if I could; he said, do not mind it, let it bleed, he would not have any thing; in the course of a little time it stopped of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a wound did it appear to you to be? - A. It was a very small wound, to look at it it was nothing, it was like a scratch of a pin more than any thing else; nobody could have thought it would have ended in the manner that it has.</p>
               <p>Q. The skin was broke? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen, before this time, that piece of iron last? - A.Indeed I cannot particularly say, it might be a day or two, or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen it then? - A. It laid in the window till he took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you examine the wound? - A. The next morning; I advised him to get a little warm milk and water, and bathe it with; it then looked like a deepish scratch, and bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear then in a mild, or an angry state? - A. It looked reddish; I put a plaister upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it, or dress it again? - A. I do not know whether it was the next day or the day after; when I saw it again, I thought it did not heal well, and I drest it once after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after that? - A. Four weeks, and I believe he died the third day; four weeks and three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Stubbs came to live with you as usual? - A.Yes; I think it was a week after the 3d of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Nobody looked upon this as any thing at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The poor man, who died, thought nothing of it? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Some few days after he received the blow, this man, Stubbs, came back to his apartments, and you and he were reconciled? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not Stubbs advise him to go to the doctor's? - A. Yes; he said, I won't make it up unless you will make it up with my wife too; he said, he had not the least objection to that.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, they were all as good friends as usual? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As your plaister did not quite cure this, did not Stubbs advise him to go and have some little advice? - A. Yes; and about a fortnight after,

             came down, and he and Stubbs had two or three pots of beer together; and Stubbs said to him, as your forehead does not seem to get better, you had better go to surgeon Potts, in Pall-Mall, and I will go with you; Ware said, it did not signify, and therefore he did not go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. At the time he struck the blow, do you know whether he used any words, or what he said? - A. No; there were no words at all that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether or not, from that 3d of October, the deceased frequently complained of his head? - A. He did not make any complaints till he got worse and worse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he or not frequently complain of his head? - A. When I have asked him about his forehead, he said it did not mend, and it was very sore, he could not beat his hat on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of his head frequently? - A. He used to say his head was very sore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of any pain in it? - A. Yes, certainly; I dare say he had a pain in his head.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I tell you the reason why I ask you, I want to know whether the Magistrate has put that in your examination as true, which was false; I have it down here, that you said, he frequently complained of a pain in his head? - A. Yes, he did, no doubt.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. On the 3d of October in the evening, I was washing for Mrs. Smallman, down stairs in the back kitchen; my husband and I, and Mrs. Smallman had supped together in her parlour, and I left him in the room; I went into the room where he was, between eight and nine o'clock, my husband had cooked some fish for supper in my room, and brought it down there; I was in the back kitchen, washing, I heard the voice of Mr. Stubbs, but what he said, I do not know, he seemed as if he was not very well pleased; I went up stairs; in about a quarter of an hour after that, I saw my husband sitting in the great chair with his arms on his knees, and his head held down and bleeding; I said, what is the matter, Mrs. Smallman answered, Stubbs has struck your husband when he never spoke to him; I then said, by God, he has murdered my husband; Stubbs was then gone out, he seemed to have bled a great deal, by the floor, it seemed to be trod about; my husband got up to go out, but Mrs. Smallman would not let him; my husband went to bed, and I went down to my work, and it was two o'clock before I had done my work, and then I went up stairs to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Smallman examine or dress this wound? - A. I did not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the wound? - A. In the morning, before I got out of be.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe its appearance? - A. seemed like two cuts, with a dent in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say to you what he was struck with? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue to go out as usual, after that? - A. He continued to go out for almost three weeks, but sometimes, may-be, he would lay a-bed a couple of days, or a day, he complained terribly of his head; the first time he entirely took to his room, was, the day three weeks that the accident happened at night, it was on the Tuesday night, he never came down any more, but once; him and Mr. Stubbs had drank two pots of beer together that day, he had dined there that day, and had eat a bit of mutton.</p>
               <p>Q.You lived in Mr. Smallman's house, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did he appear when he took to his bed? - A. The next morning he seemed very poorly indeed, and every day he seemed rather to get worse.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first send for a doctor? - A. On the Tuesday following, that was that day four weeks that the accident happened, at four o'clock in the morning, he got out of bed, and the use of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060023"></xptr>his right side was taken away; he retained his senses to the last word he spoke. I sent for Mr. Russell first, and he would not come; then Mr. Perrin came on the Tuesday evening, he is an apothecary, he took off the plaister, and said he would go and fetch another gentleman, which he did; and Mr. Thomas came.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in short, the surgeons trepanned him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that operation had been performed, what state was he in? - A. He seemed to rest a great deal better that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did any alteration take place after that night? - A. The next day he seemed to get worse, and I went for a clergyman, that was on the Wednesday, I locked my door, and left the key with Mrs. Blythe, and begged her to look at my husband while I was out, to see if he wanted any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did he seem sensible of the danger of his own situation? - A. He seemed to take very little notice of his situation; I told him, I thought he was dying, and he said, then I must die.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know that you were going for a clergyman? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. did he use any other expression, slating whether he thought himself in danger or not? - A. No. I could not get a clergyman, they were both gone out; this was on the Wednesday, and on the Friday, he died, about half past one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Court Q. You saw the wound the next morning, and it seemed like two scratches and a dent in the middle-were those two scratches opposite to each other? - A. Yes; it was wider at the top than it was at the bottom.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE BLYTHE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I lodge in the same house; my husband is servant to Lord Ashbourn; I was present just after the quarrel between Mrs. Smallman and Stubbs; she cried out, murder! and when I came down, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the night the accident happened? - A. No; he said he was very sorry for the accident, and turned into my room; he pulled the plaister off himself; I saw it was a very bad wound in his forehead, and his face was grazed with; the handle of the iron that he had struck him with; it appeared to me as if it had been struck with something sharp; it appeared to me like a dent in the middle and a scratch two ways; I thought it must be struck with an instrument, as it appeared to me from the wound.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.You are clear it could not be a wound given with the open hand, or with a clenched fist? - A. No; it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went for the doctor? - A. Yes; three weeks after the blow was given, the Tuesday before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. During the operation by the surgeons, had you any conversation with the prisoner? - A. Yes; on the Tuesday I went down and tapped at the window where Stubbs was at work, and I asked him how he could strike Ware such a blow, for the surgeon says it will be his death; he said he was frightened, and he was never frightened at any thing but this; he said, he was so savage to see him sitting in the chair, that he had not cared if he had killed him outright; but, says, he, I could not be in my right senses, for just before I came into the house, I had a sit in the street; and I said, if any thing happens of this, you may bring the man that picked you up; and there was no more passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when Mrs. Ware went for the clergyman? - A. Yes; while she was gone, I went up into the room of the deceased, and asked him if he wanted any thing; he told me he would be glad if I would bring him a cup of tea; I immediately returned into my own room, and got it; I carried it up, and put my hand under his head, and he drank it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem at all aware of the opinion of the surgeons; did he seem to think himself in danger? - A. I will tell you what passed.</p>
               <p>Court. q. Did he seem to think that he was in his last moments? - A. Yes; it appeared so to me when he had drank the tea; I asked him if he wanted any thing to eat; he said, no, I thank you; but if you will bring me a bit of bread and butter, an onion, and some salt, for my supper, and some of Flowers's small-beer, I shall be obliged to you; for, says he, what a person fancies when they are ill, does them more good than doctor's stuff; says he, my father fancied-toast and cyder, they would not let him have it, and he got out of bed, and drank it, and mended ever after; I told him, I am sorry to see you suffer so on such an occasion; ah! says he, and never spoke to the man when he struck me; I said, the gentlemen are for taking Stubbs up, are you willing for it; the deceased said, the parish will see to that, for he has murdered me with the same iron that he beat Mrs. Smallman with, the Friday night before; when he struck me, he said, you b-r, I have done for you; that was all that passed; then I was obliged to go to my children; I never spoke to him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Stubbs was in the house at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Stubbs and the deceased dining and drinking together? - A. No; I never went into their apartments.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am an apothecary: I was called in to the deceased, on Tuesday the 31st of October, by Mrs. Blythe; I went to him, and I judged, from the symptoms, that there was a fracture; I only<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060024"></xptr>took off the plaister, the wound was upon the right side of the forehead, and it was nearly healed, the scalp did not adhere to the skull, and the opposite side to where the wound was, was quite useless; he complained of a violent pain in his head, his wife first informed me so, I asked him, and he put his hand up to his head; from this symptom, and the appearance, I judged it was a fracture, and called in Mr. Thomas, a surgeon, he came with me immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You know something of surgery yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe whether it was done by an instrument? - A. It was impossible I could judge from the appearance at that moment, there was such a quantity of stuff about it that it was impossible; Mr. Thomas came, and judged as I did, that there was a fracture, and he performed the operation of trepanning; I attended the trepanning.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing him trepanned, you could form some judgment probably by what that wound was occasioned? - A. Most undoubtedly, by some piece of iron, or some instrument; it is impossible I can say what.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was not such a wound as could be given by a flat hand or a fist? - A. No; it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. What was you observation after the operation was performed? - A. I supposed the man would die from the appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any particular observation upon the part? - A. There was a great quantity of matter issued out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you tell him the danger he was in? - A. I told his wife; the man himself was insensible during the operation; he was somewhat relieved from the operation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attribute his death to the blow? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>- THOMAS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I was called in to the deceased, on Tuesday evening, by Mr. Perrin; I found that he had lost the use of the right side entirely.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether, in point of practice, it does not frequently happen that the person who has received a facture may lose the use of the opposite side? - A. Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. How did you find the wound at that time? - A. It was nearly closed; but upon introducing a probe, I found a roughness upon the bone; I immediately laid open the skin, and perceived a fracture, with depression of the skull; I then applied the trepan, and immediately a large quantity of matter issued out; the patient appeared to be perfectly insensible of pain, but the following morning seemed somewhat relieved.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the blow had been given by the hand, or by an instrument? - A. I should suppose, by the appearance, it was given by a sharp pointed instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could you judge whether the instrument was a very sharp instrument, or a blunt instrument, square or round? - A. I should suppose it had been the end of a poker, or something of that sort would have made a similar indenture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. To what did you impute his death? - A. In consequence of the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to have been taken proper care of? - A. I should suppose if he had been taken care of in the first instance, it might have done very well, allowing for the danger of the operation itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to be a kind of wound that would of necessity have required the operation? - A. Most undoubtedly it would.</p>
               <p>Q. That is always a hazardous operation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you visited him again, had he recovered his senses? - A. In part, he then answered some questions, but rather incoherently, he said he was easier, and he said he had slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend him afterwards? - A. Yes, twice a day; he never recovered his senses completely afterwards, nor the use of his side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. From the time you were first called in, to the time of his death, you did not think he was perfectly rational? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am the beadle of St. James's parish; I apprehended the prisoner, I supposed him to be the man, I met him in Jermyn-street; I came up to him, and asked him what his name was, he said, my name is Stevens; I asked him to let me look at his right hand, he had both hands in his coat pocket; he pulled out his right hand, and shewed it to me, and according to the information I had by the public advertisements, he was the man, he had got the first joint of his left thumb off; I told him, he must go along with me; he said, Lord have mercy upon me, I hope you will not hurt me; says I, I will not; I took him, and put him in St. James's watch-house: I went up to the office, and enquired for the coroner's warrant and commitment, in consequence of which it was that I apprehended him; I had an order to take him to Bow-street, I took him to Bow-street, I laid down the warrant, and informed Mr. Bond, and he said, he did not see occasion to hear any of the matters that had been heard before the coroner; he said, here is your commitment, take him to Newgate; I called a coach, and took him to Newgate, going along, I asked him how he came,o do it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you tell him it would be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060025"></xptr>better for him? - A. No; I did not hold out any threat or promise; I told him it was a shocking thing; he said, why did not he take care of it in time; I offered to take him to Dr. Potts's, says he, he is an acquaintance of mine; that is the principal of what I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You did not go after him, till after the coroner's inquest had been taken? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. One of the gentlemen, the the surgeon, said, if he had come to him sooner, he might have been as well as any man; I told him, I would go with him to Mr. Potts's, he said, he never would, but he never came down, and I never saw him up after; about a fortnight after the accident happened, I dined with him, and drank with him, till ten o'clock at night; his wife had given him a violent blow or two upon the part where he was wounded, and he never got up after.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Ware.) Q. The prisoner says, in his defence, that you gave your husband a blow or two upon that part of the head where the wound was, is that so? - A. No; I was one day putting on my cap, he was standing very near me, and I touched his head with my hand, as I was pinning my ribbon, and the matter came out of the wound, I told him, I was sure, I could not have hurt him so much; I said, his head could not be so bad as he made of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is a person in the Court that Mrs. Ware told so.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Angel and Crown, in Eaton-street; I have known the prisoner two years since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a character has he bore for good nature? - A. I never heard any thing to the contrary; in the morning that this accident happened in the evening, Ware came from the country, and he came over to me, to ask me to lend him a hat, he had lost his hat the night before, coming with the conch; in the evening, Mrs. Ware came over, and said, Mortlake, we have had such a row over at our house -</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell what she said? - A. Next morning I saw Mr. Ware, he told me, that Stubbs and he had had words, and that he had received a blow; he shewed me the blow, and I said, I thought he was able to defend himself against Mr. Stubbs, and he said, oh, I will make him come down for this.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Ware consider this at all as a serious thing? - A. No; only he said, he would make him come down for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, from what you saw at that time, think it at all a serious thing? - A. Not at all; it appeared to me to be only a graze on the temple, just about the eye; Ware came constantly to my house for a fortnight or three weeks after, and I went over with some beer for both of them to drink, the beer was set down to Stubbs, and they seemed very good friends.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you? - A. I keep a public-house, the Angel and Crown.</p>

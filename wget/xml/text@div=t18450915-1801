                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Welsh, and live at No. 20, Great Saffron-bill. On Tuesday morning, the 26th of Aug., I went to the prisoner's room, and knocked at her door—she told me to come in—I did her good morning, and she did me good morning—I said, "Mary, you have served me very pretty for the last two days, and abused me most shamefully, and I do not deserve it from you: I have always been a good friend to you"—she said, "Yes, that I acknowledge"—I said, "You said yesterday you would rip my bowels out, and I don't deserve such state<lb></lb>ments as you have made for the last two days; if you are a better woman than me, come down into the court if you like, and we will decide it with<lb></lb>out any further variance"—she said, "Go out of my room," and seized the. chopper from the corner of the room—I said, "I did not come into your room to injure you"—she took the chopper, and immediately was going to hit me—I caught the chopper and took it out of her hand, and while doing so she made several blows at my shoulder—I said, "Take care of the child"—she had her child in her arras—I took the cho<lb></lb>pper out of her hand and laid it on the table—Mary Leary, who was in the room, took it off the table, and put it in one corner under<lb></lb>neath the cupboard—the prisoner then ran and took either a jug or a basin and threw it, but it did not touch me—she then took the chopper again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184509150010"></xptr>
               <p>from underneath the cupboard and hit me a violent blow with it—I do not know how deep it was—I did not look in the glass to see—I said to the women that were in the room, "Oh, she has murdered me, she has hit me with the chopper"—Mary Leary and Catherine Cashman, the two women, said, "Come out of the room, for we shall be all killed here"—they both cried out at the same time—as they were bringing me out at the door she hit me with the milk-pot and cut me under the eye—I have the mark now—I was taken into my own room by Leary, Cashman, and two more neigh<lb></lb>bours who ran down stairs—I was hardly able to walk—I lost a great deal of blood, and the blow stunned me—I walked with their assistance—I sent for Mr. Bartlett, who advised me that the hospital was the best place for me—I went to the hospital in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they took off the strapping, and sewed up this part of my eye where it was cut—they would not keep me in, as I was pregnant, but said I should be an out-patient—I then walked home, and kept my bed for a week from the injury, except going to give evidence against her before the Magistrate on the Friday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Field-lane—I was in the prisoner's room when Welch came in—she asked the prisoner to come down stairs and see which was the best woman—she refused—they had some words—the pri<lb></lb>soner took the chopper in her hand, and desired Welch to go out of her room—she did not go, and then she rushed on Welch, and Welch rushed on her, took the chopper out of her hand, and laid it on the table—I took it off the table and put it under the cupboard to conceal it—Welch then moved towards the door with my persuasion, and while I turned to open the door she got a blow on the forehead—I did not see what with, and on coming out at the door the prisoner hit her with the mug—I did not see the chopper since I put it away—I did not know Welch was cut till she said, "See how she has served me"—I had persuaded Welch very much to come out, but she would not—they still had words, and were aggravating one another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eighteen years old—I live in the same house with the prosecutrix—I heard a noise in the prisoner's room, went down and saw Welch outside her door with her gown up to her face—she cried out that she was hit with the chopper—Mrs. Cashman said she was not hit with the chopper—Welch replied that she was—she came into her own room, and when I saw her bleeding I screamed out—my mother and father came down and helped her into her room, with Mrs. Cashman—she sat down and fainted away—I ran and fetched the doctor—I saw the chopper in the prisoner's hand in her own room—I went to the door, and said, "Mrs. Horrogan, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to take a chopper in your hand to strike Mrs. Welch with"—she said, "I did not strike her with the chopper"—I said, "Mrs. Welch said you did"—my mother went in and said, "Mrs. Horrogan, if you were outside the door, I would give you a good hit myself, for striking the woman in that way with such a thing as that"—she replied that if me or my mother came into her room, she would serve us the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I saw the prosecutrix there, she had two cuts, one over the eye, and one below—the cut over the eye was not a very severe wound, not down to the bone—if a violent blow had been given with a hatchet I should think it would have got to the bone—it might have been done with a hatchet, or a mug, or saucer—it was not a clean cut wound—I should think this hatchet if used forcibly would have made a clean wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk of the works at St. Paul's Cathedral. I have seen about 60lbs. of lead, which has been produced by the policeman—I recognize it as the balance weights of the great chandelier—it was safe on 17th or 18th of Dec., and I missed it about 21st Dec.—this is a portion of it—I have compared it with the other balances—here is the mark of an iron hoop which went round them—I have no doubt it is the same—these four pieces balanced the great chandelier.</p>

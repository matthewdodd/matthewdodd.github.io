                  </hi>. On 31st July I was at the Blackwall Railway-station at Fenchurch-street at twenty minutes before 10 o'clock—I felt the prisoner at my watch—he made a start, and I ran and caught him in the act of putting the watch in another man's pocket; I am quite clear the prisoner is the man—I called the policeman and he took him—he was standing still when I caught him, and he denied that he had taken the watch—I said, "Never mind, you are the man that robbed me of my watch"—he had a coat on his right arm—this is the watch, it has the maker's name inside it and my own name; it was made for me.</p>

SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did this happen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twenty minutes to 10 o'clock—it was near the Blackwall station—there had been an excursion—there were a great many people—I am not aware that I had ever seen the prisoner before—the first thing that attracted my attention was the tug at my watch—there were a good many people about, and a good deal of pushing and struggling to get by—I saw the prisoner near me after I felt the tug—I did not cry out that I had lost my watch till I had collared the prisoner; I followed him as close as possible through the mob and collared him myself—the other man, Mr. Green, was near; he was waiting for some of his children—the prisoner was in the crowd at the time he was putting the watch in the pocket, and I collared him—this was at night—I saw the prisoner drop the Watch behind him.</p>

I am a porter in Billingsgate market—I was with the last witness at the station in Fenchurch-street on 31st July—I was looking for my little boy—I felt a shove at my pocket—the last witness collared the prisoner immediately, and said "He has got my watch"—I said, "No, he has dropped it in my pocket"—the policeman took the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

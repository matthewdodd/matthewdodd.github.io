            , or Bearer, was taken out by the Person that brought the Money; but none of the Witnesses were positive that that Person was the Prisoner. Isaac Woodburn depos'd thus. On Tuesday the 26th of Jan. about 8 at Night, the Prisoner came to my House, (the Queen's-Head Tavern on Tower-Hill) He called for Wine, and ordered a Chicken to be broil'd for Supper. When he had done eating, he asked me if I could change him a Bank Bill, for he said he was obliged to go out of Town next Morning before the Bank would be open, and he should have Occasion for a little ready Money. The Bill was Numb. 10. dated the 23d of Jan 1724. for 70 l. payable to Sam. Brooks, or Bearer. Not having so much Cash by me at that time, I sent my Drawer with the Bill to Mr. Green, a Goldsmith in the Minories, who returned Word, that he believed that the Bill was very good, and he would have changed it with all his Heart; but it happened that he had just before paid away a large Sum, and was unprovided. I shew'd it to a Club of Gentlemen that were then in my House; none of them could give me Money for it; but they all agreed that it was good. I carried the Bill again to the Prisoner, and told him I could not get it chang'd. He told me I need not be afraid, for the Bill was good; it was taken out in his own Name, which was Sam. Brooks; that he had three new Houses in Chiswel-street, and he lived in one of them, which was opposite the Tobacco-Roll: And then he asked me what Money I had in the House. I told him I could give him a 50 l. Bank Bill, 10 l. in Cash, and a Note on Demand for the other 10 l. He told me that would do very well. I called my Drawer to be a Witness, and gave the Prisoner the 50 l. Bill, and 10 l. in Money. But he told me, that since what they did was before Witness, he would not give me the Trouble of writing a Note for the Remaining 10 l. but he would take my Word, and call for it in two or three Days. He called for a Coach, (No 370) and ordered the Coachman to drive him to Chiswell-street, and I saw him no more till the 7th of Feb. when hearing that he was in the new Jail in Southwark, I went thither to pay him a Visit. On Wednesday, the Day after he was at my House, I sent my Servant to the Bank with the Prisoner's Bill, to receive 50 l. of the 70 l. which was readily paid him. And the next day, I sent him again for the remaining 20 l. which he also received. Most of this Evidence was confirm'd by

             delivered to the Prisoner, was paid at the Bank to a Woman, on the 27th of Jan. (which was the Day after the Prisoner took it of Woodburn). This was mentioned as a Circumstance of the Prisoner's knowing the 70 l. Bill to be alter'd; for else he might have sent that as well as the other; and if he had gone a Journey that Morning, he would have been as much hindred in waiting to receive the 50 l. as in waiting to receive 70 l. It appear'd that that Bill was so nicely alter'd, that it was not mistrusted even at the Bank, till they came to examine their Books, and then they found that there was no Bill payable to

               <p>It appeared that the Prisoner went afterwards to the Fountain Tavern in the Borough. Drawer, says he, I have been a Gaming, and have lost 100l. and have wm 70 l. for which I have taken a Bank Note; and if you'll get it off for one presently, I'll make you a handsome Amends, for I want a little Ready Money just now. The Drawer carry'd it to several Gentlemen in the House, but none of them could change it. The Chester Man being robb'd but a little before, and the Oddness of the Prisoner's offering a Gratuity to the Drawer, began at last to raise a suspicion in some or them, that this Bill was taken from thence. Away the Drawer was sent to the Bank, but he came too late to receive the Money for it: However, they told him it was good, and if he came the next day, they'd pay him. From thence he went to the Post Office, but could make no Discovery. In the mean while, the Prisoner appeared very uneasy, and ask'd Mr. Parks(the Master of the Tavern) if his Drawer was honest; and told him, that if a Drawer proves a Rogue in such a Case the Money will be expected from his Master. The Prisoner still being suspected, he was taken into Custody till farther Enquiry could be made. <rs id="t17250224-51-verdict278" type="verdictDescription">

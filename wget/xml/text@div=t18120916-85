               <p>SECOND COUNT, for selling a piece of plate with a like stamp upon it, with the same intention.</p>
               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>HENRY DORSON. I am a silversmith, not a working silversmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you reside in the City-road - A. About a twelvemonth ago I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do. He is a <rs id="t18120916-85-deflabel486" type="occupation">polisher</rs>

About a twelvemonth ago, he came to my house, and asked me if I wanted any milk ewers; he took them out of a parcel and shewed them me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did he produce - A. I think three; but two I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Cream jugs - A. Yes; I purchased two. I paid him for silver, fashion; and duty; the two came to 2 l. 6 s. I marked them, and put them in my window. I afterwards sold one to Mr. Davis, Crown-street. Finsbury-square, about eleven or twelve months ago; the other one is in my window. I purchased the lease of No. 30,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160049"></xptr> and in consequence of the removal, I sent most of my plate to be coloured up at Mr. Field's, of Hoxton Mr. Field found out the fraud; and in consequence of his information, I got the cream jug I sold to Davis. This was the cream jug I sent to Mr. Field to be coloured up; and on my breathing on it, I discovered the stamp let in. I believe it is one genuine stamp of a smaller piece. When the prisoner sold it me, I believe he said it was of his own manufactory. I have no doubt about it.</p>

            . Q. Did you at any time purchase a cream jug of Mr. Dobson - A. I did, in November 1811. I wrote upon it 1811. I kept it in my custody until I gave it up. It has not undergone any alteration while in my custody whatever.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER FIELD. I am a working-silversmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometime ago did you receive a cream jug of Mr. Dobson for the purpose of polishing - A. Yes, I did. I saw that the mark was let in Mr. Dobson came to my house; I told him of it. I gave that jug up to the gentleman who carries on the prosecution for the Stamp-office. This is the one I received of Mr. Dobson, there is the appearance of a stamp being let in.</p>

            . Q. Do you hold any situation in Goldsmith's-hall - A. Yes. I am the person appointed to mark and draw plates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner or his son bring plate to your office to be essayed - A. The prisoner's son; he lives in North-street, City-road.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner frequently come to the hall - A. He has been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at that cream jug sold to Davis, has that been essayed and marked at the hall - A. It never has.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stamps do you observe upon that cream jug - A. Three; the king's head, the lion, and the letter of the year, four years ago being the letter P, for 1810; that is a genuine stamp of a bottle label. If it had been stamped at Goldsmith's hall in the shape of a cream jug, the stamp on it would have been the lion, the leopard's head, the variable letter, and the king's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is not only one more in number, but the order of the line is varied; does it appear to you that the stamp has been transposed from another plate to that - A. It does. I am confident of it, and from a bottle ticket. The duty of a bottle ticket would be two or three pence, subject to the weight; and the duty upon a cream jug, would be somewhere about five or six shillings. I have seen this essayed; it is not standard fineness: it is about two penny-weights worse in the pound. There is a stamp W H, corresponding to the mark I have here.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have a plate before you, how do you get that mark - A. At the time that a workman comes to enter his mark at Goldsmith's-hall, he shews his punch to denote his work. We take an impression of it. He writes his name and place of residence; and we have a copy of the punch.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, Sir, you have told me that this was transposed; could any person conversant with the making or polishing of this see this on examination - A. Upon examination I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Field You have told me that you are a working-silversmith - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live from North-street - A About an hundred yards I live at Haberdasher's Alm houses. The prisoner worked for me; I employed him as a polisher.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say, you understand the working part of the business - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person perform the act of polishing without seeing this was let in - A. The prisoner might, for this reason, he is a hard working man; he will do as much work as two men; he hardly gives himself time to look; he drives away. I know that he is the most bustling man in London. I have heard that character from every body where he worked.</p>

            . Q. Did you at any time execute a search warrant against the prisoner - A. I did, at No. 14, North-street, City-road. The prisoner was just out of bed when I went into the house, there I found him. I have always understood it to be his house; I searched his house. Perks and Taunton were with me. This is the punch I found at his house. I marked it before I gave it the solicitor. I think the son was not out of bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Q. Do you know that he, the father and the son, lived there - A. So I understood, that the son lived with him. He told me that his son was the maker, and he was the polisher. I have always understood, that he could not make a milk-pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of selling goods in the silversmith line for many silversmiths. It is so long ago, I cannot call to mind any thing of the transaction; and if I had known there was any thing wrong in it, I should not have taken it to Mr. Dobson. He knew my residence; and when Mr. Dobson informed me, I told him, I knew nothing of it. It was a month before I was taken up, that he informed me of the danger. I did not go away; I staid with my family.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

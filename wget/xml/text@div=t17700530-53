On the 28th of April a woman brought the prisoner to me, and desired me to give her a little water for tea; that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300036"></xptr> the first time of my seeing her. She came again the next morning, and fell asleep till half an hour after three; then I went down for a pail of water, and she was gone when I came up again. I had left her about a quarter of an hour; and I was informed she had been gone ten minutes, or better. I thought I had left her asleep. I missed my purse directly; there was only a five-and-three-pence in it, and that was gone: it was in a box that was unlocked. My child told me she had been at my box. She left her dog in the room, by the means of which I found where she lived. When I charged her with stealing my money, she gave me back two shillings of it: she said she was in liquor, and had she been sober she would not have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your purse again?</p>
               <p>S. Curtis. She left that in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never took her five-and-three pence; but I gave her two shillings out of charity, fearing she should be turned out into the street. She came and took me up out of my warm bed. I had but one shilling and two sixpences. I said, In the name of God, take them along with you, I know no body in the world but God Almighty and myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the West London Union Workhouse, West Street, Smithfield. I have known the prisoner for the last three years; he was an inmate there on 12th Oct.—on that morning, about 20 minutes past 8 o'clock, I went towards the men's hall, and met William Brendall, an inmate, with his hand over his eyes; I removed his hand, and saw that the eye was crushed, and blood was running down his cheek—I sent him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital immediately, in charge of one of the men—I then went into the men's hall, and said, "Who has committed this assault?" there was a pause—I said, "Who has done this?"—the prisoner said, "He struck me, and I struck him again"—I took him into custody—he is rather fond of drink when out, but is generally peaceable.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of 12th Oct. I was at work in the work room; the prisoner came in, sat himself down at the same work table, and commenced taking my work from me, which was oakum—I told him that he should not take it from me, I had got it to do myself—he said, "I will let you know I will take your work from you when I think proper"—I said, "You shall do no such thing, I will do my own work;" and began to take it away from him again; he jumped up in a dreadful passion, I tried to get out of his way, and my hat came off; he seized me by the front hair, and commenced punching me with all his power; I kept calling out for assistance, but nobody came—he struck me several times on the head, and one blow in particular went right into my eye; I reckon that it must have been his knuckles—I made the best of my way into the passage, met Mr. Phillips, and was sent to the hospital—I had not struck him; I tried to get out of his way.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an inmate of the West London Workhouse. I did not see the first part of it, but saw the prisoner strike Brendall a violent blow on the left eye, while he was leaning on the table with his head down—I did not see Brendall strike him.</p>

                  </hi>. 12th Oct. I was house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I was there when Brendall was brought in—I found a wound on his eye, at the lower edge, through the inverting mem<lb></lb>brane, showing a wound through the cornea into the interior chamber of the eye, which was filled with blood—the lens is injured, and he has lost the eye; it will not recover—it must have been a very violent blow with the knuckles, a chance blow; a man might try to do it a great many times before he could do it, as the eye is so beautifully protected.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I sat down to take some stuff, and he said that it belonged to him; I said, "That little bit shall belong to you," and handed it over to him; he took a stick down from the wall, and struck me with it; I took it away, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it to the other end of the room; they have not brought the stick; I never said a word to him.</p>

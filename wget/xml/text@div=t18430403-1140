                  </hi>. I am now a stamper in the Stamp Office, Somerset-house. In 1834 I was a constable in the police—I know the prisoner—while I was a constable I apprehended him in Finsbury-square for highway robbery—I took him to the station in Bunhill-row—he was committed on a charge then made—I am sure he is the person.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see him again, after, as you suppose, he was transported? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till I saw him at Bow-street last Tuesday week, to the best of my recollection. I was sent for by Inspector Pearce, of the A division—I should think the prisoner is about forty years of age now—he has not the same outward appearance—he has a greater pro<lb></lb>fusion of hair and beard than when I apprehended him—with that exception I should say he is the same, when I make allowance for the difference that nine years would make in the appearance of his face—I do not know who described him as being thirty—I see no alteration in him except his hair and the work of age—he is altered in that way—there was a peculiarity which I observed then, and which I observe now, he stammered very much—there is nothing peculiar about him except the stammering—I was in the police up to two years and a half back, and was about all parts of the town—if he had been about his business in London for six or seven years last past I might possibly have seen him, and not have known him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CURWOOD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With the alteration that nine years would make, can you undertake to say he is the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can positively; I am certain of it. I was a young officer at that time, and this was the first case of the sort that I had; the prisoner struggled very violently, and gave me a violent fall at the time, and I was more likely to recollect his features after that circum<lb></lb>stance—I was anxious to be as zealous as possible in my humble sphere in the service.</p>

               <p>so, I did not positively assert it—I said, "I believe"—I think that was the word I made use of—I will swear that was the word, to the best of my belief—I remember Peek bringing me forward, and asking me if I knew that woman (<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Cartwright</hi>)—I swear that I did not say I did—I was brought into the presence of the female, and I put several questions to her—Peek asked me, "Do you know this woman?"—I said I thought I did—I saw two females—I do not recollect saying, "But there is two of them"—Mrs. Cartwright did not come up to me at all—I do not remember her saying in my presence, "What, me?"—I do not think she did—I will not swear she did not—I did not in answer to that, say, "Yes, I will swear it"—Mrs. Cartwright's friends interfered by saying I had sworn she was the person—I asked Mrs. Cart<lb></lb>wright if she lived in St. Martin's-lane, and I think she said, "No"—she asked me if I had ever had her in custody—I said, "My impression is that I have"—that is all that occurred, as far as I recollect—I have seen persons similar to each other, not exactly alike—I consider that person now standing below the prisoner, like him in some respects, not exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

About nine years ago, one winter's evening, I heard a cry of "Stop thief" in Windmill-street, Finsbury-square—I came up on that cry, and followed a man from Windmill-street to Chiswell-street—he was running—the police-officers took him into custody—he fell down at Lazarus's, the linen-draper's shop—I came in contact with him, and fell also—the fall was the cause of his being taken—two policemen, Seal and Collins, closed on the prisoner as well as myself, and took him—I afterwards attended at the Police-court—I made sufficient observation of the person to think I should know him again—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a clerk in the General Post-office—I have been married between four and five years—I went with my sister to Bow-street Police-court, and saw the prisoner there—I had seen him before that in Jermyn-street, at my brother's house, between one and two years ago, but I cannot well say—I do not remember ever having seen the prisoner be<lb></lb>fore that in my life, if I did it was a very very great many years ago, as much as twenty years ago—I believe I did see him twenty years ago—I was with my brother then—he was never acquainted with my family, only with my brother—I was not living with the prisoner in 1834, or in any other year during the whole of my life—I never did—I never lived in St. Martin's-lane—I was never charged with committing any felony with him, or being an accomplice—I was never in custody, or charged with an offence of any kind—I saw Peek and Seal at Bow-street—Peek came forward, and pointed to me as I was in the room, and said, "That person was taken into custody at the same time"—I said, "Me?"—Peek said he would fetch another man to prove what he said—he went out, and fetched that man (Seal)—Peek asked him if he knew either of those ladies, pointing to my sister and me—Seal said yes, he did not know my sister, but he knew me—I asked him where he knew me—he said in St. Martin's-lane—I asked him what number—he said No. 53.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman and lodging-house-keeper, and am the brother of the last witness. I live in Jermyn-street—I knew the prisoner about twenty-three years ago in the first instance. I have known him within the last five or six years—he came from America about five years ago—I know he has been trading from London to America during those five or six years—I have been on board the packets he has come from—I have seen his luggage—there were intervals of a year and a half, or two years between each time of my seeing him, as near as I can remember—he has been in the habit of remaining about three months at a time—I have been into the docks with him several times, on board the ship he came from—the last lodg<lb></lb>ing he had was at my sister's, in Maddox-street, Hanover-square—her name is Phillips—that is the same lady that was at the Police-court—he never lodged with her when in London on former occasions—I do not know where he lodged before—I think he lodged there two months before Christmas—I did not go with him to Boulogne—he said he went, and he was away a time—I think he returned from Boulogne a month or six weeks ago, and has been in London since—he has gone about the streets as usual, with other people—I cannot say as to his going to places of amusement—I have not been with him.</p>

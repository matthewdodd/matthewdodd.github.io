            . I live at the corner of Church-Street in the Strand. On the king's coronation day I was from home, and as I was returning by St. Martin's Round-house I saw a mob of people. A gentleman there told me there were two women carried in there, for robbing my shop of ribbons. I went into the Round-house to them. There Evans, upon knowing I was master of the shop, fell on her knees, and beg'd for mercy, and said, she had four children, and had lately buried one. The other prisoner cried, and said but little.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice with them?</p>
               <p>Lawder. I was, before justice Cox. The ribbons were there produced. The justice asked me if they were my property, and I said they were. They are here now sealed up.

               <p>Q. Who was in the shop then?</p>
               <p>A. Piggot. Mrs. Lawder was. Upon seeing this, when Smith turned to go out of the shop, I took hold of her, and said, Child, I believe you have got something, which you have not paid for. She said, indeed I have not. I turned her apron aside, and saw the ribbon in a pocket apron. I made her put her hand in, and take it out, and lay it on the counter. There were two pieces. I gave her a shake, and down fell a third. She beg'd to go, and Evans desired I'd beat her, and let her go about her business. The shop soon fill'd. There came a beadle, and took them both away to the Roundhouse. Evans had bargained for a piece of ribbon, but after Smith had taken the ribbon she pretended to be off her bargain. (The ribbon produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Q. Now where was that watch - A. In the dressing case draw in my bed-room, I had not seen it ten days prior to that, I saw it there ten days before I missed it, prior to that I lost a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of breeches, and many other things I always suspected her. I got a warrant, I went with the officer to search her apartment, I went up stairs with the officer, she was not at home the first time the officer came; the officer came the second time on the 23d of February, she was then at home; he searched her apartment and her person, he pulled out of her pocket a pocketbook, full of duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any articles belonging to you. - A. Yes, I went with the constable to the pawnbrokers, and identified all the property I could find.</p>

            . In consequence of a search warrant, I went on Sunday the 23d of February to the prosecutor's house, he said the prisoner was at home; he went up stairs first and I followed him. I searched the prisoner, in her pocket I found a quantity of duplicates, she said they belonged to herself, and the property that was pledged belonged to herself. I took her to Worship-street, there she was examined by the magistrate, I went round with the prosecutor to the pawnbrokers there he saw the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the pawnbroker with the duplicate of the watch - A. I did, at Mr. Crouch's, in Paul-street. We had no duplicate of the coat and waistcoat, they were at Mr. Crouch's. We found at Mr. Nicolas's a spoon, two pellisse coats at Mr. Sadler's, Aldersgate street, and a pair of breeches at Fothergill's.</p>

               <p>What were they? - A sort of a brown.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come out of Mrs. Johnson's? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>What did you know it by? - Because he had a black apron on; I saw the apron when he was putting the things in it; he had the apron by the corners.</p>

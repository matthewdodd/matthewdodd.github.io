             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. You were captain of the revenue cutter the Hind? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell my Lord and the Jury, what was your situation at sea on the 15th or 14th of May. when you had a view of the Lottery cutter? - A. I will; the wind was westerly; I was cruizing on the 13th of last May, between Dartmouth and the Start Point, for the purpose of intercepting smuggling vessels; when I was informed, by the man at the mast-head, that a sail was seen.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it? - A. About three in the afternoon; we could not then perceive exactly what she was; about half past three we made her to be a cutter; at four she came in so fast that we discovered her to be the Lottery; she came in directly for the shore; the wind then veering to the northward of west, I stood in under the land, the smuggler still continuing to steer in north, till at six he was within about two leagues and a half of the land called the Bolt, when finding the wind come to the northward, he tacked; the Hind immediately tacked after him, made fail, and chased him all the night, without ever losing fight of him; on the 14th, at five in the morning, we were becalmed, at about the distance of five miles from the smuggling cutter; when I ordered both the Hind's boats to be manned and armed, with an officer in each, to proceed towards that cutter, and take possession of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as inform my Lord and the Jury your relative situation with the Lottery, at five in the morning? - A. I, at the same time, fired a gun, and hoisted an ensign at the mast-head, in the most conspicuous place; the smuggling cutter then lying becalmed about two leagues and a half south south-east from the Lizard, making use of his sweeps or oars; the boats proceeded according to my order, and I continued rowing in the cutter to give them assistance; when they had proceeded about two-thirds of the five mile, I saw a gun fired from the stern of the smuggling cutter, and with my spying-glass I observed my two boats shew the revenue colours.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that before or after the gun was fired? - A. Just after the gun was fired; still continuing to row towards the smuggling cutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you observe the shot fall in the water? - A. No. They then came very close to the smuggling cutter, and laid upon their oars, where they remained some little time; a breeze of with springing up, the smuggler made more fail; the boxes returned and I hoisted them in, and made fail, pursued the cutter, and gained on him; on which he threw overboard a quantity of spirts in ankers, which enabled him to fail faster, still the find gained on him, and in the afternoon, about two, as well as I remember, just a mile and a half off the Longships.</p>
               <p>Q. Where about is the point of the Longships? - A. Near the Land's-end; I brought my chose-guess to carry over him, on which he lowered the part of the crew took to their boat, which boat ordered to be chased by my own two boat, end she was taken and brought alongside the Hind; we then took possession of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300080"></xptr>the Lottery smuggling cutter; we found her laden with spirits, in small casks, for the purpose of smuggling.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell me whether either of the prisoners were in the boat that was brought alongside you, or on board the vessel? - A. Barrett was on board the vessel, and Marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recognise the persons of any other person who came alongside in the boat? - A. Yes; the shortest of those at the bar, Searle.</p>
               <p>Q. This vessel has since been condemned? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Marryatt. I shall certainly object to the question; that is not the way of proving a condemnation.(Mr. Fielding was about to reply.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Never mind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Marryatt. Q. What course did the cutter steer during the night, while you were chasing her? - A. Sometimes to the southward of west, and sometimes to the northward, the wind veering occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might she run in the course of that time? - A. She ran from the Bolt-tail nearly to the Lizard.</p>

               <p>Q. What distance was she from the Lizard at the time that your boats first went in chase of her? - A. About two leagues and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak with accuracy to that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the distance of the one cutter from the other? - A. When becalmed, at five in the morning, the cutters were about five miles distant from each other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after five in the morning before your boats got nearly up to the cutter, how many hours? - A. I suppose it could not be more than an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Lottery been pulling away with their sweeps all that time? - A. I did not perceive her with her sweeps for some time; I was busy; I saw her with her sweeps while the boats were chasing her.</p>
               <p>Q. When the swivel was fired, did you hear the report, or only see the smoke? - A. I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance were the boats from the cutter at that time? - A. About one-third of the way from the cutter to us; nearly two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. The object of that question is, what I dare say you will answer me fairly; whether, if there had been any shot in that gun, it could have reached the boat? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any shot strike the water? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you overtook the Lottery cutter, and the boar had put off, what means did you use besides chasing, to bring back the Lottery's boat; did you fire at the boat? - A. I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your boats fire? - A. I believe they might, I cannot be positive; they were armed, and might fire; I was too busy in shifting sails and other things, to observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mate's name was Pearce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person of that name on board the Lottery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a seaman? - A. No, only a passenger; he was allowed by all on board to be only a passenger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he any relation to

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I believe you were the mate of the Hind revenue cutter? - A. I was acting mate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a custom-house officer? - A. I am</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it that you got sight of the Lottery smuggling cutter? - A. On Monday, May the 13th, about a quarter, or half past five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you one of the persons ordered into the boat of the revenue cutter? - A. Yes, I was; that was on Tuesday morning, the 14th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Lottery cutter before? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you came near her? - A. I suppose about an hour and a quarter after I left the cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came near her, what distance was this smuggling cutter from the shore? - A. About three leagues.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do when you came near to her? - A. The first thing that we did, in the boat, was to hoist-the revenue colours; but previous to that a gun was fired from the Lottery, and hoisted English colours to the beam-end.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after you had hoisted your colours? - A. I was hailed from the Lottery by a speaking-trumper.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your colours hoisted in such a manner that the people on board the Lottery could perceive them? - A. Quite so.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that they must have seen your colours hoisted? - A. It is impossible they should not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said to you by the man with the speaking-trumper? - A. To keep off them boats immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to perceive who that man was, and whether he is any of the persons now at the bar? - A. I believe neither of them is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man with the speaking-trumpet say to you? - A. I thought myself that I was not so near the cutter that I could make myself heard, because I had no speaking-trumpet in the boat with me. I then pulled much nexter to the cutter, within less than a cable's length of her; I was again hailed by the same man on board, and told, that if I did not immediately keep off them boats, they would immediately fire at us, and sink us.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Inform us, perhaps the gentlemen of the Jury may not know, any more than myself, what a cable's length is? - A. A hundred and twenty fathoms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That is two hundred and forty yards, is it not? - A. Yes. I then stood up in the boat which I was in, told them that it was the Hind revenue cutter's boats, that my name was Pearce, and that I had orders from Captain Bray to go on board of their vessel, and such orders I must obey; at the same time I told them that I knew the cutter, that her name was the Lottery, and told them that I knew them, meaning the people on board of her; the answer was, that they did not care a d-n who the boats belonged to, or who we were, or what I was; and that I was very much mistaken, it was not the Lottery; and if in case I did not immediately retire, they would fire on us, and kill us all: the vessel had a piece of canvas over the stern, which piece of canvas covered the name, in order to hide it. I lastly asked them positively; whether they would permit me to come along-side, or not; if they would, I would use them well; the answer was, that if in case I attempted to come along side, not one single man of us should live to return again.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300081"></xptr>Q. At the time they made this threat to you, how was the cutter and the crew disposed? - A. I saw one gun run out at the larboard-quarter port.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the side you were on? - A. Yes; there were two swivel-guns mounted on the mizen-beam; and one man I perceived distinctly, standing on the mizenbeam, with a musket; the people, who had been rowing the vessel before we got near her, had laid on their oars apparently to me on the quarter where these guns were, and the guns appeared to me to be pointed immediately towards the boat I was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have persevered to board her, without the hazard of being destroyed? - A. No; nothing but that could have induced me to return to the Hind cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, did you give up your attempt to board her? - A. I did, in consequence of seeing them so determined, and my people alarmed. I then returned to my own cutter to endeavour to row our own cutter alongside of the smuggler, there being little or no wind.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Lottery, at last; did she escape? - A. No, we took her off the Longships.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she turn out to be the Lottery, or not? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the crew of the Lottery? - A. They hoisted out their boat, and twelve of the crew pushed off; that was about half past one on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you had taken possession of the Lottery was that? - A. About half an hour before we had possession of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue the Lottery's boat with your boat? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her before she could get to shore? - A. I did, about the half distance between the Lottery cutter and the shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the men that are now here, in her? - A. Yes;

               <p>Q. Did you yourself see what the smuggling cutter was loaded with? - A. I did, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. Brandy, gin, tea, and tobacco; I do not know that there was any rum.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of casks were they? - A. Ankers, and what we call six-gallon casks; they hold about five gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there, as near as you can guess? - A. Seven hundred and sixteen; chiefly ankers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Best. Q. Your name is Pearce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a person on board the Lottery of that name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that persons any relation of your's? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person on board the Hind cutter of that name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he any relation of his? - A. He was his son.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation on board the Hind does young Pearce hold? - A. Only mariner.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us there were twelve persons in the boat, how many were there on board the cutter? - A. Five.</p>
               <p>Q. There were fifteen indicted? - A. There were sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were all but Pearce indicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it, when you went from the Hind in the boat? - A. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning was it? - A. A very clear morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What course was the Lottery steering? - A. West north west, by the compass.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, you hoisted your colours? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was, perhaps, calm at that time? - A. Nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course the colours could not spread, so as to be seen, but would hang down in folds? - A. In order to prevent that, our colours were fastened to a flag-staff, in the first place, and that staff lashed to a boat-hook staff, about fourteen feet in length, and lashed in this direction athwart (describing it); so that the marks should be clearly distinguished in the boats bows.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You displayed your flag so as to be distinctly seen? - A. Yes, as much as if it had blown a gale of wind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Best. Q. Do you know what was the situation of Ventin on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he was cook? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you the least doubt in the world, that the persons on board the smuggling cutter must have seen the colours? - A. It is impossible that they should not, unless they had shut their eyes to avoid seeing them, or knowing me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an officer of the Customs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any appointment from the Customs? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. Q. You were a mariner on board the Hind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an officer of the Customs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A deputed officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the chase given, on the 13th of May, to the Lottery cutter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the morning of the 14th, go out in one of the Hind's boats? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went in the other boat? - A. Mr. Pearce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you row on towards the cutter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you approached nearest the cutter, your boat, or Pearce's boat? - A. Pearce's boat.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were nearest the smuggler, about what distance was she from the shore? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. About what distance were you from the shore? - A. I cannot say; I did not see the compass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Was she within one hundred leagues of shore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. Can you tell within a mile? - A. I suppose, in my own opinion, she might be within three or four leagues of the Lizard; the easternmost part of the Lizard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Lizard the nearest land to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come near enough to the Lottery to hear what was said from the Lottery? - A. Yes; I heard some of the dispute.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear? - A. I heard the people on board the Lottery desire us to keep the boats off.</p>


               <p>Q. Did they say they would do any thing in case you should not keep off? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they at any time say they would do, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300082"></xptr>you did not keep off? - A. They told us if we did come along-side, we should not go back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the expression used? - A. That is as high the expression as I can recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you hoisted any colours in the boat you were in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What colours did you hoist? - A. Custom-house colours.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you hoist them; in such a way as they could distinguish it on board the Lottery? - A. Yes; I stood up, and held it athwart the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they see what the flag was? - A. If I had been there I could have seen what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You know that at sea, in order to ascertain the distance accurately, two points of land must be taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no land then but the Lizard? - A. Yes; I could see land, I could see Falmouth land.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not take the bearings of Falmouth land and the Lizard? - A. No; I did not take the bearings at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot speak by any means, with the accuracy that you could speak, if you had taken the bearings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear, upon your oath, that when a vessel is about four leagues from the shore, you can tell to half a league without taking the bearings? - A. Oh, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean by the first part of your evidence, that she might be within three or four leagues? - A. Between three and four leagues.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your opinion without taking the bearings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Lottery was taken you went on board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any guns on board her? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a single gun? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not any shot? - A. Yes; there were a few shot, and there were wooden guns.</p>
               <p>Q. Would those shot be of any use with wooden guns? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Was it a wooden gun that was fired at you, when you were chasing? - A. I did not hear the report of any gun; I saw the smoke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. After you had returned to the Hind, and the Hind was in pursuit of the Lottery, did you see any thing thrown overboard? - A. I did not see any thing thrown overboard, but I saw the kegs upon the water floating.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you saw the explosion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any shot fall in the water? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you not have seen it if any shot had struck the water? - A. I do not know that; it could not have reached us.</p>
               <p>Q. You were looking towards the cutter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see any shot strike the water? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Mr. Bray). Q. Are you able to say, upon your oath, while you were in chase of the Lottery, that a gun, of some description, was fired from the Lottery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positively sure of that? - A. Yes; there was a gun fired from the stern.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to state to the Corrt and Jury, whether that gun was fired from small arms, or any thing of the size of a swivel? - A. It was not a musket or a blunderbuss.</p>
               <p>Q. And of this you are positively certain? - A. I am positively certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Pearce) Q. Are you certain, that while you were in chase of the Lottery, some gun of some description, was fired from the Lottery? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to distinguish whether it was of the description of small arms, or of a larger size? - A. My opinion, upon my oath, is, that it was a swivel gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Not any thing smaller than of that denomination? - A. Not any thing smaller than a swivel could have made that report.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw a man with a musket pointed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marryatt. Q. Can you at all identify who that man was? - A. No.</p>

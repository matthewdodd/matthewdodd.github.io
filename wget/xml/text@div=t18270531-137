On the 25th of May, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was in the back parlour, and saw the corner of a shawl come off a line; I ran to the door, and saw a man in a white coat walk off the pavement - I ran to the corner, and desired a man to pursue him; we ran to the corner of Air-street; I said, "That is the thief, pursue him;" he did so, and took him.</p>

I close the shops in the Quadrant; I was at the corner of Air-street; this lady came, and told me to follow that thief; I saw a man running with a speckled black fustian coat on; it was rather black; it was all colours; he seemed to have something under his left arm; I did not see him drop any thing, but I picked up the goods in the street; I saw him taken, and one of the handkerchiefs was then round his left leg; I took it off; I lost sight of him as he turned the corners, but not for a minute.</p>

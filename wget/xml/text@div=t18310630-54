            . On the Thursday before the 23rd of May Batchelor offered this seal in pledge at my master's shop, in Tottenham-court-road; I did not lend any thing on it - he came with the prisoner on the following day, to demand the seal; I refused to deliver it till I had been to a Magistrate - the Magistrate advised me to come again the next day; the prisoner said he had bought the seal of a young man for 10s., but knowing the value of it I had suspicion of him; he said he sent Batchelor with it.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about a month - he lodged where I had lived, at the Boar and castle; he asked me whether I wanted to buy a seal; I said I had no money - he said he gave a gentleman at Brighton half a guinea for it, and I should have it for 8s.; he then said I should have it for 6s. - I said, "I dare say I know a young man who will buy it;" I took it to him, and he said he was not certain it was gold; I took it to Mr. Tims, who detained it - I was to meet the prisoner the same night, and the pawnbroker told me to look in the next day; they then said they had not heard any thing, and I was to go again - they then told me to bring the man I got it of.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner; I told him Batchelor was in custody for offering a seal to pawn - he admitted that he had sent Batchelor; I asked him if he had taken any thing else - he said he had taken another: I had not made him any promise or threat; he said the other was at a cousin's of his, and I went and got it - he said they belonged to Mr. Granville, and he took them out of his room, either off the sideboard or the table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not state that they belonged to Mr. Granville, nor that I took them out of his room - about three months ago I was employed at the hotel for three weeks; I then left, and lodged with Batchelor's mother, in Praed-street - about four nights afterwards I was coming across the fields, and was stopped by Avis; he said, "You are my prisoner" - I was thunder-struck; he said would I tell him the truth, it would be all the better for me, as I should be taken before a Magistrate, and by telling him the truth I should, no doubt, be acquitted; I was frightened, and said, "What am I to tell you the truth about?" he said, "You have been accused of stealing two seals from the hotel;" I said I had not - he said, "You gave them to a young man to pawn;" I said, "I gave him one seal, which I bought of a young person at Brighton, and gave him half a guinea for it;" he said no more to me, but took me before the Magistrate, and stated nearly the same as he has to-day.</p>

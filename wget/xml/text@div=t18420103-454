                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer's labourer. Last Monday week I went to the Gun public-house, Shoreditch, a little before five o'clock—a man named Kelly and his wife were with me—I sat down in the taproom—the room was full of people—there was a disturbance—Kelly and the prisoner's mother had some words—I do not know whether it was the prisoner's mother or Kelly that began it, but there was a disturbance shortly after I got there—when the disturbance happened I got up, and was going out—I said, "What is this between you, it is a shame for you?"—I did not see the prisoner at that time—a friend of the prisoner's asked me to go home, and take Kelly with me—I said I was doing nothing out of the way—I was going out at the door, and met the prisoner just between the tap-room and the bar, he caught hold of both my ears, pulled my head to him, and caught hold of my nose with his teeth, and while he was holding my nose by his teeth, his brother hit me—the prisoner bit part of my nose off, and then I was <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> out of doors—I fell down as if dead—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030047"></xptr>
               <p>I lost a great deal of blood, and suffered great pain—I was sober at the time, and had my senses very well—I had not had any quarrel with him, nor with any body belonging to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the prosecutor shortly after this happened—before seven o'clock—he was perfectly sober—I found his face smothered with Wood and dirt—I washed it off—blood was still issuing from the wound, which I stopped—I found a portion of the left side of his nose completely gone, and a larger portion of the middle cartilage of the nose—it was evidently bitten off—there Were Marks of teeth—part of the wound is now healing, but the centre does not heal well, it is ulcerated, and will be a very long while before it heals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday morning—I told him he was charged with biting off a man's nose—he said he did not do it, that he was bitten himself, and showed me two marks on the side of his neck—it appeared to hare been scratched, not bitten—he afterwards said they bad been all fighting together.</p>

I Opened the door, and saw the parties fighting together, I had no sooner entered the tap-room door than I was knocked down by Kelly, and received a severe kick in my eye from the prosecutor; I was senseless—my brother and the two females picked me up; the landlord told them to take me out at the back-door; I was taken to a friend's house, washed, and my wound dressed; I came home about eight in the morning, and heard there was a warrant against me; I did not stop at home, but stopped at a friend's house; my brother told me there was a warrant against me at M'Carthy's complaint; I put on my coat and hat, went to the Office, and stopped there till my case was brought on.</p>

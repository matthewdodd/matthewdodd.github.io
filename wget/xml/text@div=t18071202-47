When I went in, to my great surprize we found three young men in the room, and O'Conner and his wife; I did not know of the young men being in the room; we said that the servants had been robbed, and we suspected them; myself and the watchman looked round the room and found some towels that we had been robbed of; by that time the watchman brought up the gown that had been hung up at the window. I charged them all with the watchman, and they were all taken to the watchhouse.

            . I am a watchman. On Thursday the 5th of November I was called in by the maid servant, about half past eleven at night, she told me she had been robbed, she shewed me the room where the robbery had been committed; it appeared to me the lock had been forced back by a knife; the bolt was about half undone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say whether it was locked or only half locked. - A. No. On the same floor there were two empty rooms, I looked them over, there was nothing to be seen there; I observed under the staircase of the two pair of stairs, a great vacancy under the stairs, the maid servant kicked her foot against the dirt that laid there, and the first thing that came to light was one stocking; I turned the dirt over, there were three more stockings there and a petticoat; I informed the landlord, he came up stairs, I shewed him where they were found. The prisoner, with four men, were in the room making a noise, Kensington desired them to go to bed. Mr. Kensington and me came down stairs together; the maid servant informed us there was a gown hanging out of the window, I went out in the street, there seemed apparently to be a gown hanging out of the window; I sprung the rattle and brought another watchman and a patrol. Mr. Kensington desired the watchman to stand under the window to see what fell from the window; the patrol and I went up stairs, I told them I insisted upon the door been opened; we forced the door open; when we went into the room there were four men and the prisoner; when I got into the middle of the room, I said, Peggy go to the window and take your gown in, and as the servant maid was going towards the window, the prisoner turned upon her heel, and throwed the window up herself, she told her to come and see if there was any gown there; the instant the window was thrown up, the gown went from the window into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see it go into the street. - A. I saw it go from the window; we took them all in custody to the watchhouse, then Mr. Kensington ordered them to be taken to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the room when you took them. - A. No, the room was not searched the first time at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that, you have been a watchman a good many years. - A. I cannot say, we took them upon the gown being found.</p>
               <p>Q. Then seeing the gown drop, your suspicions must be encreased. - A. We did not search the room till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Kensington told me you did. - A. There was nothing found in my sight not then.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner went to the window did you go to the window. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went to the window to prevent it from being opened. - A. I had not the thought.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these men. - A. The magistrate discharged three of them, and one was kept upon another indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all in the room, and all charged alike at the present time. - A.Yes, We searched the room after we came back; we found five stockings in a saucepan, upon a shelf over the prisoner's bed; the bed was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that tin saucepan was there when you were there before. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you look then. - A. I had not the presence of mind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barry. When the prisoners were taken to the watchhouse the door was left open. - A. No, Mr. Kensington fastened it with a string in a particular manner.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you take upon you to swear that this was a gown hanging out of the two pair window. - A. It was apparently.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be something else. - A. It might be something else.</p>
               <p>WINTER BURR. I am a watchman. I was placed below at the window, I saw a gown hanging out at the window; the prisoner I believe dropped the gown and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020038"></xptr>Q. I believe a great many things, and I shall tell the jury you believe there is a forty pound reward - why do you believe, upon your oath, that it was the prisoner, you cannot know, you was not at the window. - A. I do not pretend to say that I was at the window. I gave the gown to the officer Bayliss.</p>

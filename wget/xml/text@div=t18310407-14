On the 22nd of February, between ten and eleven o'clock, he came to my shop with another man, who, he said, was a carpenter and undertaker - they both came in together, and Davis said to me, "Have you got any good superfine black cloth?" I said I had - he said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070022"></xptr>want nine or ten yards of the best, and as much more of inferior;" I said I was very low of the very best superfine cloth, but what I had I would show him - I took out a piece of fine, which measured six yards, tight measure, and told him I had got another length of the same quality, about two yards and a half - I showed it to him, and told him the price was 22s.; he told me to measure it off - I put it all in at eight yards and a quarter, as it was tight measure, and I told him so - he said he was in a very great hurry, for the carpenter had got a job to finish at some coffins, and I was to make it up as quick as I could - he called the man a carpenter and undertaker; I put the cloth into a paper, and chalked out on the counter "9l. 1s. 6d." - I put my hand on the bundle, and said, "Now, which of you two is going to pay for this cloth?" Davis said, "I will, but I want to look at some single kerseymere; a low one," meaning a cheap one - I told him I had no low single kerseymere, but I had some low double-milled at 8s. a yard, and would cut it to him at 7s. 6d. - I brought three ends of kerseymere forward, one single and two double - I told him the price of all three; he approved of them, and told me to unroll and measure the whole - I did so, and rolled them up again; I made out my bill, and said, "Mr. Davis, if you will wait a moment I will send my girl out for a stamped receipt; the bill amounted to 26l. 8s. - he said,"Oh, you need not mind, you can draw upon me at a month for it."</p>
               <p>Q.What had become of the carpenter? A. When the prisoner said, "Oh, I will (meaning he would) pay for it," the carpenter went away with the first parcel of cloth, and the prisoner said to him, "All the small pieces you get out of the cloth bring them back to me;" he took it away at the time I asked who was to pay me for it; when I said I would send for a stamped receipt the prisoner said, "You may draw upon me at a month or two if you like;" I said"Draw a bill upon you you vagabond, scoundrel - draw a bill upon you, now you have got my property out of the place; I shall send for a Policeman directly for you;" I sent for one directly - he came, but did not think it a case he could interfere in; I told him the prisoner and another had robbed me of 9l. odd worth of cloth - he did not search him; I never intended to part with the goods without the money - I would not have suffered it to go out of my shop- I expected him to pay for it immediately; I never intended to trust him with it at all, nor give him credit for it any way whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. The prisoner has dealt with you for twenty years? A. I have known him twenty years - he may have dealt with me that time for trifling articles, till within these four years; I never gave him a year's credit, but he has taken it - he has not spent 50l. with me all his life; he used to be foreman to a man in Holles-street - he might buy 7l. or 8l. worth of goods of me in a year; I gave him about six months' credit - I never had but one bill of him, and that was the last transaction; I could get nothing but a bill from him - the upmost I gave him credit for was about 3l.</p>
               <p>Q.When the cloth was folded up. you, for the first time, talked about the payment? A.Of course; I had my elbow on it, and if they had mentioned bills then I should have turned it on one side, and told them to walk out - I let the man go out with it because he said Davis wanted to look at other goods; the carpenter took away the parcel with my consent, because the prisoner promised to pay me- he used not to bring a person with him when he dealt with me before; I had my hand on the cloth, and asked who would pay me for it - the prisoner said, "I will," and as he said the man was in a hurry, I let it go; if he had said, "I will give you a bill," I would have thrown it aside, and said, "Walk out of my place;" 13l. is the greatest amount he ever owed me, and I was a year and a half before I got that; it was not likely I would trust him after that - I have never said that he had dealt with me eighteen months ago; he got very bouncing when he found the Policeman would not interfere - he gave me a bill in 1827 for 20l., though he only owed me 13l.; he wanted the balance out of my pocket, but I would not give it him - I did not negotiate the bill; the 13l. was paid me - when I first knew him he was foreman to Mr. Tenpenny, which is a respectable firm; he was with them many years - I never knew him in business for himself; the Magistrate gave him an opportunity of bringing the cloth back, to me, but that was before I found it in pawn; he said he kept a shop in Well-street, and I see there is a shop there, but I was never in it - the Magistrate asked if I wished to prosecute; I said I had no ill will to him, all I wanted was my property.</p>

               <p>DANIEL DUTCH. I am a Police-constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 23rd of February; I have a duplicate in the name of Wilson, who is a carpenter, and lives in Homer-street I believe; it was given to me by Wilson's mother.</p>
               <p>HENRY GIBBS. I am shopman to Mr. Jenkins', of Crawford-street, Marylebone, about a mile from the prosecutor's. I produce two pieces of cloth, pawned on the 22nd of February, about one o'clock in the day, by a woman, in the name of Mary Wilson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How far is your shop from Wilson's? A. Not above three or four minutes' walk.</p>
               <p>JOHN LOYD. It was about half-past eleven o'clock when the Policeman was sent for - here are my initials on the paper the cloth is wrapped in; it is the paper I wrapped it in at the time - here is my name on it, and the cloth is mine; it does not appear to have been cut at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner made any endeavour to find Wilson? A. I cannot say - I have endeavoured to find him, but cannot - Dutch and I were looking after him, and find he lived where they gave the pawnbroker his address, but his absconded; I believe the prisoner was apprehended at his own house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have dealt with Mr. Loyd full twenty years, from the commencement of business - I was foreman to the late Mr. Tenpenny, and used to buy all the trimmings; indeed, I carried on the business - I set up in business, and paid him ready money, which I received from my master, for sixteen years, and at times, having a few jobs of my own, he gave me credit, and I paid him when I received my bill, till the last time, when Mr. Tenpenny failed, and owed me 222l.; I came in with the creditors, which made me poor - I was to have received 14s. in the pound, but had only 6s., which made me run rather longer credit with Loyd; he never intimated in the least manner whatever to deny me credit when I asked him - I left off dealing with him, because my son was in the habit of going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070023"></xptr>to Mr. Tenpenny's, who once sent him to Loyd's with half a crown too much - he gave me credit for it, and that was the reason I did not deal with him; this undertaker had been fitting up my place in Well-street for three months, till I was apprehended, since then I have not seen Wilson: Mrs. Wilson says I ordered her to pawn the cloth, but I never saw her in my life - as to Loyd, he will swear any thing; he has been in Clerkenwell three months for buying stolen goods, and would have been sent over the herring pond if he had not had Counsel to plead for him - he learnt so much at Clerkenwell that he said he should treble his way of laying out his money.</p>
               <p>JOHN LOYD. I bought some goods of a man, and got into a hobble with them: I am sorry to say I have had an accident of that kind - I have lived eighteen years where I now do; many traders have fallen into an errer, and I do not deny it, but I was never in Clerkenwell; I was confined twelve months - I never heard the least thing against the prisoner's character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. (Produces a release.) Q. You are an attorney? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Living where? - A. In Old Broad-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. He was with me two months previous to the 8th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. He was two months with you before he absconded? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of taking checks to your banker's? - A. Small ones of four or five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that four pound note - did you give him, on the 18th of December, a check for four pounds upon your banker? - A. I never gave him this check on my banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. Yes, he used to write in my office.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able, from seeing him write in your office, to say whether that is his hand-writing or not? - A. To the best of my knowledge and belief it is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. None occurs to my mind whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion to speak to him about taking your book to your bankers? - A. Yes; I think it was the day before he absconded, I said, I intended to take it to my banker's for it to be made up, or to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any reply to that? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep your book? - A. No; but I frequently used, when I went out, to tell him where I was going.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that? - A. Yes, I am sure I saw him after that; I am not sure whether he absconded that day or the next, I cannot be positive; it was the 8th of January that he absconded; he was at the office till about twelve or one o'clock; I am positive I did not see him after three.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of you missing him, and making this discovery, did you apply to the Lord-Mayor for a warrant? - A. No; I delivered up the checks to the bankers, leaving it to them to act as they thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you afterwards see the prisoner? - A. The first time I saw him, since he absconded, was on Tuesday last, at the Poultry-Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him at the Poultry-Compter? - A. I asked him what could induce him to do any thing of this sort, was it any unkindness on my part.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold out to him any promise of favour, or use any threat, before he said what you are going to state? - A. None, whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He said, he did not know that he had done any harm; I asked him to what extent he had injured me, and he said he had drawn the drafts, and received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - A. I don't recollect any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any other conversation at any other time? - A. Only at the Mansion-house the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed there was taken in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any body else, in your presence, ask him what he had done with the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that what the prisoner said, was taken down in writing? - A. I believe, what the prisoner said, was not taken down; I did not see it taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said in your presence by the prisoner before the Lord-Mayor? - A. He was asked if he had a father living; he said, no; he had a mother, who obtained her livelhood by keeping pigs; he was asked what he had done with the money that he had received for the drafts, and he said, he had spent some of it in tarts, and that he had given some to another lad in an adjacent office, who recommended him to my office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I take it for granted you cannot undertake to say, whether that writing was made in the County of Middlesex, or the City of London.? -

               <p>Q. In consequence of directions you received from the Lord-Mayor, did you go down to Bristol for the purpose of apprehending the prisoner? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend him, and where? - A. I did, at a Mr. Long's, in Newton's-court, Broad-street, Bristol, on Sunday morning, the 7th of this month.</p>

            Nothing at all; when I came to Piccadilly, I related to him that I had a warrant upon suspicion of forgery, upon which he coloured very much; I asked him how many drafts he had drawn forgeries of Mr. Windus's name; he said, he could not directly say how many; I then asked him if he could recollect whether there were four, or five, or half a dozen, or what number, and to what amount; he could not recollect for some little time; but, upon his recollection, he said, he thought it was about three or four, for three pounds each; I then asked him if he recollected one of the amount of six pounds; he said, yes, he did; I recommended him then to recollect himself, and say how many he had really forged; he said, it might be four, or it might be half a dozen, he really could not say; about twelve o'clock I took him before the Lord-Mayor, and he was remanded till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place the next day? - A. I asked him, in the presence of Mr. Windus, how many he had forged; he said, he could not exactly recollect how many; I asked him how he had laid out the money; he said, he laid out some in tarts, some he had given to a lad in another office, and he had bought a watch in Holborn for a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the drafts shewn to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Are you sure you made him no promise of favour? - A. I am sorry you should ask me that question.</p>
               <p>Q. It is my duty to ask you? - A. I did not say any thing to him of that kind.</p>

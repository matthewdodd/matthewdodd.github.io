                  </hi>. I am station-master at the New Wandsworth Station of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway—on the evening of 20th January, I was at the Shaftesbury Anne, Wandsworth Road, with three friends—we left there about 11.30, went to the York Road Station, and found the last train had gone—the two female prisoners addressed me as I came down the stairs—Sarah Smith said, "Your name is Mr. Harding, the station-master at the Wandsworth Station; we know you very well; we live at Clapham Junction"—I said, "I do not know you"—they said, "We know you very well; you had better Dome home with us"—I said, "No; I am going to my owu home"—they said, "You had better stand something to drink"—and as I thought they were persons from Clapham Junction who knew me, I went with them to the Mason's Arms, opposite the station, where they had some gin, and I had some whiskey—I stopped there about 10 minutes, and left them about 12.40, but they followed me down the Queen's Road, which is twelve or thirteen yards from the house, and came on each side of me—I knew perfectly well what I was about, but had had a glass or two—I had my hand in my pocket, and felt my watch and chain</p>

I had none of the property nor yet the money, if I had, I wish my arm may drop off my body"—when the prisoners were charged, Sarah said to Joseph, "I gave you the money and chain 'in the Queen's Road"—he said "No, you did not, you gave it me at the corner of the road"—and he turned round to Brockley, and said "You had some of the money"—she made no reply.</p>

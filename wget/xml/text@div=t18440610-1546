On Sunday, the 5th of May, the prosecutor and his brother came to my house, about four o'clock—we sat in the bar together, and had a glass of gin and water apiece—he went home to his brother's to tea, and came back again about eight o'clock—they had a dram at the bar, and went for a walk—they returned about ten o'clock, and had a glass of gin and water and a pint of ale—he had then his union pin in his cravat—I should say he was not the worse for liquor—he spoke rationally enough—I was about having a lodge fitted up, the Knights of Burgundy—he was telling me he should come down and join it the following Wednesday night—in my opinon he was sober enough to know what occurred.</p>

When I found my life was in danger, I opened the door and ran into the parlour, and the prosecutor after me; he then swore he would break the chimney-glass. Mrs. Mason endeavoured to take the poker from him, when he struck her violently across the arm; he then struck the fender, and broke it into pieces; Mrs. Mason screamed, 'Murder!' I then ran out through the kitchen for assistance, and Thomas Mapson was going by at the time: he came and took the poker from his hand, Mrs. Mason ran out of the front door into the street; the prosecutor took the candle and candlestick off the table, and threw it at her; it missed its aim, and it fell into the gutter; he then struck her with his fist several times; she struck him again; her dress got torn; she ran into the house, and prosecutor after her, but he was pre<lb></lb>vented from going in, by a man that rescued her from him: he then went away, and returned in a few minutes with a policeman, and gave us all three in charge: he did not say he was robbed until we all got to the station."</p>

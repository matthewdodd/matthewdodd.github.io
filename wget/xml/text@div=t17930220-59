               <p>I keep an herb shop in Covent-garden Market; I saw the prisoner at my shop, on the morning of the 2d of February, about half after six on Saturday morning; he came to my shop before I saw him, I was in bed, and my man called me up, and I saw a bag of mazarian roots in the shop, the prisoner had them to sell, I asked him what he asked for them, he said, he asked one shilling a pound, I told him I should detain him, and the roots, in consequence of information of some nursery grounds being robbed; I asked him where he got them? he said, he got them from a man at Paddington;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200127"></xptr>I then sent for a constable, and he was taken to Bow-street; the roots were then produced, and Mr. Kirk then brought the tops after some little time, and a great many of them were matched with the roots. (The roots produced, compared, and several of them exactly matched with the tops where they were cut, found in the prosecutor's gardens, and the other gardens, which had no Mazarions growing in it, it being a market garden.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is a wall between our garden, and the market garden of eight feet and there was the marks of feet on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trace no foot steps in your garden ground, where the tops of the Mazarions were found? - I could, and marks where they jumped down from the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trace any on the opposite side? - I did not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, sir, how many did you lose? - I cannot be positive, there might be seventy, but I can swear to fifty, they were worth about one shilling a plant.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel to Blackwell. What do you consider the value of these things to be? - The price of the plants is one shilling a piece, but we give one shilling a pound for the roots.</p>
               <p>Court to Blackwell. What time did you see the prisoner that morning? - At half past six o'clock, we had lights burning there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Kirk. What marks have you got that you can swear to the roots against any other roots.</p>
               <p>Court. The marks are these, he does not say, that there are any particular marks on the roots, except that the roots appear to have been cut, and that by putting the top of the Mazarion to the root of the Mazarion, one part agrees and tallies with the other, that is the reason that induces him to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is done since.</p>

               <p>Kirk. I have known the prisoner at the bar several years, he usually used to work in nursery gardens and grounds, he has worked for me, and he has worked for my father at different times, the last time he worked for me was about ten or eleven months ago, as nearly as possible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming one morning from my wife, going to my wife's brother in Cold-bath-fields, and coming along the road I picked up this bag of roots by the road side, I brought them to Covent garden; I thought they belong to me as much as any body else; I asked Mr. Blackwell, if he wanted any roots, and when he came, he said, he had information given out by Mr. Grimwood, if there were any thing came they must be stopped.</p>

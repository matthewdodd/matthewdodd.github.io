               <p>What sort of a night was it? - Moonlight; I had a great opportunity of looking at the prisoners while they were robbing the other persons; I am certain Harding the tall man was one; I had been in his company two or three times before, and had seen the horse he rode on, therefore I knew him; I have seen the horse in James-street, Kensington.</p>
               <p>Are you able to swear Harding was one of the men that robbed you? - I am; I am not positive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160076"></xptr> to the other, he was at too great a distance.</p>
               <p>'On his Cross Examination he said, the</p>

               <p>On the 9th of September about six in the morning I was at the taking of the prisoners; they were apprehended in a house, which I was informed was Harding's, on Strand on the Green, which is between Chiswick and Kew Bridge ; Harrison was in bed in the left hand room, and Harding in the right hand room; in Harrison's room, underneath a hat I found this pistol loaded (producing it); I asked him before I found the pistol, who that hat belonged to? he said it belonged to a friend in the bed where he was; I found two small balls.</p>
               <p>[The loading of the pistol and the balls were produced.]</p>
               <p>HALL looks at the pistol. I believe this to be the pistol I had with me in the diligence when I was robbed: I have the fellow to it here (producing it).</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This robbery was committed in January? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing of Harding till September? - I saw him once since at Tattershall's selling two horses; the engraver's name has been erased out of the pistol.</p>
               <p>COURT. The name and place of abode was on the pistol?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, and is on the one I have produced; they are made to unlock each other; they are a key to each other.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take him up when you saw him at Tattershall's? - I had rather he had fell into other hands: I said nothing to him.</p>

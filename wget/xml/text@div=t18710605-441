I am warehouseman and clerk to Mr. Charles Brumlue, a drug merchant, of 9, Mincing Lane—he has also a warehouse at 8, Billiter Street—on Monday afternoon, 17th April, I locked up the warehouse per<lb></lb>fectly safe—it was fastened with a patent padlock bar, and another lock besides, which locked the door—on the following morning, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I found the padlock had been taken away, and an old padlock substituted—I could not open it with my key—it was forced open, and I found that a box of saffron had been taken away—it contained about 2 cwt, and was worth more than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were three inferior qualities, but that would be the value, striking an average—I found a crowbar standing against a bag of seed—here is a piece of paper which was afterwards found in the saffron—it was torn from a piece that was in the warehouse—it has</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). I received information of this robbery on 18th April—on Saturday, 22nd April, I received some informa<lb></lb>tion from Mr. Gabriel, in consequence of which I went to his premises in White Street, Moorfields—after I had been there a short time, Robinson came in—he produced two parcels to Mr. Gabriel, weighing 14lbs. he was showing it to Mr. Gabriel, when I said to him "Robinson, how do you account for the possession of this saffron?"—he said "Well, I will tell you the truth"—he then told me that he had received it from Hall that morn<lb></lb>ing—I said "Where?"—he said "At the public-house down the Bow Road"—I said "Do you know any other person in this matter?"—he said "These two parcels were handed to me by another person that was with Hall, and he rode as far as Whitechapel Church with me, by the tramway"—he said he did not know the man's name—I said "When are you to see that man again?"—he said "I have to meet him at a public-house facing King William's statue about 11 o'clock"—I asked him how he was dressed; he described him—I said "And when have you to see Hall again"—he said "After I have seen this man at this public-house; I had a sample given me of this saffron last Wednesday morning, and that is all I know of the matter"—I said "Very well, I will test your statement; consider yourself in custody, I shall take care you don't escape"—he walked before me to the White Bear public-house in King William Street—I there saw Adams,—I did not know him before; from what I saw I said to him "Did you give this man two parcels this morning?"—he appeared somewhat confused, and made no answer—I turned to Robinson and said "Is this the man that gave you these parcels?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I shall charge you with being concerned with Robinson and others, in stealing a large quantity of saffron, on 18th April, and also with receiving"—I then conveyed Robinson and Adams to the Tower Street Police Station—I did not nee that Adams went out from the public-house after he came in—Child and Downs were with me—I was looking after another person at the time—after lodging Adams at the station I directed Robinson to keep the other appointment with Hall—I went to Smith's public-house in Bishopsgate Street—Hughes came in, he had a conversation with Robinson, and then left—(Hughes was afterwards taken into custody, and has committed suicide)—shortly after, I saw Hall enter the public-house—I walked round to the same compartment that Hall and Robinson were in, and from some<lb></lb>thing Robinson said to Hall, Hall said to Robinson "I thought there would be some mess in this job"—I then spoke to Hall, and told him that I should charge him with being concerned with Robinson, Adams, and others, in the stealing and receiving of this saffron—he said "Adams knows nothing more about this than carrying the parcels for me, I will take all the responsibility myself"—he said "You have been a little too fast in this; if you had not been so fast, you might have recovered all the pro<lb></lb>perty"—I said "I can't help that"—I then conveyed him to the station and charged them—I think I ought to mention, perhaps, what caused him to make that remark; I had almost directly after the robbery given direc<lb></lb>tions to a constable named Obee to call upon Hall, and Hall said he should have communicated with us, or something to that effect, but that I was too fast in the matter—he did not say anything about Obee—he said "You. have been too fast in the matter: if you had not been too fast perhaps you</p>

               <p>would have recovered the whole of the property"—after they were charged, Hall said he wished to make a statement—I took him apart, and he then said "The saffron was all taken to my house on the Tuesday morning (that was the morning of the robbery, the 18th), and you will find it there now, or rather it was there this morning when I left; if you don't find it there you must go to Hughes, he ought to know where it is"—he told me Hughes was to be found at 26, St. Peter Street, Hackney Road—I knew that—I afterwards went to Kenilworth House, Wellington Road, Bow, where Hall lived—there was a strong smell of saffron in the house, and I saw small traces of saffron about the passage and just outside the door—it was a wet morning, and the colour was running a little—I was accompanied by Childs and Downs—we searched the house thoroughly, and could not find the bulk of the saffron there—I then went to Adams' house, which is thirty or forty yards from Hall's—I there found three bags, containing about 150lbs. of saffron, in the kitchen—I saw Adams' daughter there, she showed me where it was—I had seen her in Hall's house a few minutes previously—I took the saffron to the station—I saw Adams, and told him that we had found three bags containing saffron at his house—he said "Well, it was not there this morning when I left"—I then saw Hall, and told him we had been to his house and found the saffron at Adams'—he said it was at his (Hall's) house that morning when he left—he said he had borrowed from Mr. Smith, the landlord of the public-house where I had seen him in Bishops<lb></lb>gate Street, 166<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he had paid over to Hughes on account of this saffron.</p>
               <p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050019"></xptr>
               <p>he went to Mr. Smith, and had deposited two life policies with him as security—I don't remember his telling me that on 18th April Hughes called at Mr. Boore's, and that he (Hall) saw him, and told him that Mr. Boore was absent—he told me that Hughes frequently called at Mr. Boore's—I don't remember his telling me that the cheque which he gave to Hughes was actually handed to Hughes in Mr. Boore's house, or that Hughes told him that one bag contained 42lbs. weight of saffron—he told me 28lbs., in addi<lb></lb>tion to what I have mentioned, had been sold by Hughes to a person named Goodrich—he said that Mr. Boore was to have received the whole of the saffron, but he (Hall) said "You can't have all, because 28lbs. has been sold by Hughes," not mentioning the name, I believe, and that Mr. Boore said "Very well, then the remainder you bring to my house, in 7lbs. and 14lbs., and I will have it all packed away in cases"—he said that in conse<lb></lb>quence of that he had given a sample from the 14lbs. to Robinson—I have no recollection of his telling me that he had mentioned to his master that the police were enquiring about 100lbs. weight of saffron stolen from Bil<lb></lb>liter Street—he said something about its being brought from the docks, but I understood that to have come from Hughes, that Hughes told Hall so; I would not be sure of it, but that is my impression—he has told me all through, that Mr. Boore had directed him to do all this—I knew that Obee had com<lb></lb>municated with him beforehand—I don't remember his telling me that he had mentioned that to Mr. Boore, and that Mr. Boore said "We need not be afraid about that, because it has come from the dock"—I would not say it was not so, but I did not understand it so; I understand that that came from Hughes—Hall said his master had told him he had given 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., per lb. for it—I also understood that from Hughes—Hall told me that Mr. Boore had promised to allow his wife 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, and to pay counsel for his defence; he did not say he would do that if he would not give information of these matters—he said that Mr. Boore had paid his wife 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, and had paid for a solicitor to defend him at the Mansion House, but that after he had made some statement at the Mansion House, all moneys had been stopped—when he said I had been too fast, I understood him to mean that if I had not been so fast, he might have given me information in reference to it—I have mentioned all these matters to the prosecution—I did not mention them to Mr. Evans, the solicitor, but it has been made known, the whole statement, to the Commissioner, and persons concerned—there was a lot of matter that I did not consider I ought to have exposed—I would rather not have said anything about it, because it referred to another person not before the Court—I mentioned all that I considered necessary—I have not mentioned to the solicitors all that I have told you, they have only just come into the matter, therefore, I have not had an opportunity of going into the—I case with them; I have had the management of this matter entirely myself have communicated to other persons connected with the prosecution the information that Hall gave to me.</p>

I live at 19, Christopher Street, and am employed by Mr. Edwards, a carman—on 22nd April, I went to Hall's house, in Wellington Road, Bow, about 1.30, and removed some goods—while there I saw Hughes, and his man—I saw them take some gunny bags out, and I saw them take them into Adams'—I afterwards saw them at the Mansion House—they looked the same sort of bags—I could not swear to them—I only saw two removed; they were taken from up stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale druggist, in White Street, Moor<lb></lb>fields—on Thursday, 20th April, about the middle of the day, Robinson came to me, and offered two samples of saffron—he asked 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., per lb.—I sus<lb></lb>pected the transaction, and asked him to leave the samples, and call again next morning—he left me the two samples that I have here; they are worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—within a quarter of an hour after he left I sent off a commu<lb></lb>nication to the police—next morning, when he came, I bargained with him for the quantity he told me there was—I put it down in his presence, 14lbs. of one parcel, and 28lbs. of the other; he was to let me have it at 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "Well, I shall require 5 per cent, at all events"—he said he could not allow that—I said "Well, bring the parcels down at 4 o'clock this afternoon"—he said he could not bring them down then, but he would bring them the next day—I said he must give a fixed time, because Satur<lb></lb>day being a short day, I should not have-much time to spare—he fixed for 10 o'clock—he came at 10 o'clock, and brought these two parcels of saffron—I had in the meantime arranged for Sergeant Moss to be at the back of the warehouse, in secret, and on a given signal the sergeant came forward—Robinson had just opened one parcel, at my dictation, and was just opening the other, when the Sergeant came up, and said "Well, Mr. Robinson, where did you get that?"—he said "I am selling it on commission"—Sergeant Moss then went into the rest, and I left it in his hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Robinson.

                  </hi>. I am an oilman and drysalter, of 344, Mile End Road—I deal in very few drugs—I gave up to Sergeant Moss 28lbs. of saffron—I got that from the deceased man, Hughes, on 14th April—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the identical sample he brought to me on 14th April; the bulk was brought on the 19th, but I did not see it till the 20th—I gave 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., per lb. for it, less 5 per cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had had a good many dealings with Hughes, extending over three years—I looked upon him as an honest, straightforward trader—should not have bought this saffron of a stranger—I bought saffron of him several times—he called on me weekly, as a wholesale drag dealer; he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050022"></xptr>
               <p>had been calling round, I suppose, for four years—I had no dealings with him for the first twelve months—I had not made enquiries about him—he was a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company—I was satisfied of his respectabi<lb></lb>lity, or I should have had no dealings with him—I found that he was a wholesale drug dealer—I had large dealings with him in oil of lavender, and after this transaction occurred I requested to be furnished with the parti<lb></lb>culars of it—I suppose I have paid him somewhere about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have bought of him cheaper than this, I may say, in one respect—I did not know that the value of the saffron that I gave 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for was 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I know it now, from what I have heard here to<lb></lb>day—I could buy a similar sample to what I have here, at 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—at the time I bought it I told Hughes it was very cheap, and I ordered 7lbs. of him, and then increased it to twenty.</p>

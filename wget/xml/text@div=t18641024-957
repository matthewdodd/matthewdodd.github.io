                  <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE MITCHELL</hi>. I live at 187, Great George-street, St. George's-in-the-East—I assist at a boarding-house—on the night of 21st September I was in the Rose and Crown"—my master, John de Leon, was there, and the prisoner—there were a lot of Spaniards there—I got there about 10 o'clock—about half-past 11 the prisoner and deceased had a quarrel—after that all was quiet—I saw the prisoner go down stairs—soon afterwards I went down—I found the prisoner walking up and down outside the door—he had his left hand in his trousers pocket, and his right hand in his coat-pocket—he was there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I saw the deceased come down stairs; he came down about 12 o'clock; the lights were blown out, and every one came down; a lot of <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> and girls too—after all the people had come down I saw the prisoner walk inside the public-house: I was alongside of him—Leon came, and said to the prisoner, "What is the reason you always mention my name? you never hear me mention your name; if you have got any spite come outside, and fight in fair play in English fashion"—the prisoner answered, "Go, and—your<lb></lb>self"—Leon then put his hand to his breast, and pushed him; on that the prisoner took his right hand from his pocket with the knife in it, and let him have it with all his might in his belly—as soon as he was struck Leon said, "I am killed"—I caught the prisoner—he dropped the knife with the force of the blow; it was taken to the station—many of the people there beat the prisoner as soon as he had struck the blow—I went to the hospital with Leon—I think he lived about thirty-five or thirty-six hours.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there fighting upstairs before they came down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only quarrelling for two or three minutes; I saw nothing else—I did not see the prisoner struck on the nose, and his nose bleeding—I don't know what the quarrel commenced about—I was servant to the deceased for five or six months—I don't know Charley Wilson or Domingo Salort (<hi rend="italic">they were called in</hi>)—I know them—I saw Wilson there with the prisoner—I did not see the other man there; I know him—I did not see the deceased strike the prisoner, nor did I see the other Spaniards attack him and strike him—I did not see them pull the hair out of his head; I pulled some out when a lot of the Spaniards tried to take him out of my hand; that was down stairs—I did not see the prisoner with a handkerchief wiping the blood off his face—I did not hear Wilson say it was a great shame there should be such a row amongst Spaniards—I did not bear the deceased say that was nothing to what he should do by-and-by, and that he had nearly knocked the prisoner's eye out some time before—I did not, before the blow was struck, see the prisoner on the ground, and four or five on the top of him. <hi rend="smallCaps">RALPH VANDER MULLER</hi>.

               <p>about 12 o'clock on this night I had occasion to go to the door to shut up the place—I saw the prisoner standing outside the door with his right hand in his coat pocket, and his left hand in his trousers pocket—he stood so for about ten minutes—after that Leon and the prisoner spoke some words in Spanish, which I could not understand—Leon was sitting at a table oppo<lb></lb>site the bar, about three yards from the prisoner'—I believe Leon spoke first—he jumped off the table and was going towards the door—they spoke some more words; the prisoner answered him back with some expression, and Leon touched him on the shoulder with his open hand; the prisoner then took his right hand out of his pocket, and put the knife into the man's belly; he appeared to do it with violence—I saw the knife in his hand as it went by me—Leon said, "The son of a b-has killed me"—a policeman was sent for—I said, "He has got a knife;" and he dropped it on my boot—I picked it up, and gave it to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What countryman are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hollander—I had known the deceased about two years—I was not up stairs when any fighting took place—there was no fighting—the prisoner came down about twenty minutes before the Spaniards, and went outside—I did not notice whether he appeared distressed, he passed me rather sharp—I did not see him wiping his face with a handkerchief—when Leon came down he sat on a table in front of the bar—he was solid and sober—it was while he was sitting on the table that he spoke to the prisoner—the prisoner was not knocked down before he stabbed Leon—I did not see him on the ground afterwards with several on the top of him—he was got hold of by Mitchell—I helped to carry Leon into the kitchen—it was about a yard and a half inside the door that he was stabbed—I saw no blood on the prisoner—at the police-station, I saw that he had marks of violence on his face; his eyes looked inflamed—he was crying very much—I believe one eye was cut a little—his hair was in a rough sort of manner—Leon went towards the prisoner when he jumped off the table—I did not see him spit in the prisoner's face.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He was a strong, muscular man, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quite up to the average—he was a considerably larger and more powerful man than the prisoner—I examined the prisoner at the Police-court next day—I found he had been very much ill-treated about the head—both eyes were black, and there was a little cut on the cheek-bone—hair had been pulled out of his head—I examined his body—I could see no marks, but he complained of being tender when I touched him in different parts—the deceased's wound was in the belly, not very low down; it inclined slightly upwards, as if struck from below.</p>

What I done to him before is nothing to what I will do to him again"—they then all went down stairs together—I did not see what took place there—I went into a little room to speak to a young woman.</p>

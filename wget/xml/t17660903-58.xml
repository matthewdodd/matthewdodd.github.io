Some little time after my wife told me she saw him put a pair of silk stockings in his pocket; I asked him if he had not some of my stockings in his pocket; he denied having any: I searched, and found two pair of silk stockings upon him, (produced in court.) Here is my private mark upon one pair, and I am sure to the other; he said he hoped I would forgive him; he then confessed he had stole several other pair, some silk, some worsted. Two gentlemen heard this confession besides me, before we carried him to a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him any favour?</p>
               <p>Foote. I promised to be as favourable in laying the indictment as I could, and I have not laid the indictment capital, which I might have done; the pawnbroker is not come; he has another pair which the prisoner acknowledged to the pawning of.</p>

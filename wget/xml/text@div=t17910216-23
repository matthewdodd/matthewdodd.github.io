               <p>I belong to Justice Reid, the prosecutor came to me and told me he had been robbed, and suspected Dodd; I knew Dodd, and found him at work in Husband-street; Watkins was with us, says he to Dodd, I have lost some wood, you know where it is? says the prisoner, cannot we settle it, without going further; he said one Martin a soldier gave it him, but would not tell his regiment; he reached down eight of these things, he wanted to settle that matter with Watkins, I said he must go before a magistrate; I know nothing of the table legs.</p>
               <p>Court to Watkins. You missed some of these things between Sunday and Monday? - Yes.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I met this soldier, and he asked me to sell them for him, he laid the table legs on my arm, and carried the vaneers to my place where I was at work; I saw them the next day, and told him to take them away; they said that would not do, and the best way would be to burn the whole kit; I said that was not right; he said, you take care of the vaneers, and I will take care of the legs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Piggott, and live in New North-street, Finsbury-square. I knew the prisoner two years ago, and she went to reside with her friends in the country—she returned on the 22nd of June, and staid nine days with me—she was in the kitchen, and I told her to set the table for dinner—I had three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two half crowns, a sixpence, and a ring in the drawer—about half-past two o'clock in the day I left the keys in the drawer a little while—I went into the back kitchen to wash—I returned, and took the keys out—I did not look whether my money and ring was then safe—I went out to hang out my clothes, and left no one in the house but the prisoner and the servant—when I retained the prisoner was gone—I went to my drawer about half-past five, and mined the money and ring—I had a good way to go to hang my clothes out—I might be gone an hour and a half—this is my ring and locket—on the 16th of July, I and a friend met the prisoner in the City-road—we accused her of the robbery—she said she was sorry she had done it—I said, "So am I, Eliza, I did not think you would have done it"—she said, "Nor did I, will you forgive me"—she took the ring off her finger and gave it to me—my daughter keeps a lodging house—she lives with her husband—she has not lived in West-street for some time—I do not keep a house of accommo<lb></lb>dation.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable.</hi>) The prisoner was brought to the sta<lb></lb>tion, charged with stealing three sovereigns and other money—she said she had only stolen two sovereigns and a-half and this ring, but she was very sorry for it—the ring was given to the inspector by the prosecutrix—I be<lb></lb>lieve hers is a house of accommodation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> She lent me the ring; she was very much in liquor that day. She had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine in her possession; she said it was not the value of the money, but the manner in which 1 left her house.</p>

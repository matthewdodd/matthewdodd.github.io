                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, No. 20, Weston-street, Bermondsey—I have known M'Carthy about six years—about 20th December he came to me and told me that he had a number of these pipes at home, showing me a sample, and asked if I could dispose of any of them I said I would see; it was entirely out of my way, but there was one tradesman in Piccadilly where, no doubt, I could succeed in disposing of some of them—that was Mr. Simmonds—I went to Mr. Simmonds, and took him a sample, and he after<lb></lb>wards purchased ten, at the rate of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece, that was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ten—I gave M'Carthy 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and returned him five of the pipes—I had had fifteen from him—I saw other pipes of the same description.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever done anything in the smuggling line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is best known to Mr. M'Carthy—I certainly have bought a bit of tobacco of Mr. M'Carthy—I have once been convicted of smuggling, that is only since last Monday—I was fined 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or six months—I did not pay the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I hope the custom-house authorities will mitigate the punishment, as there are extenuating circumstances—they have not been talking to me about these matters, it was at Guildhall that I appeared—I was charged with being concerned in conveying 131bs. of tobacco, on 10th April last.</p>

I am a detective officer of the city-police—I accom<lb></lb>panied Hughes to the house of Hinds—I told him we had called respecting a pipe that was put up at a raffle at a public-house in Hickman's-folly, and that his daughter was there present with us—he said, "She knows nothing about it, I bought it of a man in Thames-street, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave it to her for her sweetheart—her sweetheart and her had had a fall out, and I told he to put it up for a raffle to do her good"—he did not tell me the name of the man that he bought it of—I afterwards accompanied Hughes to M'Carthy's house in Royal Mint Street—I met him in the street, and told him that we wanted him to accompany us to Seething-lane police-station to</p>

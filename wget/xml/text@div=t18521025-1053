                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Peter-street, Southwark. Last Saturday night but one, I was drinking at the Grapes public house, in the Mint, with the prisoner Jones—I went there between 9 and 10 o'clock, and remained till the house was shutting up—Jones was there in company the whole time with Winter—I did not see Reardon there—I left the house and went as far as Gravel-lane—I went to a private house with Winter and the other prisoner—there was drinking going on—the prisoner asked me if I would have a glass of anything to drink—I said I did not mind; I took a glass of what I thought was gin—when I had taken it some time, I found myself getting stupified—I thought I had better leave and go home—I went out of the house towards home, Winter and Jones followed me out and joined my company—Reardon was in the house, but I do not know whether she came out or not—I did not see her again till she was taken—I looked at my watch ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I came out, it was then a quarter past 1—I went towards home, and was talking to Winter and Jones;. I missed Winter, and in a minute, or a minute and a half, I received a blow on the side of the head which fetched me to the ground—I saw nobody but the prisoners, but did not see who gave me the blow—I felt a tug at my watch guard; I got up but fell again—I got up again and ran to a policeman—I did not see any one run away; I thought I heard them, but the stuff they gave me and the blow stunned me—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Winter. Q.</hi> Did not I take and leave you at home with your wife and child three or four minutes before you were robbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; you did not leave me above a minute and a half before I was knocked down.</p>

                  </hi>. On this Sunday morning, about 2 o'clock, I was near Gravel-lane speaking to a constable, and heard a bit of a scuffle—I saw Win<lb></lb>ter and Jones there, Reardon passed by and went down a court—I saw nobody else except a lame old gentleman with a stick—I followed Reardon down the court, and brought her back—after I had brought her over 100 yards, in crossing the road I heard a watch drop—this is it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Winter. Q.</hi> Did not you come after me, <hi rend="italic">tap</hi> me on the shoulder, and say, "I want you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: the prosecutor had got Jones, and he told me to stop you and take you to him, and I did so—you came back with me to see what it was for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Reardon. Q.</hi> Was not I outside my father's door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I found you outside in the street, but the quarrel was on the opposite side of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, London-house yard—on Tuesday, 27th August, about 3 o'clock, I was in the parlour adjoining my shop—I saw the two prisoners in the street near my shop—their manner attracted my attention—I watched them, and saw Strong give Bradley something out of his side pocket—Strong had his back towards me—I could not say exactly what it was—Bradley put them into a bag which he carried—Strong took something out of his pocket two or three times, and each time Bradley put what he gave him into the bag—Bradley then left Strong, and went towards St. Paul's Churchyard—Strong had a small hand truck with him—it was a few yards from him—it contained two large paper parcels—he followed with it in the same direction as Strong had gone—I went through a court by London-house-yard, thinking I should meet Bradley in Paternoster-row—he did not come quite up to me, but turned into a passage leading into Newgate-market, called, I think, Paved-alley—I followed after him, and when I got to the top of the alley, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said "Bradley, I wish to speak to you"—he said, "Very well, Mr. Fox"—I said, "Come along with me"—I took him to my house, and when in the parlour I said, "What was it you received of the man with the truck?"—he said, "Some books"—I said, "Where are they?"—he said, "In my bag"—I said, "Give me them out"—he then gave me three books, saying, "Mr. Fox, these are my books; I ordered them of the man with the truck"—I then asked him who the man was that gave him the books, and where he worked; and after some hesitation he said, "Messrs. Routledge, of Farringdon-street"—I said that if that was the case, I daresay it would be right, I would go with him down to Farringdon-street; but when I got him to my street door he wanted to get away by</p>

About 8 o'clock in the evening, on coming to the station, I went to the cell where Bradley was, accompanied by a constable—I asked him if he had any of Messrs. Rout<lb></lb>ledge's books at his lodgings, and he said, No, he had not—I said, "Are you quite sure?"—he said, "Yes" I said, "Why you have got stock, have you not?"—he said, "Yes; but it is only old books' and pamphlets"—I said, "Now, be careful; are you sure that you have not any of Messrs. Routledge's publications at your house?" and he then repeated that he had not—I then said, "What will you say if I show you 142 which have been found at your lodgings?"—he made no reply to that—I said, "Come with me"—I took him to the office where the books were all placed, and he then said, "These are mine"—pointing to this packet of eleven books—" I bought them of Mr. Lowe"—I said, "But these are published by Routledge, you said you had none of Routledge's publications"—he made no reply to that, and he then went into the cell—when Bradley was first brought in, I questioned him as to what account he could give respecting these three books, and to the best of my remembrance he said that he he got them of a porter of Messrs. Routledge, and I think he said that he had ordered them—when Strong was brought in, which was perhaps twenty minutes or half-an-hour after, I said to Bradley, "Is that the porter you got these books from?" and he said, "No; that is not the man"—that was in the presence of Strong and of Mr. Routledge, and two or three other persons.</p>

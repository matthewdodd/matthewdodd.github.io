I keep a fancy repository at 14, Old Granada-road—on 14th August, I served the prisoner with four small salt-cellars, which came to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he gave me a bad crown—I asked some children to send in a policeman—the prisoner said that he could prove himself a respectable person, and a neighbour—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "At the other end of the Albany-road"—I said, "You do not call that a neighbour;" at that time a policeman came, and I gave him in charge, with the crown.</p>

I am clerk to Lane and Son, gold-beaters, of 30, Red Lion-square—on 14th August, the prisoner came for 100 of gold leaf, price 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave it to him—he gave me a five shilling-piece, and went out of the office rather hastily—I then looked at it, found it was bad, and went and overtook him in Princes-street, about half a minute's walk off—I said, "You have given me a bad five-shilling piece; you must give me the gold back or a good five shillings"—he said that he had given the gold to a friend to take to his place in the Walworth-road, and he had not five shillings—I took him back to the office, and sent for a constable—he gave his address Charlotte-row—I went to look at the directory, and then he said that it was some street at the corner, and I did not look further—he was then on one side of the partition, and I on the other—he stood on a mat, underneath which I found a bad five-shilling piece next morning—I gave them both to the policeman.</p>

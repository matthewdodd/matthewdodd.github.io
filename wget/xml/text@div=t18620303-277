                  </hi>. I am assistant to my father, John James king, a jeweller, of 21, Kingsland-place, Kingsland-road—I reside there—on 1st January I listened up the place about 12 o'clock—at that time all was safe; the doors were secured in the usual way, and the windows the same—about 4 o'clock in the morning I was called up by the police, and on coming down found the place in great confusion—the thieves had entered by the back window; that window had been closed and fastened the night before—we lost property on that occasion to the amount of 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—amongst the property lost was this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it—we gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it to Mr. McKewan.</p>

I am a watch and clock manufacturer at 140 and 141, Cheapside—I sold this watch to Mr. King in 1854, for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., amongst others—on the night of 18th January last, in conseqnence of a communica<lb></lb>tion from Mr. King, two policemen in private clothes came to me, and by their wish I went to the bar of a public-house in Red Lion-street, Holborn—a party whom the police introduced to me brought the prisoner to me there—he produced to me a silver gilt watch—he said it was gold, and wanted 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he then produced another, which I was not quite sure was Mr. King's property, but it subsequently turned out to be so—I took the number of it—a third one was then produced, which I also took the number of; but not being sure of either of those I asked to see another, and this watch was then produced—he asked 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it at first, but ulti<lb></lb>mately took 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid him for it, and then left the public-house, and met the police-sergeant by appointment—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man I saw—I could swear to him among a thousand.</p>

               <p>to a public-house in Red Lion-street, on Saturday, the 18th—whilst there I saw the prisoner come out of a coffee-shop, and go into the public-house where Mr. McKewan was, which was at the corner of the street, about fifteen yards off—I afterwards saw him in conversation there with Mr. McKewan—I went in and looked in at the door—he returned to the coffee-shop, and then returned again to the public-house—I saw him three times and am quite sure he is the man—I afterwards followed Mr. McKewan to his shop in Cheapside, and received the watch produced from him—I returned to the coffee-shop that night and searched for the prisoner, but could not find him—I apprehended him on the Monday morning following, the 27th, between 12 and 1 o'clock—he was in conversation with a girl at the door of a coffee-shop in Eagle-street, close to Red Lion-street—I told him I was a police-sergeant, and that I had been looking after him for the last week—he said he had not been out of the way—I told him that I wanted him for selling a gold watch to a person, which was stolen from Mr. King's, at Kingsland—he said he had never sold any gold watch to any one, and he knew nothing at all about it; it was a mistake, and I must be mistaken in the man—I took him to the Kingsland station, and he denied the charge there in the same way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am innocent of stealing the watch. I received it from Mr. Benjamin in the coffee-shop in Eagle-street. At the time the gentleman came for the watches Mr. Benjamin was busy, and said, "I cannot come over myself, I will send some one over." I was in there taking some coffee, and he asked me if I would go over with it. I said, "Yes." The first watch I took over was a large gold one, as he told me, and he told me to ask 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—it did not suit the gentlemen, and he gave me another—that did not suit, and I took another, which I was to ask 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for; the gentlemen said he would give 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I took it back and told Mr. Benjamin about it, and he said, "Go back, and take the 50<hi rend="italic">s.,"</hi> which I did, and I immediately returned to the coffee-shop, and gave it to Mr. Benjamin, and he gave me half-a-crown for my trouble.</p>

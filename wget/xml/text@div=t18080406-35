               <p>Q. During the time you have been speaking of, previous to this accident taking place, did you observe any thing with respect to the prisoner. - A. Yes, she was larger than general, I thought she was pregnant. On Thursday, about five o'clock, to the best of my recollection, she ate her dinner and complained of a pain in her stomach; her mistress and the family went out that evening and left three of my mistress's servants in the house; the prisoner wished to go to bed early, being very poorly; she went up stairs about eight o'clock; my fellow servant

            , she went up; in about five minutes I went up again; I was alarmed, I sent for my mistress home, she complained of a pain in her stomach; my mistress came home immediately, and Mr. Smith the doctor was sent for; we all thought she had a child; the doctor came, he asked Mrs. Birkett if she was a married woman. After the doctor was gone Mrs. Birkett asked her, she denied it; I remained with her all night.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when Mr. Peelvin made a search. - A. Yes, that was on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pockets. - A. Yes; I found the pockets on the Thursday on the counterpane, at the top of the bed, near the pillow; I tied them up and placed them under her pillow that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. How were they before you tied them up. - A. They laid loose on the bed. On Saturday when Mr. Peelvin was there, I took the pockets from under the pillow, I found a pair of scissars in them, with a little blood on them; I gave the scissars to Mr. Peelvin, he is the churchwarden; there was a penknife there, but there was no blood on it. I searched under the bed; I found a little black trunk under the bed with a female child in it, wrapped up in a gown which I have seen the prisoner wear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What was the appearance about the person of the child. - A. Its throat was cut with a bad edged instrument, or a pair of scissars; I said to Mrs. Birkett who was standing by, I had found the child, and that its throat was cut; the prisoner was laying then in the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak loud enough for the prisoner to hear you, when you mentioned the appearance of the child - when you first found it. - A. I suppose she must hear.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said the child's throat was cut. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner upon that make any observations. - A. She did not speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You said you took the infant out of the gown, what did you do with the infant. - A. I laid it on the boards till Mr. Smith came; he came about three quarters of an hour afterwards; he saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You say, what you said to Mrs. Birkett, the prisoner must have heard you. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she in that exhausted state that she might not hear. - A. She lay with her eyes shut.</p>

               <p>Q. The penknife had not any blood upon it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a very large child. - A. A very large child.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a married woman, but common sense tells you it must have been a very hard labour. - A. Most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you examined the box, in which you found a child. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find another box in which apparently there were things for the child

Yes; the prisoner was a person that I highly valued; I had no suspicion of her pregnancy; on the 3d of March we dined about six o'clock: the prisoner ate a very hearty dinner; after she had done she went up stairs, she complained that she was ill in her bowels - she came down stairs about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came down stairs. - A. The prisoner; she was confined up stairs with the infant, she only came down upon occasions; she came down about eight o'clock to provide for Mrs. Hewitson's child's supper, and for the night; she complained again of her being ill in her bowels, she apparently looked very well in the face; I smiled at her for saying the fish she ate for her dinner disagreed with her, I thought it was so simple a thing to make her ill; I asked her to take a cup of tea with me, she refused; about half past eight I went up stairs to dress myself; I asked her to have a little brandy, she said no; she was then sitting on the chair by the side of the bed, with her gown unpinned; she had a very nice colour, she put her hand to her stomach and apparently was in great pain; I then said what is the matter, are you very ill; yes, she said, I am very ill in my bowels; by her looking so well I did not think any thing of it. I then went out of the room and left her. About nine o'clock I went into her room again, she was then in bed with the cap on she had worn in day; I then asked her why she went to bed with her cap on; she spoke apparently confused, and rather smiled, said she should be up by and by; I concluded that she had fed the child; I asked her if she would have tea, she refused; I went down stairs and made tea; I took it her up, and staid with her till she hand drank part, I asked her how she did, she said she was better; I poured her out the remainder, she refused my staying with her; I then went out, it may have been three quarters of an hour before I returned; it was about a quarter after nine when I went out, and I returned to her about ten o'clock;

            . These are the pockets, I can swear to them; and these are the scissars, the stain of blood I can swear to; I took particular notice of that; the prisoner was laying in bed when they were found, and the conversation was loud enough for her to hear every word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bed at any time. - A. I searched the bed after the doctor left the room. On Thursday night I saw nothing of the child, only a great discharge of blood; Mrs. Birkett then said she was as much in that situation as ever she was (meaning having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060026"></xptr>had a child or something of that sort), the prisoner replied no such thing madam. I searched under the bed, I saw this trunk; I moved it of one side, it was under the bed, I could see nothing; I never thought of looking into the trunk, nor did I see the child till it was laid on the floor, on Saturday night the 5th of March, between one and two o'clock; the child was wrapped up in a gown that the prisoner always wore, while she was at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about the child. - A. The child's throat was cut with an instrument that did not cut well, it was not cut strait; it was scolloped in and out, it appeared to me to be cut with scissars; it was a very fine child as ever I saw.</p>

               <p>Q. Your daughter brought an infant to your house. - A. Yes, the prisoner had the care of it; she was servant to the child.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand that you were out this Thursday evening. - A. Yes, I was out drinking tea and all the family; I returned home about a quarter before eleven. I went up immediately to the room where the prisoner was; I found her in a state which gave me suspicion that she had been brought a bed; she was in bed, I asked her what was the matter with her, she said nothing particular, she could hardly, make any reply; I believe she fainted away shortly after I came into the room. I said to her I thought appearances were very much against her; I did not know what to make of her situation. I did not exactly suppose that she might be brought a bed, I thought it might have been a bad miscarriage.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you were aware from what was found on the floor what had happened, you were told of it. - A. Yes. I went up and down several times till two o'clock in the morning, then I left the two servants with her, and told them if they observed any thing to let me know; there were no further appearances, I said to her the next morning that I had hurt her feelings by saying what I did last night; but appearances were so, that gave me suspicion, but I hoped it was not so; she said oh dear madam, it is not so, indeed; she was attended during the day by the family; Mr. Smith came again the next morning, she was then laying in a stupid kind of a way. He had strong suspicions of her; I told Mr. Smith I did not think she was capable of deceiving us so much; I could not believe it was so On the Saturday morning Mr. Smith insisted upon there being a child; he begged I would search immediately; I took

             up with me; there was a small black trunk under the bed; she pulled it from under the bed; opened it, there were a few small muslin things on the top inside of the trunk and under it a bundle tied up in a handkerchief, we opened the handkerchief the child was found wrapped up in a gown, which was in the handkerchief; it was a fine full grown female child; it appeared to have some injury upon the throat. I was not near enough to examine it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That child that was so found was afterwards shewn to Mr. Smith. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This poor woman had behaved very well, you had a high opinion of her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover any child bed linen. - A. There was some found, I understand; it was not brought to me, she only came to my house for a few days; her box was at her master's at Tower hill.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time that you made the discovery of the box and the child in it, did you talk so loud that she could hear. - A. Yes, she appeared to be in a stupid state; she hardly appeared to be alive. I hope my lord the whole was more the effect of accident than design.</p>
               <p>Mr. SMITH. You are a surgeon living at Stoke Newington. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday evening the 3d of March, were you sent for to Mrs. Birkett's at Clapton. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see the prisoner. - A. I did, I was desired to go up stairs, where I found the prisoner in bed; I was told by her attendant that she had lost a great quantity of blood; the prisoner at that time was very faint and languid; she could give very little account; upon my going down stairs to Mrs. Birkett, I expressed my suspicions, I did not give any directions that night because my suspicions were not very great. Upon my seeing her the next day I then discovered a disagreeable stench about the bed; which I knew from my experience could only be the placenta, or after birth; I then requested Mrs. Birkett to give directions to have the bed searched, and if she found any thing to send for me, for my inspection. On the Saturday morning about eleven o'clock I called again; I was shewn part of a mature placenta; I then told Mrs. Birkett that my suspicions were quite confirmed, that such an appearance could not be without there having been a child. I then proposed to Mrs. Birkett to have the room searched. In a few hours afterwards I received a note from Mrs. Birkett that she had discovered the child. I returned to Mrs. Birkett about three o'clock in the afternoon; I was then shewn a female infant, of full mature growth, with its throat cut.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cut was it. - A. An incised wound cut by scissars and notched, extending along the whole course of the neck to the jaw, where the would was long and deep; it was very deep near the jaw, and where the windpipe received the injury.</p>
               <p>Q. What injury had the windpipe received. - A. It was divided.</p>
               <p>Court. Would that require a considerable effort to cut the windpipe with these scissars. - A. It must require great labour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. When you talk of the windpipe being divided you do not mean separated. - A. No, it was an incision, a deep cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of observing in the course of your practice, that the naval string will twine itself round the child's neck, so that it is necessary to apply the scissars to cut the navel string.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060027"></xptr>A. It is necessary to cut the navel string always.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen that the navel string will twine itself round the child's neck. - A. Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it would choak the child. - A. No, it would break before it could produce suffocation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think that a poor wretched woman in attempting to assist nature might have done that injury. - A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you that the wound went upwards. - A. Yes, along the whole course of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. That notching that was done at several times could that be to assist the separation of the navel string. - A. It is possible that it might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear that it would be a mode to separate the naval string from the neck, if the navel string was there. - A. I think not; the scissars appear to have had a forcible thrust of a considerable depth; I dare say more than an inch; the navel string is extremely easy, cut it is like cutting a piece of tape.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there require any effort at all necessary for the purpose of separating the naval string, which might be cut as easy as a piece of tape. - A. None at all; it would have required no such force.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen the scissars. - A. I saw them before the coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they competent to produce the effect on the child. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated the appearance of the child, can you form a judgment of its being born alive. - A. Certainly; I think it was; but not being present, I cannot say, but taking all the circumstances together, the placenta and from the wound, it does not alter my opinion at all about it, but that it was born alive.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever understand she was married. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday the 6th of March had you any conversation with the prisoner. - A. I asked her whether she recollected the time that she was connected with any one; she told me about the beginning of June; I then asked her the reason why she did not leave me, knowing herself to be in that situation; she said, she did not know it would have happened so soon, she meaned to go to the parish; she had been asking leave to go to town, saying she wanted to see her mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine any box of hers. - A. No, I merely locked it up, and set it to her.</p>
               <p>Court, to Dr. Smith. You say the wound was a competent, and a valid cause to produce death. - A. Quite so, I saw no other cause whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Being of opinion as you have stated, that the child was born alive, do you therefore ascribe its death to that wound. - A. Entirely.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. You are the nurse that was called in to attend the prisoner. - A Yes. On Sunday morning I gave her some sut drops in tea, she being in pain; about an hour and a half after that I found the afterbirth. When Mr. Smith came at night I shewed it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her box brought down to her. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are a surgeon, and have had an extensive practice of midwifery. - A. I have, a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard of the accident of the navel string twining round the child's neck. - A. It certainly occurs very frequent.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you sir, from the opportunity that you have had of observing women in labour - is it not a thing likely to occur that a woman assisting herself, being totally ignorant, might have made an incision in the same way as described. - A. It is possible that she might by applying the scissars to extricate herself; if the navel string is round the childs neck as there is but a short distance from that and the uterus even for a practioner to cut the string; supposing the scissars had been both points sharp, one is obtuse, which makes it more difficult; in the agony of mind had they both been sharp pointed, she might have forced the scissars without any intent to commit murder; I should certainly have untwisted the string; there is a difficulty in getting the scissars under the string.</p>
               <p>Q. You say sir in the situation described it, would be necessary to use some force to get the string. - A. I do say so, and it might be so, that there would be room enough to put the scissars under; it could not hardly be done by an ignorant person, and in fact hardly is ever done by a practitioner, without untwisting the string before they apply the scissars.</p>
               <p>Court, to Smith. What was the depth of the wound, describe where the wound commenced. - A. In the inferior part of the neck, and stretched up to the jaw; it was about three inches in length.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form how many cuttings there might have been. - A. Three distinct ones. The navel string was round the neck of the child, I left it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the incision made by the scissars could have been done by the person in the agony of labour to relieve herself from that. - A. It might happen.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see any circumstance to enable you to say whether it did happen so or not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In conversation with the prisoner, did she suggest to you any thing of that sort. - A. I had no conversation with her, I only asked her how she did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

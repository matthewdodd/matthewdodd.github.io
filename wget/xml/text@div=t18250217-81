On Friday, the 4th of February, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I sent Buckner to Messrs.

I saw several people running across the road. I went to the back of the truck, and found a hole in the end of the bag, which was quite full before - it must have been cut, and was large enough to admit a hand.</p>

            . On the evening of the 4th of February I was in Watling-street, and saw the prisoner following Buckner's truck. I called Hugget, my fellow-servant we watched, and saw him go to the truck several times from the path, but I did not see him take any thing. Huggett went on before me, and took him; I saw him take a skein of silk from his pocket - I picked up some more in the street, and took it to Messrs. Pearkes and Co.</p>

            . I heard a noise in Castle-street, where I live. I went to the door, and saw Huggett holding the prisoner, who was crying out, "Let me go." I saw him loosen his coat and throw the silk about the road. I picked up one skein, which laid on the foot-path. I had a ream of paper in my hand, which I took in doors; I then went to the watch-house, and left the silk with Collins.</p>

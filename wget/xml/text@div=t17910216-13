Gentlemen of the Jury, you have collected by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160020"></xptr>this time, from the indictment which has been stated, that the charge against the prisoner is that of stealing silver plate from one of the royal palaces at one of the Queen's houses. Miss Burney, a lady who has the honour of attending her Majesty, has apartments at the Queen's house: the prisoner had been formerly in her service; he knew the apartments and the property, and how to gain access; but I believe, at the time when the present felony was committed, he was not in her service; the felony was certainly committed on the 25th of January last. Gentlemen, some time in February following, a Mr. Heather, to whom the public have been in very many instances extremely indebted, as a pawnbroker, was applied to by the prisoner, who pulled from his pocket several pieces of silver; Mr. Heather immediately suspected him; he searched him; and in his pocket he found other pieces; he gave immediate notice to Sir

            ; the man was apprehended; he had not undergone an examination long, before he was sent to a neighbouring house; and a person of the name of Macmanus happened to be there; the man, alarmed at his situation, asked him what would become of him? Macmanus said it was impossible for him to say; probably he might be hanged; but told him the best thing he could do, was to tell all he knew; in consequence of that he then made the discovery, which I humbly conceive would have been better for him to have made to day; that he was walking in St. James's Park; he saw this property; he was in extreme distress, and was tempted to go into those apartments to take this property; I shall therefore call to you the maid of Miss Burney, who discovered the nossels of the candlesticks being taken away; the consequence of the discovery made to Mr. Macmanus; he likewise told him the place where he resided; he immediately went to his apartments; and there some other property was found, bearing the royal arms of England. You, gentlemen, will hear the evidence, and then there can be no doubt in your minds of his guilt.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I saw him at the office; I heard him tell Sir Sampson that he found those first pieces of silver, rolled up in a paper, in Tavistock-street; Sir Sampson asked him several questions, and desired me to go oyer with him into the back parlour at the Brown Bear; and I talked to him a great while; and he still continued in the story that he told Sir Sampson; then I said I must go to St. James's; and he said, whatever gaol I go to, you will come and see me; I shall want to speak to you; then he desired me to put out the keeper of Bridewell's servant, who was in the room, which I did, and he went out; then he told me it was the Queen's plate; that is, the pieces that he before said he he had found; he asked me, what do you think they will do to me? I said, why what is found upon you will very likely cast you for death; and denying the rest will do you no good; it will only make you more roguish; then I told him to say no more; and Sir Sampson sent for him, and asked what he had to say? and he turned round to me, and said I was to speak to Sir Sampson; and up in a garret, No. 27, Denmark-street, in a room of Mrs. Coltaines's, who used to wash for him; I found her lodging there; I went up stairs, to the top of the stairs; and I found a trunk there which I took to Bow-street; and the prisoner gave me the key; the prisoner had before that told me he had a trunk in that room, in the garret; I recollect now, Morant gave him the key, and he gave it to me.</p>

               <p>Court to Macmanus. Did you go to the trunk the same day, where he told you it was? - Immediately.</p>

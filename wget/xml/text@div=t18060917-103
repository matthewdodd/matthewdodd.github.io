               <p>Q. When did you lose your property. - A. On the 18th of August I went out about four o'clock in the morning to wash; I left the prisoner in my lodgings, I had taken her in to live with me, I had kept her in victuals and drink for almost three weeks; she had left her aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. You took her in because you believed her to be in distress. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the 18th of August did you come back. - A. About twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there when you returned. - A. No, she was gone with my clothes, she left me nothing but what I have on me now; I saw her again when she was in custody, and my clothes were on her back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave your mother a shilling for the tea caddy, I gave a shilling off the bed gown, and whatever I had to expend they partook of.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY sworn. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 28th of August; I found this gown on her back, and she had the stockings on, I believe, but the woman could not be sure; she acknowledged to the magistrate they were the prosecutrix' stockings; I produce the gown. I did not take her for this offence, I took her for six more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I pledged a light gown of mine to fetch this woman's out of pledge; I lent her a shilling to fetch some soap and candles; I was to give her a shilling for the tea caddy, the mother said this shilling will pay for the tea caddy; the bed gown I was to have for eighteen pence, I paid the mother a shilling off that to get some breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Did you give her permission to pawn your things. - A. I never gave her any permission.</p>

I am the wife of John Swetman—we keep a shop at Twickenham—I have known the prisoner about three weeks—on the 9th of November, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise in the passage—J went out and saw the prisoner in the yard—I re<lb></lb>turned to my shop, and in about five minutes, he came along the passage with some coal under his arm—he went out, I followed him, called after him, and said he had been stealing my coals—I requested him to bring them back—he did not—I went and took him by the arm, and told him if he did not put it down I would give him in charge—he said it was not mine, that he got it from the wharf—Mr. Lucas went by, and I asked him to give the prisoner in charge—he said he would not, and asked where my husband was—I said he was busy in-doors—he went for him, and while he was gone the prisoner threw the coal down, and said, "Take your coal"—he went away.</p>

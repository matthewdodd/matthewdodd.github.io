               <p>Mr. Garrow prisoner's counsel. Who gave it you? - I received it from an evidence that is in Court, one Mr. Payne; I know it perfectly well, by its being my cancelling; I am perfectly sure that is the draft I received, the draft was brought to me for payment; I asked the person that brought it, whether he chose to have it in bank or money? he said, half in bank and the rest in money.</p>
               <p>Court. These transactions are no evidence against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He paid that draft part in notes, and part in cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You talk of cancelling it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cancel with two strokes? - The others do; I make four strokes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing so peculiar in your manner of cancelling that you can venture to swear you paid this draft? - I have a copy of the entry taken by myself, an entry of the partners paid in bank notes; it is my province to pay the money, not the bank notes, the person who brought it, first said, he would have it in money, then he would have it in cash and notes; I am very positive this is the note that was given to me.</p>
               <p>Who has had the custody of it ever since? - It has been in the custody of the house ever since; it was delivered to Messrs. Hardcastle and Field, they found it to be a forgery, and we have had it in our custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - I deal in butter; I have known Powell five years; on the 3d of May last I met the prisoner on Snow-hill, about four in the afternoon, he asked me how I did, I told him, I was pretty well; he asked me to have a pint of beer; we had two pints of beer, he paid for one, and I for the other, then I was for going, he asked me which way I was going, I said to London-bridge; he said, he was going to Gray's-Inn-lane but would go back with me; in Newgate-street he asked me where I should be on Friday, if in the city or not, I said, I did not know but I should; I was there every day, he made answer that he had a sum of money to receive on Friday next, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310044"></xptr> banker's in Lombard-street, and he did not like to receive it himself, as he had a quarrel with the clerk, and if I would receive it myself, he would do as much for me; I told him I did not know any thing to the contrary, I would receive it to oblige him. The prisoner said, if you will, I will be much obliged to you, and where shall I see you on Friday, about eleven; I told him I would meet him at the Three Tuns in Upper Thames-street at eleven; I went there, and told the landlord that I expected Powell to meet me; he said he knew him very well; I desired a pint of beer, and I waited three quarters of an hours; I went away, he did not come; I went away, and called again about two; when I came, the prisoner was in the tap-room, sitting with his fellow-<rs id="t17860531-27-deflabel162" type="occupation">servant</rs>

Hardcastle and Field; I said, how do you do? he said, how do you do? I said, is this eleven o'clock! he begged my pardon, and said, if he had not waited out of the rain, he should have been at the time, but he had a good deal of way to come; then we both went out of the house; we came into Lombard-street, we went to the corner of George-yard; he went in there at No. 56, and enquired, and came out, and said it was a few doors lower down; we went to the corner of Birchin-lane; he said, this is the house; he then pulled his book out of his pocket, and gave me a draft for 450 l. 14 s. and I should have it half cash, and half bank; he took a bag out of his pocket to put the cash in; the draft I received from him was the same I paid in to Messrs. Bland and Co. I received two hundred and twenty pounds fourteen shillings in cash, and I received two hundred and thirty pounds in bank; and if the clerk should ask me who I came from, he told me to say a name which I have forgot, and if he asked me where they lived, he told me to say Whitechapel; then he told me he would wait there for me till I came out; I said, very well; I went into the banker's, and put down the draft on the counter; the clerk took it up, and looked at it, and he asked me how I liked to have it; I told him half cash, and half bank, if he pleased; then the bank was brought me in three different notes, and then I had the cash; I weighed some of the cash, and counted it over, and I picked out some that I thought were light, and they changed them for me; I spread the guineas, and weighed some of them, and then put them into this bag that he gave me, and tied it up, and came out; and when I came out, the prisoner was opposite, he came over to me, and asked me if I had got it; I told him, yes; he said, you have been a long while; I said, I have been weighing some of the guineas, and have had them changed; then we went to the Three Tons in Upper Thames-street, and desired a room to ourselves; the landlord's wife went up stairs, and the prisoner followed her, and I followed him into a room up stairs; the prisoner ordered sixpennyworth of brandy and water, and we sat down at the table, and I took out my pocket-book, and gave the prisoner the three bank notes; I pulled out the bag, and turned the cash on the table; the prisoner said, here is somebody coming, cover it over; I put the bag on the cash, and the prisoner took a pocket-book out of his pocket, and put it on likewise; the landlady brought the brandy and water, and went out; the prisoner counted the money, and found it right, he put it into the bag, and put it into his pocket; then he put his hand into his breeches-pocket, and took out a shilling, and laid it on the table; he said, Joe, there is a shilling, I am obliged to you; I said, Mr. Powell, I do not desire any such thing, I will not have it, and the shilling laid on the table a few minutes; I said, why do not you put the shilling in your pocket, and I gave it him, and he put it into his pocket.</p>

               <p>I went with Carpmeal.</p>
               <p>When you apprehended him, or in your road to London, did either of you tell him that if he would make a discovery, and pay what money he had, it would be better for him? - No, never; nothing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Any thing that could intimate to him that it would be better for him? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Did you at all, or did any body, to your knowledge, before he made the confession in Bow-street, give him any sort of hope of mercy? - Nobody, to my knowledge, in the world.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Powell, what have you to say in your defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, they told me a great many times, that if I could raise the money any way among my friends, if I had a hundred to apply to, they were come off in such a manner, nobody knew of it; and when we were coming to town on Sunday night, they said, we can lay about twenty miles off, and we shall come to town on Monday morning, and I should go and raise the money; instead of that, we came to Bow-street on Sunday night, and they took me to the Justice's; I was misled by them; I was innocent of the forgery, with respect to the writing, as a child.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have witnesses to his character, but I do not see it will be material; every body agrees that he bore an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to the confession, they took it down on Sunday night, when I came to town; they gave me a quart bottle of gin, which I drank myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Macmanus. Was the prisoner perfectly sober when his confession was taken? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge; he lay in the watch-house all night, and the confession was taken on Monday morning; he was sober when I came on Monday.</p>
               <p>Court to Carpmeal. When was the confession taken? - On Monday morning.</p>

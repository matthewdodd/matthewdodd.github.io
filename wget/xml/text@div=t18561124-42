                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Horne, trading under the firm of Benjamin Wortley Horne and another, in Wood-street. On 12th Nov., at 20 minutes before 6 o'clock, I was making up the parcels for the South-Western Railway; Sidey was calling the parcels over to me—a parcel was called by him and laid on the counter, addressed, "B. Fewtell, Halton, Hants"—it laid on the counter to be taken out by the book carrier—I did not see it taken away, but I miased it—before I missed it the book carrier called my attention—in about three minutes after I saw it on the counter—I went outside, and saw Harvey in custody of-two policemen, coming in a direction to the Cross Keys—I accused him of stealing a parcel from our premises—he made no reply with reference to the parcel, but said he would mark me and do for me, and he swore violently—I saw Brown, and in consequence of what I heard I gave him into custody—I had seen both the prisoners before about the premises.</p>

I was at the Cross Keys—I saw the parcel wrapped in this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the counter—I saw the prisoner Harvey standing, just going into the office—I saw his hand on the string of the parcel—I stood and watched him—he drew it towards him, and pulled it down alongside the counter—he leaned over it, and was asking something of one of the porters outside the counter—he then walked out, with the parcel in his hand—I stopped him, put my hand on his collar, and asked what he was going to do with that parcel—he said, "What do you want me for?"—I said, "Don't be in a hurry, you will see directly"—I called Mr. Underdown, he came out directly—Harvey made a strike at me, and got away—he did not bit me, he hit the post—he threw the parcel into the office, and he was knocked down by a carrier of the North-Western—he had just got outside when he threw the parcel in again—I had never seen either of the prisoners before—I did not see Brown before Harvey was taken in charge, it was just directly afterwards—Brown was about three yards off.</p>

I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners there on the evening of 12th Nov.—I recollect the time that Harvey was given into custody, it was about a quarter before 6 o'clock—I had seen the two prisoners for full an hour before, walking up and down—I saw them the best part of the time, as I had to come out of the office to see things placed in the vans, and I warned the policeman—I had seen them walking up and down on the preceding evening—on this evening I was calling the parcels over to go by the different railways—the office got crowded—I observed Harvey—he put his hand in his pocket, and asked me some questions—I referred him to the other end of the office—I heard Sherlock say, "Leave my parcels alone," and then he called out, and Mr. Underdown called, "Stop thief!"—I did not see this parcel on the counter, because my back was turned to it—as soon as I heard the cry I ran out, and I saw Brown walking round the mob that was collected outside round the man that was taken—I saw Harvey in custody of the policeman—Brown was four or five yards from him, at the corner of Goldsmith-street, with his hands in his pockets—I did not see the parcel before I saw it at the Man<lb></lb>sion House—when I saw Brown a few yards off, I said to the policeman, "You had better take this man into custody, he has been with him all the evening"—Brown must have heard it—he said he knew nothing at all of the man, he was merely walking up and down—I had seen them walking up and down on the evening before, for I dare say half an hour or three quar<lb></lb>ters, watching about—I saw them talking—I could not hear their conver<lb></lb>sation</p>

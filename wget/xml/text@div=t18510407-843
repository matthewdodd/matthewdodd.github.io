On 14th March I was in front of the bar, Robinson was inside; she passed a shilling to me over the bar, and asked if it was bad—I passed it to a gentleman I was talking to, and he said it was bad, and bent it—the prisoner then paid a good shilling, and received the change—the gentleman said she ought to be given in charge, and she threw the gin over him—I could not get an officer—the prisoner made a disturbance, and I let her go—on 28th March I was in the bar, and my attention was directed to the prisoner again by the barmaid, who gave me a shilling, and said it was bad—I looked at it, and said it was—I went to the door, and stood till the officer came—the prisoner said she had never been in the house before—I gave her in charge, and gave both the shillings to the policeman—I had kept the first shilling in my pocket—this is it—I marked it, and this is the second shilling.</p>

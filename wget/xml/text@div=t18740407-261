                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Baggs, an accountant, of 28, King Street—on 27th February, about 7.30 p.m., I was coming down the stairs and saw a man run out at the front door—I did not see his face—I went down to the basement and saw two piles of books ready for removal; most of them large ledgers belonging to Mr. Baggs, which he kept in the basement of the office—I went up and told Mr. Baggs, who told me to go down and lock up the place—when I got down the two piles of books were gone—I went into King Street and saw a barrow about 30 yards up the street with books on it—two men and a woman were with it, and when they saw me both the men ran away and left the woman on the path—the barrow was almost in the middle of the road—I could not see the men to identify them then—I fetched a constable, and when I came back I found the prisoner and the woman in Laurence Lane, and the barrow upset, and they were trying to put it right—the man I saw then was not the man I saw at the office-door—there were a good many carts about, and they dodged behind them—the door of the basement had been locked and they had burst it open.</p>

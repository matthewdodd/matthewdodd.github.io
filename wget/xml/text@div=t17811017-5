               <p>I am a bricklayer and plaisterer. The prisoner worked for me. I am repairing some houses for Mr. Mabberley, in <placeName id="t17811017-5-crimeloc21">Newtoner's-lane</placeName>

About a quarter past seven o'clock, within about sixteen yards of Newtoner's-lane, I saw the prisoner with something in his apron. I called to him, to know what he had got in his apron. He said, Wood. He ran back to the building as fast as he could. I followed him. I saw him near a cellar, and then he had nothing in his apron. We went to the place I had seen him at, and there we found 18 lb. of lead.</p>

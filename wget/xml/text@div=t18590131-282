               <p>door to me, and through her recommendation I took Stow into my service—she left on Easter Tuesday without notice, in a very sly manner—I made a search and missed some window curtains, a set of bed furniture, and other articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are some of them, but only a small part of what I lost—these were all in my possession when Stow was with me—they were all found in Mrs. Woodhouse's house, excepting this table, which she had sold, and this small lamp—I found the table at Mrs. Kennard's, next door to Mrs. Woodhouse's—I went there before I went to Mrs. Woodhouse's, and in consequence of something she told me, I went to Mrs. Woodhouse's, on a Tuesday, about three weeks ago, about 11th January—she came to the door and said, "Oh, what is it?"—I said, "I wish to speak to you, Mrs. Wood-house," and was going into the front room, where the curtains were—she said, "You shall not go into that room"—I said, "I will; this is the room I wish to go into"—I made rather a push to get in, and saw my rug and carpet and curtains—I said, "You wicked woman, this is quite sufficient to transport you; I hare lost many things, and where did you get that table you sold Mrs. Kennard?"—she said, "I got them all from <hi rend="italic">Lizzie's</hi> don't expose me, don't expose me; are they not better down in my house than in a rag and bone shop?"—I said, "I never intended them for a rag and bone shop; I am not in the habit of sending tables and carpets to rag and bone shops; Mrs. Kennard has paid you more for it"—she said nothing to that—the things had all been in <hi rend="italic">Lizzie</hi> bed room in several large boxes—I searched Woodhouse's house with an officer, and found my bed furniture between the bed and the mattress—I had never given any of them to <hi rend="italic">Lizzie,</hi> and she had no right whatever to take them—Mrs. Woodhouse lived next door to me all the time, and her family live there now—she and my servant were, I believe, very intimate.</p>

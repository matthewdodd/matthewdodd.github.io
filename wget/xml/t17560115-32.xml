               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Row. I had seen him once or twice before, I had liv'd in the house but ten days; the man that came with him said, after he had seen it, he would consider of it; and they went away: and within half an hour after, I miss'd my case of instruments, with the things mentioned in the indictment. I sent for the prisoner, he came again, and said he had found where the case of instruments were pawn'd for a guinea and a half, and if I wou'd give him that money, he'd go and fetch them for me. I gave him a guinea and half; he said, if they were not mine, he wou'd return me the money; he went and return'd the same day with them; then I sent for a constable to know how he came by them; after which, he gave me a guinea and two shillings again. We carried him before Justice Withers. I there swore to my instruments.</p>
               <p>Q. What said the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Row. He said nothing at all. The justice committed him.</p>

            . On the 17th of Dec. the prosecutor sent for me, I am constable: when I came, he shew'd me a case of instruments and said to the prisoner, how came you to do it? He said, he believed the devil was in him, and hoped Mr. Row would not prosecute him, saying he was very sorry for what he had done, and own'd he had taken them, divers times; and before the justice's clerk he own'd the same, though before the justice he wou'd not speak a word.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. At the time he gave you the money back, did you promise you wou'd not prosecute him?</p>
               <p>Row. No; I told him I wou'd prosecute him; he said, he hoped I wou'd not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I came into Mr. Row's house that day, he had given us a commission to get a person to take it; so I brought a man, we look'd over the house, and he seemed to like it; this case of instruments lay in a corner cup-board, which was open. I look'd in the case and found a pair of scissors; I took them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150030"></xptr> out and cut my nails, and after that went to put them down in a hurry, and put them in my pocket, and away I went with the man. Some time after Mr. Row sent to my lodgings for me: I went, and he told me he had lost a case of instruments; then I said, Don't you make yourself uneasy, for undoubtedly you will have them again. Said he, If I get them again I don't care what I pay for them, and nobody shall come into any trouble about them. I asked him if he would let me have a guinea and half, and said I thought I could get them out of pawn. He gave me a guinea and half, and said if I would bring them again I should not be hurt. I brought back the case at the hour appointed, and gave him a guinea and 2 s. back: then a soldier drew his sword in the room, and they secured me immediately. They carried me to justice Withers. I never owned any thing. I believe Mr. Row sent me word twenty times, that if I would but send him the 8 s. 6 d. due to him, he would not hurt me. He came once to the gaol, and gave me a shilling.</p>

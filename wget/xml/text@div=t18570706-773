                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of No. 232, Oxford Street. On 16th June, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came in—Rigi spoke English, and asked to look at some trowsers in the window—only one of them spoke to me, and I did not notice whether they spoke together, but I am sure they came in at the same time—while Rigi was looking at the trowsers I missed the other prisoner—my nephew made a communication to me, and a piece of cloth was shown to me which was my property, and which had been safe, I believe, that morning, though I had not noticed it in preference to other goods—here is a sample which I have brought.</p>

I was in the area on 16th June, between 9 and 10 in the morning, and saw the prisoners standing talking on the kerb of the pavement—I saw them go into the shop, and in about five minutes I saw Pallasano leave—I went into the shop and spoke to my uncle; I then pur<lb></lb>sued Pallasano and caught him ten or twelve yards from the shop—I could see a piece of cloth projecting from under his coat, with a ticket on it of the party that it was bought of—I touched him on the shoulder, and said that he was wanted at the shop—he said, "Want me!"—I said, "Yes, you have some of our cloth under your coat;" I pulled it, and he took fresh hold of it, before he could walk back with me into the shop—Mr. Barrow gave him into custody.</p>

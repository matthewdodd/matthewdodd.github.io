On the 9th of December last, I missed four pair of stockings out of my shop, one pair of black silk and three pair of cotton; they were my own property for sale. The prisoner was in my shop about six o'clock in the day, there were no other customers in the shop but the prisoner; she applied for some Guernsey frocks and some flannel shirts, and bought nothing; these stockings were at the lower part of the shop, I had just taken them out of the window a few minutes before, and the moment the prisoner went out of the shop I missed the stockings; I went directly after the prisoner, and could not find her. My boy went down the gateway two doors beyond my house, he there saw the prisoner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120006"></xptr>he brought her into the shop. The prisoner stood with her back to the counter, near to where the stockings had been taken and before the officer came I saw the prisoner place one pair of stockings upon the counter; I immediately put my hand upon them, they were quite warm. I opened them; they were dirty as if they had fallen in the street; that was a pair of cotton stockings. The officer came, and searched the prisoner; he found nothing more upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of all the stockings that you lost - A. Ten shillings; the pair of stockings that the prisoner put on the counter was eighteen pence.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Minton. On the 9th of December, I came into the shop before the prisoner went out, and directly she went out I ran after her; I found her up the gateway with a pair of stockings in her hand. I asked her where the stockings was; she seemed flurried, and did not answer; at last she said the other girl had got them. I brought her back to my master's shop; I went for an officer.</p>

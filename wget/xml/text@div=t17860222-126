P. There were six or seven shirts in his box, I will not swear they were my linen; amongst the halfpence, I found a button, a gingerbread nut, and a screw, which I believe were in the drawer when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>Who had you a character of him from? He lived with Mr. Burton, who kept the house when I took it of him; he then was out of place, and went and lived with Mr. Parker, at the Angel and Crown in Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he was seduced from that place? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you never hear that? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you will presently; he left your house with credit that time? - He used to get drunk sometimes.</p>
               <p>I ask you the question, did you, knowing him to be a drunken lad, give him a good character? - I gave him a character of being obliging and civil.</p>
               <p>Was he a servant at Ratcliff-cross at Dr. Horsefall's, when this robbery, as you call it, was committed? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not he seduced from that place by any part of your family? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Pray, before any talk or any pretence of the robbery or burglary, had you any quarrel with your wife? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Had you no jealousy concerning this young man? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>You have had no jealousy or suspicion? - No, Sir; because I never had any proof.</p>
               <p>Pray, did you never visit him in the Poultry Compter? - I went there once, by the desire of Mrs. Davis; she sent for me.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, in the Poultry Compter, tell him, if he would confess whether he had ever been great with your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220184"></xptr> wife, you would maintain him, and get him out of his troubles? - Never in my life, so help me, God!</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did you or not turn your wife away? - I say that, and insist upon it.</p>
               <p>You know Mrs. Davis? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was there, and her two daughters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And no such conversation passed? - I never was jealous of my wife.</p>
               <p>You think the parlour windows were down? - I am sure they were shut.</p>
               <p>Your servants might have lifted them up, for what you know; was there any appearance of force to the windows? - Not to my knowledge; he could not come into any other part of my house.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I have no other reason to think he got in any other way, my servants were all locked up that night.</p>
               <p>Who sent for the box? - I did not; I asked the prisoner, I said, John, how came you to rob me? says he, I do not know; says I, how did you get in? says he, at the parlour window; I had no reason to quarrel with him about it; the halfpence were taken out of the box by the constable.</p>
               <p>Do not you know how he came by them? - Upon my oath I do not.</p>
               <p>Might they not have been given him? - A great many things happen that we do not know of.</p>
               <p>Did not your wife leave you that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For what? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it not for quarrelling with the black? - I did not quarrel with him, we had no words at all.</p>
               <p>What did your wife leave you for? - For fear I should ill treat her; I cannot tell her reasons for it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, cannot you assign any reason for it, why she should be afraid of your ill using her? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Cannot you guess? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>You have treated her roughly before? - Yes; it is too hard a question for me to answer.</p>
               <p>You must give the Court an answer; what was the reason why your wife should think you would ill treat her that morning? - Because I had ill treated her before; I cannot answer that question, I cannot do it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever ill treat your wife, on account of this boy? - Never on his occasion, in my life.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - I have sworn it before.</p>
               <p>You dropped a word of his being let in the over-night? - I know nothing of it; I have received information from my wife that he was let in; I heard of his coming in over-night, I heard from my wife that he had been asking her to give him lodging; he had no place nor money, and she gave him permission to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Did not your wife tell you, that he was distressed for a lodging? - Not in the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>She had given him leave to come upon the premises? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not your wife tell you that she had ordered him to be let into the house, because of his distress? - She told me that she had given him leave to sleep in an out-house, she mentioned that at my Lord Mayor's the morning she was examined.</p>
               <p>Was it denied by your wife; was there not mentioned that th e halfpence were made a present, because he was out of bread? - No, Sir, my wife never gave him a farthing.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the maid say that this man was let in, by order of her mistress, into the house, or into the out-house? - Into the out-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Did not it come out before the Lord Mayor, that your wife had sent him money very frequently while he was at Mr. Parker's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was it not in evidence, that she had seduced him from that place? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did not you not, promise the young man to pay his expences, and get him safe out, if he would inform you how often he had familiarities with your wife? - No, Sir, so help me God!</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220185"></xptr>There were a good many people there? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say no harm should happen? - No, Sir, I never mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Jury. You talk of a back house? - Our house is a narrow house in front, and we have a way to come in through a neighbour's house; it was a place where he had an indulgence to sleep.</p>
               <p>Is it customary for your wife to go into the bar when she comes down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say the bar-door appeared to be wrenched open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not she give you notice of it? - She said so when I came down.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood by you, that it appeared to be wrenched open? - The bottom part of the door has a single lock, and the top part was forced from the bottom; there is a wrench in the bar-door now.</p>

               <p>I am wife to the last witness; I ordered the prisoner to be let in to sleep in one of the out houses, on the night the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Did your husband know that at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the condition of this house before you went to-bed on the Sunday night? - No, I cannot say I did; my husband ordered us to go to-bed, and he would see that every thing was fast; we all went before him.</p>
               <p>Did you come down first in the morning? - When I came down, the servants had been into the bar, and had served; it was open when I came down.</p>
               <p>Did you see them at the bar when you came down to the bar? - No, Sir; I knew they had been serving, by the money they gave me; I did not think there had been any robbery committed, as I had no occasion to go to the till; the bar-window which looks into the passage was bolted; I did not take notice whether all the windows were shut, I did not go into the parlour; the maid had cleaned the parlour before I went in; I did not see the till wrenched at all.</p>
               <p>Did no person in the bar shew you the bar, and tell you it was wrenched? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your husband tell you that the money had been taken out of the till? - No, not till he was sent for out; then he said he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>When had you last any communication with the till? - An hour before I went to-bed; my husband had the key of me to lock the door; I went to the till for what I wanted, but I cannot tell what money was in it, there were halfpence in it.</p>
               <p>How much do you think there were? - Two or three pounds worth there might be, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were they loose, or in papers? - Loose.</p>
               <p>Had any body that day the key, but you or your husband? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing besides money in the till? - No, without it was bits of ginger or chalk.</p>
               <p>Was there no screw there? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you never see a screw there? - There were screws and nails there; there was ginger and chalk.</p>
               <p>Did you see a button, or button stone there? - No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. When you came down in the morning, you found your servants had been serving in the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was no more than usual? - No.</p>
               <p>Who had the key in the morning? - They came into the room for the key; they had it from my husband.</p>

               <p>Do you swear that? - Before he was up.</p>
               <p>As for the window of the bar, that you found bolted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And as for the opening of the door, can you account for that? - I did not say the key of the bar, but the key of the cross door my husband gave to the servants.</p>
               <p>How did they open the bar-door? - By taking down the shutter.</p>
               <p>Then it opens of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no breaking or wrenching shewn to you? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, Mr. Granger came to me about eleven, and told me he had been robbed, he said, he had lost some brown paper off the shelf, and he believed he had got the thief; I went to the Three Kings, in the Minories, and there was the prisoner; I searched his coat pockets, and found a few halfpence, his waistcoat pockets, and breeches pockets were full of halfpence, his box was on the tap-room table, he said, it was his box, and I opened his box, and found a quantity of halfpence in a blue apron; some in papers and some loose, and I found this screw, and button, and stone, and a bit of ginger; I asked him how he came by them, he owned he had taken them from his master that morning, he told me, that at five in the morning he got in at the window, the people were talking to him.</p>
               <p>Did any of these people say any thing to to him? - I did hear the people say it would be better for him, and they said he had better say how it happened.</p>
               <p>Recollect whether some of these people did not tell him, it would be better for him if he did confess the whole truth? - Upon my word I cannot be sure, but I think they did.</p>
               <p>The halfpence shewn to the prosecutor: and the button and button stone, and other things deposed to.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you hear any person offer favour to him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood to Constable. What time did he come to you? - About eleven, Mr. Granger was present all the time, I was present with the prisoner, he did not attempt to make his escape, he did not appear drunk.</p>

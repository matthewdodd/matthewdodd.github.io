                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Shaw, linen-draper, High-street, Southwark—the prisoner was his cook. On the 18th of Oct., about ten o'clock at night, I went to the room occupied by myself—there is a spare bed in that room—as I went up stairs, I heard a rustling noise—I went into my room—there was no candle there, but I had one in my hand—I looked under the spare bed and saw the prisoner, and under the other bed I saw two parcels—I asked the prisoner who the first parcel belonged to—she said, to herself, and the other to Mrs. Cornelius—I opened the first parcel, and in it were three blankets, the property of my employer—I separated one of them from the other—it was one of a pair, of which I had sold one the day previous—in the other bundle I found fifty-three yards of calico, which was my employer's, and had his mark on—I then, with the officer, searched the prisoner's box, and found five cambric handkerchiefs, a length of lawn, and a piece or two of calico, which were my employer's, and had our private mark on them—these articles had not been sold—the prisoner was to have left on the Monday following.</p>

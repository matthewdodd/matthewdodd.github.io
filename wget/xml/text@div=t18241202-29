               <p>SAMUEL BALL. On the morning of the 8th of November, I saw the prisoner at the Ship, public-house, Charles-street, Westminster. I was in his company four or five hours, and then went with him to a lodging-house in <placeName id="t18241202-29-crimeloc157">Orchard-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18241202-29-crimeloc157" type="placeName" value="Orchard-street"></interp>

I put my clothes under the pillow; there were two sixpences, and a snuff-box in the pocket of the waistcoat, a handkerchief in my coat pocket, and my hat was on the shelf. I awoke about seven o'clock and he was gone, and my things also, except my coat and one of the tops of my boots - there were two men and their wives, and a child in the room - they were not there when we went to bed - the prisoner came again about five o'clock in the afternoon - I said, "What have you done with my clothes?" he said, he had taken them to my brother's in Smithfield. I have no brother in London - he then went to bed, and said, I should have them in the morning - he pulled my clothes off himself, and I called for the watchman and gave him in custody - when we got to the watch-house, he said, I should have my clothes in ten minutes if I would give him 5 s., which he had paid for what we eat and drank the day before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 9th of November, while I was crying half-past five o'clock - I was called by the prosecutor. I went to No. 66. Orchard-street. and took the prisoner there in bed - he got up and pulled the waistcoat off, and a pair of white stockings, which the prosecutor owned - he then said, the two sixpences were gone out of his pocket. I then said, he had better let him have his things - but, he said, he would be transported for life rather than let him have his things without he gave him 5 s., which he had expended upon him.</p>

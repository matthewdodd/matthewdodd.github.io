               <p>Smith. I was paid part in money, and a note; they came in all to 26 l. and 6 d. I have a note of hand for 6 l. 8 s. the prisoner at the bar paid all the money, saving the 6 l. 8 s. for which he gave a note of hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On the 21st of April Territt came to my house, and asked me if I would be so kind as to go to Mr. Smith, and get him to let me have the watches out for the use of him; I asked him why he could not go himself; he said, because there was a writ out against him, and he lived just by Mr. Pain; he said there were six of them; he gave me 19 l. 12 s. 6 d. and desired me to lay down the rest of the money; I said I could not, for I was going to Yorkshire, and should want money; he said, if he had not them out directly, he should lose the sale of them, the gentleman that was to have them was going abroad; I went to Mr. Smith, and desired him to let me have these six watches; Mr. Smith said, he believed Mr. Territt to be a very honest man; he brought them one at a time; they came to 22 l. and 6 d. I paid him 19 l. 12 s. 6 d. and desired him to trust me the rest a day or two; he said, if I thought proper, he would take my note; I gave him a note, and he delivered the watches to me, and I carried them to Territt's house, and delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When was your shop broke open?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was broke open in January last, and I advertised the watches above a month in all the papers, and handbills, describing them almost all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. How came you, when all this was done, not to make a discovery to Mr. Scott?</p>

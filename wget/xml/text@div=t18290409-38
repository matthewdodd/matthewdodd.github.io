               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He said they were some old clothes, or something of that sort? A. I understood him old clothes - I had been at a dance, and was returning home; I was not at all fresh - I believe the prisoner has eight children; he has borne a good character in my service - he appeared as a witness for me a Session or two ago, but he could not identify a horsecloth, which I indicted my ostler for stealing; he was in my service, but he did not know the cloth - I did not stop 8s. out of his wages on that occasion, to my knowledge; I believe I stopped 8s., and gave him the rest, because I considered he was in my service, and it was my time - he said I had no right to stop it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You stopped 8s., but that had nothing to do with the oats? A. No - he usually comes to work about half-past five o'clock; it is my own private mews, but the stables are let to different persons.</p>

I am a shipwright, of 13, Edward-street, Deptford—on Tuesday, 9th February, about half-past 2, I was at a ship launch in Deptford dockyard—I saw the prisoner standing on my left side for about half an hour, and while he was there I missed my watch, which I had seen safe about a quarter-past 2—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bow is broken; it was perfect before—I told a policeman.</p>

I am a detective police-sergeant attached to Deptford dockyard—on 9th February, I was there at the launch, and about half-past 2, when the ship went off, I saw the prisoner and three others come from the bows—I watched them, and afterwards received information that a watch had been stolen—I watched them again, and saw the prisoner leave the three others and make his way towards the gate—I went to him, stopped him, and said, "Where is that watch you have got?"—he said, "I have got no watch"—I rubbed him down, but could not find it—I called Turner, a policeman—I watched the other three, and returned to the prisoner, seeing him put his hand to his left pocket—I said, "What, are you going to throw it away; I will walk with you," and took him to the room at the gate, and in his right trousers pocket, I found this watch, with the bow broken—he said nothing then, but an hour after, when I took him to the station, he said he had picked it up.</p>

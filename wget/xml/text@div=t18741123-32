                  </hi>. I hold a chief mate's certificate—I joined the <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta</hi> at Akyab on 4th March—she was a British vessel sailing under the English flag and belonged to the port of Liverpool—the prisoner was the captain, Cook was the second mate, and there were two boys named Pyke and Mattison—those were the only Europeans, except the carpenter, who shipped at Calcutta and who was taken sick and did not come home in the vessel—there was a crew of about thirty-three Lascars who were engaged at Calcutta and taken across in a steamer to Akyab, a port in the Bay of Ben<lb></lb>gal—eighteen Englishmen would have been a sufficient crew for the vessel, but being Lascars we had thirty-three—she was 1,279 tons burden—we sailed from Akyab on 10th March—the crew appeared in good health at starting—Sheik Abdoolah was an able seaman, and in my opinion he was about the best on board the ship as regards seamanship—I did not see anything the matter with him when he first joined—I saw him every day—every man who was shipped to steer the vessel was incapable of doing so; those men are called <hi rend="italic">secunnies</hi>, which is equivalent to quarter-master in England—as not one of them was able to do the duty required, Sheik Abdoolah was put to the wheel—Abdul the <hi rend="italic">Serang</hi>, asked if there was a</p>

               <p>man on board who could steer—the <hi rend="italic">Serang</hi> is about the same as boatswain in a white crew; he spoke very little English—he recommended Abdoolah to be put to the wheel to steer about fourteen days or three weeks after leaving Akyab—Sheik Abdoolah could steer a little, but not very well, he did not know the English letters on the compass—when he had been at the wheel a few days he was ill and refused to go there when he was told by the chief mate—he said that he did not sign to do that duty, he was no <hi rend="italic">secunnie</hi>, and declined going there, and the captain called him up on the poop and made him go there; he hit him a slap with his hand and sent him aft in a hurry and he then went to the wheel and stopped there—the <hi rend="italic">secunnies</hi> for steering get more pay than the seamen—Sheik Abdoolah died in the beginning of June; I can't remember the date—I have seen the captain hit him over the head, arms, and legs with anything that be to hand, sometimes a rope's end and sometimes a piece of leather which used to be there, which came off a sail; it was about a fathom long, and I have seen him use a belaying pin several times—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—I have seen him strike him with it on the head and arm and on two occasions I have seen him strike him on the head with a belaying pin and the blood used to flow from the wound—that was three weeks or more before he died—he also struck him with the belaying pin on the left arm while he was at the wheel—it had no effect on his arm at the time, but the same arm was swollen at the time of his death from the wrist up to the shoulder—the captain frequently struck him with the leather about the shoulders and back—after the leather came off the sail it used to be used almost every day on the deceased while at the wheel—it was about a fathom long and four or five inches wide, it would be hard when it was dry and soft when it was damp—I saw nothing done to him before he was put to the wheel, nor was anything the matter with him, but shortly after he was put to the wheel his ears began to swell—he was at the wheel the day before his death, he was not able to steer very well, but he had to manage, and after he left the wheel he went and turned in—he was very weak at that time and he seemed to be delirious to me, he was in his bunk talking—the captain asked me where he was and I told him, and he told me I should get him out and send him to the wheel—he had been his time, four hours, so he was wanted to go to the wheel again—I said nothing to the captain then about his state, but I went to the deceased and found he was delirious, and I went and told the captain that the man was not right, he seemed to be delirious, but he said nothing—the second mate and me went in and the second mate told the man to come out, but he did not come; he was lying in his bunk in a weak state and would not come, the captain said that he would soon come and get him out, and he came inside and got the man out, and got hold of him and threw him out the door—he picked the man up and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> him out and he fell outside the door—the captain then got a belaying pin and gave him two or three blows about the back and then the man got up and walked aft to the wheel—I did not go after him and I don't know how he got on—he had to stop there till his watch was up, four hours; he had been four hours off, and he went on in the regular turn of duty—on the day of his death he was in the forecastle, the captain asked me where he was and told me to get him out—I went and found him lying in his berth, he seemed to be very-weak; he would not come out and the captain went and hauled him out, and told me to send him to work—he had been making a mat some time previously, and he told me to set him to work to finish</p>

               <p>it—that was about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, or half-past—he had not been at the wheel, I am certain, since 8 o'clock that morning—I sent him to make the mat, and left him there—he could not use his left arm, and said that he could not work at the mat—when the captain told him to make the mat, he said that he could not use one arm, and I left him there, sitting by the side of the mat; whether he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> anything I don't know, I walked away—I next saw him after I came out from dinner, about 1 o'clock, tied up to the windlass bit—the windlass is horizontal, and there is a hitch on each side, and round that the rope was tied and round the man's body and under his arms, and one of the crew was throwing water on him—he seemed to be insensible, and the captain told me to cast him adrift, which I did, and he slid down on the deck as I was slacking away the rope, and appeared senseless—he was alive—I left him on the deck, and as I left the captain said he thought the man had had opium—I said it would be well to leave. him alone for a couple of hours, and if he had any he would be all right after he had had a good sleep—I went about my work, and about an hour after, as I was working at the fore rigging, a man said that he was dead—he was lying at the end of a spar—I went and looked at him, and found he was dead, and stretched him along the spar—that was between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon—the captain was told the man was dead, and he told the second mate and me to carry him aft into the cabin—we did so, and stripped him, and rubbed his arms and legs to see if there was any life in him; but there was not, and we were told to take him on deck again—we did so, and the captain told some of the crew to comer and look at him—several of them did so, and he was then sewn up in canvas, and buried—when I rubbed him I noticed his left arm was swollen from the wrist to the shoulder, and the skin was up like a bladder; there was water underneath the blisters on his arm—his ears were rotten; they had been swollen for some time, and had burst open, and out of the wounds was discharging matter and blood—the crown of his head was completely rotten; it was a mass of matter; you could see a few ragged edges of skin—he had a wound under one of his eyes, which he had had for some time, and which had never healed from the time he first got it till he died, and at the time of his death it was discharging a little matter—I did not notice anything else<lb></lb>next day I said to the captain "I don't half like the way that man died"—he made no answer—I kept the log, and made an entry in it of the death of this man—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he died on Friday, June 5th, 1874—I made that entry on the day he died, and the captain saw it—this is it: "4 p.m., Abdoolah, a Lascar, died suddenly, his ears being festered for six weeks, and several other places about his head; mortifica<lb></lb>tion set in"—that was my opinion at the time—ten days before we got to Cork, the captain said that he would make an extract of the log he was keeping, and state the way that he and some more of the men died, and have them all sign it, in case there was any difficulty after he arrived in England, and that being a black crew he thought it was necessary to have it done—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was written and read out to the men—I was in the cabin at the time—the men were not all there, there were only two men and the captain and me, one used to interpret what the captain said to the other men—I mean that they came in one at a time and Khalee Khan was interpreter—the captain read what was on the paper and Khalee Khan put his name to it and if he could</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: Extract of official log of ship <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta</hi>, lat. 29-30 south, long. 40° 40' east. "At this time Sheik Abdoolah, Lascar, died from a disease bearing a close resemblance to that described by medical authority as erysipelas. He had never complained of sickness, and was at the wheel at 4 a.m. of the day of his death, and as usual eat his meals heartily. I had remarked his ears being sore looking and much swelled on his first arrival on board and had sent to the butler, who understands English well, to ask what was the matter with them; some time afterwards they seemed to get worse, and he said he did not know they were sore and it had come of itself. I cut one of them with a lance once, but nothing but black blood come out of it and in a few days it closed up as before. Though he never complained of sickness, I had compelled him to take opening medicine daily for about a week previous to this date, as any little sore he got never seemed to heal, but it was not until examining his body after death that we found the whole of the crown of his head was affected in a similar manner to his ears, the whole surface being apparently quite rotten and was spreading over his limbs and other parts of his body likewise. He was an inveterate opium eater and was caught several times under its influence, we supposed asleep on his feet, and at work asleep at the wheel once. The skin harassed from his face under the eye by the spoke of the wheel knocking against it two months before his death, and that small mark never healed up. He was an inveterate opium eater, and from the evidence of his shipmates his stock was just lately exhausted, which, while its use deadened his feelings of pain, must have fearfully aggravated his disease. He appeared to be under the influence of opium at bis death, for from noon, when called out of bed, he appeared just like a drunken man, sleepy and stupid, and lay down on a spar by the fore rigging, falling into a deep sleep, from which he never awoke, dying without a word, sign, or struggle, though nearly all the ship's company were working near him, setting up rigging at the time.—H. Walters, master; R. Shurtz, first mate; William Cooke, second ditto. The above has been entered in the official log book, and signed as customary, but being surrounded by a crew of Lascars, all of one nation and language, and manners different to my own, and holding the prejudices naturally arising from such, I had deemed it advisable and prudent that a kind of inquest should be held, examining the crew as to their knowledge of his sickness and the cause of his death, that each one may subscribe to his own evidence at once in the presence of one of their own class, who speaks English well, and acts as interpreter, and my officers who act as witnesses. The following men were questioned, and replied as follows': Abdool Rahoman—'I first met Sheik Abdoolah on board a steamboat coming from Calcutta to Akyab. I noticed his ears bad; one swelled up much when he first came on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Emily Augusta.</hi> He never told me he was sick. I saw him eat his meals every day, and always about the same quantity, until he died. I saw him after his death; his head was all rotten, and ears had little maggots in them. His head was always covered up before he died, and I did not notice it so before.' Ameboodee (<hi rend="italic">Lascar</hi>)—' I first saw Sheik Abdoolah on the passage at Akyab, and noticed his ear swelled up on board the steamboat. I asked him on board the boat what was the matter with his ears; he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230043"></xptr>
               <p>I don't know, I have pain in them, I can't tell what is the matter." On board he afterwards told me he was in Calcutta for two months before he came here, and had been treated with medicine by the doctor without any good effect, and he did not think he would ever get better. I saw him after death, and noticed the crown of his head and ears were all rotten. I did not notice the top of his head before, he always had it covered. I have heard the account of his death read over, and I think it right—Ameroody. <hi rend="smallCaps">AMEER KHAN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Lascar</hi>)—' I have heard the account of Abdoolah's death in the log book read over, and consider it quite correct I first saw Abdoolah on the steamboat coming to Akyab. I noticed one of his ears swelled up then, but did not speak to him. I spoke to him once about his ears on board the ship, but he gave no answer. I saw a mark on his face, which he said he got by nodding asleep at the wheel; the wheel turned round and struck him in the face. It was about six weeks before he died; it never got any better. I saw it when he was dead. I noticed his head; the crown of it was all rotten. I saw his ears before, but did not know his head was that way before his death; his head when he was alive was always covered up when I saw him. '<hi rend="smallCaps">ABDUL TINDAL</hi>:—'I first saw Sheik Abdoolah in the steamboat coming to Akyab. I noticed on board the steamboat his ear sore and swelled; on board the ship it got worse, and then the other one swelled up also. I asked him what was the matter with him, and he always said he did not know, it came of itself. I saw him when he was dead and his head on the top was rotten all over. I did not know it before; he never complained to me, and always had his head covered up when I saw him. I saw him when called out of bed after dinner (one o'clock); he was like a drunken man, first lay down on deck and would not get up, afterwards saw him get up and go to the spar and lie down and thought he had fallen asleep. I was working near him at the riggingall the time until we found him dead.—<hi rend="smallCaps">TINDAL' KHALLEE KHAN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Lascar</hi>).—'I did not know Sheik Abdoolah before I saw him in the steam-boat. I noticed one of his ears was swelled and sore, but did not speak to him until he came on board the ship; he then said he had been with sickness some time ashore and had used a lot of medicine, but could not get better, he had some black stuff he brought with him which he used to apply to his ears until it was used up and they got worse. I saw him eat his meals every day; he had breakfast the day he died. He gradually got his ears larger, and marks about his skin never healed up. I saw him when he was called at 1 o'clock, he had been below from 8 o'clock; when he came on deck he was like a drunken man staggering, and then lay down on deck and would not get up when spoken to. I saw him afterwards get up and go to the spar and lie down himself. I thought he had gone to sleep. Afterwards I found he did not move, and found him dead after an hour had passed. I saw his body after death; his head on the top was all rotten and maggots in his ear. I did not know his head was that way before, he always had his head covered up when I saw him. I lived in the same side of the forecastle as he did. I have heard all the evidence of the former witnesses, and have faithfully interpreted their answers in English. '<hi rend="smallCaps">DERRAN ALLER</hi>.' I first met Sheik Abdoolah on board the steamboat which was going to this ship at Akyab. I first noticed his ears swelled and sore on board the steamboat, and after he got here his both ears got worse all the time. I asked what was the matter with them; he said he did not know, he had been that way with sore ears a good while. I saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187411230044"></xptr>
               <p>him the day he died. When he was called after dinner, he came out of bed on deck; he was like a drunken man staggering about, and took no notice of what was said to him. He lay down on deck, and would not get up. We were setting up rigging, and he was in the way; after he got up himself, and lay down on a spar, and I thought he went to sleep. He was a great opium-eater, and took mine, and was buying all he could get from everyone. I saw him when he was dead, and saw the crown of his head was all rotten, and his leg and arm was getting bad. I never saw his head like that before, for it was always covered up with a cloth, and I did not hear him complain of it. I have heard the account of his death in the log-book read, and believe it to be quite true. <hi rend="smallCaps">DEBRAN ALIER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 2)—' I knew Sheik Abdoolah; I first saw him signing articles. I noticed his ear swelled and sore on board the steamboat. I asked him there what was the matter with them, and he said he did not know; he had had much pain in them for some time, about a fortnight, he said. After he got aboard this ship 1 noticed his two ears both get larger and worse every day. I saw the captain take him from the wheel below in the cabin once to cut his ear; he came back again to the wheel with something on his ear, or a white cloth, which the captain had given to him. When his opium was finished he complained of being sick, and after that he got more from the other men in the forecastle, and then he was satisfied. I was in the mizen rigging at work when the captain dressed his ear. I saw him when he was dead, but was in the rigging before that, when he was called out of the forecastle. I saw his head and ears was all rotten. I did not see his head like that before, as he always had it covered up with a cloth, and he never told me about it. I have heard the account of his death in the official log read and explained to me, and it is correct' <hi rend="smallCaps">MAHOMED</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Lascar</hi>)—'I first saw Sheik Abdoolah when signing articles. I noticed his ear sore and swelled when we first joined the ship. I asked him what was the matter with them, and he said he did not know, he had pain in them, and had them that way ashore for a good while a number of days, and they did not get better, but worse. I saw them getting worse every day I saw him "when he was dead; the crown of his head was all rotten, and his ears the same. I did not know of it before; he always had his head covered with a cloth when I saw him on deck or below. 'I have heard the account of his death written in this paper, and I believe it is quite correct.' <hi rend="smallCaps">CUDIR</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Lascar</hi>)—'I knew Sheik Abdoolah about a month ashore before he joined his ship. I noticed his ears sure and swelled for about three weeks before he joined this ship, and asked what was the matter with them; he said he did not know, he had been to a doctor and bought medicine, but the pain in them was only getting worse. I know he eat a deal of opium, and his ears got worse every day on board. I saw his head about three weeks before he died, and it was swelled, like a soft lump on the crown, and afterwards broke, and rotten when he died. When signing articles, he said to me I am going to sea, but I do not think I will live. I have heard the account of his death read over and explained to me, and I believe it to be true.'

The deceased always wore a turban or a cloth round his head—I never saw him without it for any length of time—I never noticed his head bare—I did not notice that his ears were bad till about fourteen days after he was sent to the wheel—he was sent to the wheel about three weeks after we left—the upper part of both ears. swelled first, not the lobes—he said that they were hurting, him—he was not a confirmed opium eater to my knowledge, but I was told that he used it—I heard some one say that the crew had opium—I cannot tell whether the deceased was under the influence of opium on the day of his death, but I thought he might have had some—the men were called in and requested to make a statement—the captain said something to the interpreter, who said it to the men—I cannot tell now after so many months what the captain desired him to say to them—he did not tell the interpreter to ask each man as he came forward to give his account of the death of Abdoolah, they were asked whether they had known Abdoolah before and whether they had seen him before—I can remember that, and that they were asked further whether they had seen his ears sore while on board the steamboat—those are the only questions I recollect—the answers were put down—I not see the deceased get a blow on the eye from the wheel, but it was spoken of in the ship—it inflicted an injury which did not heal—that was supposed, to be the cut and I saw the marks under his eye—it was not festered, but there was a discharge from it; I never went near enough to examine it with any minuteness—he was filthily dirty in his person, there were constant complaints about his dirt, because his ears were discharging and running all over his garments and ha always used to be in a mess—I do not know whether he had had opium or not, but I have seen him asleep at the wheel—there used to be three at a time taking the wheel—the boy Pyke could steer and so could Cassbar one of the <hi rend="italic">secunnies</hi>—we had taken steersmen on board and it turned out that one was an old man who could not do anything, and the other knew nothing about it—Abdoolah did not know much about it, but he could just manage, and after he had been there a couple of weeks he got better—I joined at Akyab, but I heard that the ship had come from Bahia—I only know what I have heard, that they were discharging cargo at Akyab—I had never sailed with Lascars before—there was a <hi rend="italic">Serang</hi> on board to govern them—I complained at the latter part of the <hi rend="italic">Scrang</hi> having no con<lb></lb>trol over them, but the first week or two we <hi rend="italic">done</hi> very well, while it was fine weather; after that we got on very badly—Tindal, one of the Lascars, assaulted the <hi rend="italic">Sevang</hi>—we got wet and squally weather after leaving the Mauritius and then the men began to feel the influence of the climate and the cold—I had a great deal of trouble sometimes to get them along, I could always get them along somehow, sometimes by words, and sometimes I used to take a reef point and help them along—that is what you call a rope's end—I found that that assisted their movements, I could always get them along then—I found that I could not get them along without; it was an absolute necessity, I could not do without it, or else I would not have used it—I did not use a capstan bar and strike a man on the head with it, or a belaying pin—I have been accused of doing so by one of the Lascars, it is entirely a</p>

               <p>falsehood; I never raised a belaying pin or a capstan bar to anyone on board the ship or struck a man on the belly—I know one of the Lascars said so, and I have made it a point to question the other witnesses whether they ever saw me do it and they deny it—I do not know whether the captain's arm was broken when Sheik Abdoolah died, but it was bandaged up and he said it was bad—I cannot recollect whether it was the right arm or in what way it was injured—I went down to the prisoner's wife with the second mate and remember his saying something but I cannot recollect what it was—I was charged originally, and was in the dock with the captain four or five times at the Police Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was Fugeer Ali who used a capstan bar, the man who died over here—his dying statement was read over to me at his bedside—the captain sat in the cabin, writing down the men's statements at the time I speak of.</p>

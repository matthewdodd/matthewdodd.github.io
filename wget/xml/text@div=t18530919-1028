                  </hi>. I am a farmer. I am lodging at the Spread Eagle Tavern, Greenwich. I rent some ground at Westbourne-park, Blackheath—the prisoner occupied a lodge there, belonging to the estate—I had a room there for my use, where I was in the habit of leaving some clothes—I left there two carpet bags and a packing case, containing wearing apparel and a hamper containing wine and liquor—on Sunday, 11th Sept., I went there about 7 o'clock in the morning—I found that my packing case had been opened, and re-sewn with a thread—I missed from it a travelling cloak, a great coat, two waistcoats, and a pair of trowsers, which had been lying outside the packing case—there was a snuffbox in the pocket of the great coat—I had left the things all safe on Saturday evening, at 7 o'clock—the prisoner was there that Saturday evening—he came from his employ at the time I left—he was intoxicated—after missing the things on Sunday morning, I re-packed the package, and left the lodge—I returned at 3 o'clock, and then found the prisoner standing in the middle of my room, over the hamper, with a quart bottle of Hollands in his hand—he was intoxicated—the hamper had contained one quart bottle of Hollands and live pint bottles of port—I examined the hamper, and missed the five bottles of port and the Hollands, which he had in his hand—I then asked him what he was about; he said he did not know what he was about—he fetched me two pint bottles to put into the hamper, and asked if I wanted any more—I said, "Yes," be knew there was more—he was so very bad I could not be angry with him—I have never seen the other three bottles—about half of the bottle of Hollands was left; I have never seen the other half—I told the prisoner I had lost some things, but he seemed in a sort of stupor, as if he did not know what he was about—the hamper was secured with a proper hamper cord—I gave information to the police on the Monday evening, and the prisoner was apprehended on the Tuesday—he went away—his wife endeavoured to find the things.</p>

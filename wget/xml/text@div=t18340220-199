I am a sadler, and live in Milton-street - on the 18th of January, the prisoner brought me a saddle-tree for sale, and asked 1s. 6d. for it - I asked him how he came by it, as I knew he was Mr. Reynolds's, the undertaker's servant - he said he had lived with his master a long time - I bought the saddle of him, and afterwards sent for his master, and found out the owner.</p>

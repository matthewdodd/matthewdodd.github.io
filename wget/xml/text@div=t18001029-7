               <p>Q. Which of them did that? - A. It was the elder Williams, that was the active hero, he took my watch; he then said, I require your pocket-book, sir; I told them I had no pocket-book; they searched me, but not finding a pocket-book, they took from my waistcoat pocket, a pair of spectacles, in a case, which I now hold in my hand, then they let me go; my horse's head being pointed to Highgate, and they going the reverse way, towards London; but before they had got twenty yards from me, they broke into the fields, on that side of the lane, which adjoins to Holloway; immediately as I observed this, before I had time to run round,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290008"></xptr>a gentleman's servant came riding as hard as he could ride; with some difficulty I stopped him, he agreed to assist me, and we leaped our horses over into the fields where they were; I pointed out to him the two men a little before us; I then began to holloa after them as footpads, crying stop thief; upon hearing my voice, they turned round with their faces, and began to run; the young man on horseback and I, pursued them, but we did not get quite up to them till they got over the hedge of the next field; in the next field I got up to them, and got rather before them with my horse; I told them they had robbed me, and I would take them; they drew their pistols, and pointed them at me, and bid me keep off, or they would shoot me; I told them, I did not regard their threats, they might depend upon it I never would leave them till I had taken them, they then holding their pistols to me, and the young man, with me, broke away into an adjoining field,still we followed; then they run and got into the third field, and there we got the assistance of some men that were making of hay; we kept on pursuing them, and in the third field, at the end of it, they were pressed so close, that they fired a pistol, I was a very little way off, and they were in the hedge, but which fired it I do not know; after this pistol was fired, I saw clearly that they were desperate men, and that there would be no taking them without some fire-arms; I desired the people round to go to Holloway, or some place near, and get some fire-arms, some of the men that had come up to us, and we kept them at bay for some time, backwards and forwards, and in different parts of the field, and as frequently as I pressed upon them, they levelled their pistols at me; they then crossed the lane into the fields, leading to Kentish-town; at last there appeared a man at the top of the hill, with a gun; I cried out loudly, here is a gun, give it me, and I will blow their heads off; upon their feeling the gun, they laid down three pistols, and surrendered themselves; I had them tied together with a handkerchief, and they were searched by the people that got about me, but no part of my property was found upon them; I then took them to Bow-street early the next morning; I got up and went to the fields where this bustle had happened, a boy had picked up the spectacles and case, which I received from the boy's father, his name is Thomas Watson.</p>

               <p>Q. Are those the spectacles of which you were robbed? - A. They are positively the spectacles, I have had them many years.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you positively sure that the two men who robbed you, were the same that you afterwards found in the fields? - A. I am very positive that they are the same men; I never lost sight of them, but while they were getting from one field to another.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. There were several persons collected? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long a space of time do you think might elapse before you saw the servant? - A. I can scarcely think it was one minute.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is the field where you took them, from where you were robbed? - A. I should suppose the fifth field.</p>

               <p>Q. There are hedges which divide each field? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The persons who committed the robbery had got over one hedge before you began to pursue? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. There were five hedges-do you mean to say that you always had a constant view of the prisoners? - A. Allowing for the time of getting over the hedges.</p>

               <p>Q. None of your property was found upon them? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you at all say in what direction the pistol was fired? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I was riding down Maiden-lane, towards Battle-bridge; I met Mr. Hodgson; he told me he had that moment been robbed by two thieves; he turned back; we went in pursuit of them; I immediately saw two men going across under the hedge; I asked him if those were the men; the one had a black, and the other a brown coat on; I leaped my horse over the hedge, and holloaed, stop thief, upon which Mr. Hodgson followed me, and they began to run; they had their hands in their pockets, in this way, (describing it), to hold the weight of the pistols up; they ran across the field, and after that field they had to cross a little lane; I leaped the horse over the hedge, and then I was in the same field that they were again; then they presented each a brace of pistols, one in each hand.</p>

               <p> Mr. Hodgson. He is certainly right in correcting that they had two brace of pistols. White. They asked me if they had hurt me; I told them, no, they had not; I said, I know that very well, but you have robbed that gentleman of his watch and money; they told me; if I did not leave them, they would shoot me; I told them, they might depend upon it I would follow them; if they did shoot me, they could not shoot that gentleman; in going over the third field hedge, one of them fired a pistol, but which way the pistol was directed. I cannot say, for I was paying attention to my horse to leap the hedge; in the next field there were some farmering men came up and surrounded them; they threatened, that the first man that touched them they would shoot him; they swore they would not suffer themselves to be taken; they got out of that field into another, they were crossing a little narrow lane, upon which one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290009"></xptr>them that was going up the furthermost hedge from me, fired another pistol, but I did not see the direction of it; a little time after that they surrendered themselves, and put down their pistols; there were only three pistols then: they were secured, and we took them to Bow-street.</p>



               <p>Q. Are you sure that the men that you pursued till they surrendered themselves, were the same that Mr.Hodgson first pointed out to you? - A. I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. This was about noon day? - A. Yes, as far as I can guess, I had no watch with me.</p>

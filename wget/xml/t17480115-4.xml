             at any time do to you?</p>
               <p>Upington. My mother sent me with two shillings to get a gown which Mrs. Moody had to make, but the gown was not done, it being holiday time, and she told me I must wait.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Upington. Last Monday was sevennight *. I went to one Mrs. Crew's, and Mrs. Crew locked the door.</p>
               <p> * This does not agree with the indictment, for it must be Monday fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Upington. Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>
               <p>Upington. She took the two shillings from me, out of the corner of a handkerchief where it was tied up; then she went to a chandler's shop, and bought tea and sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring the tea and sugar to the house?</p>
               <p>Upington. Yes; then she had two pots of beer and a pint of gin; after that she pushed me into a chamber with a boy, and went to put the boy to lie with me; he could not have his will of me that way, and he put his finger up my body.</p>
               <p>Q. What boy was that?</p>
               <p>Upington. One Dick that lives at Kingsland. After that

               <p>Q. What did Crew do to you?</p>
               <p>Upington. She clapped one of her knees against my arm, and put her hand upon my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first complain of this matter?</p>
               <p>Upington. The very same week it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in Crew's house afterwards?</p>
               <p>Upington. About half a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you immediately go home after that?</p>
               <p>Upington. There came a woman to Mrs. Crew's to ask about the coals that were given away, and so I got out, or else I had not got away at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get home?</p>
               <p>Upington. Sir, it was one o'clock in the day.</p>

               <p>Upington. I did not say any thing to her then.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to acquaint your mother with it then?</p>
               <p>Upington. Because I was afraid my mother would beat me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any complaint to your mother?</p>
               <p>Upington. I did not make any complaint at all; but my mother asked me what was become of the two shillings, and that if I did not tell her, she said she would beat me, so then I told her the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this that you told her the whole of it?</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know further about the matter?</p>
               <p>Upington. I inquired after the two shillings, and that brought all out, for then she owned she had been abused. When she had discovered this, I got two of my neighbours ,

            , to go with me to a midwife to examine her.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the midwife here?</p>
               <p>Upington. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition did you find her in?</p>
               <p>Upington. I found she had been entered about half the length of my finger, and I don't know but she may have the foul distemper. The boy did put his hand, as she says, up her coats, but she was too many for him; and that the Prisoner said, after the boy was gone, he would lie with her; and that Mrs. Crew held her down upon a wad of straw, for they have nothing but straw to lie upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she was consenting to it, or that it was done against her will.</p>
               <p>Upington. She said she cried out, and that Mrs. Crew stopped her mouth; she always said so from the beginning to the ending.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon the Friday that you examined her body?</p>
               <p>Upington. It was upon the last Friday past.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that on the Monday after Christmas-day you sent your daughter with the money, and the time you examined her body was last Friday, which is also a fortnight's difference ; did you see any thing upon your daughter's linen that gave you any suspicion of that kind?</p>
               <p>Upington. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the girl give you any account of the matter?</p>
               <p>Scott. She said the same as she has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her body?</p>
               <p>Scott. Yes, and she was very sore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, upon examining her body, think that she had been abused by any man?</p>
               <p>Scott. Yes, Sir, we did, and that was the reason of our going to a midwife.</p>

            . I am the officer that apprehended the Prisoner. I know nothing else of the Affair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . I never exchanged a word with her in my life , nor never saw her; she was not there all that day, and if I had seen her a thousand times I should not have known her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moffat, a surgeon, happened to be in court, and was desired to give his opinion in this case .</p>
               <p>Q. to Moffat . You have heard the age of the girl, that she is above twelve years; she says no blood was drawn, and she was entered, as her mother says, about half the length of her finger, I desire your opinion.</p>
               <p>Moffat. Suppose a man to be extremely small, it may be, but if a man is full made, it is impossible to do it without there being a considerable quantity of blood.</p>

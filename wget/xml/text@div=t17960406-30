               <p>I am servant to Mr. Baird: On the 18th of February, I went out for some tea, and left my fellow servant, William White, in care of the kitchen; I shut the kitchen door, with a spring lock, and the scullery door with a latch; when I came back, I found the scullery door open, that opens into the kitchen, and the kitchen door shut; and the area steps door was open; we suppose he came down those steps.</p>

            Is there any outer door from the scullery to the area? - A. Yes; I left that shut, and found it open; when I came into the kitchen, I shut the door after me again; I then saw that man come from the laundry door, at the back part of the house; he told me, he had come of an errand; I asked him a second and a third time, what he did there; he said, what did it signify to me what errand he came on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him? - A. No; I placed myself against the kitchen door, and told him he should not go without telling what errand he came on; and he told me, I might kiss his a-e; he went up stairs, and dropped two aprons of mine; they are not worth much; they are only sit for wiping candlesticks with; they are not worth above sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me drop them? - A. No; it was too dark; I was the last person that went down, and he the first that went up; and there was nothing upon the steps when I came down.</p>

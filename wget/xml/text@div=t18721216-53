I am assistant to Mr. Wells, cheesemonger, of 440, Oxford Street—on 23rd November, the prisoner came in for some cheese; he tendered a florin, which John Herwood, another assistant, broke, and kept one piece, and I kept the other, and they were afterwards given to Police-constable C 132—I went outside and saw Mr. Heitmuller, who charged the prisoner—I also charged him.</p>

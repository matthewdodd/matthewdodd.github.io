We were stationed at Thanet watch-house, about five miles west of Londoness light-house. I had the charge of the watch on land at the Thanet watch-house.

               <p>Q. What does that mean - A. To go straight by land, instead of going by the coast, to intercept any smugglers they might fall in with.

            , two of our party, near Harvey's watch-house, and cut inland. Motts and Treader accompanied me to the spot where I had seen the flash, towards the north. On our reaching the spot where I cut in, I observed a large body of men apparently covering another body, who were retreating inland - and at the same time a volley of musquetry was fired from this body of men. Before they fired I called to them to stop - they answered by firing. We laid down to avoid the fire, and could hear the balls pass over our heads. Several guns were fired, I am certain. We were at that time about 200 yards from the sea.</p>
               <p>Q. After the musquetry was fired at you, did you fire your pistol - A. Yes, I did. After our firing the two pistols I mentioned, I fired a third, to extend the alarm, and in a short interval called to them to stop - and then they fired. They then proceeded in a direct line from the sea. I and the two men with me followed them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what direction did you fire, towards the noise, or how - A. I really cannot recollect, I only fired to give the alarm - not at them - my pistol would not reach them. We pursued, and from time to time fired our pistols, to extend the alarm and at one time we aimed at the party, but could never get near enough, for they kept up a continual fire. The wind was about north, and that was the direction they fired, that would enable me better to hear their steps - and at one time we heard them talk very plainly. In the course of our pursuit we were joined by Mr. Jones, an Admiralty midshipman, of the Severn, and four or five men with him, belonging to the Severn. We all pursued the party, and kept them in sight - they were not out of sight at that time. We fired at them, but we had only pistols, and could not take a direct aim with them - and we wanted to take them, but their numbers were so great, and they kept up a continual fire. There was a very large body of them - I should suppose between two and three hundred men.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean both parties were of that number - A. Yes; I should suppose the covering party were nearly one hundred men.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your pursuit, when the smugglers fired, were any of your party wounded - A. Yes; one Crockford. Digby had joined us. I was at the head of my men, and did not know that any were wounded, till after the conflict. I then found

Digby and Mackenzle, and several men, and our party then consisted of twenty-four or twenty-five. We pursued the party to Scotley-cut farm, which is a great distance from Lidd. The smugglers halted there, and fired on our party. We laid down to avoid the fire, and heard the balls or slugs passing round. They halted, and formed a direct line, at the time we were laying down, and fired a quick fire, one after the other - and at that time I heard some of them complain of being short of ammunition. After firing they retreated - we pursued, and heard their voices - we afterwards laid down for nearly ten minutes. We fancied we heard them again - we heard a great shouting - the moon was under a cloud, and we thought they would lay in ambush for us. We afterwards pursued them for two miles or more - we were in the marshes, and obliged to pass through all the ditches. We then came up to a farm where one Lee lived - in consequence of information we received there, we got into a public road. I there saw two men, on the left side of the road, apparently with muskets presented at us - it was rather dark then, it might be nearly five o'clock - we were close to them - I am certain they had muskets in their hands, apparently presented - we ran after them to catch them, but they escaped. In the course of the pursuit, several muskets were fired at us. I observed the man nearest to me run into a field, near the body of men. The men among whom he ran were firing from a field on the left hand side of the road. I saw five or seven men on the right side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was disguised - A. I was dressed in a white Guernsey frock and thick blue Flushing trowsers. I stood near our party, and one of the men on the right ran down to me, and shoved a musket into my hand - he appeared much agitated, and said twice</p>
               <p>"Shoot the ***," very quick. I seized him by the frock, and gave the musket in charge of

            , who was close to me. The man was going to make a noise at the time, and my party being all round me, I gave him to them - it was the prisoner Quested. In the confusion our parties divided - there was at this time firing from both sides of the road, right and left. I endeavoured to join Messrs. Digby and Mackenzie, who had charge of Quested - I had been separated from them. I mistook the armed party of smugglers for my own party, and was walking towards them. They called out</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" I fired off my pistol for assistance, and then a volley of muskets were fired at me. One ball came in contact with the metal button on the waistband of my trowsers - it broke the button, drove it through my trowsers, cut my skin, and I fell. A ball came through my frock, and grazed the skin of my left shoulder. I was knocked down by the ball that struck me on my stomach, and as I fell they called out,</p>
               <p>"There the d - d *** drops; there he drops." It was said exultingly. They fancied fancied they had shot me. I got up almost immediately, and succeeded in joining Mr. Jones, and some men who were with him, and we laid down to conceal ourselves till day-light was coming on. In about an hour, on day-light coming, I saw two men - one of them had two tubs on his back - we ran after him, he dropped the tubs, and escaped towards Brockland, and was followed by Mr. Jones and some of his men. The other, who had no tubs, took the direction towards Lee's, and I followed him, but he escaped. He got into Lee's house. I afterwards found the body of a dead man of their party. I sent for a cart, to take the body and the two tubs away, which had been picked up. We could not get one.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you meet with any other party of smugglers - A. Yes; about twenty - some on foot, and some on horses, came out of Brockland. Three or four of them were armed with muskets - this was about eight o'clock in the morning. As we were waiting at Lee's house for the cart, one man rode to us and challenged us to fight. The rest of the party were standing near where I found the dead body. A gun was fired at us as one of our men, named Holt, who I sent to make enquiry, was returning, he appeared to have mistaken these men for us - and on discovering his mistake, he ran away, and a gun was fired at him.</p>
               <p>Q. A man ran towards you - A. Yes; apparently to ascertain our strength. He challenged us to fight, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come along, we will see what we can make of you." Our ammunition was wholly expended then - we had two pistols, loaded, and two cartridges, that was all that was left. I, Jones, and the party, retired to a watch-house called Jew's-gut. We took the five tubs with us, which had been seized - they were given in charge of Mr. Digby. I could tell by their smell that they contained either spirits of gin or brandy, much above proof.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The third shot you fired was at them, and before they fired at you. A. I cannot say. I took no aim. When the two first pistols were fired, it was merely for alarm. I could not see the smugglers. I very likely fired the third in a direction towards them. I am certain Quested is the man who gave me the musket. I never doubted about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no tubs for an hour after you yourself had been wounded - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I believe it was about two o'clock when you first saw cause for alarm - A. I think it was about half-past. At that time I was on the beach. The firing took up aconsiderable time. I dare say Lee's house is about five miles from the beach. It took some time to get through the marshes. We walked quickly - I dare say it might take us two hours. The party came out of Brockland after day-light, about eight o'clock in the morning - we were then about five miles from the coast. Lee's farm is about a mile from Brockland.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this plan, and say if it is correct - A. It does not appear correct.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this, is it correct - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was the latest firing from the smugglers - A. I think the conflict took place about five o'clock I merely go by the moon. We were then near Lee's house, about a mile from Brockland.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went up this marshy way towards Lee's farm. You followed the smugglers' noise, and therefore supposed they went that road - A. They were north, and we went in that direction. We supposed we were following their steps, as we frequently heard them.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. Q. About what time did you see the two men, one of whom had the tubs - A. Daylight had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110039"></xptr>broken, it might be about seven o'clock. I saw the party come from Brockland about eight o'clock.</p>

            , a seaman, was in company with us. I observed a considerable deal of firing, still going inland. It was further east. Proceeding inland, about a mile and a half, I perceived the firing did not proceed from pistols - I supposed it to be musket shots, from the report, it was not pistols. I used the Lidd-road as my guide, and heard distinctly a company of men using the most opprobious and disgraceful language, to excite others of their gang to fire on the blockade party. There was a considerable firing on both sides. I fancy the firing of our party was for the purpose of strengthening the alarm. I joined Mr. Newton and Mr. Jones, and their party. Mr. Mackenzie was with me. Our force then consisted of about twenty-five. We followed the smugglers. I should think there was two or three hundred, or two hundred and fifty. There was a cart with them. I observed cart wheels.</p>
               <p>Q. As you approached, did they fire on you - A. They halted, and exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Come on." We collected our men together, and halted - while we were doing this they fired on us, and wounded W. Crockford, and I was wounded in the belly, only skin deep - it went along, about four inches.

             were also wounded. We laid down about ten minutes, to avoid their fire, and they retreated and stopped firing. we got up and went after them. They halted again at Scotney-cut.</p>

             was wounded there in the arm and legs - we laid down and received their fire for about ten minutes. They again retreated, we followed - and I believe, from the road we took, that they retreated by a private cart road, through all the marshes; we at times heard them, and proceeded in the direction of the voices, and came out in the public road, between Lidd and Rye, about a quarter of a mile east of a finger post, pointing to the Romney, Lidd and Rye roads, and not knowing our position, we obtained information from a house where we were. I supposed the smugglers to be going towards Brockland; we proceeded that way - Lee's house was in our way there. About half a mile on the east side of Lee's house I perceived a man on the road, with a musket in his hand, holding it downwards - he saw me - we were a head of our own men, and we all (I and four others), pursued him, supposing him to be one of the gang. I got ahead of them all, overtook the man, and collared him; at this time men were rising both on my right and left, flashing and shouting - two or three muskets were discharged, the balls of which passed me on my left. A scuffle ensued between this man and me, he extricated himself from me, and endeavoured to get the muzzle of his musket to my body, but I pushed him off, and discharged a pistol at him. I perceived four or six men about eight yards on my right from me, with muskets in their hands, apparently in confusion, one of the four or six men, which was Quested, came from them, and I saw him go into custody of Mr. Newton - he was taken by Mr. Newton. I now heard Mr. Mackenzie calling to me to come and assist him. I went, and observed him in contact with a tall man, with a musket in his hand, I went, wrenched the musket out of the smuggler's hand - we each laid hold of his hands - and hauled him away, when a musket ball or balls shot our prisoner (the smuggler), and Mr. Mackenzie; they both fell at the same time. I know it was a musket ball that shot Mr. Mackenzie - he died the midnight following.</p>
               <p>Q. The man died immediately - A. Mr, Mackenzie just said to him</p>
               <p>"You are shamming;" and he just had life to say No, and died, I believe, for I left him there. At this time there were bodies of men in the field on each side of the road, firing - the fields are divided from the road there by a ditch. My own party at this time were both behind and before me. Mr. Mackenzie was fainting, I caught him in my arms, and supported him, eastward, about two hundred yards, then left him to fetch men to his assistance, to carry him off the field, as I could only carry him upright myself. I pursued eastward, and saw Quested in the custody of James Hill, a seaman; Hill said he was stubborn, and we each laid hold of his collar; he had not been out of custody since. I am sure he is the man. Perceiving that he was intoxicated, he had been drinking by the smell of his breath, I thought a ducking would do him good. I threw him across a ditch, and went down to the watch-house at Jew's-gut. I afterwards examined his person, and took some swan shot from his trowsers pocket - it was but a few grains - it appeared that his pockets had been emptied, for they were black. I also found a fowling-piece flint on him. On arriving at the watch-house I found the prisoner, Wraight, there - it was between seven and eight o'clock, and was daylight.

             and Nicholl had him in custody. On searching him I found a knife in his pocket, the crevices of which between the blades were full of wet powder. I took a quantity of wet powder out of his pocket - it was not so wet but what it would burn - he was wet himself. I also took about a charge of shot from him, but no pistols or arms; his hands and face were black with gunpowder, down the right side of his mouth or chin; the inside of his pockets were also black with gunpowder; I might almost say plaistered with it. I saw Mr. Wood, the surgeon, put his finger on the black upon his face, and take it off. I observed Wraight's frock tucked up under his arms, apparently, for the purpose of getting at his jacket pockets more easy, both of which were plaistered with gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. How far were you from the coast when you fell in with Newton and his party - A. About a mile. It was a dark night, but not so dark but what I could see twenty yards. When I first saw Quested distinct enough to speak to him, he was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110040"></xptr>Hill's custody; that was not five minutes after Mr. Mackenzie was killed.</p>
               <p>Q. You found swan shot on him, such as would be used in killing wild fowls - A. Yes; he was intoxicated, but he had his wits about as much as I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Your wound I believe was caused by a ball or slug - A. Yes; small shot could not have occasioned it. When I laid down I heard balls and slugs distinctly pass over me. Mr. Mackenzie was killed by a ball, it was impossible from the position of our party, that the ball could come from them. I should think a quarter of a pound of powder was found on Wriaght, it stuck over his pockets. I produced what powder and shot I selected. I found no cartridge on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could that shot do harm to an individual - A. Certainly, if they were fired at him.</p>

Mr. Digby joined me about twelve minutes after. I took him to Jew's-gut watch-house. I left him in custody till then. I was close to Mr. Mackenzie when he took him. I saw nothing in his hand.</p>

               <p>MR. J. JONES. I am Admiralty midshipman of the Severn, and a deputed officer of the Customs. On the forenoon of the 11th of February, I was out after the smugglers. Mr. Mackenzie called out for Hill to take a man in custody. I saw Mr. Newton deliver a gun to

            . I am a petty officer of his Majesty's ship Severn. On the 11th of February I was near the beach - the moon was up. I saw some bodies of men some distance from the beach; one body appeared higher than the other. The highest body were in advance in-land, the other body behind were armed. I joined my own party.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember coming up to the finger post - A. Yes; a little distance from there several flashes were observed. Mr. Newton seized a man alongside by his frock. I was alongside the man when he put a fowling-piece into the hands of Mr. Newton, (he had seized him first) then the man seemed to go a few paces back, when Mr. Jones came forward and said,</p>
               <p>"If you offer to resist, I'll blow your brains out;" he said he would give himself up, he was done, it was the prisoner Quested. He was secured, and the musket given in my charge. I kept it till daylight, then delivered it to Mr. Jones. Just at the break of day I went towards Lee's house, and saw two men together, one carrying two tubs slung across his shoulder, which, on giving pursuit, he threw down. I saw them picked up by Holt, they appeared the usual contraband spirit casks, and smelt of spirits. I tasted it afterwards, on Tuesday, the 13th. I had delivered them to Mr. Jones, at Jew's-gut watch-house. I saw three more tubs, two in one field and one in the other. The two were fastened together by a small-cord, so as to enable a person to sling them across his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How far were they from the sea - A. Between four and five miles. I found them between six and seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . In February I was a seaman of the Severn, stationed at the westermost station of the Thanet watch-house, a quarter of a mile from Moot's post - he is the next. Between two and three o'clock I observed a pistol fired, proceeded to the spot, and heard several pistol fired as I went along the coast. I observed several men ranged from the top of the beach down to a white boat, which laid just on the beach; they were taking some tubs out of the boat. I suppose there were two or three hundred men - they saw me, turned round immediately, and fired at me, and said</p>
               <p>"Come along you black *** we are ready for you." I returned, and as I was going back met Hill, we both returned to the smugglers, and fired our pistols, they returned our fire directly, and fired a good many paces at us. I then saw the boat of the Rose, which is a King's ship, pulling in, some men landed from her. The smugglers were then all over the full of the beach, and when we got on the top they fired at us, and wounded two or three of our people. Clark and another were shot. We followed the smugglers, and were at times within one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards of them. I could not see whether they had anything with them - there might be nearly three hundred of them. We were joined afterwards by Messrs. Newton, Treader and others. I did not get quite to Dowell's farm - there was some firing. I was wounded with a slug in my right arm, which is there now. I was then taken back to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. The transaction had began when you were first alarmed - A. Yes; I went down to the beach between two and three o'clock, and saw a white boat, it was close by Harvey's watch-house. I know by the tide that it was not later than three o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw them taking tubs out of the boat; could you tell that part, or all of those men went on to the place where you was wounded - A. Yes; they all kept together. The firing I first heard was a pistol - it was an alarm to us. I was on the watch when I heard it - it was after I heard the pistol fire that the men fired at me.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of February, I was stationed on the beach by Harvey's watch-house, I saw a boat between two and three o'clock in the morning, plying into the shore. I walked towards her as she pulled in, as soon as she touched the beach, two men jumped out of her, dressed in long frocks, they immediately ran up the beach, and the boat shoved off about her own length. I ran after the men, and as soon as I got to the top of the beach, I saw a great body of men (two or three hundred), some of them appeared to be armed. I ran back over the full towards the sea, ran along and fired my pistol in the air, as a signal of alarm; as soon as I fired, they fired a volley at me. I suppose nine or ten pieces were fired. I heard the shot, it passed very close to me. I waited there, and saw the body of men go down to the boat and come back again, with packages on their shoulders. I could not see what the packages were, but I saw something on their backs, one before and the other behind, in the way smuggled spirits are carried. There was two or three hundred men running, I stood there, charged my pistol again, and by that time Mr. Newton came up; he and I pursued together on the beach, within about fifty yards of them, then he fired his pistol, and they immediately gave us a volley. We followed them, Treader and Motts joined us. We all four followed the party over the shingles, and now and then fired an alarm, and when we fired they fired at us. We pursued them till about five o'clock. I saw a man drop two tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue to follow the same party that you originally saw - A. Yes; but the tubs were not dropped till after daylight. I was present when Quested was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you never loose sight of them - A. Yes; they gave us two or three vollies, and so we laid down - they were out of sight half an hour or more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was firing going on during that half hour. - A. Yes; when we came in sight of them, they appeared about the same quantity of men. We travelled five miles.</p>

            . I am a seaman of the Severn. On the 11th of February, I was on the beach, and heard an alarm between two and three o'clock in the morning, I went from my station to Jews-gut watch-house, found nobody there; I proceeded up the Lidd-road towards the firing, and met Jackson and Churcher both wounded, and returning to the watch-house. In consequence of information they gave, I proceeded up the road to Dowell's farm. I never overtook the party - I stopped there. I afterwards met Nichol, one of our party; he and I waited some minutes and laid down on the ground, and saw about six men moving at Dowell's farm, at the east end of the building; we could see them better laying down than standing up; we could see the figures of men above us, and hear them talking, but could not hear what they said. As we lay in that situation, a man came within two yards, I rose and stopped him, and asked who he was - he answered, a friend - we asked where he was going, he said to Rye, and had come from Hythe; I told him it was the wrong road, and asked what time he left Hythe; it was the wrong road - he was coming to the sea coast, and going in a direction to Dungeness light-house, from Dowell's farm; we stopped him in a field about ten yards off the cart-road, leading from Lidd. I searched him, but found nothing on him. I said I should take him to the watch-house, he said he would go with me, but I had no business with him. I asked if he had heard or seen any firing, he said No. I had heard firing a quarter of an hour or ten minutes before. I took him to the watch-house, he stopped twice as we went along, and would not go in till I threatened to shoot him. It was about twenty minutes before four o'clock when I first took him, he had a grey coat and a long frock underneath, tucked close up under his arms. I saw Mr. Digby search him; a knife with wet powder sticking about it, and some small shot were found in his breeches pocket, and marks of gunpowder were on his face; his pockets were black, and powder in one; his right hand was black, particularly between his fingers, and his finger ends were black with powder; there were marks of powder on his nose and mouth. Hemmings, the quarter-master, tasted it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was near four o'clock when you met him - A. It wanted twenty minutes. I had heard firing about twenty minutes before; I was then three quarters of a mile from where I met him; the voices I heard, did not appear to be the voices of above half a dozen men. I and Nichols were the only King's men there; I should think those persons were within hail when I took Wraight, he made no noise - I was armed with a cutlas and pistols, I presented my pistol immediately as I saw him.</p>

            . I am a seaman on board the Severn. I was centry on the beach between two or three o'clock, and saw pistols fired to the eastward; I ran and saw a boat on the beach belonging to the Rose - I saw no others. When I got there, I saw Clark, the officer, one of the Rose's galley - I found Clark and two more men had been wounded. I ran about half a mile over the beach, and joined Newton and his men; there was firing as we went along - Jackson and Churcher were wounded. I went on till we got to Dowell's farm - Crockford was wounded there; we went to Dowell's farm, they came upon us, and we all retreated. I lost my party, and fell in with Mockford, we both laid down on the grass, and saw six or seven people moving at the east end of the barn - the firing had then ceased about ten minutes. A man came towards us from the east end of the barn, where I had observed the others, we both jumped up, Mockford searched him to see if he was armed, he merely rubbed him down, but did not examine his pockets; he said he came from Hythe, and was bound for Rye - we were then between Dungeness light-house and Dowell's farm - that is not the way from Hythe to Rye; the Dungeness light was burning and visible.</p>

I saw about half a dozen men a-shore, two of them were of the Severn's crew, we landed and joined them; went to the full of the beach, and saw a great number of people over the full - there might be sixty or seventy, or more. After Paramour (one of the Rose's crew) fired a pistol in the air, they fired a volley at us; they fired fifteen or twenty guns at us.

            . I am a seaman on board the Severn. On the 11th of February, I was stationed at Carrick watch-house, heard an alarm, went westward, and joined Newton and Treader; we went on, and when we came to the finger-post, we went towards Brockland, and saw Newton seize Quested - Treader received a musket from Mr. Newton. At daylight I saw two men, one of them had two tubs slung across his shoulder; on seeing us he hove them off, and they escaped; the tubs were secured by one the other party - three more of the same kind was picked up afterwards; one of them leaked, I put my finger to it and tasted it, it was foreign spirits - I believe brandy; we saw a dead body in the road, about fifty yards from where the tubs were found, which was in the direction the party had gone. I picked a musket up twenty or thirty yards from the dead body, and a cutlas along side of it, which belonged to one of the other party - none of us had muskets - the dead man was one of the shore people, and had a smock frock on. I carried one the tubs to the watch-house - it was marked SS. which I believe means spirits of brandy - another was marked S.G.</p>

               <p>As to the circumstance of my having a little powder and shot in my pocket, and my face and hand being smeared as if with gunpowder, I can only say that I am in the constant habit of going out with a gun on my mother's farm, for the purpose of shooting rooks and other birds, that destroy the seed corn, for which purpose I am very seldom without a little powder and shot in my pockets - and that the loose gunpowder that was found in my pocket, had worked out of a paper containing a small quantity of gunpowder, which I had put in that pocket a day or two before, and which had become damp through the accidental breaking of a vial which I had carried in that pocket afterwards - and I have no doubt the fact of my face and hand being smeared, was occasioned by my sometimes carrying my hands in my jacket pockets, as I was walking along on the night in question, and then wiping my nose with my hand, without thinking at the time of the damp powder being in my pocket.</p>
               <p>I shall now leave my case in the hands of my Counsel, to call witnesses on my behalf - but if there should be any whom you may think material to the case not called, I trust you will give me credit when I say, that if I had been tried in the county where I was apprehended, I could have had the attendance of ten times the number of witnesses to my character, than I can possibly expect to be in attendance here to-day.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother, and live at Pedlinge, near Hythe. My son is married, and has seven children. He is my bailiff. I am a widow. I know Mr. Baker, of Northland, and Mr. Baker, of Fair-field. On Saturday, the 10th of February, my son left my house to exchange some corn for seed, with Mr. Baker. He went away in the afternoon or the evening. He has exchanged corn with Baker several times. My son was to give him corn for beans. The beans were for seed for my land. He left my house after he had done work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he ever shoots rooks on your land - A. Yes; and carried ammunition with him for that purpose. I used to provide it for him. I do not know where he kept it.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. Q. To which of the Baker's did you send your son. - To Fairfield, not to Northland. My son's house is under the same roof as mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son take any corn to Fairfield with him - A. Not to my knowledge. I had had a sample of beans from Baker about a month before. I had a little in a sample bag. The beans were sent in after the barley was carried away - that was a week after my son went away. I sent five quarters of barley to Baker. I did not hear where my son was for a week after he left. I live about a mile from Hythe. I sent my waggoner with twenty quarters, a week after him, on the Monday, and he brought back the beans in the waggon. I had sent the barley in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought you the sample of beans - A. My son.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner - (hesitating) A. Mr. Baker. He brought it himself in a little bag. Baker had a sample of my barley two months before, I sent it to him by my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this sample was sent or taken by your son. - A. I do not know any thing about it. My business was carried on unknown to me sometimes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110044"></xptr>Q. You have sworn that Baker had a sample from you two months before - A. Yes; I recollect now, he had a sample from me - he came to me for it. He came alone. I saw him, but did not see the sample given to him. I recollect his going to the barn to my son. The barley was threshed.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you seen any written defence that was to be put in for your son - A. No; I have not seen any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any paper read over to you, as your son's defence - (hesitating) A. No; I do not remember any; none has been read to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your son been out shooting that day - A. He might possibly go out while he was threshing - he had been threshing in the barn all the day. I did not see him with a gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what time he returned from this journey - A. Possibly about five o'clock. He knew the road pretty well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Let me quite understand you, be attentive - are you quite sure it was a sample of beans that Baker brought you - A. Yes. I am certain he was to let me have beans.</p>

            , Esq. of Dover, who is now deceased. He had land at Fairfield. I have exchanged corn several times with Wraight. I paid him for some corn in November, and told him I should want some barley seed - he said he had some which would suit me, and he should like beans in exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give a sample of beans, or receive one of barley - A. No doubt samples passed, and I think I do recollect that I carried a sample with me. I went to their house, and looked at the barley in the barn - it was about January. I was to give him beans in exchange. I received a letter from Wraight about the 1st or 2d of February. I have not got the letter, I destroyed it. In consequence of that letter, I expected to see him on the 10th of February. I live about eighteen miles from him. I expected him to come to my house, but he did not. I have since perfected the exchange - I think it was on the Monday week following.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How soon after this business happened did you hear of it - A. On the Tuesday. I live six or seven miles from Dowell's farm, and about two miles and a half from Brockland. I heard of the affair the next day, but not about the prisoner. I have seen him at Fairfield a great many times. The road is sometimes difficult at night. There are many turnings.</p>
               <p>Q. Your expression just now was,</p>
               <p>"I do think I carried the sample;" had any one told you what Mrs. Wraight had been saying - A. No.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you have dealt with her before; was it by exchange - A. Yes; I always dealt by exchange - our waggons used to meet at St. Mary's. What I expected him about on the 10th, was to appoint where they were to meet. I should think Dowell's farm is fifteen miles from his house.</p>

            . I live at Saltwell, and have some land adjoining Wraight's, On the 10th of February I saw him about noon, in the road by my house. I saw him on the Wednesday before that, out with his gun, shooting rooks. I gave him some powder and shot. He took it in a paper, and rolled it up. I gave him between two and three charges. He put it in his waistcoat pocket. I gave him two or three charges of shot; I think it was No. 3. about the size of those produced.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. Q. Does he use a flask - A. I never saw him with one - I often gave him powder.</p>

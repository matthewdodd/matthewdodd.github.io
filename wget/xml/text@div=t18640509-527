I live in Eastfield-street, Limehouse—I have known the prisoner nine or ten years—when I first knew him he was in the same line that he is now; he kept a grocer's shop; he does not now—I believe my son was taken ill on Sunday, 20th March, and on Monday night I went to see Mr. Stevens—he has a shop in High-street, Whitechapel—I told him the boy was very ill, I believed he had got the fever; that was all I told him then—that was on the Tuesday—I did not tell him on the Monday that he had the fever—I went and got some powder and pills on the Monday—I got those from Mrs. Stevens—I did not see Mr. Stevens on the Monday evening—I had some composition powder and some pills from the prisoner's wife—I also brought him on Monday night a bottle of liniment to rub on his hip; I got that also from Mrs. Stevens—some of the powder and the pills were given to my son that night, and the liniment was rubbed on; he was no better on the Tuesday, and I went to Mr. Stevens and told him my boy was very bad, and I thought he had the fever—he gave me some powder and told me to give it to him freely—I went again that night a second time and got some more liniment, as my wife had used all that I took on Monday—part of that was used, but I think not all—I went to Mr. Ste<lb></lb>vens on Wednesday evening, and told him my boy was very bad—I asked him if he would come and see him, and he came and examined him in my presence—he said that he was very bad, and he would rather see him by daylight—he then left, and told me to come up in the course of half an hour; I suppose that was to enable him to make some medicine—I went, and he gave me a bottle of medicine—I gave my son some of it as directed, and altogether be took about half the bottle—I believe the prisoner came next day by daylight, but I was not there—it must have been on the Tuesday that lome other medicine was sent by Mr. Cummings or Dr. Monk, but my son had none of it—I had always been satisfied with Mr. Stevens' treatment before, and that was the reason I did not give it to him—until my son died he took no medicine, that I know of, except what I brought from Mr. Stevens; I brought the whole of it—these are the pills, medicine, and liniment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the last he swallowed; I got it from Mr. Stevens on the Sunday, the day my son died; he died as I was pouring that down his throat—the bottle was full, and he swallowed all except what you see left in the bottle—this other bottle, with "Gargle" on it, he gave him on the day he died, because he complained of sore throat—I do not think I have any of the liniment left; my wife used all of the first bottle; the second bottle was not all used, because he ceased complaining of his hip after Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I am registered under the new Act of Parliament—Mr. Proby's sister came to me, and on 24th March I went and saw the boy at the request of the mother—it was a Thursday; they are quite wrong in their dates—I only saw him once—it was about the middle of the day—my son had seen him before for a moment, I believe, but I was not present—I examined the boy—he was suffering from in<lb></lb>flammatory fever, the consequence of acute suffering of the hip-joint—his state was quite dangerous, and he was in great suffering—I said, "If you have no regular medical attendant you had better send the boy to the hospital or he will be lost"—not being called in I did not recommend any particular treatment, but I said what ought to be done—a prescription of Dr. Monk was made up on my counter—I read it, and was present when it was made up—I made up part of it—I am sure of that—after the boy died, Mr. Grant made a post mortem examination in my presence—I sealed up the stomach, and gave it to the Coroner's officer—the boy had been suffering from acute inflammation of the hip-joint, for which, in my opinion, Cayenne pepper would be very injurious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw that the boy was very ill, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if anybody who saw him, two hours before met, said that it was only a touch of the rheumatism, and that he would get better in a day or two, he would be a very ignorant person, and a very stupid person if it was said, but it was not said—my son is a certificated medical man, and very talented as a general practitioner—he only spoke a word of comfort, he never ex<lb></lb>amined the case at all; he never interfered the least in the world; he merely looked in at the door—cayenne pepper is in the pharmacopœa, only we call it there capsicum, but there are two descriptions there—if I wanted to translate capsicum into English, I should call it cayenne—hip-joint disease is scrofulous in nine cases out of ten—capsicum or cayenne may be used in scrofulous disease where there is atony or want of power—we use it occasionally as a stimulant—I have never used it in low fever, but it is used occasionally—it is a recognised remedy among the class of stimulants, and it is in our pharmacopœa as a remedy for low fever, and it is optional for medical men to use it—I do not think I ever used it—I have it in my laboratory, but I use other stimulants—I prefer them—it may be</p>

               <p>used with propriety in proper quantities where there is a weakness in the tone of the stomach, but I do not use it—of those proper quantities the medical man judges, and they may be increased or diminished according to circumstances—one of the curative processes that I recommended was that Dr. Coffin's prescriptions ought not to be used, as he was a mere unqualified man—I take it for granted that people who have not taken out a certificate are not very likely to know what is right.</p>

                  </hi>, F. R. C. S. I am one of the surgeons of the Royal Free Hospital, and pathological anatomist to it—I was ordered by the Coroner to make a post mortem examination of this lad about a week or nine days after his death—I found all the organs essential to life, quite healthy—I examined the hip-joint by laying it open, and found a portion of the circumference of the cartilage of the head of the bone absorbed or removed by disease, or more correctly speaking, removed by inflammation, and another portion of cartilage, about the size and shape of a shilling, had also been removed from the ossitabulum or socket of the hip—it is a ball and socket joint—the bone itself was highly inflamed, and turgid with blood, highly vascular, and in the cavity of the joint was about two teaspoonsful of matter—I looked inside the abdomen, at the part corresponding to the hip-joint, and there I found that the disease, I have been speaking of, in<lb></lb>flammation; had extended to the muscle leading down to the hip-joint, and also had extended to the peritoneum, covering the muscle and its sheath; there was peritonitis or inflammation of the peritoneum at that part—some lymph bad been thrown out by the peritoneum into the substance of the muscle, causing considerable tension of the muscle—in my judgment in<lb></lb>flamatory fever was the cause of death, followed by exhaustion by peritonitis—there was no difficulty in a properly qualified medical man ascertaining in the boy's lifetime what he was suffering from—in the state in which I found the hip-joint, cayenne pepper would be a very improper thing indeed to administer, because it is a powerful stimulant, and would make the inflam<lb></lb>matory fever inevitably fatal—I believe that the administration of the cayenne, in doses, in connection with the acute inflammation, and inflam<lb></lb>matory fever would together be inevitably fatal—this was not a scrofulous disease at all; I can give you a very good reason for saying so: the usual manifestations of scrofula in the meserteric glands, and by tubercles in the lungs, were absent—there was no scrofulous disease, nor were there the usual characteristics of it—I took out the stomach, held it up to the light, and saw that it contained a quantity of dark fluid, and that it also had, when held up to the light, a crimson hue from inflammation.</p>

               <p>medical opinion of the last age that has not been altered in the present—bleeding is not used as it was fifty or sixty years ago; it is not considered fatal now, but the treatment is very different—the doctors hardly ever carry a lancet now, because the state of the public constitution is so altered that people will not bear bleeding where they used before—I think that bleeding was all right fifty years ago—a great many medical men are not of an en<lb></lb>tirely different opinion—I never saw cayenne used for low fever, or heard of it—I am not acquainted with it from books—I do not say that the notion of using it for low fever is monstrous, because I have no experience of it, but capsicum or cayenne pepper is so powerful an irritant that we should not use it in fever—low fever and acute inflammation are not the same—I have had no experience of its effects in low fever; but as regards acute inflammation its effect in congested sore throat, for instance, would preclude our using it for inflammation—I can form a judgment of it in in<lb></lb>flamination, but low fever is far more mysterious, and that is the reason I cannot give an opinion—the pathology of low fever is not by any means so well understood as inflammation—cayenne is never used for inflammatory sore throats.</p>

I am professor of chemistry at the London Hospital—I received these bottles from Cunningham; this jar containing the stomach, and this box of pills—the stomach was unopened, but I observed marks of inflammation outside of it—I opened it, and found that the mucous coat was tinted generally of a yellow colour, but here and there there were patches of a red colour as if from the action of an irritant—it contained ten drachms of liquid, (one ounce and a quartere) of a yellowish, or yellowish brown colour, which I found was due to the prsence of bile in large quantities—there was no trace of food or of any solid matter—I examined it chemically, but found no trace of matters of a poisonous nature, but only bile and cayenne-pepper—that is called in Latin <hi rend="italic">capsicum annium</hi>—it flowers annually, and is different from <hi rend="italic">capsicum frutescent</hi>—several kinds are used for making cayenne-pepper—the cayenne-pepper I found would account for the red patches in the stomach, and also for the presence of the quantity of bile which there was there, and for the absence of food, because being a powerful irritant, I think it likely to have created very violent vomiting, which is accompanied by a regurgilation of bile into the stomach, bile not being naturally found there—I examined this large bottle, No. 1, labelled "The mixture, take a table-spoonful four times a day, and two pills night and morning"—it is a twelve ounce bottle—it contained six and a half ounces of a brownish liquid, which on standing, separated into two portions; a quantity of vegetable matter which subsided, and a clear liquid which was a solution of cayenne-pepper—the rest was powder which subsided to the bottom of the bottle—the vegetable matter was so broken up that I was unable to ascertain by microscopic examination what it was—the cayenne-pepper was rather a strong solution as was ascertained by its taste, and by proportion which I obtained by evaporation—I am a medical man, but not a member of the College of Physicians, at least I am qualified, but do not practise—I practised some fifteen years ago, but have ceased to do so—in my judgment that mixture would not be a proper medicine to give to a person suffering from acute inflammation of the hip-joint—it would be in<lb></lb>jurions—this six ounce bottle, No. 2, called" The gargle," contained four and a half ounces of a brownish liquid—it contains spirits of wine and cayenne<lb></lb>pepper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090034"></xptr>
               <p>—bottle No. 3, which the boy's father gave him when he was dying is nothing but liquorice-water—the pill-box contained thirty-two pills, weighing two and a half grains each, consisting of assafortida, or gal<lb></lb>bula, a resinous matter like jalap, and a quarter of their weight of plaster of Paris and chalk—they would not have a tendency to increase inflammation. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you not know that there is a prevailing opinion that cayeune or capsicum is a very useful remedy; I do not mean among graduates of the University, or the College of Physicians, but is it not among the masses very largely taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, I can only answer from my experience, and I have had four cases of Inquests in which I have had to inquire into it, therefore I speak from my experience, and say there may he among the masses a prevailing opinion that cayenne-pepper, and <hi rend="italic">lobelia inflata</hi>, are good remedies for serious diseases, and I found my opinion upon the fact that I have had to investigate five cases of poisoning by lobelia and cayenne-pepper—I do not know that there have been cases in which my judgment has turned out to be very much at fault—I was not entirely in error in the case of Mr. Sheridan, the arsenic test; allow me to explain, in the case that we are referring to, there was evidence that a powder was taken out of a man's pocket and thrown into a fire, and that there was a blue flame, I thought it was therefore an important question whether the person had thrown in a paper containing arsenic; the experiment was made by me in the presence of a great number of chemists well qualified to form an opinion, and we found that it does burn with a blue flame, though a gentleman, who had perhaps never made an experiment before in his life, came into Court and gave evidence that he did not get the blue flame, but that does not prove that I was at fault—I am giving the absolutely right version—Sir Benjamin Brodie did not give a different opinion, nor was the man's life saved upon that; the man was acquitted—there was no medical opinion on the case or question of it—it is not the general opinion of the profession that I was wrong, and if you had that opinion before, let me disabuse your mind of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the immediate cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The pain and inflammation had created great exhaustion and, as I take it, the vomit<lb></lb>ing: he died of exhaustion, following on intense inflammation—the inflammation caused the exhaustion, and the exhaustion caused the death; the inflammation being partly natural and partly artificial; natural from the hip-joint, and artificial from the cayenne.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Reading from the Sessions Paper, Vol.</hi> 44, <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 178)—"The sentence was not carried into effect in consequence of my having written a letter; I was the cause of her being respited; other scientific gentlemen interfered, and challenged the soundness of my conclusions before I wrote any letters at all." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the impression was that my opinion was called in question; it was a case in which Ann Merritt was tried here for murder of her husband by arsenic, and she was convicted; one very important question put to me by the Judge was, whether I could form an opinion of how long the arsenic had been administered. I forget the proportions, but I think it was eight grains, contained in nearly a pint of gruel; the evidence of the medical man, Mr. Tolman, was that the person had vomited up to half an hour of death, taking that into consideration, and as I had found nearly a pint of gruel in his stomach, and eight grains of arsenic, my opinion was that it had been taken within three hours: upon that the Judge made</p>

               <p>some powerful observations, that as nobody had had access to the man but the woman, it must have been administered by her, and whether I was right in saying that the gruel might not have been there more than three hours.</p>

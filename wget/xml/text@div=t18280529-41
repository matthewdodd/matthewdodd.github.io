               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you lock your desk when you left it? A. I did not; I was not the last person there - the pigeon-holes were inside the desk; I mentioned the loss of my money about an hour after I missed it, but not to my employers; I did not go home to see if I had left it there - I went home in the evening, but not to look for it; I never said so, nor did I look for it at home - I did not mention it to my employers till about half-past two o'clock on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, when you was asked at the Mansion-house why you did not tell your master on the Monday, say because you had another place to look for it? A. I did not, nor anything to that effect, there or any where; the prisoner constantly lived in the house; I have been in the prosecutor's employ two years and a half - I have heard from my employers that she once found a 14l. cheque, and restored it: I never heard of her finding a 50l. Bank note, or any other property, and restoring it; I have no doubt of her being a respectable well conducted young woman.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Had you any doubt of leaving the money in the counting-house? A. I had not; the 14l. cheque had been stopped the day before she gave it up; I cannot say whether she knew that.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Pearson, a jeweller, of Whitechapel. On a Monday (the 11th of April, I believe) the prisoner came to the shop about the middle of the day, and bought a small gold neck-chain for 25s.; I gave her change for a 5l. note - I am quite satisfied she is the person - I have not the least doubt of her; this is the note she paid me - (looking at it) - I have written on it- I asked her name and address; she said her name was Martin, and she lived at the Bull inn, Bishopsgate; I have written that on the note; my employer wrote the date on it the same day - it is the 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the person, whoever it was, buy anything of you before? A. I do not recollect ever seeing her; we cannot remember every person who comes; I was fetched to the prosecutor's counting-house about a fortnight or three weeks after; I had not seen her between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290033"></xptr>the day I took the note and my going there - nearly a month had elapsed.</p>
               <p>Q. When she saw you, did she not immediately say,"You are the person I bought a pair of snaps of?" A. She had seen me before that, in the morning; she said, "You are the person of whom I bought a pair of snaps," and produced one; the officer searched, and found the other; I do not remember selling her a pair of snaps - I had never seen the person who I sold the chain to before, that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say "Your shop is in Whitechapel I do not know the number; but if you will take me out I will show you the shop?" A. I do not recollect it - I will not swear she did not say so; several persons were present; I cannot describe her dress - she came about the middle of the day - twelve, one, or two o'clock; I cannot say precisely which hour - I dine about one; I cannot recollect whether it was after dinner or before - I cannot say what weather it was.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You do not recollect selling her any snaps? A. I never recollect seeing her, except the day the note was passed - when the inquiry was made she said she had never seen the chain, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the snaps ever belonged to your master? A. We cannot say, for almost every shop has the same sort - it is a common gilt snap which every body keeps; I have not seen the gold chain - I cannot say what sort of a dress or bonnet she wore, but I knew her countenance the moment I saw her - whether she wore a hat or a close bonnet I do not know; or whether she had a cap on.</p>

            . I am the employer of the first witness. I stated to the prisoner's father, in her presence that the note was traced to her - that she had paid it away to Mr. Pierson, of Whitechapel for a neck-chain; she said she had a neck-chain in her possession, which was given her by a gentleman, a foreigner; and I think she said recently, but am not certain: the officer went up to search and brought down what they said were all the trinkets she had - I never saw the neck-chain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was the officer there when she said she had a neck chain given to her? A. No; I sent for him immediately - he came in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she and her father remain with you till he came? A. They went up stairs, and when he came I sent for them, and they went up with him; they afterwards all came down to the counting-house, and no neck-chain was produced - we have been nine or ten years at the house; I never heard of her finding a 50l. note on our floor and bringing it to us - it was not to anybody in our house, I am certain; I one day dropped a 14l. cheque in the counting-house - I missed it the very day I drew it, and stopped payment immediately; it was brought to me next day by the prisoner or some of the family - I am not aware that I mentioned to anybody that I had stopped it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you remain at your counting-house after you lost it? A. Till six or seven o'clock in the morning; when they returned it they said it was found in the ashes, and I recollected standing there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you drop it? A. In the course of the morning I believe; the counting-house was not left any part of the day - I never heard of it being presented.</p>

            . I am a jeweller; Ciriackes was in my employ. I was in the shop when the neck-chain was bought, but have not the least recollection of the prisoner; I was attending to other ladies - Ciriackes gave me the 5l. note; I went up stairs, and got change for it, which was given to the person who bought the chain: I paid the 5l. note to my brother (looking at it) this is it; it has my man's writing on it, and my brother's also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you recollect at what time the note came into your possession? A. I should think between two and three o'clock - I do not think it was later.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said the person who paid the note was as tall as your wife? was it not a taller woman than the prisoner? A. No; I do not think it was; I said I was not positive of the person's height, and that she was as tall as a person in my shop - that person is about her height, not taller - I have not brought my book here; Mr. Butler. the prisoner's solicitor saw it - he asked me to bring it here; I told him I could swear to my entry - I did not think it of any use to bring it here - there is nothing in my notice to produce it; there is an entry in the book of a pair of snaps bought on the 1st of April, and I sold Mr. Butler a pair exactly like them - I cannot say whether those sold on the 1st of April, was to a woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they correspond in appearance with those sold on the 1st of April? A. Mr. Butler brought a pair, and I gave him a pair of the same pattern exactly.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. If you had been called upon to identify that young woman, could you venture to swear to her? A. No; I cannot say that I sold the snaps myself - we sold no others about that time; we sold none between the 1st and 14th of April.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you the person who dealt with her? A. No; I was attending to two ladies - these snaps may he had at any shop; Mr. Butler called to examine my books, and I shewed them to him - my shop is No. 92, near Whitechapel-church.</p>

I am a chymist, and live at No. 93, Cheapside; the prisoner has been several times at my shop with prescriptions - we copy prescriptions the first time they are brought; in case they should be lost (looking at one) - I copied this when I received it from the prisoner; which was on the 14th of April - it had been in our shop before, but for particular reasons which are in it, I did not enter it till then; I did not receive it myself from the prisoner, but from my assistant - after entering it, I delivered it to the prisoner; I wrote this on the envelope(looking at it) - "Monday, April 14th, Mrs. Taylor, 3s. 1d.;" I returned this prescription to her at near four o'clock - I do not recollect seeing her before that day; our shop is not in the way from George Yard to Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You gave her the prescription made up on the 14th? A. Yes; it had been left at my house at near twelve o'clock that day - by whom I do not know.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Rogers; I remember the prisoner coming to the shop on the 14th of April; to the best of my belief it was near twelve o'clock; she brought a prescription, which I delivered to Mr. Rogers - she left it with me and went away, and when she called again it was nearly ready for her; I cannot say at what times he called; it required at least half an hour to make it up.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to CHRISTOPHER CIRIACKES. Q. There are other counting-houses in the same house? A. Yes, on the same staircase; the street door is open in the day time.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Has any person access with your permission except this young woman, her father, and mother? A. No.</p>
               <p>- TAYLOR. I am the prisoner's father. On the 14th of April I was at home, also my wife and daughter - I have another daughter who was ill; my brother came about eleven o'clock, and stopped till about a quarter-past one - my wife was washing a few things; I was going to an excise sale, in Old Broad-street, with my brother; my daughter(the prisoner) was sent by her mother to Mr. Roger's, with a prescription, soon after eleven o'clock - it was between eleven and twelve; she told her to make what haste she could, as she wanted her to attend the door, and to the gentlemen - we were without a servant; we only keep one occasionally; it was, I think, not more than twenty or twenty-five minutes when she returned; she then began preparing our dinner; I and my brother dined, and went away about twenty minutes past one o'clock; my family dined with us - we had beef-steaks; when we went out we left her at home - she had not left the house after she returned from the chemist's, and she went there much quicker than I could; I returned from the sale a little before three o'clock- my wife and both daughters were at home; the prisoner was sent out about four for the medicine, and returned with it in as short a time as before, and prepared the tea; my brother drank tea with us, and left between five and six o'clock - near six.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Does this young woman always cook the dinner? A. In general when we have no servant - she is rather fond of a domestic life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not, when called upon to give an account of her time on the afternoon of the 14th, say she had been abroad? A. She did not; I do not recollect her saying a word about being out; she was sent for the medicine; she did not say she was never in Mr. Pierson's shop, to purchase snaps or anything; she said to the young man, "I know you - I bought the snaps of you;" she said, "I cannot tell the number of the house, but you are the young man who sold me the snaps; I know you now your hat is off."</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say she had a neck-chain, which was given to her by a young man? A. No; she said she had a locket; she never said she had a chain - I never heard her say so; she never said it in my presence; the locket can be produced - she produced it at the time with a ribbon on it; I never saw her with a gold chain.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was the locket worn round her neck with the snap which fastened the ribbon? A. It was - she took it off to show the snap; the snap was not mentioned till she mentioned it.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother; she is in her eighteenth year. On the 14th of April, about eleven o'clock, I sent her to get a prescription made up; she was gone about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, at the very farthest, and remained in the house till about four o'clock, when she went to fetch it; she was engaged at home the whole time, attending to the gentlemen and answering the door; I was washing - she got the dinner; her father was at home till about half-past one o'clock; she was not out till I sent her for the medicine - she was gone about a quarter of an hour; we provide her with everything she wishes - I never saw her with a gold chain; I remember her buying a pair of snaps - she wore a black ribbon round her neck with a locket to it, fastened with one of the snaps; no money was found in her box.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. On the 14th of April I had a bad swelling in my throat, and was at home - my father and uncle were there part of the time; my sister was sent about eleven o'clock to Mr. Rogers, of Cheapside, for a prescription to be mixed; she returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; I remarked her haste when she came back - she prepared the dinner - I was unable to do it; my father and uncle went out about a quarter-past one o'clock, and returned about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290035"></xptr>three; my sister had been at home all that time - she was constantly in my presence; she went out about four for the medicine, and returned in about the same time as before - my uncle left about five. Mr. Henderson has a counting-house in the house - he knocked about two o'clock; my sister went up to him, and came down with the rent, which she gave to my father when he came home, and he sent the change.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY here expressed the prosecutor's wish to press the case no further.</p>

I was called to Mr. Mosley's house, and searched the prisoner—I found the buckes in his coat-pocket, and the pencil and thimbles in his waistcoat-pocket—Mr. Mosley said he would not charge him with stealing them; he might have had them, but he had no right to have them—I gave them to Mrs. Mosley—she gave them back to me—they were not all wrapped up separately—they had a paper between them, as if to be taken out for sale—they were not loose.

               <p>"Sir—It is with the humblest sense of gratitude I thus presume to address you. Your kindness to me on Wednesday, in giving me the money, exceeded my expectation so far, that I cannot find words sufficient to express my gratefulness. The task I am now performing, believe me, is a very painful one; and more particularly when I reflect and expect my fate is sealed. I sincerely assure you my sufferings since this day week have been of a very severe nature: my conscience is in such a state that I cannot rest day nor night; I begin to find I am a lost man. All my future prospects depend entirely upon your generosity. Indeed, you and Mr. and Mrs. Mosley are the only earthly friends I can appeal to. It is you alone that can mitigate my punishment; therefore I trust you will consider my very unfortunate situartion, and allow me this once to implore mercy at your hands. If you should extend the had of compassion towards me, God and myself only know the debt of gratitude it will incur on me. I cannot well make an appeal on the part of my poor wife; my heart is too full, and more particularly when I know her innocence;—therefore I will leave it with you; it is too painful for me;—her sufferings have been great. Should I at any distant period receive my liberty, this will be such a lesson that I shall be another man. This is the first act of the kind I ever was charged with, and I trust in God it may be the last. No one but myself knows my feelings. In conclusion, allow me to intrude myself upon your generous consideration. At the same time, if you should feel disposed from the memory of your very obedient and humble servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH PERKINS</hi>.</p>

               <p>"Newgate, Nov, 29, 1836.</p>
               <p>"Sir—I humbly trust you will excuse my solicitations. Believe me, I am the most wretched man in the world. The more I reflect, the more it aggravates my misery, and increases my torture. I saw my poor unfortu<lb></lb>nate wife yesterday; her altered appearance harrows up my very soul. Still I cannot claim your good word; but, alas! if it were possible for you to know my sufferings, I think it would in some degree soften your ven<lb></lb>geance. Indeed, under a sense of my lost and ruined condition, hope seems to have quite flown; everlasting punishment suggests itself to my mind; I anticipate nothing but perpetual misery, without any prospect of the least mitigation. Let me humbly entreat you to take my case into your serious consideration. and, perhaps, as the last request of your unfortunate peti<lb></lb>tioner, you will be kind enough to recommend him to the mercy of the Court, which may probably ease the dreadful sentence which I know I shall shortly receive. I leave myself to your mercy, and at the mercy of that Being who never deserts the unfortunate; and I trust, if you have one spark of sympathy, you will extend it towards the unhappy being who is addressing you. Would to God I could see the last twelve months over again! I should be a different man;—but, alas! it is too late. Then, let me beg at your hands in this world; and may that Being, who knows my miserable heart, reward you in the next is the next, is the prayer of your very humble servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH PERKINS</hi>."</p>

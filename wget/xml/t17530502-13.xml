               <p>I had been drinking three or four pints of beer with a woman, and said I'd make her child a present for her civility; I went into this shop and asked for a ribbon, the apprentice said plain or figur'd, I said figured, he took out a drawer and asked me six pence a yard; I bought a yard for a groat, after that he put his hand down my bossom, and up my coats; I asked what that was for, he said he thought I had something about me that did not belong to me; I said if I had, it was proper a woman should search me, he said he should think it no sin to rip me open, and let my puddings out; I went up stairs and stripped my self to my bare shift, there was nothing found upon me.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240149"></xptr>
               <p>on Saturday night, 1st October, I went with my brother into the King William the Fourth tavern, at about 10 minutes to 12 o'clock—there was a concert going on, and the prisoner struck my brother on the hat—I told him not to do that again—I knew him by sight—there was no singing going on at the time—I and my brother had not done anything to him—there had been no quarrel between them—I told the prisoner not to do that again—he told me he would put a knife into me, and came up, threatening—he closed with me, and I struck him—I did not see a knife in his hand, nor had I one—I did not take one out of my pocket—I went down the stairs, not knowing he was following me, and when I got to the bottom I felt my<lb></lb>self struck on the shoulder—I turned round and saw the prisoner behind me—I took him by the throat, took the knife from him, and threw him on the table—I afterwards found I was wounded—I then lost my senses, and when I came to myself I was in Guy's Hospital, with pains in my hip and ear—this wound on my hip was done then, and this hole through my cheek—I found part of the flesh in my mouth—I am still in the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> Were you the worse for liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rather, but not much—I had spoken to the prisoner once or twice at that house, but not familiarly—I bore him no animosity, nor had he reason to bear me any—there was a scuffle upstairs between us, and other persons separated us—I did not use a knife against him—I do not know that his wounds were dressed by the same surgeon who dressed mine, or by any surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of 3, Francis-place, Southwark—I was at the William the Fourth tavern, about twenty minutes to 12 o'clock, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner at the bottom of the stairs—the prosecutor was holding the prisoner on a table, on his back, and the prisoner had a knife in his hand—the prisoner said, "Mind, I have got the <hi rend="italic">chiv</hi>"—the prosecutor said, "Is that what you mean?" the prisoner said, "Yes" the prosecutor said, "Well, wait till I get mine out"—I thought they were joking, and was about to torn away, when the prosecutor left hold of the prisoner, who jumped up and stabbed him three or four times with the knife—the blood spirted out, and I got away—the prosecutor had not got his knife out—he had no knife, and, if he had, he would not have had time to draw it before the prisoner stabbed him—I did not see what took place on the stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he say, "Wait till I get mine out?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but he did not pull one out—they might both have had a little liquor, but I do not think the prosecutor was much the worse for it—I have seen them before, but not to have any conversation with them—I did not see the prisoner bleeding from his head—I have heard since that he was—I never knew that he was wounded by the prosecutor—I walked by the side of the prosecutor when he was carried to the doctor's—I am not a friend of of his, I never spoke to him before.</p>

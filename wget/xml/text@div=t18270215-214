            . I live in Hanover-street, Long-acre. I saw this child crying in the street, and the prisoner running from her; I went and asked her what was the matter - she said, "That woman has got my sixpence;" I ran, and caught her in Bow-street, and said, "You hussy, you have robbed this child;" she said she had not; I caught hold of her hand - she resisted; I found 41/4d. in her right hand, and a shilling and a sixpence in her left; she said it was her own. The child said, in her presence, "That is the woman who took my sixpence."</p>

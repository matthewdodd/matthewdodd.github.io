On Tuesday, the 9th of July, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110127"></xptr>shop with a cotton gown and a shawl; she said she wanted to pledge them for twenty shillings, as she asked so enormous a price, being twice the value of them, I would not take them in; upon some occasion, I turned round to my desk, and was informed that a woman had taken a gown from within the door where I bang things for show; in consequence of this woman's information, I immediately went over the counter in pursuit of the woman; my house being the corner of a court, I looked up the court, and perceived the prisoner running; I pursued her, and took her within about 10 yards from my door; the court was not a thoroughfare; she went to the end of it, finding it was not, she returned, and I took her; I saw her throw the gown from her; I then took her to Bow-street with the gown, and she was committed (produces the gown); it has my own private mark upon it; I had seen it at the door less than two minutes before; it was almost momentary.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SULLIVAN sworn. - I was in Mr. Lloyd's shop; the prisoner at the bar was there with a gown and a shawl, and she asked twenty shillings for it; she went away with them in her apron, and went as far as the door; this gown was hanging the very next to the door; she took it off both the hooks, and went up this little court, and I told Mr. Lloyd of it, and he went after her, and took her to Bow-street; she chucked the gown away from her in the passage, and he picked it up; it was a gown of this colour, but I cannot swear to it.</p>

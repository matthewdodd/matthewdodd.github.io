I missed them in less than half an hour's time. I went to his sister at Billingsgate, and told her he was gone away, and desired if he came there to stop him. About six weeks after this, his sister sent word she had stopped him. I went there, he had my wig and hat on his head, and he owned he sold my handkerchief for six-pence.</p>

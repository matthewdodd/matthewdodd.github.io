               <p>Q. Did you lose a looking glass at any time lately? - Yes, on the 28th, the day before yesterday; from the table in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your shop? - A bit of a broker's shop. I was called out by one of the neighbour's; I was at dinner, and he told me that man had something of my property, and I followed him about a hundred yards, and took him with the glass in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be your's? - By the private marks that I put on it for my wife to sell it by.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - About a quarter before one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from Tottenham court road; I had been to an acquaintance of mine, and a man met me, and asked me to hold the glass while he went into a public house, and I was standing there, and the gentleman came and took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did he say how he came by it? - He said he picked it up in the street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

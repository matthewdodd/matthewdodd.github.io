            's, of Ludgate-street, to No. 6, Clements-Inn. I got there at twenty minutes past twelve. I saw the prisoner at the door, he was alone. He asked if I had brought Captain Smith's clothes. I said I had, and he said he would run and fetch Captain Smith, as he was gone out with a gentleman. He returned in about five minutes, and said Captain Smith was taking a glass of wine with a gentleman, and would be home directly. I waited till Captain Smith came home. I had seen him before, and gave him the clothes. He asked if I had change for a 10 l. note, he then asked me to go with his <rs id="t18200918-86-deflabel486" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I came down with the prisoner (who was the servant) into the Strand, he then asked if I had got the receipt. I said I had a stamp, but it was not wrote; when I came to the turning beyond Exeter-change, he took me into a public-house, to write the receipt while he waited outside. I perceived him going on, and came out after him, and told him they could not lend me a pen and ink, and if he would come down into the Strand I could get him change, and write the receipt there. He then wanted me to wait for him at the end of <rs id="t18200918-86-deflabel487" type="occupation">Swan-yard</rs>

I said I should follow him for the money, and followed him down the yard, till he came to a cellar, he then gave me a severe blow on the eye, and knocked me down; I got up and hallooed Stop thief! but he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered the clothes to Captain Smith, who had ordered them - Yes; the prisoner took nothing from me, my master ordered me not to part with the clothes without the money. I am sure the prisoner is the man. Captain Smith told me the prisoner could get change and pay me. I returned to Clements-Inn, and found neither him nor the goods there, and have never found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you ever delivered goods there before - A. No; I had never seen Captain Smith but once at my master's. When I saw him at Clements-Inn, he gave his servant a note, or something to pay for them. I delivered the clothes just inside the passage.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 5th of July I apprehended the prisoner in Long-acre, he saw me, and ran into Little St. Martin's-lane. I secured him, and told him I wanted him for the Swan-yard job, meaning this. He said he did not have the clothes. I had seen him on the 26th of June, under the Swan-yard gateway with Gough. I passed the end of the yard about ten paces, then heard the cry of Stop thief, and saw the boy covered with blood. I followed the prisoner, a number of girls of the town and others closed on the prisoner, and threw the boy down; the prisoner got away. I searched the privy of the house he ran into on the 27th, and found two sheets of brown paper there.</p>

               <p>"Take that 10 l. cheque to Mr. Burn's, in the Strand, and enquire if he can change it." I could find no such person; the boy said I had better go to his master. I gave him the paper, and told him to bring the change back, he was insolent, and said I had robbed him, and so I gave him a slap in the face. I returned to look for Smith, but could not find him.</p>

            , jun. sworn. - I live at No. 4, Mitchell-street, near St. Luke's, but did not receive a letter or 5l. note on the 20th of April.</p>

               <p>Mr. HUGH FERGUSON sworn. - I am inspector of the letter-carriers. When letters arrive from different parts of the country, they are sorted in the inland office to twelve districts for London, which are distinguished by numbers; Mitchell-street, in Old-street, is in No. 8. Those first twelve divisions are again subdivided for delivery into 116. It daily happens in the first sorting that letters are sorted to a district to which they do not properly belong; in which case it is the duty of the subdivision to carry it to the proper division. On the 20th of April the prisoner was employed in the 11th division, to sort the franked and paid letters; and supposing a paid letter by mistake to be sent to the 11th division, it would come into his possession, and his duty would have been to hand it over to the 8th. On the 20th of April there were letters missorted; there is a charge taken to each division who keeps a book, and that book contains an account of the charges for letters missorted and sent back; the amount was 2l. 18s. 11d. in the 11th division.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Anthony Foxlow? - A. Yes, he was at the 9th division, and has been employed in the Office near thirty years; he is a hosier as well.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know one Wells? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he? - A. A letter-carrier and sorter.</p>

               <p>Q. At what number did he attend? - A. At the 9th division.</p>

               <p>Q. What is become of him? - A. He has absconded, he being in arrears to the Office.</p>

               <p>Q.Wells would be nearer to No. 8, and so would Foxlow, than the prisoner's place of division? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM NEWTON sworn. - I am clerk in the Bank, and produce a Bank-note, dated the 14th of July, 1802, No. 6413, for 5l. entered on the 21st of April, as received of Esdaile and Co.</p>

               <p>JOHN BOYLES sworn. - I am a clerk in the Bank, and received a list from Esdaile's house on the 21st of April, the total of which was 1741l. there were seventy-eight 5l. notes; we have nothing to do but to see that they are good; this was a good Bank of England note before it was cancelled.</p>

               <p>ROBERT GARFORD sworn. - I am clerk to Mess. Esdaile and Co. bankers to the Receiver-General of the Post-office; I received a parcel of notes from the Receiver-General's late on the 20th, which I counted over, and made the entry on the 21st.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Who delivered the notes to you? - A. I do not recollect; there are no dates and numbers entered; the particular notes are not specified in any book in our house.</p>

               <p>DANIEL STONE, Esq. sworn. - I am Superintending President of the Inland Office: On the 14th of July I pointed the prisoner's name out to him on this note, and asked him whether it was his writing; at first he hesitated, and said, he was not quite certain whether it was or not; afterwards he said he believed it was; I asked him where he had received it; he said, he had either received it from Foxlow, or some person who kept a public-house in his walk, and he said, he had paid it to the Receiver-General.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.He said, he paid it to the Receiver-General, and the name of Langbridge was at full length on the note? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you, whether a person belonging to the Post-office would be so mad as to pay it again into the Post-office, if he had stolen it from it? - A. I should think not.</p>

               <p>Q. The persons who carry letters about the town, are a good deal in the habit of getting change for notes? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know that Foxlow is much in the habit of receiving others cash, and giving them notes for it? - A. I have understood so from himself.</p>

               <p>Mr. FRANCIS NALDER sworn. - I am one of the City Marshals; this examination was taken in my presence, and signed by the Lord Mayor, the prisoner, and myself.(Examination read:)</p>

               <p>"The examination of John Langbridge, a letter carrier, employed by the General Post-Office, taken before me, Charles Price, Esq. Mayor of the City of London, and one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said City, this 17th of June, 1803. - The said John Langbridge, a letter carrier, says as follows: The Bank-note, now produced, I paid to the Receiver-General on the 20th of April, and the name of Langbridge on the Banknote is my writing; I received the note of Foxlow before nine the same morning; I gave him change in gold and silver for it; I gave the note, together with the rest, as my payment that morning, being 8l. 4s. 8d. to Atkinson, or Smith, to pay to the Receiver-General; I have been in the habit some months of giving Foxlow all the change I could accumulate, for which I was to have something out of every hundred; I gave Foxlow change in gold and silver for it; there might be a guinea, two half-guineas, and some seven-shilling pieces, or it might be all silver; it appeared that half-guineas and seven-shilling pieces would be as desirable as silver at that time; I have taken many one of Foxlow, and did not think of marking them; I am clear I did take it of Foxlow; I have not taken one five-pound note since of any other person; the Bank-note, now produced, No. 6413, dated 14th July, is the same I received of Foxlow, and paid into the Receiver-General's office; I have taken fifteen or sixteen five-pound notes of Foxlow at different times, and have put my name on some of them, but not all; I have taken many notes, and not put my name on them; I know Bowles, who keeps a public-house, in Seething-lane; I have not received any five-pound notes of Mrs. Bowles for five or six months past."</p>

               <p>Further examination, taken 20th of June, 1803, - "Says that Atkinson, or Smith, or one of them, was the person he left the money with that morning; it is impossible for him to say which of them, but he is conscious he paid it to one before he went out on his delivery, and before nine o'clock in the morning."</p>

               <p>MATTHEW ATKINSON sworn. - I am a letter carrier; this is the bill that was paid into the Receiver on the 20th of April; it is not my writing, but Mr. Tadbumter's, who was the charge-taker; I believe I took the money into the Receiver on the 20th of April, and I make a mark upon the list when I receive the money of each man, but I will not swear I received the prisoner's.</p>

             sworn. - I received a letter from the prisoner on the 15th, but, in consequence of removing, it is mislaid, and I cannot find it; I recommended the prisoner to the Office two years ago, in consequence of the recommendation of another person.</p>

               <p>ANTHONY FOXLOW sworn. - I am a letter carrier in the Post-Office, and have been thirty years in the walk I have now; I live in Lamb-street, Spital-fields, and keep a hosier's shop; I know the prisoner since last January; I collect what silver I can to carry to a banker's, and the prisoner, as well as others, brought me what he had to spare, and I gave Bank-notes for it, but that could not be more than three times a week; with the prisoner it might be once or twice a week generally, at what we call the first round, a quarter before eight in the morning, when we have most spare time at the Post-Office; I always took the Bank-notes with me, as I had not time to seek them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember having any transaction with him on the 20th of April? - A. Not the least in the world.</p>

               <p>Q. If you had any transaction, and got any change, how could you have paid him? - A.With a note out of my book that had been in my pocket ever since the day before.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any recollection what you did on the 20th? - A.Nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon no occasion did you do it but with notes you brought from home? - A. I am clear of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060041"></xptr>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You stood at No. 9, and the prisoner at No. 11? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. A letter intended for No. 8, could not get to No. 11 but by mistake? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. By the same mistake it might get to No. 9? - A. Yes, it might.</p>



               <p>Q. Supposing a person, standing at No. 9, was inclined to take a letter from No. 8, he would have a better opportunity of doing it than a person at No. 11? - A. No doubt of it, No. 11 is not so near by eight or ten yards.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you acquainted with Wells? - A. Not much, about as much as with the prisoner; I never got change of him, he had other people to oblige; I believe he did accommodate me once or twice when he wanted to borrow some money.</p>

               <p>Q. How many persons come to No. 8 or 9 at the time the letters are sorted? - A. At No. 9 there are nine in number, and eight or nine at No. 8.</p>

               <p>Q.Then there would be eight or nine people nearer this lot than those at No. 11? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.And No. 7 is as near as No. 9? - A. Yes, there is only the partition of the seat between.</p>

               <p>Q.You were examined upon this business? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you always put your name on the notes you pay? - A. Yes, they will not take them of me without.</p>

               <p>Q. You have said it, and I give you leave to retract it, for I have two or three people to prove the contrary - do you mean to swear, that, whenever you gave a note in exchange for cash, you always put your name on the notes? - A. I did not intend to say I always had done so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you have not, in many instances, passed notes to persons in the Post-Office without putting your name to them, upon your oath? - A. If I have done so, I have told them they must put down the numbers.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not done it? - A. Yes, I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know one Dennett? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not often given him notes without putting your name on them? - A. I cannot say, he knows best; not to my knowledge; I do not mean to say what is false, I would rather acknowledge I had done so than that I had not; I believe I had but two or three transactions with Dennett; I had no meaning for it if I did, but I will not swear I did not; I might do it.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever happened to be suspended before this took place? - A. Yes, once.</p>

My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - It has been told to your Lordship that I have been in the habit of giving Foxlow change for notes for several months past; I did, on the 20th of April, give him gold and silver, for which he gave me that note; and I do declare most solemnly, I have not received, or taken, or given, any person change for any five-pound note for eight months whatever; when I was before Mr. Parkin, I was asked from whom I received it; I did not hesitate in stating it; Foxlow was present, and Mr. Parkin told him it became him most seriously to account how he came by it, to look at the note, and see if he could recollect from whom he had it; we were then ordered to withdraw, and we went home about our business; we were told there would be no more examinations at his house, but on Friday, the 17th, we must attend the Lord-Mayor; I was the first that attended at the Mansion-house on that day, agreeably to Mr. Parkin's order; I was first examined, and my examination went to prove I received it of Foxlow, and of no other person; the Lord-Mayor asked me several times to recollect, and I am under the necessity of stating, that a more partial case never was known; he asked me whether I could not recollect whether I did not receive it of another person; I could not charge a person from whom I had not received the note; we were ordered to withdraw, and attend again on the Monday following; we attended again, and during this time Mr. Foxlow had made all the interest he could, and every thing was devised that could be thought of, to throw it upon me; I was then ordered to the Compter, to be provided with every thing necessary, and to have my friends to see me, at the expence of the Post-Office: I was ordered to attend again on the Monday following, and then he had got those gentlemen about him, and I was ordered to be tried; I have a number of friends also. Foxlow tells you, he has been suspended no more than once; more than once or twice he has been charged with robbing the seal of his brother officers of their letters, and he has been suspended for that; he has been only suspended when four, five, or six others were dismissed for embezzling Government money, for which he was glad to pay 175l. to save himself from disgrace. During all the time I filled that situation, I have endeavoured to discharge my duty as became a man, and I have a number of friends, if it is necessary to call them, to my character. I hope that your Lordship's mind, and the Jury under your Lordship's direction, will be perfectly satisfied of my innocence.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lettercarrier, and have been so two years; I know Foxlow, and have often given him cash for Banknotes within the last twelve months, twenty or thirty times, or more; when I first gave him change, they used to be signed A. F. at the top, but he has discontinued it, and I have not asked him to do it; one time I gave him forty guineas in gold, and he gave me forty-two pounds in notes, not one of which was signed; a little before this circum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060042"></xptr>stance, I gave him cash for a twenty-pound note, and that was not signed; and at several other times.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Don't you know, that, by the direction of the Post-master, you are to put your names upon the notes you pay in? - A. I know it now, and first knew it by seeing it stuck up in the Office; I always put his name on those notes myself that Foxlow gave me.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

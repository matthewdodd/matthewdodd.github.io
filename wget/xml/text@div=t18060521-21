               <p>Q. I suppose you have linen drapery goods hanging about your window. - A. We have; she went suddenly from the window, I went after her on suspicion, I found a piece of printed cotton under her arm under her cloak, I brought her back to the shop, and Mr.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that she suddenly went off, you do not mean to say that she ran off. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you venture to swear to this property, if you had gone into any place whatever, and you had seen this cotton produced, could you have ventured to have sworn to it. - A. If it had my employer's mark on it, if I had known that he had not sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot be confident of what is sold but by yourself, other persons sell in the shop as well as yourself. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You can only swear that you did not sell it, but you cannot swear that any other person might not have sold it. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. The other shopmen are not here. - A. They did not see any thing of the transaction.</p>

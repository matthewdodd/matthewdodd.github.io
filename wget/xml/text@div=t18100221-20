            ; they took him away, and two other lodgers with him. About half an hour after they had taken them to the watchhouse, the prisoner came back into the room where me and my child was sitting; he took the candle and candlestick off the table. I asked him where he was going with it. He twirled round with a stick that he had in his hand, and said that if I said a word he would knock off my bloody head. The prisoner went out of my room with the candle. I thought I heard a noise as if he was going up and down stairs, but I heard nothing more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing taken out of your house that night - A. A great coat and a pair of sheets. I did not miss them till next morning; they were in the room where the men broke in up stairs, in the lodger's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the watchmen had been in that room - A. Yes, and a great mob of people after the watchmen went into that room.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen these things before this happened - A. On the day before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the things again - A. No, only the candlestick.</p>

            . I am an headborough of St. Luke's. I searched the prisoner's lodgings on the 22d of January; the prisoner's wife was in the room. I found the candlestick there; the prosecutrix took it off the mantlepiece, and said it was her property. The prisoner was down at Greenwich at that time. The prisoner came to town, and gave himself up to go before the magistrate. I told him I had been to his lodging and found the candlestick; he said he had heard of it before.</p>

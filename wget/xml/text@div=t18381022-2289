                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Coleshill-street, Pimlico, in the parish of St George, Hanover-square. On the 23rd of August I left for Margate, and left the prisoner White in charge of my house—she was sot in my service at that time, but had lived three times servant with me before—I left her entirely in charge of my house—the articles stated in the indictment were at that time all locked up in the bed-room and back-par<lb></lb>lour, which is my bed-room—I locked both those rooms, and took the keys with me—she was to live in the kitchen, and sleep in the back-room on the first floor—she had no authority to go into the rooms that were locked up—I said I should be gone a fortnight, or it might be more or less—I returned on the 3rd of September, without giving any notice—I got home it half-past six o'clock in the evening—I knocked at the door, and found nobody at home—I waited an hour, and then the prisoner came, and I went into the house with her—I told her to get a fire and get my tea—I then went into my bed-room, and found it was unlocked and open, and the front room also—I saw the appearance of somebody having been there—I called her up, and said, "I have been robbed, it appears—you must know something about it"—she said, "Oh God!"—that was all she said—I went to the door, and called Mr. Newman, a tenant of mine, next door, to come in—I sent him for a policeman, who came and searched the place—every drawer was stripped, except some which had books in them—I missed all the articles stated—the watches and things were locked in drawers, which were wrenched open, and I lost about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of articles.</p>

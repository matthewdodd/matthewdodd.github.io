On the 15th of July, about two o'clock in the morning, I was suddenly awoke by a knocking at my door - I got up, and by the light of the lamplighter's torch, I found my window shutter down, and the window broken, which I had fastened up myself the night before. I found my door was tied with a cord, got a person outside to undo it, and the lamplighter came in. I missed several copper and tin goods out of the window. I fastened the house up, and went into Boston-street, and at the end of that street there were several boys and girls lurking about some carts. I went to the end of Boston-place, and on looking round the corner, saw James and

I knew them before perfectly well - not hearing their conversation, I went into Boston-street, to get behind them, and when I came round the watchman came up - they had moved from where I saw them, and joined some girls and boys, and went in among some cottages; this was about half-past three o'clock in the morning. I then went home for a quarter of an hour - I returned again into Boston-street, and on looking round the corner, I saw Crawford and Charles Dixon place themselves against a white cottage, opposite Boston-street, and very soon after Phillips and

The parish labourers came to sweep the streets. I requested one of them (Pheney) to go to the opposite corner, and see what they were about; he very soon returned, beckoning to me. I went over, and found a basket containing copper and tin goods - I did not see the prisoners at that time; they were within ten yards of the spot where the basket was at the first conversation.

            . (Looks at a great number of pieces of thread lace produced by Driver) They have been cut off cards of lace, which I have in my possession, they tally exactly; I had all these things at the time the prisoner came to live with me; I counted them over by an inventory which I keep by me, and I am sure they were all there when the prisoner came; it is my general method to look over them once a month.</p>
               <p>Did you compare them with the inventory before the prisoner? - No; I missed all the things during the time the prisoner was in my service: there were 15 rows of pearls in the necklace, seven rows were taken away; I know them by their being on cotton thread as they came over from India; they exactly correspond with the eight rows left behind.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination of the Prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoner lived with you? - This last time.</p>
               <p>No, all together. Whether when you was in France you did not send her to England to fetch some valuable things to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she bring them faithfully to you? - Some she brought safe, some she did not.</p>
               <p>You had a very good character with her from the place where she lived, after she left you, when you took her again? - I had; but afterwards the gentlewoman discovered she had lost some things, and was sorry she had given her a character.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see what was in it? - No.</p>
               <p>To DRIVER. When you found the bundle, did you go to the prisoner? - Yes, at the request of Mr. Norton; she was then in Tothil-fields Bridewell; I asked how she could be so wicked as to say she knew nothing of the bundle; she protested she never did.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. I object to this evidence; a constable being sent to a woman in order to ask her questions is exceeding improper.</p>
               <p>COURT. My objection arises from the words of the man,</p>
               <p>"how could you be so wicked," it carries terror in the very manner of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman in Newgate-market, and live at No. 53, Myddleton-street, Clerkenwell—the prisoner was my errand-boy. On the 9th of March I sent him out with some meat—I cannot swear whether there was two shins of beef among it—there was one I know—I put a ticket of the weight on the meat—I know I lost a shin of beef by the deficiency of weight—there was 11 stone given to him, and he only delivered 10 stone 31bs.—I cannot swear to the shin of beef now product being mine—I had an excellent character with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I have my meat from the prosecutor. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 9th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Holborn, and met the prisoner with a tray of meat—he put it down near a count, took from it a shin of beef, tied it in a handkerchief, and then proceeded up Holborn—I followed, and saw him give the shin of beef to the witness Lovitt, who sells apples in the street—I followed him to my house, and charged him with the offence—he at first denied it, and afterwards said he was sorry—I asked him for the ticket of the weight of the meat—he re<lb></lb>fused—I gave him into custody, and the ticket was found on him at the station—the meat was 71bs. short of the weight named in the tickets, and the shin of beef made up the weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The shin of beef was for a Mr. Logsden, and was on the top of the other meat; I wanted a rest, and stopped at a court where a bar goes across; I slid the tray off my shoulder, and found the beef slipping; I tied it in my handkerchief, intending to hang it on the corner of my tray, but found I could not do it; I went on as far as Furniva-inn, and them changed my. tray from my right shoulder to my left, and placed the shin of beef between my legs; I said to the woman, "I wish you would mind this for me till I come back, I am just going round the corner." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> I saw him put the shin of beef between his legs, he seemed as if he could not tell how to get rid of it—he had come with heavier loads to my house—he was only about twenty yards from my house at the time he gave the beef to Lovitt.</p>

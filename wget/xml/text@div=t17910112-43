On Wednesday, the 12th of January last, I had some clothes drying in a garden at the bottom of a grass-plat; on going out of my own house, I observed one part of the clothes lying on the ground; I went a little farther, when I observed that the prisoner at the bar had that moment either cut or pulled the line down from the post, by which means the whole line of clothes was down; immediately as they were down, he began at the end of the line at which he stood, gathering up the clothes, walking along as he picked them up; upon seeing me, he ran to the corner of the garden; he ran about eight or ten paces with the clothes in his arm, and threw them down over some palisades; from thence he jumped over into the turnpike road; and I pursued him, and took him back into the garden where the clothes were, and asked him why he put them there? he denied being in the garden; I desired my servant to take care of the clothes; and I took him to the watch-house, and gave him to the care of the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you lose sight of the man, before you took me? - It is impossible, from the situation of the place, but what I must; but I only lost sight of him while I opened the front gate; I am positively sure that is the man; there was no one else in sight whatever.</p>

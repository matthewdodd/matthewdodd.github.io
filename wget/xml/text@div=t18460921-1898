                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in Park-terrace, St. John's-wood, Marylebone—my shop has two counters, one on the right side and one on the left—I have a glass door between the two. On the 26th of Aug., between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a gold watch—I put out three gold watches, with gold dials, on the glass-case on the left hand counter, for him to look at—he took up one—while he had it in his</p>

               <p>hand he said he did not like gold faces, he wanted a white face—the white-faced watches were on the other side of the counter, in the window—he could have seen that from the street—I went round to the other counter, and took three white-faced watches from the right hand window—the prisoner crossed over towards that counter—in doing so he passed the glass door—I had left two of the gold-faced watches on the glass case, and he had one in his hand—he crossed over to me—I did not observe it in his hand then—while I had the white-faced watches in my band, and before I showed them to him, another person came in, with a coat or cloak on his left arm, and asked if I could take a stone out of a pin—I said, "Yes"—he stood close by the prisoner, who was at the right hand counter—I walked back again with the tray in my hand, with the gold watches in it, and when I came to the left side of the counter, there were only two watches there—the person who asked about the pin had gone out before I got back to the other side—he went out in a moment before the prisoner came to the other side—he could not reach the watches where the prisoner originally stood—they were on the left hand side—when I got to the other side I missed a watch—I told the prisoner, "I put three gold watches on the glass-case here"—he never said anything—I mentioned it twice, and the third time I had the tray in my hand I walked round and said, "You have got a watch of mine, and I will have it; if you have not got it your friend has"—he did not say anything—I sent for a policeman—before I gave him in charge, he said, "I remind you you roust know what you are doing"—I afterwards saw Taylor, the witness—the passage between the two counters is two yards wide—it may be more.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>.) I am shopman to Mr. Keiser, and am watchmaker to him. On the evening of the 26th of Aug. the prisoner came—my master was on the left hand side of the shop, and went over to the right—I was on the right hand side—the prisoner said he wished to purchase a gold-cylinder watch—he spoke English—I speak very little English, but I can always understand it—Mr. Keiser showed him three watches—he said he did not wish one with a gold dial, but with a white dial—Mr. Keiser had none with silver faces on that side of the shop—he came round to the other side of the counter, where I was at work, and took some white-faced watches out of the window—while so doing another person came two steps into the shop, and asked Mr. Keiser if be could take a stone out of a pin—Mr. Keiser said, "Yes, I can"—the man said he would call to-morrow to have it done, and turned round sharp, and ran out of the shop—he did not come further than</p>

                  </hi>. On the 26th of Aug. I was servant to Mrs. Dixon, of Wellington-terrace, St. John's-wood. About half-past six o'clock that day I went out with Mrs. Dixon to go down Baker-street, which is a very little distance from Mr. Keiser's shop—I saw two persons on the other side of the street—the prisoner was one of them—the other had a cloak or coat on his left arm—they crossed over in front of us—directly they got past mistress they stopped and looked at mistress, and I stopped and looked at them—the prisoner stood right in front of me—I am quite certain he is one of them—mistral had a gold watch and chain exposed to view—the prisoner could not see the watch behind her—they were coming down Baker-street, in the direction of Mr. Keiser's shop—I afterwards went to a shop with my mistress—when we came back my mistress went into a shop two or three doors from Mr. Keiser's—I went on, and when I got opposite Mr. Keiser's I saw the prisoner sitting in the shop against the counter—I knew him to be the same man as I had seen with the person carrying the coat or cloak—I saw a policeman go into the shop before that.</p>

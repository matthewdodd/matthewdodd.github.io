On 1st June, a few minutes past 12 a.m., I was on duty in Thomas Street, Limehouse, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Wallwood Street—he looked up and down Thomas Street several times, and then returned the way he came up Wallwood Street—I ran to the corner, and saw him standing at the corner of Strathfield Street—he stood there about a minute, then returned and leaped over the wall in Wallwood Street—I walked across the road and signalled the constable on the adjoining beat; he came to my assistance, and I sent him for another constable who was close at hand—I then went to the wall where the prisoner went over; it is about 5 feet high—I remained there—there is a yard on the other side of the wall and the rears of houses.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 592). I was on duty in Thomas Street, at 12.15, on the morning of 1st June—I saw Orme signal for assistance—I went to him—in consequence of what he said I went for another con<lb></lb>stable and posted him in Thomas Street, opposite where the prisoner was likely to escape from—I then got over the wall pointed out by Orme, crossed over several walls from one yard to another, and had to climb over till I came to the rear of 19, Strathfield Street, where I saw the prisoner tampering and fumbling about the back kitchen window looking into the yard—as soon as he saw my light turned on him he jumped over a low wall into the next yard—I followed him—getting on to a low wall, then on to a wall a little higher, he gained a stack of timber, jumped from one stack to another, and dropped into a timber-yard, climbing a plank that was raised against a shed 15 feet high—crossing the roof, he dropped on to some barrels at the rear of Thomas Street, where he was turned by two constables coming over a wall—he then jumped into a back yard in Acland Street, crossing several yards and walls till he came to the rear of Strathfield Street, a second time regaining the stacks of timber—he sprang from one stack to another till he gained the roof of a workshop, a building about 30 feet high—I followed him, he going to the extreme end of the roof—seeing that his capture was imminent, he walked down the slates to the gutter-pipe—I told him it was useless trying to escape; he could not get away—he said "For God's sake don't hurt me, and I will come to you"—I told him I would not hurt him if he came quietly—he came to me and I took him into custody—we both stood up in the centre of the roof and came towards the end where he had got up—when about 2 or 3 feet off the end he suddenly seized me by the collar of the coat with both hands, at the same time raising his knee he kicked me in the privates with his knee—we were standing up at the time; it is a very broad roof, but a slanting one—the kick caused me to feel very faint; at the same time he was swinging me about from side to side, attempting to throw me from the roof—I had my truncheon drawn at the time, but I dared not release my hold of the prisoner to strike him with it—I called loudly for assistance, when 102 K (Talbot) and 328 (Wilson) came to my assistance—Talbot struck the prisoner over the left arm with his staff; the prisoner then released his hold of my collar and he was secured and taken to the station—on searching him I found the knife produced—I afterwards went back to 19, Strathfield Street, examined the back kitchen window, and found marks of violence between the two sashes—they were bright marks such as might be caused by the knife, indents of the same breadth as the blade—there was also a sawing-like mark on the catch—the washhouse<lb></lb>door was open—that is part of the dwelling-house at the rear of the house—there is a door leading from the washhouse to the kitchen—the proprietor called my attention to foot marks in the washhouse, which I traced to the kitchen-window; this knife bears marks such as would be caused by the catch of the window; it is jagged—at the station the prisoner was charged with burglary, and assault on me and attempting to throw me from the roof of the building, 30 feet high—he said he had got over there to sleep, having no money; he had walked from Birken<lb></lb>head—on the way to the station he said "For God's sake speak the truth"—I have spoken the truth.</p>

I was on duty with Wilson in Thomas Street on 1st June, at a quarter to 1—from informa<lb></lb>tion we received we went to the wall in Thomas Street—we heard foot<lb></lb>steps coming towards us among some barrels which are piled up by the wall—I heard somebody sing out "Look out, there he goes"—we then heard footsteps retreating from the wall—I immediately jumped upon the wall on to a party-wall which parted the gardens from each other—the prisoner jumped out from between the barrels on to this party-wall—I told him to stop—he did not, he ran towards where Martle was coming from—seeing Martle, the prisoner jumped into a garden on the right—I followed him up to a high wall, and got on to the timber and saw him and Martle struggling on the top of the shed—I told the prisoner to be quiet or let go his hold—he refused, he still kept struggling, trying to throw Martle off—I then drew my truncheon and struck him a blow on the left arm twice—we then got him from the roof and took him to the station—I subsequently discovered his lodging—his statement about coming from Birkenhead is false.</p>

The Prosecutor deposed that as he was going along he saw the Prisoner standing by Dukes Place about 7 a Clock, who carry'd him to the <placeName id="t17200907-18-crimeloc91">Standard Tavern in the Minories</placeName>

The Prosecutor being ask'd if he knew the Prisoner before, and why he did not prosecute her sooner; said that he knew her by going by his Door frequently; but was ashamed to appear in Court to prosecute her. Mr. Russel deposed that the Prosecutor is his Tenant, and told him 5 or 6 Months ago that the Prisoner had pickt his Pocket of 7 Guineas, but that he did not care to expose himself. The Prisoner denied the Fact, or that she ever was in his Company, and said that she had that very Day (being St. Andrew's) taken two Rooms next Door to the Prosecutor, and had some Friends who supt with her at home that Night, and was not out; but she hearing that the Prosecutor had raised this false Report upon her, and his Wife had flouted at her as she past by, saying I love a Whore, but I hate a Pick Pocket Whore: she Arrested him the Saturday before to clear her Reputation, and on the Monday he brought this Prosecution; and called the following Evidence to prove it, Her Landlord deposed, that she took Rooms of him about a Month before Christmas, but could not be positive to the Day. Another deposed, that he and some Friends supt with her that Night (he was sure it was St. Andrew's) at her Lodgings, that he went between 4 and 5 and staid till past 10, that the Prisoner was at Home all the while, and he left her there. Another Evidence deposed, that the Prosecutor came to Mr. Mitchel's in George Yard, and enquired for one

            , but they knowing no such Person, he described her, saying she was very much Pock-broken, Red Hair, her Eyes black with beating and a cut cross her Nose, and said that she had pickt his Pocket of Seven Guineas the Night before, at the Standard Tavern. Mr. Mitchel's Servant confirmed the last Evidence in every particular: She likewise called several to her Reputation, who gave her a very good Character. It was also observed that if the Prosecutor knew her so well, and saw her so often, he need not have gone back to the Tavern to enquire who she was, nor elsewhere next Day and describe a Person the very reverse of the Prisoner. The Jury looking upon it to be a base Prosecution, <rs id="t17200907-18-verdict92" type="verdictDescription">

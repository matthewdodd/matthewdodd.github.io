            , not yet taken and brought to Justice.</p>
               <p>Although this Indictment hath made a Distinction between the several Prisoners, and divided them into two Classes, of Principals and Accessaries; yet the Law makes no Distinction in the Crime. And in case all the Prisoners are guilty of the Charge in this Indictment, they will be all equally liable to the same Judgment, and Punishment.</p>
               <p>In the outset of this Trial I shall not enlarge upon the Heinousness of Murder in general; nor shall I dwell upon those many Circumstances of Aggravation, attending this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801160012"></xptr> Murder in particular. When I come to mention those aggravating Circumstances of Cruelty and Barbarity, in the course of this Trial; I doubt not but they will have all that Effect upon the Gentlemen of the Jury, which they ought to have; to awaken and fix your Attention to every part of this bloody Transaction; and to balance that Compassion which you feel for the Prisoners, though they felt none for others. The Effect I mean these Circumstances should and ought to have, is, to clear the way for that Justice, which the Nation expects and calls for from your Determination and Verdict.</p>
               <p>To comply with this general Demand of Justice upon the Prisoners, his Majesty (ever attentive to the Good and Welfare of the Kingdom, the Preservation of his Subjects, the Protection of the Innocent, and the Punishment of the Guilty,) in order to give the Prisoners the earliest Opportunity of proving their Innocence, and of wiping off this soul Suspicion of Murder they now lie under; or if guilty of a Breach of the Laws of God and Man, that they may suffer the Punishment due to their Guilt; his Majesty has been pleased by a Special Commission, to appoint this Trial to be before their Lordships, not less knowing in the Laws, than tender and compassionate in the Execution thereof.</p>
               <p>I cannot here omit taking Notice of the unhappy Cause of this fatal Effect, now under your Consideration. Every one here present, will in his own Thoughts anticipate my Words; and knows, I mean Smuggling. Smuggling is not only highly injurious to Trade, a Violation of the Laws, and the Disturber of the Peace and Quiet of all the Maritime Counties in the Kingdom; But it is a Nursery of all Sorts of Vice and Wickedness; a Temptation to commit Offences at first unthought of; an Incouragement to perpetrate the blackest of Crimes without Provocation or Remorse; and is in general productive of Cruelty, Robbery, and Murder.</p>
               <p>It is greatly to be wished, both for the sake of the Smugglers themselves, and for the Peace of this County, that the dangerous and armed manner now used of running uncustomed Good, was less known, and less practised here.</p>
               <p>It is a melancholy Consideration to observe, that the best and wisest measures of Government, calculated to put a stop to this growing Mischief, have been perverted and abused to the worst of Purposes. And what was intended to be a Cure to this Disorder, has been made the means to increase and heighten the Disease.</p>
               <p>Every expedient of Lenity and Mercy was at first made use of, to reclaim this abandoned set of Men. His Majesty by repeated Proclamations of Pardon, invited them to their Duty and to their own Safety. But instead of laying hold of so Gracious an Offer, they have set the Laws at Defiance, have made the execution of Justice dangerous in the Hands of Magistracy, and have become almost a Terror to Government itself.</p>
               <p>The number of the Prisoners at the Bar, and of others involved in the Suspicion of the same Guilt, the variety of Circumstances attending this whole Transaction, the length of Time in the completion thereof, and the general expectation of Mankind to be informed of every minute Circumstance leading and tending to finish this Scene of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801160013"></xptr> Horror, will necessarily lay me under an Obligation of taking up more Time, than will be either agreeable to the Court, or to myself.</p>
               <p>To avoid Confusion in stating such a Variety of Facts, with the Evidence and Proofs thereof; and to fix and guide the Attention of the Gentlemen of the Jury to the several particular Parts of this bloody Tragedy, at last compleated in the Murder of Chater; I shall divide the Facts, into four distinct Periods of Time.</p>

               <p>This will take in the barbarous usage of Chater at Mills's House; a Consultation of sixteen Smugglers in what manner to dispose of Chater, and their unanimous Resolution to murder him.

               <p>But the Murder of Gally is not the Object of your present Consideration, nor do I mention his Name, either to aggravate this Crime, by taking notice of his Murder also; nor to inflame the Jury against the Prisoners at the Bar. But I do it, for the sake of Method, and for the purpose only of laying the whole Case before the Jury; for the Story of Chater's Murder cannot be told, without disclosing also what happened to Gally his Companion, and Fellow-sufferer.</p>
               <p>To begin with the first Period of Time. Some Time in September, 1747, a large Quantity of uncustomed Tea had been duly seized by one Captain Johnson, out of a Smuggling Cutter, and by him lodged in the Custom-House of Poole, in the County of Dorset.</p>
               <p>In the Night of the Sixth of October following, the Custom-House of Poole was broke open by a numerous and armed Gang of Smugglers; and the Tea which had been seized and there lodged, was by them taken and carried away,</p>

Dimer was afterwards taken up upon Suspicion, of being one of those who had broke open the Custom-House of Poole, and was in Custody at Chichester for further Examination, and for further Proof that he was one of that Gang.</p>

Their direct way to Stanstead, lay near to Rowland's Castle; but Jenkes and the two Austens, carried them to Rowland's Castle, that Sunday about Noon; where this cruel Plot was first contrived, and in part carried into Execution.</p>
               <p>The Malice conceived by the Prisoners against Chater, from what I have already mentioned, appears not to have arisen, from any Injury or Suspicion of Injury, done by the Deceased to the Prisoners. But because Chater dared to give Information against a Smuggler; and to do his Duty in assisting to bring a notorious and desperate Offender to Justice; he was to be treated with the utmost Cruelty, his Person was to be tortured, and his Life at last destroy'd. What avail the Laws of Society, where no Man dares to carry them into Execution? Where is the Protection of Liberty and Life; if Criminals assume to themselves a Power, of Restraining the one, and Destroying the other?</p>
               <p>Having mentioned the Motive of the Prisoners to this Murder; I shall now open to you (what I proposed in the second Period of Time) a Scene of Cruelty and Barbarity, tending to the Murder of Chater; begun at Rowland's Castle, by the two Prisoners Jackson and Carter, in Company with others; and from thence continued, until Chater was brought to the House of

            . But upon Gally's coming out to them, and interposing to prevent Chater's making any Discovery, they quarrelled with Gally, and beat him to the Ground, Gally complained of this ill usage, and said he was the King's Officer, and to convince them shewed his Deputation.</p>
               <p>Chater and Gally were very uneasy at this Treatment, and wanted to be gone; but the Gang insisted upon their staying; and in order to secure and get them entirely into their own Power, they plied them with strong Liquors, and made them drunk; and then carried them into another Room to sleep.</p>
               <p>During the two Hours Chater and Gally slept, the Letter was taken out of Chater's Pocket; whereby it appeared that Chater was going to give Information against Dimer. The Secret being thus disclosed to the Gang; the next thing to be considered of by the Smugglers, was how to save their Accomplice Dimer; and to punish Chater and Gally, for daring to give Information against him. For that purpose, whilst Chater and Gally were asleep, several Consultations were held.</p>
               <p>It was first proposed secretly to convey Chater and Gally into France; at that Time at War with England.</p>
               <p>The second Scheme was, for all present to contribute Three Pence a Week, for the Maintenance of Chater and Gally, who were to be confined in some private Place, and there subsisted, until Dimer should be tried. And as Dimer was done unto, so Chater and Gally were to be dealt with.</p>
               <p>The third and last Proposal, was to murder both.</p>
               <p>With a View and Intention to execute this last, and the most cruel Proposal; Jackson went into the Room about Seven of that Evening, where Chater and Gally lay a sleep, and awaked them. They both came out very bloody, and cut in their Faces; but by what means, or what Jackson had there done to them, does not appear. They were immediately afterwards forced out of the House by Jackson and Carter; the others present and consenting and assisting: Richards, one of the Company, with a cock'd Pistol in his Hand, swore he would shoot any Person through the Head, who should make the least Discovery of what had passed there.</p>

            . After they had been thus carried about one hundred Yards from Rowland's Castle; Jackson cried out to Carter and the Company, Lick them; Damn them, Cut them, Slash them, Whip them. Upon which, they whipped and beat them over their Heads, Faces, Shoulders, and other Parts of their Bodies, for the space of a Mile. With this cruel Treatment, they both fell down under the Horse's Belly, with their Heads dragging upon the Ground. They were again put upon the Horse, and tied as before; and whipped and beat with the like Severity, along the Road for about another Mile. And when they cried out through the Agony of their Pain; Pistols were held to their Heads, and they were threatned to be shot, if they made the least Noise or Cry. Being unable to endure this continued and exquisite Pain, and to sit on Horseback any longer; they fell a second Time to the Ground. By this inhuman Usage, they were rendered incapable of supporting themselves any longer on Horseback. Gally was afterwards carried behind Steel; and Chater behind Heward. The Prisoners Jackson and Carter, with the rest of the Company, still continued their merciless Treatment of Chater and Gally, but instead of whipping, they now began to beat them on their Heads and Faces, with the Butt end of their Whips, loaded with Lead. When they came to Lady Holt Park in Sussex, Gally almost expiring with the Torture he had underwent, got down from behind Steel; and it was proposed to throw him alive into a Well adjoining to that Park; in which Well, Chater was three Days after hanged by the same Gang. Gally was then thrown across the Pummel of the Saddle, and carried before Richards. He was afterwards laid along alone upon a Horse, and supported by Jackson, who walked by him. And was at last carried before Sheerman, who supported him by a Cord tied round his Breast. When they came to a Lane called Conduit Lane, in Rogate Parish in this County, Gally in the Extremity of Anguish; cried out, I shall fall, I shall fall. Upon which Sheerman swore, Damn you, if you will fall, do then; and as Gally was falling he gave him a Thrust to the Ground; after which Gally was never seen to move, or heard to speak more.</p>

             the elder, first appears to be privy, and consenting to the intended Murder of Chater. A Private House was thought much more proper and safe for the Confinement of Chater, than a Publick House, at all Times open to every Man; and therefore Chater was to be removed from Scardefield's. The Prisoners and their Companions being no Strangers to old Mills, but his intimate Acquaintance, and Confederates in Smuggling; where could Chater be so secretly imprisoned, as at the Private House of the Elder Mills? And where could he be more securely guarded, than under the Roof of one of their own Gang? With these Hopes and Reliance, and in full Confidence of the Secrecy and Assistance of old Mills, Chater was brought to his House by Jackson and Sheerman, when they came there, they told old Mills, they had got a Prisoner; he must get up, and let them in, old Mills got up, and received Chater his Prisoner; whose Face was then a Gore of Blood, many of his Teeth beat out, his Eyes swelled, and one almost destroyed. I shall here omit one or two particular Circumstances, which the Witnesses will give an Account of; which shew that old Mills also, was void of all Tenderness and Compassion.</p>
               <p>Chater was received by him as a Prisoner, and a Criminal; and therefore was to be treated as such. Old Mills's House itself, was thought too good a Prison for him; and therefore he was soon dragged into a Skeeling or Out-house, adjoining to the House; wherein Lumber and Fuel was kept. And though Chater was in so weak and deplorable a Condition, as to be scarce able to stand; yet to prevent all chance and possibility of his Escape, he was chained by the Leg with an Iron Chain, fastened to a Beam of the Out-house. He was guarded Night and Day; sometimes by Sheerman, and sometimes by Heward who came there that Monday Evening. Thus he continued in Chains, untill he was loosened for his Execution. But least he should die for want of Sustenance, and disappoint their wicked Designs; he was to be fed, and just kept alive, until the Time and manner of his Death was determined. During the whole Time of this Imprisonment; old Mills was at Home, and in his Business as usual. He betrayed not the Trust reposed in him. He acquainted nobody with what had happened, nor with whom he was intrusted. But like a Gaoler, took Care to produce his Prisoner for Execution.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday the 17th of February, there was a general Summons of all the Smugglers then in the Neighbourhood of Scardefield's House, who had been concerned in breaking open the Custom-House at Poole; to meet that Day at Scardefield's. Upon which Notice, all the Prisoners (except old Mills) came that Day to Scardefield's. And there were also present,

               <p>Tapner, in order to make good what he had before said (and happy had it been for him, had he shewn more Regard to his Actions, and less to his Words) after Chater had been forced over the Pales which fenced the Well, pulled a Rope out of his Pocket, put it about Chater's Neck, fastened the other End to the Pales, and there he hung Chater in the Well, until he was dead.</p>
               <p>But soon after the Body was let loose, and had fallen to the Bottom of this Well, which was dry, one of the Accomplices imagined he heard Chater breath, and that there were still some Remains of Life in him.</p>
               <p>To put an End to a Life, so miserable and wretched, they threw Pales and Stones upon him. This was the only Act, that had any Appearance of Mercy and Compassion; and it brings to my Remembrance, the Saying of the wisest of Men, fully verified in this fatal Instance of Chater's Murder - The Mercies of the Wicked, are Cruelty.</p>
               <p>I am now come to the fourth and last Period of Time.</p>
               <p>And here it is observable, that although Providence had for many Months permitted this Murder to remain undiscovered, yet it was then disclosed and brought to Light, when the appointed Time was come, and an Opportunity given, to apprehend and bring to Justice many of the principal Offenders.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801160019"></xptr>Upon the 17th of September last, Search was made in Pursuance of Information given, for the Body of Chater. And the Body was found with a Rope about it's Neck, covered with Pales, Stones, and Earth, in that Well I before mentioned, close by Lady Holt Park, in a Wood called Harrass Wood, belonging to Mr Carryll.</p>
               <p>By the Length of Time, from February to September, the Body was too much emaciated, to be known with any Certainty. But by his Boots, Cloaths, and Belt, there also found, it evidently appeared to be the Body of the unfortunate Chater.</p>
               <p>I have now opened to you the Substance of all the most material Facts; and should the Proofs support the Truth of those Facts, no Man can doubt the Consequence thereof, that Chater was murdered, and that the Prisoners were his Murderers.</p>
               <p>Mr Smyth, another of the King's Counsel, also spoke as follows, viz. May it please your Lordships and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am likewise of Council against the Prisoners at the Bar, three of whom are indicted as Principals for the Murder of

            , the other four as Accessaries before the Fact to that Murder.</p>
               <p>The Crime they are charged with, is one of the greatest that can be committed against the Laws of God and Man, and in this particular Case attended with the most aggravating Circumstances.</p>
               <p>It was not done in the Heat of Passion, and on Provocation, but in cold Blood, deliberately, on the fullest Consideration, in the most cruel Manner, and without any Provocation: The Occasion being as you have heard, only because he dared to speak the Truth, he had seen Dimer passing through Fordinbridge, and had made Oath of it before a Magistrate, being required so to do.</p>
               <p>This Prosecution therefore, is of the utmost Importance to the publick Justice of the Nation, and to the Safety and Security of every Person; not only in this County, but in the Kingdom; for if such Offenders should escape with Impunity, the Consequence would be, that no Crime could be punished. It would teach Highwaymen, Housebreakers, and all other Criminals, to unite in the Manner those Men have done, and whoever received Injuries from them, would not dare complain, or take any Steps towards bringing them to Justice, for Fear of exposing themselves to the Resentment and Revenge of their Companions.</p>
               <p>Our Constitution therefore, which must be supported by a regular Administration of Justice, and a due Execution of our Laws, depends in some Measure, on bringing such Offenders to condign Punishment; and 'tis to be hoped a few Examples of this Kind, will restore the Peace and Tranquillity of this Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801160020"></xptr>In shortly stating the Facts, I shall endeavour to point out to you the Share, which every one of the Persons at the Bar had in this Murder.</p>
               <p>In October 1747, the Custom-house at Poole was broke open; the Smugglers who did it, in their return passed through Fordingbridge, a Town in Hampshire, where Chater saw Dimer among them; and having declared so, was obliged to make Oath of it before a Magistrate; on which Information Dimer was taken up and committed to Chichester Goal for further Examination; and on the 14th of February, Chater was sent by the Collector of Southampton, in Company with Gally, with a Letter to Mr Battine, Surveyor-General of the Customs, in order that Chater might see if the Man in Chichester Goal, was the same-Person he saw at Fordingbridge.</p>
               <p>These two Men having enquired their Way at the New Inn at Leigh, one Jenks undertook to direct them, and carried them to the Widow Paine's at Rowlands-Castle, who saying she feared they were going to do the Smugglers some Mischief, sent for Carter and Jackson, Steel, Raiss, Richards, Sheerman, and Heward, who having made Gally and Chater drunk, and seen the Letter to Mr Battine, consulted what to do with them. Some proposed to murder them, others to send them Prisoners to France, and others to confine them, till they saw what became of Dimer, and to treat them as he was dealt with.</p>
               <p>Carter and Jackson having sent Jenks away, this poor Man and Gally were left absolutely in the Power of them and the other Smugglers; and indeed, into worse Hands he could not have fallen; had he been taken Prisoner in Battle by our Enemies, he would have had Quarter, and been treated with Humanity; had he fallen into the Hands of Enemies of those Nations who give no Quarter, his Lot would have been immediate Death; but as it was his hard Fate to fall into the Hands of Smugglers, he was to have neither Quarter or immediate Death, but was reserved to suffer the most cruel Usage for several Days, and afterwards murdered.</p>
               <p>These poor Wretches, after having been beat and abused at Paine's by Carter and Jackson, and the rest of the Gang, were carried away by Force, both set on one Horse, with their Legs tied under the Horse's Belly, and whipt and beat by Direction of Carter and Jackson, till they fell; then were set up again in the same Manner, and whipt and beat again, till they fell a second Time; and were then set on separate Horses, and used in the same Manner, till Gally had the good Fortune to be delivered by Death from their Cruelty; after which they carried Chater, who was bloody and mangled with the Blows and Falls he had received, to Scardefield's, at the Red Lion at Raike, who observed Jackson's Coat and Hands to be bloody; and while Carter and the rest buried Gally, Jackson and Sherman carried Chater to old Mills's in the Night, between the 14th and 15th of February, where he was chained by the Leg in the Skeelling, or Outhouse, till the Wednesday Night following, and Sheerman and Heward guarded him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801160021"></xptr>Imagine to yourselves the Condition of this unhappy Man, certain to die by their Hands, uncertain only as to the Time, and the cruel Manner of it; suffering for three Days and three Nights, Pain, Cold, and Hunger; and what was infinitely worse, that Terror and Anxiety of Mind, which one in his Situation must continually labour under; he must doubtless envy the Condition of his Companion Gally, who by an early Death was delivered from the Misery he then endured.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday following, being the 17th of February, (all the Prisoners at the Bar except old Mills) met at Scardefield's and there were present also seven more; at which Meeting they consulted what to do with Chater, and it was unanimously agreed by all the thirteen then present, to murder Chater; and young Mills, the prisoner at the Bar, particularly advised it; and said, if he had a Horse, he would go with them to do it; and either then, or at another Meeting at Scardefield's, when Carter and Jackson said, that as they came along, they brought Chater by a steep Place thirty Feet deep, young Mills said, If I had been there, I would have called a Council of War, and he should have come no further.</p>
               <p>This being determined, the Prisoners Tapner, Cobby, Hammond, Carter, and Jackson, together with five more of that Company, went to old Mills's, where they found Chater chained, and guarded by Sheerman and Heward, and told him he must die; he said he expected no other; Tapner then said he would be his Butcher, and taking out a Knife, cut him twice cross the Face; on which old Mills said, Don't murder him here, but take him somewhere else first.</p>
               <p>Tapner, Cobby, Hammond, Carter, Jackson, and the rest, who came there together with Sheerman and Heward, then carried him away to murder him; Sheerman, Heward, and Richards, having been concerned in Gally's Murder, said, the rest should kill Chater, and therefore went away at Harting; Carter and Jackson having been likewise concerned in Gally's Murder, when they came to Lady Holt Park Gate, turned in there, and left the others; having first told them, the Well is a little Way off, you can't miss it, 'tis fenced round with Pales, to keep the Cattle from falling in.</p>
               <p>Tapner, Cobby, and Hammond, and the rest, went then to the Well, where Tapner put a Rope about Chater's Neck to hang him; and some of the Pales being broken down, Chater would have crept through, Tapner would not let him, but made him climb over the Pales, weak as he was, and then hanged him in the Well about a Quarter of an Hour, till they thought him dead; then having drawn him up till they could take hold of his Legs, they threw him headlong into the Well; and fancying they heard him breath or groan, threw Posts and Stones in upon him, and went their Way.</p>
               <p>The Terror this Act of Cruelty had spread through the Country, stopt every Person's Mouth, who had it in their Power to give any Information; so that the Body<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801160022"></xptr> was not found till September last, when it was so putrified and consumed, as not to be known, but by the Belt which was about it, and which Chater's Wife will prove to be her Husband's. If there was any Doubt as to the Identity of the Man, we could shew likewise, that being examined by the Smugglers just before he was murdered, he said his Name was

               <p>It appears therefore from this State of the Case, that all the Prisoners are guilty of the Indictment; Tapner was present at the Consultation at Scardefield's, and was the Person who hanged him; Cobby and Hammond were present at the Consultation, helped to carry him to the Well, and were present at the Murder, and therefore equally guilty with Tapner, as Principals. Carter and Jackson took him away by Force from Paine's, and by the Treatment of him there and on the Road, shewed an Intention from the first to murder him, though perhaps the particular Death he was to suffer, was not then agreed on; they were afterwards present at the Consultation at Scardefield's, where it was resolved to murd er him, and went almost to the Well with him; and when they parted, gave those who murdered him, particular Directions to the Well.

             was also at the Consultation, and particularly advised and directed the Murder, in which he declared he would have joined, if he had a Horse. Old Mills, though he kept no Publick-house, and therefore was not obliged to receive Guests, receives this Man brought in the Night, in a bloody and deplorable Condition, Chater is chained in his Outhouse from Sunday Night till Wednesday; yet Mills never discovers it to any Person, or uses any Means to deliver him, which is a strong Evidence of his Knowledge and Approbation of their Design; and when Tapner declared he would be his Butcher and cut him, old Mills expresses no Disapprobation of the Murder, does not dissuade him from it, but desires him not to do it there, but carry him some where else first, which shews his Approbation of the Fact; though to secure himself as he thought, from Punishment, he would have had it committed at some other Place.</p>
               <p>This, Gentlemen, is the Fact, which shews, that securing themselves and their Companions, was not their principal Aim; were it so, they would have murdered this Man as soon as they had him in their Power; but their Motive seems to have been Revenge, and a Disposition to torture one, who should dare to give any Information, which might bring them or their Friends into Danger.</p>
               <p>After hearing the whole Evidence, if these Men appear innocent, God forbid they should be found guilty; and I would not have the cruel Circumstances of the Fact, incline you to believe any Thing we suggest, that is not supported by the strongest Proof : But if the Fact is proved beyond a Possibility of Doubt, to be in the Manner we have stated, I am sure you will do your Duty, and by a just and honest Verdict, deliver your Country from Men so void of Humanity.</p>

This was about the Middle of the Day, or something after. That the Widow Paine asked him if he knew these Men, or whether they belonged to his Company; he told her they were going to Mr. Battine's, and that he was going to shew them the Way; she then said she thought they were going to do Harm to the Smugglers, and desired him to set them out of the Way, which he refused to do; she then seemed uneasy, and she and her Son consulted together; that her Son went out, and the Prisoner Jackson came in in a little Time; that the Prisoner Carter, and several more, came thither soon afterwards. He knew none but Jackson and Carter. That Jackson enquired where the two Men were bound for, and the Man in the light Coat answer'd, they were going to Mr. Battine's, and from thence to Chichester; but Carter was not by at that Time; that the two Strangers had some Rum, and Jackson called for a Mug of Hot, which was Gin and Beer mixed, or something of that Kind, and to the best of his Knowledge they all drank together; he did not see any ill Treatment, nor either of the Men bloody whilst he was there; that he went away between one and two, and left the two Men there; the Widow Paine called him out of Doors, and told him his Brother Jenkes wanted to speak to him; when he came out, his Horse was at the Hedge by the back Door, and his Brother said he wondered why the two Men did not go away; upon which he went back again into the House, and his Brother was uneasy because he did so; that the Widow Paine advised him to go Home, and said the two Men would be directed the Way; he was uneasy at going without them, because he saw so many Men come in, and imagined they had a Design to do some Harm to them; that when he went away, Jackson and Carter were left with the two Men, to the best of his Knowledge; and Jackson, as well as the Widow Paine, persuaded him to go Home. He was positive that Jackson and Carter were there, for he knew them very well.</p>

He saw the Man in the blue Gaberdine pull a Parchment out of his Pocket, and heard him tell the People he was the King's Officer; his Wig was then off, and there was Blood upon his Cheek; that he saw a Letter, which he understood to be going to Mr. Battine; one Kelly, and the Prisoner Carter, had it in their Hands, but he did not know how they came by it; he did not see the Directions of the Letter; he observ'd it was broke open, when he saw it in the Hands of Carter and Kelly; and he understood, by the Discourse of the Company, that it was a Letter which the two Strangers were to carry to Mr. Battine, but he never heard it read.</p>

Galley likewise said he was an Officer, and shewed his Deputation to the People that were in the Room; the Company continued drinking till Galley and Chater were quite fuddled, and went into a little inner Room to sleep; this was about four or five o' Clock, and they continued in the little Room two or three Hours; the rest of the Company sat drinking all the while, consulting what to do with Galley and Chater. The Prisoners, Jackson and Carter, and Little Sam, Little Harry, Richards, and the Witness, were at this Consultation. It was proposed to put them (Galley and Chater) out of the Way, because they should not appear against the Shepherd, meaning Dimar, and it was proposed to throw them into the Well in the Horse Pasture, about half a Mile from Rowland's Castle, but it was thought not convenient to put them into a Well so near, for fear of a Discovery; it was then proposed to join, and each Man to allow them three Pence a Week, and to keep them in some secret Place till they saw what became of Dimar, and as Dimar was served, so these two People (Chater and Galley) were to be served; this was talked of while Chater and Galley were asleep, and there was no other Proposal made as he heard: But while they were talking these Things, the Wives of Carter and Jackson said it was no Matter what became of them (Galley and Chater) or what was done to them; they ought to be hang'd, for they were come to ruin them, meaning the Smugglers: That about seven o'Clock Carter and Jackson went into the inner Room, and waked Galley and Chater, and brought them out of the Room, very bloody and very drunk; he did not see what pass'd in the Room, but was sure they did not go in so bloody; and he believed Jackson and Carter had kicked and spurred them; they set Galley the Officer upon a brown or black Horse, and Chater up behind him; Jackson, Carter and Richards put them on Horseback and tied their Legs under the Horse's Belly, and also tied their Legs together; they then tied a Line to the Bridle, and he (the Witness) got upon a grey Horse and led them along; that just after they turned round the Corner about 20 or 30 Yards from the House, Jackson cried out whip them, lick them Dogs, cut them; it was then dark, and the Company whipped and lashed them with their Horsewhips, some on one Side and some on the other, with great Violence on the Face and Head and other Parts of the Body, and continued doing so while they rode about half a Mile to a Place called Wood's Ashes; that there they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801160030"></xptr> alighted and Little Sam gave all the Company a Dram or two, but none to Galley and Chater; that as soon as they were mounted again Jackson and Carter cried out, damn them, lick them, whip them, and they were whipped as before for about a Mile further, and then they fell down under the Horse's Belly with their Heads upon the Ground and their Legs over the Saddle; they were immediately set up again, and their Legs tied together in the same Posture; and the Company went on whipping them as before, till they came to a Place called Goodthrough Dean, which was about half a Mile further; they were beat very much, and in the Judgment of the Witness it was almost impossible they should sit their Horses; when they came to Dean somebody of the Company pulled out a Pistol, and said he would shoot them (Galley and Chater) thro' the Head if they made any Noise whilst they went thro' the Village; he could not tell who it was that threatned to shoot them, but apprehends it was done for fear the People in the Village should hear them; they went on but a Foot Pace, and after they got thro' Dean they were whipped again as before, and when they came near a Place called Idsworth they fell down again under the Horse's Belly, and then some of the Company loosed them, and set up the Officer (Galley) behind him, (the Witness) and Chater behind Little Sam, and in this Manner they proceeded towards Lady Holt Park, which is near 3 Miles from Idsworth, whipping Galley and Chater as before, but the Lashes of their Whips falling upon the Witness, as he sat before Galley, he (the Witness) could not bear the Strokes, and therefore they left off whipping Galley in that Manner; Galley sat upon the Horse till they got to Lady Holt Park, and then being faint and tired with riding, he got down and Carter and Jackson took him one by the Arms and the other by the Legs, and carried him towards a Well by the Side of Lady Holt Park; that Jackson said to Carter, '' We'll '' throw him into the Well,'' to which Carter replied, with all his Heart, and Galley seemed indifferent what they did with him; but some of the Company saying it was Pity to throw him into the Well, Jackson and Carter set him up behind the Witness again, and Chater was still behind Little Sam; they went on in this Manner 'till they came to go down a Hill, when Galley was faint and tired, and could not ride any further, and got down there; upon which Carter and Jackson laid him on a Horse before

               <p>Upon which, Mr. Justice Foster opened to the Jury the Substance of the Indictment as before set forth; and told them that whether the Prisoners or any of them were guilty in Manner as therein they are severally charged, must be left to their Consideration, upon the Evidence that had been laid before them.</p>
               <p>That in order to enable them to apply the Evidence to the several Parts of the Charge, it would be proper for him first to acquaint them how the Law determines in Cases of this Nature; that with regard to the Persons charged as Principals, whereever several Persons agree together to commit a Murder or any other Felony, and the Murder or Felony is actually committed, every Person present aiding and abetting is, in the Eye of the Law, guilty in the same Degree, and liable to the same Punishment as he who actually committed the Fact. And the Reason the Law goes upon is this, that the Presence of the Accomplices gives Encouragement, Support, and Protection to the Person who actually commits the Fact: And at the same time contributes to his Security.</p>
               <p>That it is not necessary that the Proof of the Fact, in Cases of this Nature, should come up to the precise Form of the Indictment. For if the Indictment charges that A did the Fact, and that B and C were present aiding and abetting, if it be proved that B did the Fact, and that A and C were present aiding and abetting, they will be all guilty within the Indictment.</p>
               <p>That Accessaries before the Fact, are those who not being present in any Sense of the Law at the time the Fact is committed, have advised or otherwise procured the Fact to be done. These Persons in the Case of wilful Murder, will be liable to the same Punishment as those who committed the Murder, by their Instigation, Advice, or Procurement.</p>
               <p>* He then summed up the Evidence very largely, and applied it to the Case of the several Prisoners, and concluded, that if upon the whole, the Jury should be of Opinion that either of the Principals (Tapner, Cobby, Hammond, or the others charged as Principals in the Indictment) did strangle the Deceased, and that the Prisoners, Tapner, Cobby, and Hammond, were present aiding and abetting, they will be within this Indictment.</p>
               <p>* Note. The Particulars of the Judg e's Charge to the Jury in summing up the Evidence, are omitted. Because thro' the Mistake of the Short-hand Writer, which is mentioned in the Advertisement at the Beginning, the State of the Evidence is now reduced to so narrow a Compass, that the inserting the Judge's Charge, would have been little more than a Repetition of the Evidence, in the same Order as it stands in the Trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801160038"></xptr>And if they should be of Opinion, that the Prisoners, charged as Accessaries, before the Fact did advise, consent to, or procure the Murder, they likewise will be guilty within this Indictment, tho' they were not present when the Fact was committed.</p>
               <p>The Jury, after some little Consideration, gave their Verdict, that Tapner, Cobby, and Hammond, were <rs id="t17480116-1-verdict14" type="verdictDescription">

            , and to which they had pleaded, Not Guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steele opened the Indictment to the Jury, and Mr. Bankes, the King's Counsel, spoke to much the same Purport as the Day before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smyth, another of the King's Counsel, spoke as follows, viz. I shall only add a Word or two, to explain to you why these two Men, who were convicted Yesterday as Accessaries before the Fact to the Murder of Chater, and thereby liable to suffer Death, should be tried a second Time, as Principals, for the Murder of Galley.</p>
               <p>The Reasons for it are, in the first Place, it will be necessary to convict them as Principals for the Murder of Galley, otherwise the Accessaries to that Murder, either before or after the Fact, cannot be convicted.</p>
               <p>Another Reason is, as the Intention of all Prosecutions, as well as Punishments, is not so much to revenge and punish what is past, as to deter others from committing the like Crimes; it may be of Service to the Publick to have every Circumstance of this cruel Transaction disclosed, to shew how dangerous to their Neighbours, and to the Country in general, those Persons are, who are concerned in Smuggling, and how much it concerns every Man to use his utmost Endeavours to suppress, and bring them to Justice; and it may have another good Effect, in preventing Persons from engaging in that lawless Practice, when they see it consequentially engages them in Crimes, which at first they might never intend; for I believe, if these unhappy Men had been told, when they first began Smuggling, that the Time would come when they would cooly bathe their Hands in the Blood of two innocent Men, (bad as they now are,) they would then have been shocked, and startled at the very Imagination of it; yet Men are so naturally led from one Vice to another, that having once transgressed the Laws of their Country, they have insensibly arrived at such an Height of Wickedness, as to commit this heinous Crime without the least Hesitation or Remorse.

               <p>He was then asked, whether the Gravely Knap was in the County of Southampton or County of Sussex ? answered, That he could not tell; that he had never heard, as he remembered, what County that Place was in, but he was carried thither last Friday, to see the Place, and he shewed to some People, then present, the Spot of Ground where Galley fell off the Horse, and he believed he should know one of the Men that were with him.</p>

               <p>Deliberate Murder is most justly rank'd among the highest Crimes human Nature is capable of; but those you have respectively been convicted of, have been attended with Circumstances of very high and uncommon Aggravation.</p>
               <p>The Persons who have been the Objects of your Fury, were travelling on a very laudable Design, the Advancement of publick Justice. For this they were beset in their Inn, tempted to drink to Excess, and then laid asleep in an inner Room, while a Consultation was held in what Manner to dispose of them; and in the End a Resolution was taken to carry them to some distant Place, and to dispatch them by some Means or other.</p>
               <p>In Consequence of this Resolution they were set on Horseback, and exercised with various Kinds of Cruelty for five Hours together, 'till one of them sunk under the Hardships he suffered, and dyed upon the Road.</p>
               <p>The other was carry'd to a Place of safe Custody, there kept chain'd on a Heap of Turf, expecting his Doom for three Days. During this dreadful Interval, a second Consultation was held, and a Resolution taken to dispatch him too: Not a single Man, of thirteen who were present, offering one Word in his Behalf.</p>
               <p>He was accordingly hurry'd to his Death; and though he begged earnestly to live but one Day longer, that small Respite was deny'd him. I will not repeat every Circumstance; but I cannot forbear putting you in Mind of one. When the poor Man was told he must die that very Night, some of you advised him to say his Prayers, and accordingly he did address himself to Prayer.</p>
               <p>One would have hop'd that this Circumstance should have softened your Hearts, and turned you from the evil Purpose you were bent upon. Happy had it been for you, if you had then reflected, that God Almighty was witness to every Thing that pass'd among you, and to all the Intention of your Hearts!</p>
               <p>But while the Man, under great Distraction of Thought, was recommending his Soul to Mercy, he was interrupted in his Devotion by two of you, in a Manner I scarce know how to repeat.</p>

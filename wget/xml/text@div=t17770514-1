               <p>I kept the ring locked up in a case in a chest of drawers in the room where the prisoner lay; we took her into the house in charity; she said she was in distress, but had a very large estate coming to her: I saw the ring on Saturday night, and missed it on Sunday afternoon.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker: I took this ring in pawn of the prisoner on Saturday night; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>I came into Mr. Smith's house; they pretended to be very fatherly and good to me, having a little dependence coming to me, he said, he would see me righted if I would make him a will and power; and he sent for a lawyer in order to deprive me of my property; Mrs. Smith came down into the kitchen, and said, as I had been so good to the family, she did not know how to make me amends, and put the ring on my finger; I wore the ring till Saturday night, then being in distress I pawned it.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. SMITH. Did you give her the ring? - No; I shewed her the ring, but never delivered it out of my own possession.</p>
               <p>Did you consent to her taking it? - No.</p>
               <p>After you had shewn her the ring, did you put it into the drawer? - I put it into the case, and then into my drawer, and locked it.</p>
               <p>When you found it missing, was the lock broke? - No.</p>
               <p>How was it opened? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. She gave me some diamond ear-rings at the same time; I pawned the ring for a guinea, bought some asparagus and other things, and gave her the change, and gave it her.</p>

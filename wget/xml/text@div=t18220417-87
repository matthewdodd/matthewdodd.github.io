On Monday, the 25th of March, the prisoner came to my shop, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I never saw him before; he looked out a number of goods, amounting to 28 l. 13 s. I made out an invoice in the name of Captain Pascoe, by his desire. He represented himself as the Captain of the Lively from New York. I was to send the goods down to the dock on the following morning. He wrote a cheque in my presence; for which I gave him 1 l. 7 s. in change - (I produce it), he went away immediately; I directly sent my son with the cheque. It was not paid.</p>

I have been there five years, and am perfectly well acquainted with their customers, and all their correspondents. No ship of the name of Lively was consigned to us. I know no Pascoe.

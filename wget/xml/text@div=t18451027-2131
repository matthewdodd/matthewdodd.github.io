On the 18th of Oct. my attention was called to a bag, containing a quantity of iron bolts, con<lb></lb>cealed in a yard behind some large gates, the property of the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway—I concealed myself some dis<lb></lb>tance from it, with another constable—the prisoner came in a few minutes, walked deliberately through the gates, directly to the bag—I saw him stoop down, but then lost him in the shade—I heard the sound of iron, as though he was putting them into his pocket; and as he was passing through the gates out, I followed him, and took him into custody—I found on his person sixteen bolts—I went back, and found three bolts in the bag, cor<lb></lb>responding with those on his person—after completing the search, I remarked there were only sixteen found on the prisoner—he replied, "I only took eight, and if I get over this job I will go to sea again."</p>

Lant-street—Mallows lodges in that house—on Wednesday, 2nd Feb., at a little before twelve o'clock. I was in the yard—I saw Mallows take two sheets from a line in Porter's yard, go into the water-closet, fold them up, and then come and take the shift—I went into my own house, and soon after Mrs. Porter came and knocked at my door, and I told her what I had seen—we ran up to Mallows' door—she was not at home—she came home at half-past four o'clock, intoxi<lb></lb>cated, and said she was perfectly innocent—we told her if she would acknow<lb></lb>ledge it we would not give her in charge—she still denied it, and we gave her in charge.</p>

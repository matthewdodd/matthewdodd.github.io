                  </hi>. I am a journalist and Parliamentary reporter, carry<lb></lb>ing on business at 13, Paternoster Row—I know the defendant; I was introduced to him in September, 1865, upon a proposal to raise 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me upon the security of certain moneys in the hands of the Accountant<lb></lb>General of the Court of Chancery—Mr. Elworthy suggested, haying heard I was proprieter of a newspaper, that I should add that to the further security of the stop order of the Court of Chancery—I waited upon Mr. Elworthy at his office, in Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane, on Satur<lb></lb>day, 30th September, 1865, about making a declaration—I went with my wife, having seen him the day previously, and arranged by appointment to attend at his office—several papers were produced to me, among others the draft declaration—I perused that declaration; it was written on an ordi<lb></lb>nary long sheet of draft paper which solicitors use, like a sheet of letter paper laid out longways; it was blue paper, and I think there was a back sheet to it—I found it necessary to make alterations in the draft—I believe I made those alterations with a pen, sitting at his table—the first altera<lb></lb>tion was, he had described me as the sole registered proprietor of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100088"></xptr>
               <p>newspaper, and I explained to him that the registration was not quite complete, for, although I had given the notice at Somerset House as re<lb></lb>quired by the Act of Parliament, the registration was not technically com<lb></lb>plete until the printer and publisher had attended and given sureties to the Crown against libels, which, however, was no part of my duty—I said, "We will strike out the word 'registered,' leaving it simply sole pro<lb></lb>prietor"—acting upon that, I struck out the word "registered"—follow<lb></lb>ing that, or in the same sentence, was this expression, "Registered as such at Stationers' Hall, in the City of London," or words to that effect—I have been over twenty years connected with newspapers, and was aware there was no such place of registration as Stationers' Hall; that attracted my attention immediately, and I struck out those words—the next alteration was this: in a sentence or two afterwards he had got the word "unen<lb></lb>cumbered"—I explained to him that at one time I had not been the sole proprietor, but had had only a reversionary interest in a portion of the copyright, and there might be some question arise as to whether I had encumbered it, and I struck out the word "unencumbered"—I don't think I made any further alteration; the rest was merely formal matter; I have no doubt whatever about the three I have mentioned: first, as to being registered; secondly, as to being registered at Stationers' Hall; and thirdly, as to the word "unencumbered"—after making these alterations I handed the draft declaration back to him, and shortly after that he said, "Will you step in the outer officer while I have it copied; or, as it is a fine morning, will you go and take a walk for half an hour, and come back again?"—having my wife with me, I said, "We will go for a walk in' Staple Inn, in the gardens, and return"—I and my wife then went away—we came back at twenty minutes to three—Mr. Hopwood, the solicitor, of Chancery Lane, who took the declaration, was there then; he was standing at the door with his hat on, and the handle of the door in his hand—Mr. Elworthy said, "I am glad you have come back; it is a short day with us, and I was afraid Mr. Hopwood would not be able to wait"—he then handed me the declaration—I saw that it was not in the same form as the draft; it was a printed one that he handed to me then. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Carter objected to any evidence being given of the contents of the draft de<lb></lb>claration, in the absence of any notice to produce it. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi> did not seek to give evidence of the contents, but merely to identify the paper; if how<lb></lb>ever, evidence of the contents were necessary, the defendant had received a summons referring to the draft, and the indictment also mentioned it. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLES</hi> stated that he would receive the evidence, and reserve the point if necessary.</hi>) I see by my signature that this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the document that was placed in my hands the second time—I never read it; I never had it in my hand, except as I have now; I was about to read it through, when Mr. Elworthy said, "You need not trouble yourself to read it; I have copied it myself, instead of letting the clerk do it, and you may depend it is all right," or words to that effect—he being my solicitor, I took his word for it, and signed it—it is a fact that he was my solicitor; he held my retainer—I have since heard the document read—it does not correspond with the draft as I handed it to Mr. Elworthy; there are several variations—I believe the word "registered" is retained in this document. (<hi rend="italic">The declaration was put in and read: it contained the words, "I am the registered and sole proprietor;" also, "they are both unen<lb></lb>cumbered</hi>") Within three or four weeks after this, Mr. Elworthy began making threats as to what he would do to me; he began to insist upon the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100089"></xptr>
               <p>declaration as I had signed it; he began to make threats that he would put me in Newgate if I did not pay him some money—I never saw the paper again until my trial; I believe it may have been handed to me at Bow Street, I am not quite sure, but I never saw it till a public occasion like that, one of the occasions—I attended at Bow Street on a charge of perjury nine or ten times—there were two summonses and several adjourn<lb></lb>ments, and both dismissed—I have never seen the draft declaration since—at the Guildhall Police-court, when Mr. Elworthy was under examination with reference to this charge, a paper was shown to me which was pre<lb></lb>tended to be the draft declaration; it was a small half-sheet of note-paper—I was asked if that was not the thing I called the draft declaration. (<hi rend="italic">It was put in.</hi>) I never saw that paper till I saw it at Guildhall the other day; it was not the draft, it was some private memorandum of his own, which I never saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see it has some reference to shares; can you explain that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a previous conversation on another day he asked me if I had any shares in any public stock; I mentioned some, and, amongst others, the Asiatic Banking Corporation, in which I had five paid-up shares; I suppose it refers to that—I first saw this piece of paper at the hearing of my case at Guildhall last month—the agreement says I was to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that very day (30th September); I did not get any at all; he got the money, I did not; I got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday—ultimately I had 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a cheque from the defendant, and the rest in instalments from his father, who is his partner—the whole arrangement for which I had made the bargain was rendered utterly useless—I had no money at all on the day it was proposed to be paid; the contract was to advance me the money on that Saturday, 30th September—I got the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on that day, too late for banking hours—90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether was advanced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much was repaid of that 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had the order to receive the whole amount at any moment he liked after the 2nd November, when the Courts opened—he got 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in November, I paid him myself; I went with him to the Accountant-General's, and received 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a cheque, which I handed to him—I was present when the 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him, that was late in November, 1865—that money was paid by me to him in respect of this mortgage—I was subsequently tried at this Court—I defended myself—I suffered two months' imprisonment, I believe that was the smallest sentence his Lordship could pass: I went to trial, of course depending upon seeing the draft declaration—I came out of prison on 27th March last, and he caused me to be arrested at the door of the prison—I took proceedings immediately afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have had a good deal to do with legal matters, I believe, on both sides of the Court, civil and criminal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My busi<lb></lb>ness has been to attend the Law Courts for many years—I have only had actions with these people—I and my sister have not issued any writs against Mr. Elworthy—I suppose Mr. Elworthy was acting as solicitor for Mr. Honey, I don't know—I believe I have issued one writ against honey in relation to this matter—I will swear I have not issued seven, I believe only one; that action is pending now—I issued that writ the day before he commenced these proceedings against me, I believe, last year; it was for a claim against defendant's client and two other persons jointly, and criminal proceedings were taken against me to prejudice my action against them; I have no doubt of it—I got this money through Mr. Elworthy's hands—I went to him as a solicitor, because I was in want of money—Mr. Jenkins was not acting as my solicitor at that time; he took me to Mr. Elworthy's office—Mr. Jenkins is not a solicitor—he had been some years ago—at the time I signed this declaration, and after, he was certainly not acting as my solicitor—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I cannot help what he signed upon a document—it does not say there that he was soli<lb></lb>tor for me, it is signed "James Jenkins, solicitor"—he did not, as my solicitor, take me to Mr. Elworthy's office to raise the money, he only went as an old acquaintance of mine; I knew him acting as a solicitor years ago—this paper appears to be an office copy of an affidavit—that is not my signature. (<hi rend="italic">This was an affidavit, sworn by the witness on 22nd January, 1866, in an action of "Honey v. Cannon, in which were the words, "Elworthy agreed with me and James Jenkins, my solicitor, that a sum of </hi>10<hi rend="italic">l. should be paid for interest</hi>") I am now able to answer, I was not before; a solicitor practising as a conveyancer may act as a solicitor, and in that sense he was my solicitor, but not in common law matters: that was an inadvertence; I had known him some years ago when he did act for me as a solicitor, but he did not take out his certificate for some years: I met him one day and asked him if he knew any one who would lend 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once—he said, "I will take you round to a friend of mine who does business in agency," and he took me to Mr. Elworthy: in one sense he was my solicitor; techni<lb></lb>cally he was not, legally he was—for the purposes of the mortgage thing he was my solicitor, but not for any other purpose—I believe the mortgage was executed on 7th October—the declaration was signed on 30th Sep<lb></lb>tember—I don't know that he had become disqualified between those dates—that affidavit I expect was drawn by Mr. Jenkins, and he put in the words "my solicitor."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The affidavit states the action was brought upon a promissory note; here is the original writ, that is not for a promissory note; how do you explain that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In this way: he served a writ in one case, and brought an action in another—he served me with a twelve-day copy of a writ for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a promissory note; I made an affidavit, and got leave to appear, on the ground of fraud, or something of that sort; then he pre<lb></lb>tended he had not brought the action on a promissory note, and delivered a declaration on the mortgage deed; that is my explanation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do attend to this, because really this document is entirely inconsis<lb></lb>tent with that account—here is a writ under the seal of the Court, dated 5th January, 1866, and your affidavit is dated 22nd January, 1866, so that the writ was long before the affidavit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I got leave to appear on the copy of the writ; I should state that there never was any copy served, an order was got for substituted service; there was no personal service—I believe I never received a copy of the writ; the copy is no doubt attached to the affidavit at the Judge's chambers, filed in the ordinary way—he had received 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., though he issued the writ for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave notice of trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CARTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend has said you defended yourself upon your trial here; he did not follow it up by the old adage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt, if he had, it would have been quite true; I believe if I had had super<lb></lb>natural powers I could not have helped myself in that case, with the startling perjury that was committed: I never could have believed that any solicitor in London would go to Bow Street and swear one thing, and then come here and swear the direct contrary; therefore I was not pre<lb></lb>pared with any defence—the paper now handed in as the draft, was not produced at my trial to my knowledge; it was never shown to me at my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100091"></xptr>
               <p>trial or any other time, except before the Magistrate—I never saw it be<lb></lb>fore my trial, unless it was at Bow Street—I have not sworn that I never saw it till May—I did not see it written; I don't believe I did—I gave Mr. Elworthy instructions, whether he took them down at the time I do not know—I will not swear I was not standing by when this piece of paper was written; he was writing at his table, and I was sitting at the other side—Messrs. Elworthy were perfect strangers to me, until Mr. Jenkins introduced them on 29th September—he asked me the questions about the shares and other matters, and very likely wrote down the par<lb></lb>ticulars—I do not know that this paper is in two persons' handwriting—I saw both the Messrs. Elworthy together when I went to the office—I went several times; sometimes both were there, and sometimes only one—I can't say the exact date I first saw the defendant; it was the latter end of the month—I did not go alone on the 29th; I went with Mr. Jenkins—I don't believe I first saw Mr. Elworthy, senior, and that he wrote down the nature of my application before his son came in—I won't swear he did not—I do not remember that his father said to him, "These persons are here making an application for money, you go on with it," and that he took the chair his father vacated and finished the remainder of the in<lb></lb>structions from my lips; they were together several times and alone several times—I don't see a very great difference in the handwriting of this paper; it is quite obvious that it may have been written afterwards—at the top there is a very little difference; two pens would make the dif<lb></lb>ference—one part is a little thicker than the other; I don't see any dif<lb></lb>ference in the writing—it is quite possible the latter part may have been added—I don't know that it was written in my presence—I tell you I never saw it till I saw it in this Court, I believe—I don't know that any instructions were taken down in ray presence; they were sitting at the other side of a desk; I could not tell from that distance what he was writing; he might have been writing that piece of paper or some other—questions were put to me as to what security I could give; I don't know whether the information I gave by way of answer was written down then and there; I swear I don't know—I dare say I told him what is written down there—I won't swear what he wrote; I don't know that he wrote that—I wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for three or four days—I had not got ready money—I had plenty of money at command, some thousands; I only wanted it on a particular day; it was not to pay wages, it was to take up two bills; I don't remember what they were now—I have not got my book here with the entry—no doubt I represented that I wanted a portion of the money by Saturday night for wages—the defendant did not give me his own cheque, because he could not get the money from his client; I saw the clerk bring in the money from Mr. Honey, at eleven o'clock in the day—the defendant gave me the cheque after banking hours; the cheque was no use to me; I do not call a cheque money; it was not a bit of use to me till Monday, when I got the money: it was paid on Monday—I did not swear that I got no money at all; I said I never got any money on the Saturday, which was all I bargained for, and for which I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was pressed for just 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for those two purposes, and I did not get it after all in the way I wanted it—I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he sent me in a bill and sued for it over again, and objected to his own receipt because there was no stamp to it; here is his receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were indicted here for making this false declaration, and out of it was struck the words "registered," "Stationers' Hall," and "unencum<lb></lb>bered;"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100094"></xptr>
               <p>what was left as security after all that was struck out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was not the security upon which I was borrowing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was bor<lb></lb>rowing it upon the money in Chancery, which was as good as a Bank post bill—I suppose the declaration was intended to show that I had not encumbered the fund; I had not encumbered it; the papers I had, that was what I told him at the time; that was why I struck out the word—when all this was struck out, he had still got the stop order—he declined to advance me the money upon what I produced, and required further security for the purpose of making out this bill, that was all; that is my belief; his client was amply secured before, as good as a Bank note—the money was in the Court of Chancery, and could not be got at by anybody but himself—this was intended as an additional security—I told him I did not mind how many securities I gave, because I was going to repay him the money—this was as a security, and very good security too—the words "Stationers' Hall" were most certainly in the draft declaration—I am quite certain of that—we had only one discussion upon that matter, I be<lb></lb>lieve—it was not struck out of the draft mortgage—anybody who has the slightest acquaintance with legal documents can see that that has been put in since; there are no initials to it—I am acquainted with legal documents, and I should have put my initials against the alteration before I signed it—I believe it has been done surreptitiously—if there is a second erasure without initials, I don't know that that proves anything; that may have been done in the same way as the first; it is a very important part, "and also the copyright"—I have been for some years connected with the pro<lb></lb>fession myself, and I believe I never signed a document without ticking the alterations in it; two solicitors having signed that, they would natu<lb></lb>rally have put their initials against it; as they have not, I say it is some evidence that these alterations were put in afterwards—I call "striking out" an alteration—if you look at the declaration you will find there is an alteration with initials to it, showing that was his practice, as it is in all solicitors' offices—I see that the words "Stationers' Hall" are struck through in the deed of 7th October; the draft of that document was no doubt discussed at the same time as the draft declaration, the week previous—I don't know whether the draft was sent to Mr. Jenkins; I have not the slightest idea whether Mr. Jenkins ever saw the draft—I don't re<lb></lb>member whether Mr. Jenkins sent the draft to me for my consideration—I know his writing—I think this in red ink is his writing; I should gay it was his; it is "Mr. Cannon says that this was not contemplated; see agreement, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. JENKINS</hi>"—this is the part struck out by Mr. Jenkins, "And whereas the said Thomas Cannon is the sole proprietor of the news<lb></lb>paper called the <hi rend="italic">South London News and Croydon Free Press</hi>, and is regis<lb></lb>tered as such both at Stationers'Hall and Somerset House;" I don't know that that was after I had signed the declaration on 30th September; I think very likely it was before—this is the rough draft of the deed; the deed was fully engrossed and made perfect on 7th October—the reference to Stationers' Hall is both in the draft mortgage and in the mortgage, and is struck out—I never saw the mortgage deed; that is, I never read it through; very likely the draft was sent to me by my attorney after the 30th September—I do not believe I ever saw it, though I will not swear I never did; but I do not believe I ever did—I saw the document that was prepared and executed from it—it contains the words that I struck out, according to your statement—I never read the deed, I looked through it to see if there are any alterations—I mean to swear that it was not read over</p>

               <p>to me before I signed it, and I never read it—Mr. Elworthy was acting as my solicitor, I trusted in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that document executed in Mr. Jenkin's office, and did not Mr. Elworthy senior, when it was brought to him, say, "I am not satisfied with this; I will have it re-executed in my presence;" and was not that done again, and did not he sign his name to it afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever of the sort to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Jenkins your solicitor or not; and did he or not sign that deed as your solicitor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He certainly did not sign it as my solicitor; I have explained what the relationship was between us—I never gave him authority to act as my solicitor in this matter—he was acting generally in matters in that way—I cannot explain it any better—he did not sign that deed as my solicitor, and act as my solicitor in the transaction, only as a friend; Mr. Elworthy was my solicitor—Mr. Jenkins told me that he was a very respectable man, and that I might employ him with safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CARTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that attestation all done in Mr. Jenkins's chambers before you went to Mr. Elworthy's office at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the old gentleman was present in his office at Southampton Buildings, where it was originally attested—he did not say that he would have it re<lb></lb>executed, that he might put his name to it as the attesting witness—nor did I re-execute it in his presence and Mr. Jenkins—I never executed it but once—I never signed it but once—I did not put my finger on it and say, "I deliver this as my act and deed;" no such thing; it was done by Mr. Elworthy himself, he has charged for it in his bill of costs; and here is his writ in the action, where he puts it down as work done as my solicitor in drawing the deed, and here is his bill of costs for it—there is no foundation for what you say—almost the first thing he said to me when I went into his office was, "If I am going to do this thing, you must give me your authority to act as your solicitor"—if this document contains the things which I say were struck out, I did not know it—the words "registered" and "Stationers' Hall" were in the draft declaration, and I struck them out—I do not believe I ever saw the draft deed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not in that very document, which you had time and opportunity to see and inspect afterwards, solemnly covenanted that you had full title and good right to convey that which you say you struck out because you had no such right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my answer is, I do not believe I ever saw the draft, and I am certain I never read the deed—I had good right and title to convey at the time I signed the deed—I was not the registered proprietor—it was not unencumbered—I did not covenant that it was—I say I had full title to convey; those words have been kept in purposely—Jenkins was acting as the friend of Elworthy more than my<lb></lb>self, and has been all through the piece—I say that Jenkins has been a transgressor; he has betrayed me—I have not applied for a summons against him, only against Mr. Elworthy—I applied for a summons against Honey, Digby, Atherton, and Elworthy, for conspiracy—I did not include Jenkins, because I had no evidence against him—I was convicted here by the fraud of Elworthy in putting upon me a declaration which I had altered in draft—if this mortgage deed contains the same thing I tell you I never saw it—I did in my defence that Digby and Atherton had a great deal to do with the prosecution—I cannot say whether I said they were the real prosecutors—I said they were concerned in it more than any one else, and so they are now, Atherton is sitting there now instructing Mr. Elworthy</p>

               <p>and his solicitor also—Idid not prefer a charge at the Mansion House against Atherton—I did at Guildhall—my solicitor went into the case to some extent—the summons was never heard, it was dismissed because I could not get the evidence—I do not say that I had no case; I claimed to be bound over in that case in my own recognisance to prosecute the matter in this Court—Alderman Finnis dismissed the summons—I gave some evidence, preliminary evidence; that was all—I am going to prosecute Atherton—I have not done so this session on account of a mistake of the clerk at Guildhall; he did not return the depositions, and I could not—I have an affidavit of the circumstances: he will be prosecuted next session—two witnesses have died in the meantime—I have only known Mr. Honey since these proceedings—I do not make any imputation against him—an action hag been brought against him—there is an imputation against him, inasmuch as he is accountable for what his solicitor has done—he has utterly destroyed the newspaper—he told me at first that he knew nothing of Mr. Elworthy's proceedings—I wrote a letter to him on behalf of my sister to say that if he did not make some reparation I should go on with the action—I do not know that I am compelled to state what course I may take against Mr. Honey—I think both I and my sister have serious cause of complaint against him, whether there are criminal grounds for it or not I do not know, that is a question of law—this letter is my handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>—"Whitecross Street Prison, 4th April, 1867. Sir,—I have to apply to you on behalf of my sister, Emily Cannon, to know whether you intend to make her any proposal for compensation for the destruction of her and my property by the scandalous and disgraceful acts of which you have been guilty. I give you this opportunity, because I shall to-morrow, if nothing extraordinary intervenes, commence proceedings against you and your accomplices, Atherton, Digby, Elworthy, and Co., at Guildhall, Marlborough Street, Bow Street, and Clerkenwell, for the various acts of conspiracy, perjury, extortion, forgery, &amp;c., &amp;c., committed by you and them in these jurisdictions, and for the nineteen occasions on which during the last fifteen months you have falsely and maliciously dragged me before various Criminal Courts, although you had no claim whatever on me, 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the.90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent having been actually received by you, and the other 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for balance and costs your solicitor swore in your presence you could have at any time; so that it is in fact paid. All further attempts to lay the blame on others will not do, because you were in Court at the Old Bailey, and at the Police-court. If you choose to make my sister a reasonable offer, and pay a small portion of the amount to me, say 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash on her account, with a promissory note for the balance, at my house, before three to-day, that of course might have some effect on my proceedings with regard to yourself and the forthcoming prosecution. After to-day, how<lb></lb>ever, you will be too late, as she will go on with her action.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you say now about any imputation against Honey, Digby, Atherton, Elworthy, and Co.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say that if Mr. Honey cannot be made responsible for some portion of the damage it is very hard—I do not charge him with perjury—I said I should go on with the action against him—I do not think I have charged him in that letter with anything but that which may be made the matter of civil inquiry—I did not intend to do so if I have, and I do not think the letter does do so—those people have done the things I speak of: I do not say Mr. Honey has—I brought a civil action against him—I wrote that letter to him because he had all along told me that he had nothing whatever to do with it, and I found out afterwards that he had.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you found out that he was a liar towards you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not use that language, but it is quite correct—he told me something that was not true—when Elworthy got the warrant against me I went to Mr. Honey's house three times to tender myself in custody, and he told mo he knew nothing about the warrant—it was Digby and Ather<lb></lb>ton who were prosecuting me—they knew very well that I had a large claim against them for 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they adopted this malicious prosecution, and all the rest of it for the last twelve months, till they utterly ruined me—the proceedings were conducted in Mr. Honey's name by this man and his friends, and now they are all three gone to the Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy Court, and I have no redress in any other way—it is a matter of character with me; they have ruined my business—I have been in the City of London for twenty years, and never had a charge against me before, or an imputation—I do not charge Mr. Hopwood with being a con<lb></lb>spirator—he no doubt thought I had read the declaration—I dare say he heard all that passed on the occasion—I have not brought him here as a witness, because when I asked him the other day in this Court as to some of these particulars he said, "I do not remember anything about it, I can see that is my name, and that is the only thing I remember it by"—after that statement of his it was no use subpoenaing him here—he was present at the time Mr. Elworthy said, "You need not read it over; I have copied it myself, and I am sure it is correct"—he was talking to old Mr. Elworthy at one side of the room, and the other one was talking to me at the other side—I have not brought him here because he remembers nothing—he was not listening to our conversation—I will not swear whe<lb></lb>ther the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was struck out of the draft declaration; I do not remember—if it was struck out, there still remained as security the balance of the value of the newspaper—I did not represent the newspapers as belonging to me—I was not the registered proprietor—it was only on a technical ground that I objected to the word "registered"—I had given notice at Somerset House, and if an action had been brought against me for libel with respect to the paper I should have had no defence to it whatever—the notice which I wrote to Mr. Tilsley, of Somerset House, was dated 30th September, and Mr. Tilsley swore at this Court that he had it between ten and eleven on Saturday morning—that is the notice I speak of, and that is the only notice required by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you are right in saying that you struck out what you say you did, had not that the effect of removing the newspapers altogether from the security? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it left the newspapers—it remained in this way, that I was the proprietor of the newspapers, that was the only dif<lb></lb>ference—I only wanted the word "registered" struck out; that was all I objected to—Somerset House was not struck out—yes, Somerset House must have been struck out; all that sentence was struck out—the decal<lb></lb>ration would then stand that I was the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">South London News</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the Croydon Free Press</hi>, as against myself—I mean I should have no ground of defence to an action or claim brought against me as the registered proprietor, under the notice I had given—the paper was re<lb></lb>gistered in my name in the early part of the year—it was registered on 30th September to the extent that I could do it—it was not technically Regis<lb></lb>tered, and that was why I objected to the word and struck it out of the draft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CARTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it encumbered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe it was, but it might be; that is a question of law, and I struck it out because I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100098"></xptr>
               <p>wished to be very careful about not having anything to complain of after<lb></lb>wards—you may depend on it Mr. Elworthy went to Somerset House, he would not have given me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unless he had perfectly satisfied himself on the point—he told me he had—the paper was worth 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if it had been encumbered to the extent of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would not have made any difference in the value of his security, not 5 per cent.—the thing pro<lb></lb>duced here to-day is not a copy of the draft—that was not a printed form—this was bought at a law stationer's and filled up—Atherton had a charge on the newspaper—that was my reason for striking out the word "unencum<lb></lb>bered"—Atherton had not a charge on it, but he swore he had—Digby, Atherton's partner, had a charge on my reversion for 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they held a document which they claimed to call a charge—I mentioned that to Mr. Elworthy, and that was why I struck out the word "unencumbered"—it was not unencumbered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have solemnly affirmed in the mortgage deed which was effected seven days after that you had good right and title to convey it, and that it was therefore unencumbered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say that has been done for the same reason as the declaration was done—it was never shown to me—I gave instructions to strike it out of the draft—I have told you several times that the deed was never shown to me—Mr. Jenkins was not present on the 30th September when I signed the declaration—I do not think he was there at all with me on Saturday—he was there on Friday—I do not believe he was present that day—I swear he did not go with me—I do not believe he attested the declaration I made that day—if you will show me anything he signed I will answer in a moment—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) I signed that—that would be done the first thing in the morning. (<hi rend="italic">That was dated 30th September, executed by Cannon, witnessed by James Jenkins, and was a charge on the fund in Chancery and on the two newspapers.</hi>) It was one newspaper, published in two forms, something like the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Evening Express</hi>, published at different times under different titles—for some reasons they may be called two newspapers, and for some reasons only one—I suppose I executed that document at Mr. Elworthy's office the first thing in the morning—I swore just now that I did not be<lb></lb>lieve Mr. Jenkins was there at all on the 30th; now you have refreshed my memory I dare say he was; but I don't believe it now; I believe he has added the words, "Witness, Jas. Jenkins," since—I know he told me that Mr. Elworthy had given him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not to come and give evidence in my favour—after that statement to me I would not call him—I have not the least idea where he is to be found—I thought he was here—if you will look at the depositions taken at Bow Street you will see that I asked Mr. Elworthy himself the question, and he admitted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at any time see that draft of the mortgage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't believe I ever saw either the draft or the deed—all this first part, relating to the parties to the deed, is in Mr. Elworthy's writing—I don't know anything of the other writing—I don't believe I ever had this draft in my hands, or saw it anywhere—I did not see Jenkins or any one in reference to writing this word "<hi rend="italic">stet</hi>"—I told Jenkins the conditions upon which I agreed to borrow the money; I was very busy at the time, in fact I was going out of town, and he said, "If I look through the draft will you be satisfied?"—the draft mortgage was not long subsequent to the statutary declaration; the deed was executed on the following Satur<lb></lb>day; it was all done in eight or nine days—it was not read over when I executed it; I executed it at the defendant's office in Southampton Build<lb></lb>ings</p>

               <p>—my wife executed it at the same time—Jenkins's name appears to it as a witness; I can tell you the reason of that, he had a small commission for himself upon the completion of the transaction; so he took care to go every time—at the time I wrote the letter of 4th April I was in White<lb></lb>cross Street Prison, after having undergone my sentence from this Court; they arrested me upon a bill which I never had any interest in—Digby was formerly a printer in Chancery Lane—he was introduced to me by Atherton; they were partners, and printers of this paper of mine—I started the paper on account of my sister, partly with my sister's money, partly my own—I started it in her name, in March, 1865—it was regis<lb></lb>tered in her name, except for a few days, until the time it ceased to be published—the few days was when it was transferred to me, previous to this mortgage; it was only for a temporary purpose, to get this deed signed—it ceased to be published I think in January, 1866; it was stopped by Mr. Elworthy going to the printers and telling them it was his pro<lb></lb>perty, after the mortgage had been paid off; that was a long while before the proceedings taken against me at Bow Street; the money had been paid months before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say all the money had been paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You may call it paid; he had attached 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and received 85<hi rend="italic">.</hi>—I will put it in this way, he had received 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it had not been all paid, but it was attached by him; I could not get it, and nobody could get it but himself; it was not all actually paid: it was virtually paid.</p>

October, I don't think I did: no, I did not—I think I met him at Mr. Elworthy's office; he came to meet my husband—I can't say positively whether he accompanied my husband there—Mr. Elworthy said we need not stop to read the declaration, and my husband, being in a hurry, signed it, and gave the pen to me and I signed it—he was in a hurry to get away, I think, to pay some money away—he was anxious to get the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a solicitor for about forty years—I formerly practised in Plymouth—of late years, since my family has grown up, I have been practising in London, at 14, Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane—my son (the defendant) has been in those offices some twelve years—in 1865 we were in partnership there—I saw Mr. Cannon for the first time on the 29th September that year—he came to our office with Mr. James Jenkins, his solicitor—I did not know him before, and did not know his name—he was introduced by Mr. Jenkins—my son was out at the time, and I was sitting in his seat—I took a pen and piece of paper to take down in writing what their application was—the first two lines of this paper are in my writing: "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—two months—fifteen per cent, (which they wanted to pay, and which was never charged)—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. mortgage on fund in Court, 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—when I had written so far, my son came in, and I resigned the chair and handed the business over to him—his handwriting follows on that—fifteen per cent, was what they proffered—a mortgage was afterwards prepared—there was an equit<lb></lb>able mortgage on the 30th—the full mortgage was about seven days after<lb></lb>wards—ten per cent, per annum was charged—I think that is in the mortgage, not for the time, but for the year—I was present during the remainder of the interview with Mr. Cannon—I was there next day, the 30th, with my son, Cannon, and his wife—I was present at all that took place between them—there was no paper produced but this, whether you call that "particulars" or "a minute," or "a draft of the body of the declaration" I do not know, but that was the only paper—that was the only one I saw besides the declaration that was signed by Cannon and his wife—it was all prepared in my presence, and that was the only document that was drawn after that, and the equitable mortgage—no other document was prepared or written or committed to writing—nothing but this and the declaration—we keep printed forms in our office—I saw my son fill up the body of this printed declaration—there was no other but that—it was given to them to execute and peruse—Mrs. Cannon left the chair where she had been sitting, and came with her husband to the table and looked over the side and read the declaration with him—no objection was made to any part of it—he gave no explana<lb></lb>tion about his not being the registered proprietor—he did not object to the word "unencumbered"—there was no objection by him whatever—if there had been he would not have had the money—we wanted additional security, if we had known it was encumbered, and that he was not the registered proprietor of the two newspapers, we should not have advanced the balance—I sit at a desk on one side of the fireplace and my son on</p>

S. occurs both are present—I think Mr. Honey was there on 30th September, late in the day—we had not Mr. Honey's money on the 30th—my firm belief is that we had not a shilling of it then—I fancy not—I cannot recollect, it is so long since, but he sent me the money in a parcel, and I opened it before Mr. Cannon—I cannot tell whether that was about eleven in the day, I know there was a parcel I received in my son's absence—it was brought to me by the clerk—I fancy it was after this, not on the 30th, but really I cannot say the day—I perfectly recollect now that Mr. Honey had deducted his commission or bonus—we do not keep a cash<lb></lb>book, we have an expenditure and receipt book—it would not be in that, because it was a matter of loan—it would only contain the office disburse<lb></lb>ments and receipts—we should put costs in the book—we should not enter moneys as received from clients—I really cannot say whether an account was kept between Mr. Honey and my son, or between Mr. Honey and the office—there was no banking account for the firm—I had nothing to do with the cash at all—my son had a pass-book—I never saw it, or very seldom—I had no banking account of my own—I served my son for a year and a half, I think—you may call me a clerk, if you like—he made me a decent allowance to assist him, that is the genteel way of putting it—I took out no certificate for twelve months, I think—I had not this small document in my possession at Bow Street on the occasion of Mr. Cannon's examina<lb></lb>tion—I do not know where I saw it—I think it was just previous to his committal, or about his committal—I might have seen it, I cannot say that I did—I will not say I did not see it at Bow Street, I think it was there when there was an adjournment—I think there were two adjournments—I believe I was there twice—the case was adjourned because the Magis<lb></lb>trate said, as my son had written the body of the declaration, he must attend—I will not swear I was not at Bow Street four times, I think it was only twice—I cannot recollect that I saw that document there—it must have been in the bundle of papers that were there—I suppose our clerk, Mr. Wyatt, took them—I really cannot tell whether this was in it—it was very likely to have been so—it is very likely that I read it through—it is very probable that it would be compared with the body of the statutory declaration, I cannot say it was so, I have forgotten all about it—I cannot recollect whether I read the document at Bow. Street; I will not swear I did not—I went into the case, and I dare say I produced this and the declaration, and all about it, but I cannot recol<lb></lb>lect—my son was absent at the time—I remember going and seeing Mr. Cannon's sister, I did not threaten her that I would put her brother in Newgate—I cannot recollect saying anything of the sort to any one—I have not done it, it has been done by my son—if a client consults my son I generally attend to that myself, but if it is a common law matter my son takes it from me, or the clerks—if he commences a business I do not in<lb></lb>terfere—I went to Mr. Honey to bespeak this money, but my son conducted the business as between him and Cannon—my son was not managing the prosecution at Bow Street—Cannon could not be found, and a reward was</p>

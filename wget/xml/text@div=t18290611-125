            . I am a hearth-rug manufacturer, and live in Wenlock cottages, City-road. The prisoner came to me on Saturday, the 30th of May, about six o'clock in the evening; he had a sample of worsted and woollen yarn - he said he had about 60lbs. of the worsted, and about 30lbs. or 35lbs, of the yarn, which he wished to dispose of - I asked the price - he said 10d., for the yarn, and 1s. for the worsted; he said he had the yarn from a man named Masterman, in Ratcliff-highway, a rug-manufacturer - that he had taken it for a bad debt, and I understood him six months before; I asked if he hand obtained it correctly; he said he had - I showed the samples to my brother, and purchased the yarn of him at 8d., and the worsted at 1s.; I have his receipt for it - I asked his name, which he gave me correctly, and said he lived in Hackney-road, which was correct; I went with him to Hackney-road, in my cart - he there produced the articles, which I took in the cart: he went back with me to my house, and my brother paid him 3l. 17s. - I afterwards received information, and went to his house; he was not at home - I left a message, and he called the same night; I told him, from information I had received from his uncle and brother, I had reason to believe that it was Mr. Noden's yarn, as I heard he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110056"></xptr>intimate with Cleenes, Mr. Noden's man - he said he would take it away if I was dissatisfied; I said No, I must see Mr. Noden, and had written to him; he said he had known Cleenes for many years, but the yarn was not Mr. Noden's, he had bought it of Mr. Masterman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give a fair market price? A. Yes, for jobs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He gave you a proper name and address? A. Yes; I left a message with his wife, that I was dissatisfied with the worsted - he came to my house, and I told him I was dissatisfied; he said he would call on me at any time, and that he came as soon as he could - Cleenes was taken up and discharged - he asked me 2d. a lb. more than I gave him for the woollen yarn; I kept the articles, and delivered them to Brown.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have a large stock? A. Yes; I did not miss any; but when I saw it I knew it to be mine; I had some of the same description; I have sold some of the same dye, but not to Masterman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When your attention was called to it did you look over your stock? A. Yes; and ascertained the weight I dyed of that colour; I sold some to a woman who used all she had - that, and what was found at Hindley's, made up the weight I dyed; this particular dye I can speak positively to - as to the others I have no doubt of.</p>

            . I live in Brompton-row, and am in the fringe business. 1 buy all my worsted yarn of Mr. Noden; I bought between 4lbs. and 5lbs. of this colour of him about a month ago - it was the same dye as this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have seen a great variety? A. This is a particular dye; I had a pattern of it which I took to Mr. Noden - the person who gave me the pattern must have had the same dye; there may be a great deal of it in London.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did you take for a pattern? A. A bit of twine - what I bought I made up into fringe and sold.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. This is his dye, it is a particular colour; he dyed between 12lbs. and 13lbs, of it - we have about 7 1/2 lbs. at home, 4lbs. were sold, and a - lb. was found at Mr. Hindley's; Cleenes was taken up and discharged - he was an acquaintance of the prisoners - I had seen them together about a fortnight before we missed the yarn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not you an acquaintance with the prisoner? A. No; I never spoke to him, only in company with Cleenes - I will swear I have not been more than four times in his company; I have played at cards with him twice in the parlour at a public-house - Cleenes led me into it - I believe it was the Rose and Crown - I do not know the street; I went to no other public-house; the last time I went out, the prisoner offered to treat me, and as I was with them I took part of what they had - I cannot say whether I owe him any money, he never lent me any - he lent Cleenes money.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 1st of June, I went with Mr. Noden to Hindley's, and then to the prisoner's house - we waited till he came in; I asked where he got the worsted he sold to Mr. Hindley - he said he had it of Masterman six months ago; I asked who Masterman was - he said he was a rug-maker, and lived in Ratcliff-highway; I told him I must apprehend him, as I had had information that it was stolen form a person in Hatton-garden, and I asked if he knew any body that worked for a person in Hatton-garden - he said he did; I then asked where Masterman lived - he said he did not know, or any thing at all about him; I have not been to Ratchliff-highway; the prisoner was remanded to try to bring that person forward - I took Cleenes the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you that Masterman had removed, and he did not know where he was gone? A. No; he said he himself had removed - that he had lived in Ratcliff-highway.</p>

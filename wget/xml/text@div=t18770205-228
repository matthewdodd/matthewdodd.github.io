               <p>1875, I became acquainted with the prisoner, and in that month I took her into my employ—I entered into an arrangement with her; it was a free house, gas and all rates and taxes, and 7 1/2 per cent, on the returns—she told me she was married, but I never saw her husband, she said he was a painter, at a guinea a week—her duty was to receive goods brought to the shop, enter them in a book and send them on to Manchester, they were then returned, each with a bill pasted on, with the name of the customer and the amount due, and as the goods were applied for she had to give them out, receive the money and enter it in the cash-book; there were two cash books—we have a stock-book at Manchester as against Ux-bridge, containing all particulars, every item separately—we have to post to the credit of Uxbridge in the stock-book from the cash-book—she kept one cash-book at a time and sent the other to us—from the time she entered my—service to September, 1876, she professed to act according to that rule—I have the books here—between Lady Day, 1875, and September, she paid me 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at different times—I saw her at Uxbridge several times, and spoke to her about the outstand<lb></lb>ing accounts every time; I urged her to get in the money as I did not pro<lb></lb>fess to give credit; all 1 said about the credit was at the beginning "If you know any persons in Uxbridge whom you know to be reliable and trustworthy I would not object, but my system is not credit"—when I called her attention to the outstanding accounts, she said "It is no use, we can't do business in Uxbridge without long credit, everybody in Uxbridge gives credit"—she has never accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mrs. Hardy on 25th July, or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 17th August from Mr. Packer, or—16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 15th September from Mr. Birch-towards the end of Septem<lb></lb>ber, 1876, I went to Uxbridge and saw her—I told her that I could not go on any longer in the way we had been going, because I could not get the money, if she saw her way to take the thing on her own account I would do the work on terms to be arranged—she said she should be very glad, and thought she could do very well, and she could make arrangements whereby she would be able to pay every week as the goods were received; so the matter was arranged, and afterwards invoices of a different class to our own were supplied-from that time she commenced to trade on her own accounts nothing was determined between us at that time as to the amount due from • Uxbridge to Manchester, I simply urged her to get in the monies that were outstanding—on 12th December, in consequence of a telegram from a friend, I went to Uxbridge and found the place shut up; I found the prisoner in the house, next door—she appeared to be in dreadful distress, she said that her husband had run away, had sold up everything and taken the children—I asked her if she could see her way to go on now her husband had gone away;. she said she could, and if I would send on my account and her account under the new arrangement, a Mr. James would pay—I saw Mr. James then and there for the first time; he had lodged with them accord<lb></lb>ing to her statement—it" was then agreed that she was to go on with the business, and accounts were to be supplied—I told her that a hamper of goods was coming off that night to my own order to Uxbridge—I took her to the station, and said "I will give an order at the station for the goods to come to you on their arrival," in the meantime I sent up Mr. Passmore, my clerk, next day before the goods could arrive—I went back to Manchester, Mr. Passmore communicated with me, and in consequence of that I applied for a warrant—I afterwards received this letter from the prisoner; it is her</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She applied for her 7 1/2 commission—I had an agent at Uxbridge before I knew the defendant, not a branch—I distinguish agencies from branches—I have over 600 agencies—I have a printed form for them; a Mr. Turner was my agent at Uxbridge before the prisoner—I know that Turner received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his debts which the prisoner collected, I don't know that 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by the prisoner's husband, and I don't believe it—I knew that she was a married woman by her own representation—I never saw her husband—I saw three or four children—the majority of my 600 agencies are superintended by women—I did not think it necessary to have the hus<lb></lb>band's sanction to the arrangement that I made with the prisoner—I used to go there about every three months—I have the two cash books here—I took the house in my own name as tenant-after the prisoner was there I came to a settlement with the previous person, Mr. Turner; I went into the accounts with him—I settled with him at the same house—I was not the tenant of it in Turner's time, Turner was the tenant—I became tenant about Lady Day, 1875-when I came up again at the end of the first three months I was in the house two or three hours—I don't remember taking away the two cash-boots, and asking the prisoner to buy a temporary one—I was not told that her husband had bought one for ls.; I never saw a third book—I have a number of clerks at Manchester who attend to the agencies—the prisoner told me that her husband was going to do some painting and papering—I had nothing to do with that—I saw that some papering had been done in the kitchen—she said she had once or twice had occasion to buy wrappers for the goods; I told her to charge that to expenses or we should send them back—she was supplied with stamps and paper envelopes, labels, string and everything from Manchester—she said her husband had taken out and de<lb></lb>livered parcels at Uxbridge—I never promised that the repairs done should be allowed for—there was no expense book kept—if she spent money for postage stamps, or any thing, she would be entitled to charge for it-no expenses are charged in these cash-books, they are balanced up every time she remitted—the first balancing after 25th July was on the 29th, when she remits 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., she has had credit for that—on 19th August she sends 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on 16th September she Bends 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was the last remittance before the new arrangement—there is no deduction at all for expenses or commission-in one instance she makes an error against herself of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in another 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her favour—there are no dates, I could not get her to put dates, that was her fault, not mine—I told her I would get the landlord to accept her husband as the new tenant, and ask him to bring the agreement for him to sign—she did not say she would like to send for her husband that he might have a reckoning with me—I proposed the new arrangement because I could not get my own funds-when I went and found the place closed she appeared in great distress; she said her husband had sold everything—I think I asked her whether she would like to stay or whether she would take a situation at Manchester—I did not shake hands with her at the station, she tried to get hold of my hand, but I avoided her—I did not ask her to plead guilty, I only said "You must do what you think right"—I have not made any effort to find her husband, I have not had the chance, I have not been home more than two days.</p>

I am clerk to the prosecutor at Manchester—in consequence of instructions on the 14th December I went to Uxbridge—I did not go through the cash-books with the prisoner, I made out some bills from the ledger which I brought with me from Manchester, and on the 15th I called her attention to about half a dozen sums, but not to those mentioned in the indictment—I drew up a list of the half dozen accounts on a slip of paper, and made a total of them, and told her that those ac<lb></lb>counts had obviously been paid and not accounted for—I had called on the customers and looked into the cash-books to see whether they were accounted for—she could give no satisfactory account—she did not deny having had them—she said she believed that most of the accounts I shewed her to be open in our ledger must have been paid—I believe the amount was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this was on the 16th—she left the premises on the 16th after my interview—the premises were not shut at this time—the three amounts in question-were not found out till afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I arrived there on the morning of the 14th—all the furniture had been taken away except one bed and one chair—her children and her husband had gone—I did not tell her on the 16th that I should lock her out—I was not aware that the premises were rented by her husband—I thought they were Mr. Berry's, and I acted on that belief—I did Dot go there with any intention of taking possession; I brought a letter of introduction from Mr. Berry, asking her to accommodate me, and she appeared willing to do so—she did not appear in great distress—I believe she said that her husband had received monies—she said she had forwarded all the money she had received—I believe the agent's accounts are settled quarterly—I have nothing to do with the branches—I have never seen any third cash-book, only these two, the clerks at Manchester attend to them—I am not aware that the prisoner's husband had authority to receive money—I never saw him.</p>

The prisoner frequently came to the shop - between August and October she pawned the gravy-spoon, this fish-slice, and some other things, with me - here is the letter J. on the articles, and she gave the name of James - she appeared very respectable, and said she was a lodging-house keeper - she redeemed the property, and pawned it again.</p>

             (police-constable E 115). I took the prisoner into custody at a pastry-cook's shop, where she was in the habit of visiting the servant girl - I told the prisoner Mr. Jarvis wanted to speak to her - she said she knew nothing of Mr. Jarvis, but in going to the office she said she thought they could not do much to her - that she certainly did pawn the plate, but had given all the money to Develing.</p>
               <p>MR. JARVIS. This is my plate; it had been kept in a cupboard in the butler's pantry - the prisoner could not get it without receiving the key from Develing; unless Develing had left the key in the lock - the plate was in the care of Develing - I found the duplicates in the plate chest.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever authorize any one to pawn it? A. No; I believe the money was spent in drink by Develing and the prisoner.(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she was not aware the plate she had pledged for Develing, was without her master's knowledge.)</p>

               <p>Do you know her father? - No.</p>

               <p>Have not you, from time to time, trusted her with a great many feathers? - Not ostrich feathers unmanufactured.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard she carried on this business for herself? - I have heard so from shops where she has sold them; but, from the price she sold them at, I should suppose they were not her own.</p>
               <p>When you entrusted her with feathers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250032"></xptr> they were in bags? - They were; I never trusted her with any in these kind of bags till within these two months; never before these three bags.</p>

               <p>JOHN WAINEWRIGHT sworn. - I am a constable of Dowgate ward: On the 8th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down Thames-street, just opposite the Steel-yard, and the prisoner was pointed out to me by one John Stevens, a master carman; I saw the prisoner go close up to the cart, with his face towards it, close to the wheel of the cart; I did not see him take any out of the bag; I went round, in order to lay hold of him; he walked on a few yards, I laid hold of him; he made a little resistance, and said he was left in care of the cart by the carman, while he was gone down the yard; I then saw some cotton round him, between his shirt and his waistcoat; I asked him how he came by that cotton, he said he picked it up about the cart-wheel; I then saw that the bag of cotton was cut; I took him down into the yard, and asked the carman if he had left him in care of the cart; the carman said he was not left in care of the cart, and he had no business there; I then took him to the accompting-house, took the cotton from him, and conveyed him to the Compter; I asked him if he had a knife, he said he had not, but I found one down by the side of his breeches. (Produces the cotton).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say; I never cut the bag.</p>

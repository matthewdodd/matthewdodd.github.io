He turn'd back at the sore Part of a Coach; we met, I stepp'd aside to give the Way; he jostled me, I gave way again, and he jostled me a second Time. I ask'd him, what he meant by it? And as I look'd him in the Face, I felt the Bag drawn out of my Pocket. He got past me; but upon missing my Bag, I turn'd back upon him, seiz'd him by the Shoulder, and said, You. Rascal, you have robb'd me! As I spoke, I saw my Bag upon the Ground. He stampt upon it, and said, If you have lost any Thing, there it is - Let me go. No, says I, I don't know but you may have taken something out of it. I took the Bag up, and sent for a Constable. We carry'd the Prisoner to the Blue-Anchor Alehouse, and search'd him (because another Man had lost 17 Guineas the same Day) and we found a Guinea and a Half upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you find any of your Money upon me?</p>
               <p>M. Monger. No; my Money was all in the Bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me drop the Bag?</p>
               <p>M. Monger. No; but no Body was so near me as the Prisoner, when I lost the Money, nor any Body, except my self, so near the Bag when it was dropt, as the Prisoner was, by some Yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a Crowd of People about us.</p>
               <p>M. Monger. There were several People not far of; but none besides the Prisoner, were at that Time, near enough to take the Bag or drop it.</p>
               <p>Juryman. When you felt the Bag drawn out off your Pocket, was there no Body but the Prisoner near enough to have taken it?</p>
               <p>M. Monger. We were betwixt the Wall and a Coach, and there was none but he and I there, within the length of that Coach, and I catch'd him within ten Steps.</p>

            . I was at the Post at the Bottom of the Hill. The Prisoner stept over, and the Prosecutor follow'd and collar'd him, and said, he had robb'd him. I heard something drop at that Time. It chinck'd like Money. I look'd and saw the Purse in the Prosecutor's Hand, and it was dirty. He call'd for a Constable, and I went for one.</p>

               <p>M. Monger. I had that Money and Key in the Bag, but I thought there was no need to put the Two-Sous Piece, and the Key in the Indictment.</p>

            . I am a Bricklayer's Labourer; as I was going behind a Man at the Corner of St. Mary Hill (just against the Place where the Coal-Porters walk) I saw something drop from this Man like a white Bag, and I took it.</p>

Because, says he, I just now dropt it. And so I gave it into his Hand: And in a little better than a Minute, he said, his Pocket was pick'd of a Bag, of a Purse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say of that Bag?</p>
               <p>T. J. He said a Bag, but not whether it was that Bag or another.</p>

            . I am a Mantua-maker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040024"></xptr> I live in Smithfield; as we were going to Billinsgate to buy Fish, there was a Dispute; the Prosecutor ran after the Prisoner (who was walking gravely and moderately a few Yards before him) and the Prosecutor said to the Prisoner, If you won't give me my Money, I'll send you to the Compter. So they carried the Prisoner to the Blue-Anchor, and then they put him in a Coach to go before Alderman Brocas, and we follow'd; but before we came there he was sent to Newgate; and we went to him there, not that we had any Acquaintance with him, but only out of good Nature.</p>
               <p>C. Officer, take Sulvan out of Court while this Witness is examined; what did you and Sulvan do at Billingsgate?</p>
               <p>E. M. We cheapened some Eels.</p>
               <p>C. Did either of you buy any? E. M. No.</p>
               <p>C. What did you buy at Rag Fair?</p>
               <p>E. M. Some old Linnen for Body Linings.</p>
               <p>C. Of whom?</p>
               <p>E. M. Of a Woman that stands in the Fair.</p>
               <p>C. How much money did you lay out?</p>
               <p>E. M. About four Shillings.</p>
               <p>C. Was the other Woman with you then?</p>
               <p>E. M. No; we both went into an Alehouse, and had a Pint of Beer; I left her there, and went and bought the Linnen, and then I went to her again.</p>
               <p>C. Where did you part after you went from Newgate?</p>
               <p>E. M. At Pye-Corner, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>C. At what time?</p>
               <p>E. M. Between 2 and 3 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>C. Now bring the other Woman in again?</p>
               <p>Officer. My Lord, she's run away.</p>
               <p>C. Why did you let her go, when she was committed to your Care?</p>
               <p>Officer. My Lord, thought she was only to be put out of Court.</p>
               <p>

            . The Prisoner used my House, the Bull and Mouth in Bloomsbury-Market; he has kept his Horse there these 5 or 6 Weeks, and 'tis there now.</p>
               <p>C. Did he appear to follow any Business?</p>
               <p>J. W. I don't know as to that, he appeared as a Gentleman, or a Tradesman.</p>
               <p>C. Don't you think it reasonable when a Stranger lies at an Alehouse 5 or 6 Weeks to enquire who or what he is?</p>
               <p>J. W. That was no Business of mine as long as he behaved like a good hones t Man.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you entrusted him with the keys of your house? - Nothing but the key of the street door to let himself in with, because his wife said that he must have a street door key, but he had no other keys.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner the last time before your house was broke open? - I saw him the day after, and I saw him on the Sunday before the house was broke open, on Tuesday morning.</p>

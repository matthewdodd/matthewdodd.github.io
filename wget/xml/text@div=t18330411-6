               <p>Q.How was it taken? A.The man came behind me, pushed me, struck me, and snatched the bundle from me; I turned round and cried Stop thief! I followed the man who I saw with the bundle in his hand, and called Stop thief! - I saw him stopped - he had dropped the bundle before he was stopped; I am sure the man who was stopped was the man who took my bundle - he ran across out of Hereford-street into Quebec-street; a man picked the bundle up and gave it to me; I followed the man quite close, and never lost sight of him - the prisoner is the man.</p>

On the 19th of January, I was in Seymour-street; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and I ran into Old Quebec-street; I saw the prisoner run into a soldier's arms, and presently I saw the prosecutrix come up - she said he was the man who took her bundle; I did not see the bundle till I got to the watch-house - the prosecutrix herself brought it there; the prisoner ran against the soldier, and he stopped him - I have the bundle here.</p>

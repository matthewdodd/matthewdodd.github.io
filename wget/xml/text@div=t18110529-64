On the 27th of March, about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290050"></xptr>o'clock in the morning, a person came into my shop for change of a one pound note; I took a bag of silver out of my desk, and put it on the top of the desk; after I had given change for the one pound note, that person went out, and shut the door after them. I had occasion to go into my parlour which is just out of the shop, and leaving the bag of silver on the top of the desk; I had not been gone two minutes before I heard some person in the shop, and on my coming into the shop I saw the two prisoners at the bar, both going out in a great hurry; I ran after them a little way, but finding that they run so fast I could not overtake them, and having left no person in the shop; I returned back and called my wife into the shop, and then went in pursuit of the prisoners, I found them in Golden-lane in conversation with a woman, whom I supposed they were giving the property to; I saw them give her something, but could not see what.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before - A. I never saw them before they went out of my shop; after they parted with the woman I traced them to Barbican; I enquired for a constable, and they were apprehended in Long-lane, we searched them and found nearly an equal part of money upon each.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house - A. In the parish of St. Luke's; I am the sole occupier of the house; I am very sure these are the two boys I saw go out of my house, because I saw them before they got out of the door; not only that I ran after them a good way.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Monday the 27th of May the prosecutor came to me, I went with him, and in Long-lane we apprehended these two lads; I laid hold of Bolton, the prosecutor laid hold of Bevan; Bolton said to me, Mr. Green, what is this for; I replied, that gentleman will let you know. We searched them both, we found eleven dollars, six half-crowns, eighteen shillings, nine sixpences, nine penny-worth of halfpence, and a penny-piece; I said to Bolton you have made away with a good deal of this money that you took; he said, no, we have not made away with any of it. I found the money nearly equally divided between them.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you know any of it - A. Yes, this three-penny piece I can swear to, and there is a bad six-pence my foreman brought in the night before, and there is a French half-crown there.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; Bolton called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

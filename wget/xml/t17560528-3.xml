             my shepherd came and told me of it. The prisoners live about a mile from where I live; they are butchers, and live together. I mistrusting them sent for a shoulder of mutton, in order that my shepherd might see whether they had got the sheep, and enquire if either of them were gone to Uxbridge-market, in order to follow them, and see of they had carry'd the skin there to sell. He went, and did not return till he had been at Uxbridge-market, and brought the skin with him; ( produced in court, and deposed to by the mark I. S. and the trade mark produced with which it was Branded.) They both were taken up, and before the justice they both confessed stealing of the sheep out of my field between 8 and 9 o'clock, and that they carry'd it home and kill'd it.</p>

               <p>Hebert. Eight-score and 13. I missed a sheep at telling them out of the sold on the 8th of April; after I had set my sold, I looked over them as they went through a gap, and missed a particular sheep I went and told my mistress of it, who desired I'd go to the prisoners house for a shoulder of mutton. Their mother was at home, but one I found was gone to Uxbridge, and the other to kill a kog. I went to Uxbridge, where I found the at

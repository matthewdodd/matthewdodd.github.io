I employed the officer to watch our premises, and after Pearce was in custody, he sent for me to Giltspur-street, and made a voluntary statement to me; I said I was informed a quantity of iron had been taken away on the 16th; he said he delivered it to the same person as on the 18th, and that an arrangement had been made, by which he (Pearce) was to have half the money; he said he was an honest man till seduced by that person, who had induced him at different times to supply him with our metal, for which he was exceedingly sorry; and that latterly he had not been paid any money for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you not go to him for the purpose of getting him to confess? A. I went to hear what he had to say, as he sent for me. I told him, he must not expect that I should withdraw the prosecution. His duty was only to weigh goods and put them into the cart. One of my clerks, who was with us at the time, has absented himself, and I have reason to believe has taken our money. Our warehouse is opened at eight o'clock; I go there between nine and ten o'clock.</p>

            . I was warehouseman to the prosecutor in March last, and was entrusted to sell goods. Pearce had no authority to sell from my employers - but I knew that he did sell of a morning before I came. On the 16th of March, I got there at nine o'clock, and found him there; he did not account to me for any goods being sold; I always ask him if any are sold, or gone out, in order to enter them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had authority to sell? A. Ocsasionally, but my employers did not know it; the other clerk has absconded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS? A. Persons out of doors could not tell that Pearce had no authority to sell? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had the clerk who has absconded authority to sell? A. He had - Purdy had an account with the house four years ago, when it was in other hands. The prosecutors did not give him credit.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of March, about half-past seven o'clock, in the morning I was watching the prosecutor's premises, and saw Pearce hand a quantity of metal out of the loop-hole to Purdy, who was in a cart; I had seen him draw his cart up; there might be twenty or thirty pieces of cast iron put into it; the cart turned round and came by me - I did not stop it; I apprehended both the prisoners on the 18th - and after the examination, Pearce asked me what Purdy had said - I said, he had stated that he paid him for the metal; he desired me to fetch Mr. Rayner to him; he said that on the 16th, he delivered about 4 1/2 cwt., which came to 4 l. 10 s. - that he was to receive half-price, but had not had a farthing, and would tell his master all about it.</p>

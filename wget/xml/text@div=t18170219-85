On the 15th of February last, the prisoner came to my shop, about eight o'clock in the evening-it was candle-light - She asked for half a quartern loaf and a penny candle, which came to 9d.; she tendered me a 3s. token; I told her it was bad - She said it was not. I called my son, Howell Goddard, down - He took it in his hand, said it was bad, and gave it to her - She went away.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 15th of February, my mother called me down-the prisoner was in the shop - A 3s. token was put into my hand; it was a bad one. I marked it, and gave it to the prisoner again. I told her she had better not offer it. She said she took it of a gentleman in the street, and would go back with it - She went away. I followed her as far as Aldersgate-street and Long-lane; she went into a butcher's shop; I saw her buy some meat, and the person gave her some change. When she came out, I followed her along Barbican. I met Taylor, who accompanied me. I saw her go into a liquor-shop, at the corner of Golden-lane; she came out, and went down Golden-lane. I followed her into No. 1, Nag's-head-court. I looked over the shutter into the room, and saw another woman with her-the prisoner had a 3s. token in her hand, shewing it to the woman. We went in, and told her she must go with us. She threw something down on the table. Taylor said, "is that a key?" the woman said it was-but it was a 3s. piece. We took her to the butcher's, in Eong-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190044"></xptr>lane, and asked if she had not changed a 3s. piece there; the prisoner said she was there. but had not offered the same 3s. piece that she had tendered me. The prisoner gave me the 3s. piece - I knew it immediately to be the same which she had offered in my mother's shop, and which I had marked. I gave it to Mr. Westwood.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. On the 15th of February I met Goddard. We followed the prisoner down Barbican; at the corner of Golden-lane, she went into a gin-shop; I followed her in, and she went out directly - We followed her into Nag's-head-court, and there lost her. We looked over the shutters, and saw her with a 3s. piece, and went in and told her she must go with us. She threw something down on the table; I said, "is it a key?" and the woman said "yes." It was a 3s. token. I took it up-(I produce it.)</p>

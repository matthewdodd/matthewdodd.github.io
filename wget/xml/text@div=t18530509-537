                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Charlton-street, New-road. I know the prisoner; he has done a little business with me—on 19th Feb. he came to my shop, and asked me to come to the adjoining house, the Sun, and have a glass of porter—I went; he produced this I O U to me; I saw him write his name on the back of it—he told me if he wrote his name on the back, it was as good as a bill of exchange—he said he had received it from Mr. Bowyer; that he had paid for Mr. Bowyer 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Mr. Bowyer had drawn the I O U—the prisoner wanted a crown; I said I had but 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, which I lent him—I did not owe him anything; he said he would pay me on Wednesday, and if I wanted anything out of Bowyer's shop I could go and have soap, or candles, or anything I wanted—the transaction I had had with the prisoner was having bought three lots of flour of him—(<hi rend="italic">memorandum read—</hi>" I O U, James Henry Banning, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

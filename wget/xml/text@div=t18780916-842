                  <hi rend="italic">the Defence</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM PETHER</hi>. I am a grocer of High Street, Mortlake—the prisoner was my assistant about four months—on 3rd September he went away for a holiday—in his absence a parcel came to my shop addressed to him—he ought to have returned on the 4th, but did not—I opened the parcel on the evening of the 4th—it contained this gammon of bacon out into two or three pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was marked B. B. with a diamond brand—it is Hamboro bacon, Prosser's, and I purchased it of Left wich, in the Borough—I always buy bacon of him with that mark—I then missed two or three hams and some bacon—I never authorised the prisoner to dispose of any ham or bacon for me other than in the ordinary course of business—he returned to his employment on September 5th, and looked very down and never spoke to me or my wife, and he went through to the yard—I sent for a constable and told the prisoner I should charge him with having stolen the bacon—he hesitated a moment or two, and then said that he had bought it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Other people can buy bacon of this kind at the same place—on 10th August I sold the prisoner 17lb. of bacon of no brand, which he took away on the Saturday night—it was a rougher kind than this—I brought two or three odd gammons home from the market—I have not sold him bacon or other meat on any other occasion—this letter accompanied the bacon in the parcel to the prisoner—I opened it—I never knew he was in the habit of buying bacon and ham of others. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "114 A, Clapham Park Road. My Dear Uncle,—We have sent the cushion of bacon back, as it is no use to us. Father cut it on Sunday, and we found that it regular stunk, and it is as salt as brine. We have got the best part of the ham now, and mother says she never see such bacon or ham in her life, and father says you need not trouble to send us up any more. Mother says she is surprised at your sending us such rubbish as that, which is not fit to eat, &amp;c. From your sincere nephew, G. Baigent. We shall have to throw the ham in the fat tub.") When the prisoner came back that was the first time I missed any bacon—if bacon had been kept from the 10th to the end of August it would be likely to go bad—this bacon was valued at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the piece of bacon the prisoner bought of me I let him have at a price, and my wife weighed it—he took it out of the shop and I wished him good night—he was under notice to quit when he went for his holiday—he has been out on bail.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife—the prisoner was an assistant in our shop—I sold him some bacon on 10th August—I saw the bacon, which was produced, last Wednesday—no portion of it is that which I sold him—it is not the same class of bacon though the same part—on no occasion did I sell the prisoner bacon of this description—the parcel that came to the prisoner was opened in my presence—I had missed nothing in the multiplicity of business—I attend in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I don't know that there was a brand on the bacon sold to the prisoner—my husband bought it in the market—we only buy this class of bacon at one place—I suppose others buy it there also—he had not permission to take any bacon away.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am resident surgeon at Whitechapel Workhouse—on 24th October the deceased was brought there, and placed under my care—he died on 6th November, from inflammation of the brain—he was paralyzed in his left side, while under my care—in consequence of the Coroner's order I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination within thirty hours after death—he died from inflammation of the membranes of the brain, owing to violence or a blow—nothing else would cause that form of inflammation—there was a quantity of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lymph</hi> on the base of the brain, which is always a sign—there were no signs of fracture—I found all the organs healthy except the right lung, which was slightly adherent, and a little inflamed; but it had nothing to do with the death—I should not expect to find external marks if it was from a blow, as, if the scalp had been lacerated five months before, the scar would have healed—the blow was on 29th May, when he was taken to the London Hospital with concussion of the brain, and was an in-patient twenty-seven days—he came into the workhouse five months afterwards—concussion of the brain will leave effects for many months, especially with an intemperate person; and there was very strong evidence of his being a man of intemperate habits—a fall against a flag-stone, or any kind of blow, would do the same thing—it is impossible for me to say when the injury which caused death was received—it might have been some time before, or it might have been a second blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a coachman, of 34, Hare Street, Bethnal Green—on Whit-Monday, 29th May, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, I went to 24, Montague Street, Spitalfields, and as I went up into a gateway I saw the deceased, and knew that he was in charge of the yard—two men were standing in the gateway, making water—I did not hear the deceased say anything to them, or see him speak to them—the prisoner, who was furthest in the yard, went down the yard, and struck the deceased, who did not see him coming—he was behind him—the blow knocked him down—the deceased was sober—three coachmen came out of the stable—there was no fighting before that blow, and not a word was said by either—the deceased did not strike at the prisoner—he was not sensible after he was knocked down—two men told the prisoner to run for it.</p>

Q.</hi> You say you were in the yard at the time the deceased was struck, did not I meet you coming in as I was going out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As you were running out I was going in at the entrance of the gateway; you came running down and knocked him down—he was sober—I had seen him twice that day—the last time was about 2 o'clock, he was sober then—you hit him with the back of your hand as you passed by.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Craddock, an engineer, of 18, Brandon Street, Old Ford—I was at the entrance of this yard, talking to Mrs. Irvin; she screamed, and I turned my head, and saw the man lying on the ground, and the prisoner running away from him as hard as he could—when I first saw him he was a little farther from him than you are from me—he turned up Montague Street—I only saw those two men, the prisoner and the deceased—Mrs. Irvin went after the prisoner, and I went up to the man—blood was pouring from his mouth, nose, and head furiously—I did not know him previously, but I have seen him a great many times since, and know that his name is Jacobs—he got up of himself—I saw him next when he came out of the London Hospital—the last time I saw him was in the Blue Lion public-house, about two months ago, I think—he seemed then to be much about the same as he always was.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you not at the entrance of the yard when I came out running? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I got up to the man he was standing up and was leaning with his head against the harness room door, because I did not go that very instant, I spoke to a man first—I did not see another man coming to strike you when you ran away—I said at the inquest that there were three men, you and two others, we could not see you till we got into the yard, because of the position of the yard.</p>

               <p>the prisoner was sober, he and I and his father went up the yard—the pri<lb></lb>soner went round the corner to the right, and his father and I stopped about half way up the gateway—I saw the deceased throw a brush at the prisoner, and the prisoner came round the corner and asked what gentleman it was threw that brush at him—they did not speak for a second or so, or it might be a minute, and then the deceased said "I did"—I said to my friend "Come along, <hi rend="italic">Bob!</hi>"And the deceased followed us down the yard—(I was not so far down as Clifford was) he commenced fighting with Clifford, and the deceased got knocked down—the prisoner then walked out of the gateway, they picked the man up, and I think they took him to a chemist's shop, I do not know, but he came back with a handkerchief up to his head—a policeman was there then, and one of the men in the yard wanted to give me in custody—the constable asked the deceased if it was me or the prisoner's wife, he said it was not either of us, and he did not wish to swear any man's life away—the prisoner's wife came back to us after it was over—the man seemed very bad and was taken away in a cart—I did not see Mrs. Craddock there—the deceased was bleeding when he got up—the prisoner walked away, but not for a minute or so after the man fell—I am positive he walked out of the yard—I am a friend of his.</p>

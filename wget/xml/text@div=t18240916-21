            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I buy and sell old clothes. On the 16th of August, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another came to the house for a halfpenny worth of small beer. I had seen the trowsers safe on the shelf after they came in. I served them, and they went out - a man then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160010"></xptr>gave me some information, in consequence of which the prisoner was stopped - his companion had taken a contrary direction. I knew the prisoner before; he had been at my house; he had got a good way from the door before he was stopped. I afterwards saw the trowsers, and am certain they are the same.</p>

            . I live at Hackney. I saw the prisoner come out of Newcombe's house, about half-past four o'clock, with his partner; I saw a pair of trowsers under his arm - he covered them with his smock frock. I told Mrs. Newcombe of it, and then pursued about a quarter of a mile. I am certain he is the same person. Moore picked them up - when we overtook him he said he would not be handled. He worked in the same field as me, and for the same master.</p>

            . I found the trowsers - the prisoner was about one hundred yards off when I picked them up, going in a direction from Newcombe's house; I did not see him with them, but as they came back with him I gave them to them: they were claimed by Mrs. Newcombe. I did not see any other person going in that direction, except the persons who were pursuing him, and saw nobody before me but the prisoner.</p>

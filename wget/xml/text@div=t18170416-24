            . I live at Bethnal-green. On the 2d of March, about half past ten o'clock at night, as I was returning home, (I was by the dead wall near <placeName id="t18170416-24-crimeloc138">Wilmot-street</placeName>

The prisoner then put his hand into my right-hand breeches-pocket, and took my money. I made a snatch at his hand to prevent him, but he got it away. - He took two 3s. tokens, two 1s. 6d. tokens, and three shillings - He turned my pocket out, and ran away. I told him that I knew him well, and that he had got my money. I looked him full in the face. There were six or eight men standing behind me, beside the two who knocked me down - They all ran away together. A boy, named Arnes, came up to me while he was robbing me - I was laying on the ground-the prisoner was there when he came up-it was moon-light. I had been drinking at the Falcon, but was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I will swear that I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you talked with Arnes about this - A. He gave me their names.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor described the man who robbed him, to me, and told me where he lived. I went to his house, in George-street, Bethnalgreen, and took the prisoner into custody - He denied the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160011"></xptr>charge. I asked him if he was at Bethnal-green on that day, and if he knew of a man being knocked down.

            . I live in George-gardens, Bethnal-green. On Sunday, the 2d of March, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was in the Bethnal-green-road. I met five or six men running very fast - I did not know them. I went a little further, and found the prosecutor laying on the ground-no person was with him. I raised him up - He said, he had lost his money; the prisoner came along, and I asked him to give me a lift up; we rose him up. As soon as he got up, he turned round and ran after me. I ran away, for he was so drunk, I did not know what he would do. I did not see the prisoner do any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you give the same account before the justice - A. I have not told all yet. The prisoner's hand was in his pocket, but I did not see him take any thing-this was as he was lifting him up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see any person with the prosecutor before I asked the prisoner to help him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have your never said to your father, that you knew who robbed the prosecutor, and that the prisoner was not the man - A. No; I never said I saw the prisoner take the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor say to you, "stick by me, and we shall do him" - A. Yes, he did, at his house-the prosecutor was very drunk indeed.</p>

            . I was at the George public-house on the 2d of March, about a quarter after nine o'clock in the evening. The prosecutor came in, very much intoxicated-several young fellows were there, and called out "see!" The prosecutor struck me on the breast, and I struck him. I went out of doors about fifteen minutes after, and saw him laying on the ground. He had left me to go to the bar for a pint of gin, but the landlord would not serve him. I took him into the George, and went out soon after, and saw him running after my brother, the last witness. He said he had been robbed of 12s., afterwards 16s., and then 19s.</p>

He said Clayton was innocent, and that he could take a safe oath as to those who did knock the prosecutor down, but it was not Clayton. I asked him how he could say it was Clayton, he said that he was urged to say so, and that they wanted him to say a great deal more. I am no relation to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>HOUGHTON re-examined. I was at the George before the robbery, but not after. I was not there half a minute. I did not strike Arnes - I saw Harrow that night; he asked me what I had lost - I refused to tell him. I did not desire Arnes to stick by me, and I would do him.</p>

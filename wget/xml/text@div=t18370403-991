               <p>six years ago—he was then about seventy, I suppose—he then lived in Little Union-street, and had a wife—in consequence of an application from his wife, I went to see him—he was in an infirm state; confined to his bed with rheumatic gout, and could not go out—I gave my certificate of his illness to his wife, to be presented at the Pension Office—he was not living in the prisoner's house then—they afterwards removed to Ropemaker's walk, and afterwards to the prisoner's house in the Mint—the prisoner began to accompany his wife to get the certificate renewed about two yean and a half ago—she came about twice in company with the wife—afler that •he came to me and said Mr. Stockings wished to see me; that his wife had ill-used him, and he did not wish me to give her any further certificates—I went and saw him, and he confirmed what the prisoner said—in cones<lb></lb>quence of that, I delivered the certificates to the prisoner every quarter, at the applied for them—she had been to me subsequent to July last—I in<lb></lb>variably inquired of her about the deceased every quarter she applied for the certificate, as they had represented he was going to the hospital—I always inquired of the prisoner why he was not got into the hospital, and inquired about his health—she said, in October, that they had not been able to get him into Greenwich hospital—in October last I gave her this certificate—the only writing of mine on this certificate is that above my signature—there was nothing else on the paper at the time I gave the certificate—I only wrote the certificate and signature—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"I hereby certify that Mr. Richard Stockings is prevented applying for his pension, being confined to his bed with rheumatic gout.

               <p>MR. BASSETT. I believe the cloths to be mine. I can swear to the book; I went to Mr. Walker's, and found the Bible concealed in a turn-up bedstead. Bishop said Mrs. Walker sent her to pawn them; I did not take Walker; she has now absconded.</p>

On the 30th of July, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I saw three men at the corner of Dean-street; one of them crossed over and entered the prosecutor's premises; Bromley also crossed, and passed too and fro by the house; I went to Leigh-street, and on my return I met all three again; Bromley was then with the men who went in, they had a basket in their hands.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the afternoon of the robbery I took Bishop in custody at Walker's lodging, next morning Mrs. Walker absconded. On the Saturday following I went to Queen-street, Seven Dials, and saw Bromley at work on a seat; I asked the landlord (Henley) if he was his son, he said, Yes; I came away, soon after Bromley came down, and I stopped him; I told him I believed his name was Gibbons; he denied it, and said it was Henley, and that I had just been to his father's apartment; I took him to the watch-house; he then confused he was the person who was called Bromley, and that the book was given him by Mrs. Walker to carry up stairs.</p>

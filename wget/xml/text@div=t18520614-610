                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Bayley, a grocer, in Gray's Inn-lane. On Sunday evening, 9th May, the prisoner came there and asked for a penny biscuit—she gave me a sixpence—I thought it was bad, and told her so—she said it was not—I put it in my mouth and bit it—she said, "Let me have it again"—I said I would not, and she went away without it—I put it on a shell apart from other coin—in half an hour afterwards I saw my mistress take it away—it was the same sixpence—no one had been in the shop in the mean time.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Gray's Inn-lane. The prisoner came that evening about 9 o'clock—she asked for a quarter of an ounce of tea, and some other things which came to four pence three farthings—she put down a shilling, I gave her change—as she was going out Donohue said something to me—I looked at the shilling the prisoner had given me, and found it was bad—I cut it with a knife, and told her it was bad—she said it was not—I said it was, and she ought to be ashamed to come twice in one day to rob me—she said she did not know anything about any other bad money—she went out, I followed her, met a constable, and gave her in charge, with the shilling and the sixpence which I found on the shelf.</p>

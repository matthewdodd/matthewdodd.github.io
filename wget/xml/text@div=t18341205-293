                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-street, Bermondsey. On the 23rd of November, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop and ordered 1lb. of the best salt butter to be sent to Mr. Watkins, 22, Wellington-street, St. Luke's, and change for a five-shilling-piece—in about five minutes he returned, and, with an earnestness of manner, asked if I had sent the butter and change as directed—I then weighed the butter, and called my boy, George Webb, and gave him four shillings, which I particularly remarked—three were of the reign of George III., and one of George IV., with a lion on it—the boy came back with an officer, who had the prisoner in charge—he asked me if I knew the prisoner—I said yes; he is the person who ordered a pound of butter—he said, with affected surprise, "I order a pound of butter!"—I said most assuredly he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to the prosecutor. On the 23rd of November I received directions from him to take a pound of butter and change for a five-shilling-piece to Mr. Watkins—I had four shillings change—as I was going, I met the prisoner in Wellington-street, St. Luke's—I had not seen him in the shop—he said, "Are you going to Mr. Watkins's?"—I said, "Yes"—he then took the butter and the change, and gave me the five-shilling-piece—I thought it was right, as he gave me the five-shill<lb></lb>ing-piece—he told me to go back and fetch half a pound of cheese—I did not go back, but I showed the five-shilling-piece to a person on the other<lb></lb>side, who told me it was a bad one—I then pursued the prisoner—he ran away across King-square, and as he turned a corner, I lost sight of him—I then saw an officer, and told him what had happened—he took me to the Champion public-house, where we saw the prisoner—I told him he gave me a bad five-shilling-piece, and he said, no, he did not—the officer then searched him, and took him to my master—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who gave me the five-shilling-pieces, and took the butter and four shillings.</p>

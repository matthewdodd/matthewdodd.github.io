                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Cooper &amp; Co., London Wall—on Friday evening, 5th March, about 9 o'clock, I was standing at the end of Cheapside—two women came up and wanted to know where I was going—I told them to go away—I did not feel anything while they were talking to me—they were feeling my waistcoat up and down—they did not go away—there were two men on the opposite side of the road—they came across the road and asked me where a certain hotel was—I told them I did not know—Taylor was one of the men—the women then went up Cheapside and the men down—when they were gone I discovered that I had lost my silver watch and gold Albert chain, worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to Bow Lane station and gave information—I am a teetotaller.</p>

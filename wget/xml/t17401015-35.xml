I paid her Half a Guinea for the use of it; and was to take them away, when I came up again. Before I went, I fastened the Door with 3 Locks, left all my things safe, and desired her to take care of them; but when I return'd, I found one of my Boxes broke, and my Goods gone. The Doors of the Room were not broke, but, there had been 2 or 3 Boards taken out of the Wainscott between her Room and mine. I had lost so many Things, that I did not know what to do, but the People advised me to get a Warrant to search the House: I did so, and found some of them; my Petticoat, and a Piece of my Gown the Prisoner had on, and she said before the Justice, that they were her own. I lost Cloggs, Shoes, Sleeves, Caps , and many other Things.</p>
               <p>Constable . I searched the Prisoner's House, and found these Things up one pair of Stairs, in the Room where she lay; the Wainscot was a little crack'd, but I did not take much notice of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She says, she gave me Half a Gui nea, she did promise me Half a Crown a Week, but never gave me a farthing. I know no more of what she lays to my charge, than the child unborn ; and as for the Sleeves that she says she lost, here is the woman who has drest my child in them several Times.</p>

I left them in the warehouse, and afterwards took a porter to fetch them away; that is the usual course of trade. In about two hours, I went there with the porter; and counting them over, there were five skins short of the number, I weighed them again, and found a deficiency of eighteen pound in weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of them - A. About eighteen shillings; I have seen the skins since, I have not the least doubt they are the skins I purchased; they agree exactly in weight. I have not the least doubt they are the same skins.</p>

            . Q. You are the person the last witness bought the skins of - A. I am. I live in Long lane, in the Borough, I am a leather factor and tanner of skins. I sold to Elliott four dozen of bazil skins. After they were weighed I considered them ae the property of Mr. Pickford after that, in the afternoon. Elliott came and told me there were five skins missing, I said I would enquirs into it, I mentioned it to the warehouse keeper that such a loss had been sustained, after I went home in the evening, to my house, he sent me a note, that Stevens had got them. I went to Steven's house in Long lane Bermondsey street; I told Stevens what I had come for; he gave me the skins; they have the same duty mark, and of the same weight. I have no doubt they are part of the skins I sold to Elliott. The prisoner said he was sorry for taking them away.</p>

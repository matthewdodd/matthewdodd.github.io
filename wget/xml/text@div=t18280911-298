I took the prisoner into custody, about twelve o'clock, on the night of the 7th of September; I asked what money she had got - she said only a few coppers in change for a sixpence; I searched her, and found a glove, with two half-crowns, two shillings, and five half pence in it - I took her in the same house; I asked her where she got this money, and she said at a house, next door to the Lyceum - I went there and saw two servants, but they said she had not been there: the prosecutrix told me that one of her half-crowns was a new one, and one of these is new.</p>

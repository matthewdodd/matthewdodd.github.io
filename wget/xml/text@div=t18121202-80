               <p>Q. Do you recollect that one of your fowls was lost - A. I had information that such a fowl was gone. I got a search warrant, and took the cook with me to the prisoner's house. The fowl was missing on the Saturday, and on the Tuesday I went to the prisoner's house; I saw a fowl there which turned out to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. I knew him when a young man. I have nothing to say against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at home - A. No; I knew he was in the barn. I saw his wife. I saw the fowl alive in the house.</p>
               <p>SARAH GIBBINS. I am cook to General Arabin. I have the care of the fowls. I knew this fowl in particular. I used to feed it twice a day. I missed it on the Thursday or Friday, and it was on the Wednesday in the next week that I saw it in the prisoner's house. It was walking about the kitchen floor. I am quite certain it was General 
               <persName id="t18121202-80-person890">Arabin</persName>
            's fowl. After I had been to Little's house he came to me. He asked me what I had been down to his house for. I told him about some ducks. He said, does that fowl belong to you. I said, yes. He said, it might be the General's for ought he knew, but a boy had given it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner in Mr. Betts's service, close to Mr. Arabin's house - A. Yes; I have seen him there.</p>

            's house. The cook said it was their fowl. I knew the prisoner was at work at Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020060"></xptr>Betts's. I have known him eleven or twelve years. I heard a good character of him by Dr. Tomkins, and his general character is an honest man. I saw Little in about two or three days after. He said, the fowl was given to him by a boy. I did not apprehend him until the 20th.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home from my work, a lady came along; he said, I have picked up a chicken: he said, he would give it to me if I was a mind to have it. On the Wednesday following General

             came to my house, and enquired for some ducks. The officer of the parish came and took the fowl away. I said, if it is General 
               <persName id="t18121202-80-person897">Arabin</persName>
            's, he is welcome to it. After that, Mr. Wyatt took me to Dr. Perry. He was not at home, and then I went to my work. On the Sunday following he took me to General Arabin's house. He committed me to prison, and there I have been ever since.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

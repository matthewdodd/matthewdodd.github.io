                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody—I never saw the shirts—I was sent to the prosecutrix's house—the prisoner had been stopped, and her mistress gave me a night-shirt and other articles, and a small ring, which I found on the table—I took her before the Magistrate, and from the prosecutrix's kindness she was allowed to go to her sister's funeral, and her mistress engaged to produce her on the Friday morning—when she came before the Magistrate, he asked if I had searched her boxes—I then went to the house, searched her boxes, and found a number of plates, clothes, brushes, and other articles—here are some plates and dishes—the things were in five boxes.</p>

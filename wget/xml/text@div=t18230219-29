On the 7th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, I was at work behind my counter - the two prisoners with another person came in; the third person asked for laced half boots - I shewed him four or five pair, one of which he said would fit him, and he paid 3 s. 6 d. for them; he told me to drive some nails into them, which I did, and while I was about it Alvey left the shop; Moring staid till Alvey returned, and when the boots were finished they all three left together - I immediately missed two pair of half boots, which were within their reach; I followed them, and from their conversation in the shop, I understood they had been drinking in Long-lane, I went there, but could not find them. In returning I met Alvey alone, with a pair of half boots in his hand - I seized him, he dropped the boots in my hand, scuffled, and got off - I cried Stop thief! and followed; he was taken in about an hour after; I am certain of him. The boots are mine. My<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190017"></xptr>son went with me to look after them, and in crossing Smithfield we met the two prisoners together. I called the patrol and secured them. We found the other pair of boots at their feet.</p>

            , JUN. I know the prisoners to be the men who came with another - when they were gone I missed two pair of boots. I went with my father after them, and in crossing Smithfield we met the two prisoners, and gave them in charge. I saw Alvey drop the boots at his feet; he ran, but was stopped. Moring bought a pair of old boots off the other man's feet, because they were too small for him; but the boots Alvey dropped were the stolen ones.</p>

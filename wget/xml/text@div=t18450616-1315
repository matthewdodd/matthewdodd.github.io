The prisoner was in my service for ten weeks—I missed a pair of trowsers, and spoke to her about them—she said she knew nothing about them—I missed some spoons afterwards—I spoke to her about them on Sunday—she said she would produce them on the following morning—I found that other things had been taken, but I did not miss them till afterwards—I had lost the curtains, shirts, and other things stated, amounting to about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed the trowsers on the morning of the day I gave her in charge.</p>

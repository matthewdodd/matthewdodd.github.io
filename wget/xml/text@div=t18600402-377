                  </hi>. I am a widow and a laundress, of 12, Hill-street, Woolwich—On Wednesday, 7th March, I hung out to dry, three flannel-shirts, two pairs of drawers, and a petticoat—I saw them safe at half-past 8, heard the gate slam at 9, and then missed them—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave no one authority to take them off the line.</p>

                  </hi>. On 7th March, at a little before 9 at night, I heard Mrs. Brown's gate go, heard her call out, and saw that the things were gone which I had before seen hanging on a line—I ran out to the gate and saw the prisoner run up the street with the clothes under his arm, rolled up loosely—he was dressed the same as he is now—I saw his face as he turned round to see if I was coming—I called out "Stop thief!" and saw him drop the clothes—I did not stop, but followed him into the King's Arms public-house—he ran into the tap-room—I saw his face by the gaslight as he entered, and am sure it was the prisoner—I did not lose sight of him—I fetched the piquet and gave him in custody—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are like the things he propped—he was twenty or thirty yards from the gate when I first saw him.</p>

I am a marine-store dealer, of 24, Ell-street, Wool<lb></lb>wich, about mid-way between Mrs. Brown's house and tie King's Aims—On 7th March, about half-past 9, I saw the prisoner running towards the King's Arms in a direction from Mrs. Brown's—he called out "Stop thief!" as he passed me—he dropped the things just as he got to me—I told a person to pick them up and saw him do so—I believe these are the same things, and am sure the prisoner is the man who dropped them—I was out in the street when he passed me.</p>

On 7th March, about half-past 9 at night I went to the Marine-barracks, and the prisoner was brought to the station by an escort and given in custody—he was charged with stealing these things in Hill-street—he said that he was never in Hill-street; he was at the Sham<lb></lb>rock beer-shop—that is in a different direction altogether.</p>

            . I am a gold-refiner, and live in Prince's-street. On the 5th of April, a person who I believe to be the prisoner, came to my house, and offered this silver plate for sale. I asked how she came by it; she said it was found at the bottom of a night-cart; that her husband was a nightman, and had found it in emptying a privy. I said if so it belonged to the person whose privy they had emptied - she said no, she thought it belonged to the gang who had emptied the privy. I detained the plate, but not her.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner up at her own house, and told her some plate had been stolen, and she said she had heard something had been stolen, but knew nothing of it. I asked what she had to say to the plate she had offered to Mr. Smart, she said that plate she found on the top of Theobald's night-cart; that as she went home she saw a man like a footman, throw something on the night-cart - that her husband was in Theobald's employ, and in the morning she went to the cart, and found the plate on the soil, tied in a handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Druce, butcher, Weymouth-street, Marylebone. On the 27th of January the two prisoners came to the shop, and one of them asked if we had any pieces of meat—they both pulled the pieces over—I sold them three quarters of a pound for threepence—Cook gave me a sixpence—Penn was close by and saw the sixpence—I put it in the bowl—it was quite a new-looking sixpence—there were two very old sixpences in the bowl—both the prisoners went away together—after they were gone I took the new-looking sixpence out of the bowl, before any other had been put in—I looked at it, and let it be in the bowl till a man came in and told me something—I looked at the sixpence and marked it—I afterwards gave it to Allen.</p>

I will give you another"—I said, "No"—the policeman came and took her—I gave him the sixpence, after I had marked it.</p>

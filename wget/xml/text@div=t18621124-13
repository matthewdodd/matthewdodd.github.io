I am shopwoman at a confectioner's, 112A, High Holborn—on 17th October, about 12 o'clock, the prisoner came and took some stale pastry off the board—I said, "You have got three half-pennyworth there"—he took a pennyworth, gave me a penny and left—he came the same evening for a penny saussage-roll, and gave me half a crown—I gave him change, and when he got to the door I bit the half-crown, and my sister looked at it—the prisoner had then left—I put it by itself in the corner of the till—I described to my sister the person who gave it to me, and on 20th October, about 12 o'clock, she called me into the shop from the kitchen, and I found the prisoner there—I said, "You came in and passed me a bad half-crown on Friday night"—he said, "I did not"—I said, "You did"—my sister said, "Here is another; lock him up"—he tried to get away, but we detained him, and gave him into custody, with the two bad half-crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butler at 186, Edgware Road—on 28th August I had been with a friend to Victoria Docks, and came away at about 5 or 6 o'clock, and went into a public-house, the prisoner was there; he had a quart of beer and wished me to drink—I said that I was much obliged to him, but as I was with my friend I did not wish to intrude upon his company; he was quite a stranger to me—I remained in the house about half an hour—I then left, the prisoner followed me out; I was asking outside if they could direct me to Vicarage Lane, Shalford, where my sister lived—the pri<lb></lb>soner said "I will show you, I will put you in the right road"—he accom<lb></lb>panied me down one or two streets to the marshes—he said "You will have to cross here—I said "Oh dear, it is so very dark"—"Yes," he said, "You must cross here;" it was quite the reverse road—it was a very dark night—after we had had gone some distance he caught me by the collar and said "Now you b——down with you"—he threw me down and said, "Give me all you have, and if you make any noise, I will put this bullet through your head"—I felt a pistol touch my head—I had my hands in my pocket when I was thrown down and my watch was there—he took the watch and chain away—I got up and cried out and went back and told a policeman, and gave a description of the man—I saw the prisoner the next day, at the station with eight other men, and picked him out immediately—I said "You know me"—he said "Of course I know you"—I charged him with stealing my watch and chain and money—he said "No; you may say whatever you may of me, but I was never a thief, I never stole your watch"—I charged him with the robbery as well as the assualt.</p>

On Monday, 28th August, I was on. duty about 20 yards from the Victoria Dock—about 7.30 I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor going into the Victoria Tavern; I saw him come out again, and he asked me the way to the Vicarage Lane—the prisoner came out after him—I saw them go down Harris Street—the prisoner followed the prosecutor, who stood talking to a female at the door about two or three minutes—the prosecutor and the prisoner went afterwards into another public-house—they both went down Harris Street in the direction of the Marshes—the road across the Marshes would lead to Vicarage Lane, Shalford—I lost sight of them at the Marshes—the prosecutor came to me about 9.30 very much excited—he told me he had been robbed of his watch and chain and money—I took him to the station, he made a complaint there, and gave me a description—next day I met the prisoner in the North Woolwich Road—I told him the charge—he said "I did not rob him, I was only drinking with</p>

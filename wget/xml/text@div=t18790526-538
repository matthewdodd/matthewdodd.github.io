                  </hi>, I am a public accountant at 20, Great Marlborough Street, and was on the 13th September, 1878, appointed trustee of the estate of the prisoner at a general meeting of his creditors held at Messrs, Curtis's—he handed me this book.(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with others, and' my clerk, Mr. Sutton, took possession of the estate for me—the book contains entries of pianos received from manufacturers and the cost prices—I find an entry of Messrs.

(all-in pencil)—there was only one of Brewer's pianos in the shop—he gave me no explanation how he had disposed of the other pianos—I went through the books with him to. attempt to trace the pianos, but could not, and was obliged to give it up—I found an entry (in pencil), July 10th, of the purchase from Ralph Allison of a rosewood coloured piano 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., walnut piano 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and written underneath, "By per due 27th July 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and May 2nd, Broad wood, a rosewood cottage piano 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two ditto on May 3rd, and underneath, written by the traveller, a receipt for bill of exchange therefor—the last entry in 1878 of purchase from Cadhy is June 6th, two rosewood cottages 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

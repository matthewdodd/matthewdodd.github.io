On the evening of the 28th of May I had been to a club in Somers-town, with some friends—we got into King-street, Holborn, near upon twelve o'clock—I was with Crowl, Monday, Denton, and Fitzpatrick—I was very bad at the time in my feet, with the gout, and was leaning on Denton's arm—Crowl was rather behind us, and the others were at the top of the street/bidding one of the party good night—as we walked along we met the prisoner and some others—there was one on each side of him, two be<lb></lb>hind, and I think three more behind them—the prisoner was walking arm-in-arm—one of the three said to me, You b----, can you fight?"—I was looking down at the time—I then looked up—Crowl was a little before—they all three put themselves in a fighting attitude—Crowl then snatched my stick out of my hand, and said, "What are you going to do with my friend?"—some parties behind the three in front said, "Hit the b—down," and that party directly struck the deceased—I did not see which of them—I caught the person's arm by the wrist, as he was going to strike the deceased, and I caught the deceased's arm also, and held him by the arm, to prevent either striking, and I got hit and knocked down by the whole party altogether—the deceased was struck against the rails—I did not see who by—there was then a general fight altogether—I could not see whether he was struck more than once, for I was knocked down myself—I cannot tell to a certainty which of our party had come up at the time—there was a gas-lamp close by where I was-r-after the second attack I aw the persons distinctly, ✗ I lay on the curb-stone—I saw the prisoner—the affray continued for about ten minutes—as I laid on the curb-stone, I saw two policemen come up—I cannot tell where Crowl was while I was on the curb-stone—I got up, and asked the policeman to take the parties into custody—(the prisoner and his companions were there at the time)—the policeman refused, saying he did not see any blows struck—the next time I saw Crowl he was at the end of the street, sitting on some stones</p>

               <p>the arm and pus under the knee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear to the swelling of the arm—I did not see that myself—phlebitis is sometimes caused by using a lancet on an inflammatory constitution—a wound in the vein is the usual cause—the man's constitution was bad—he was labouring under disease of the bones, which does not speak well for his constitution, and I believe he was in the habit of drinking—the exostosis appeared to have been formed some time—that is very likely to produce inflammation of the membrane—the circumstances attending his death are rather complicated—I am of opinion he died from inflammation of the lining membrane of the chest, but there are other causes open to its not being so—I cannot say with certainty that the inflammation arose from the fractured rib—there was no appear<lb></lb>ance of phlebitis—I cannot say how much pus there was under the knee joint, but it is not unusual to find pus in the liver and lungs—the state of the knee joint would be accounted for by suppuration—I should not think the matter in the knee joint would be accounted for by inflammation in the vein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you not expect to find the appearance of swelling and sup<lb></lb>puration in the knee joint in a patient who had been afflicted with phlebi<lb></lb>tis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly in the knee joint—I should expect to find if in the joints—I think an injury of the knee would account for the pus—a blow would—he did not complain of any injury from blows—I have no doubt I must have seen his swollen arm, but I was very ill at the time, and a swollen arm is so common a thing in a hospital that I do not remen<lb></lb>ber it—I am not admitted a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company, nor yet a member of Surgeon's Hall—I did not say before the Magistrate that I was an apothecary—I believe I was asked if I had received a diploma. and I might have said yes—Mr. Matthias was my colleague at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you undertake to say that the rib had been fractured during life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is most probable—I will not swear it was so—this was a very fragile rib—considering the fragility of the rib, I will not say that in. placing the body on the table for <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, it might not occur, but it is an improbable thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated you desired him to cough at one time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, immediately on his admission into the hospital—that produced pain in his left side where the injury was—that would have arisen from the rib being fractured—the increase of the bone was on the broken rib—I conceive that pressure would have existed be<lb></lb>fore the rib was broken to the same extent as after—the rib was not pressed in—the ends of it were in apposition—the swelling was within the rib, and close to the point of fracture—I think that would probably occa<lb></lb>sion the pain from coughing—a sound rib would be liable to produce the same effect, but a rib in this state would break more easily—the pus in the knee joint was not sufficient to cause death, unless it was a symptom of another disease, and I saw nothing which led me to believe it was so—I should have thought it was a disease of itself—I have no recollection of examining the swollen arm at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—inflammation of the arm might be occasioned by external violence as well as bleeding.</p>

               <p>of the lining membrane of the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—in my judgment, violence to the side of the chest was the cause of that inflammation—I mean the fractured rib—Mr. Matthias was junior house-surgeon at the same time with me, but not when the deceased came in—I do not remember whether he joined in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there were a good many people present—I have no recollection of seeing him examine the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and am house-surgeon at the Ophthalmic Institution, in King William-street. In May last, I was one of the house-surgeons at Charing-cross hospital—I was present at a portion of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of Crowl—at the time I came in the fractured rib had been removed, and the knee-joint opened—I looked at it, and there was some pus in it, which induced me to suspect phlebitis—bleeding would no doubt be likely to produce that—the arm was opened in my presence—I observed that it had been bled—I looked at the vein—it was inflamed and thickened—inflammation of the vein is very frequently followed by matter in the joints—my observation of the vein confirmed my opinion as to the disease in the knee-joint—dis<lb></lb>ease of the vein is very frequently mortal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear to you that that had caused death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought so at the time, and think so still—I reminded Mr. Calthorp that he had opened the vein in my presence—I did not observe exostosis—the rib was removed before I arrived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you a member of the College of Surgeons it the time this took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Mr. Calthorp and I were elected at the same time—it was not my business to attend this examination, nor had it been any part of my business to attend to the patient—pus in the knee is produced by other causes than bleeding, but seeing the state of the vein, I should say this was quite satisfactory—if it had arisen from phlebitis, it would be found in the other joints as well as the knee—I did not examine to see if there was pus in any other joint—I think phlebitis caused the death of this person—I give that opinion without having seen the injury in the rib, but I was told what that was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse at Charing cross hospital. I attended Crowl—he appeared very bad in his health, owing to something the matter with his chest, I believe—he was bled—he got worse afterwards—he com<lb></lb>plained of his arm being very stiff—I looked at it, and there was a kind of black came along the arm—it extended up the upper arm and down the fore arm—it swelled very much, and I thought he had erysipelas in the arm—I applied poultices and fomentations, and other things to reduce the swelling, but it continued inflamed two or three days—I cannot tell how often he was bled—I believe Mr. Calthorp bled him previous to the arm being swollen.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LUCAS</hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Argyle-street. I am now lecturer on surgery, at the North London School of Medicine—I am surgeon at a metropolitan hospital, and have been demonstrator of anatomy</p>

               <p>at Charing-cross hospital for five years. I have heard the evidence of the medical gentlemen and the nurse—from which, in my judgment, the de<lb></lb>ceased died from phlebitis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that from the evidence you have heard of there being secretion of pus in the knee-joint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not entirely—there is the condition of the vein of the arm, the swelling of the arm, and the unusual circumstance of his dying of a fractured rib—it is agreed by surgeons, that pus in the joints is a consequence of phlebitis; my opinion is, that the pus in the knee-joint was occasioned by bleeding in the arm—I do not consider the pus occasioned death, but it is a symptom of the termination of the disease of phlebitis, or one of the terminations—I should be of opinion that phlebitis existed when pus was only mentioned as existing in the knee-joint, but, at the same time, it would be desirable that other organs should be examined, as pus might be found in them, in the lungs, and so on, but if it was not found, my opinion is still, that the pus in the knee-joint was the consequence of phlebitis—pus in the knee-joint is the consequence of many other disorders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing phlebitis was occasioned by bleeding in the arm, how long might it take to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There have been cases of forty<lb></lb>eight hours, sometimes longer—a great deal depends on the state of the constitution—I mean if produced by bleeding in the arm—it runs a rapid course sometimes—I have heard the diseased rib described—I do not say that would not cause the death of a person—I have never known a case of death, in fifty or sixty cases, of fractured rib—I never knew death, but once, which was where it pierced the lung—a fractured rib to a person in an ill state of health, would be more likely to cause death—I have heard that coughing gave him great pain in the left side—that is not a symptom of phlebitis—it is a symptom of a broken rib, and also of pleurisies, and other things as well—I have heard the account Mr. Calthorp has given of the inside of the chest—I have observed as severe appearances without death being caused—I do not think the inflammation described sufficient to cause death—it might be with a person of bad habit of body, but my opinion is, that it would not, certainly, of course it might occasion death—I should think the pus in the knee could not be occasioned by external injury, because the patient would probably have directed the attention of the parties to it—a blow might occasion it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why inflammation of those members might even consume them both? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—then, of course, death would fol<lb></lb>low—there is not a more artificial injury than a broken rib—my opinion is, he died of phlebitis—a blushing of the arm is characteristic of phlebitis—it occasionally arises without any fault on the part of the medial man.</p>

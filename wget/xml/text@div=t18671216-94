                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, and we carry on business at 243, Holborn—on Thursday, the 3rd October, the prisoner came to our shop and gave an order to my father—I did not hear the first part of the conversation, but I heard him say that he had a farm at Barking, in Essex—that he was in the habit of bringing milk up every morning by the Eastern Counties Railway, and that he wanted a cart harness to bring it to his sale rooms in Hatton Garden—the price first agreed upon for the harness was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we lent him an old harness for that day—I saw him afterwards in reference to the price, and it was arranged to sell it for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the harness was sent by one of our men named Clarke, but we never received the money for it—the old harness was sent back—he said on one occasion he would call and pay me—I saw him on the Friday, and he said he should not be up from the farm till the 12th, and he would call then—he did not call—I called at Hatton Garden twice on that evening, once about five, and again at half-past six—I saw two or three different people there—I did not see him again till I saw him in Holborn, and pointed him out to an officer, who took him into custody—he said he had a quantity of cows on his farm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of the last witness—early in October the prisoner came to my shop and asked if I had a good second-hand harness—after some little conversation I said he had better get a new one, and it was agreed that I should make anew one for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then said, "You must lend me an old one to use, for I have to bring up milk every day from my farm at Barking by the Eastern Counties Railway, and it is necessary that I should have a harness for immediate use—I am always at my shop at Hatton Garden at ten and five o'clock"—I told him he should have the harness in a week, but I did not send it until the follow<lb></lb>ing Tuesday week—I did not have any more to do with him after that—I parted with my harness because I thought he was a respectable man with a farm at Barking—he said he had a quantity of cows, but he did not mention the number—he said his farm was at Barking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That induced you to make the harness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was not owing to what Clarke told me, and seeing the name in the Directory, that I allowed him to have the harness—I saw the name of George Gould, of Bleeding Hart Yard, in the Directory, and I thought he was the same man—the Directory was seven years old—at the time the prisoner ordered the harness he did not say anything about Bleeding Hart Yard—he said he brought his milk to sell at Charles Street, Hatton Garden—the harness was sent there—I parted with the harness because I thought he was the owner of cows at Barking, and from seeing the name in the Directory—he looked over a good many harnesses in our shop—he saw some silver-mounted harness—we had no second-hand set of harness except that we lent to him—the value of that was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was my pro<lb></lb>position that he should have new harness—I said it would be cheaper for him in the end.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you have parted with your harness at all if he had not said he was a farmer at Barking, and had a number of cows then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—certainly not—he said what milk he did not sell in the Eastern Counties he sold at Charles Street.</p>

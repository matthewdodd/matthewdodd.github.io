            . In the month of June, I arrived here from North America, and after I had made a sale of the little effects I brought over with me and had received the money. I was curious to see the city, having never been in England before: I happened on the 5th of July to pass through a place called <placeName id="t17750913-32-crimeloc160">Salt-petre Bank</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was this room above stairs or below stairs?</p>
               <p>Hanna. Below stairs, After I had sat down she begged I would send out for something to drink, and she would tell me what she had to say to me: I gave her a shilling; she carried it, to the door and returned immediately with the prisoner Brown; Brown returned me the shilling  and said it was a bad one, and asked me if I had any more money; I told her, I had not any more money, as I was not willing to let her know I had any gold about me; but at the same time I put my hand upon my pocket, which I believe they observed,

             came and sat down beside me, and began to use some freedoms; she laid one hand on my back and unbuttoned part of my breeches with the other; during this time, Ives sat down close on the other side; she turned the inside of my pocket out, and took from thence a shammy pocket of an old pair of breeches that I had cut out and put my money in; there were fifty-one guineas and seven half guineas: on my discovering that my pocket was turned inside out, they immediately fled out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you said something.</p>
               <p>Hanna. I had no time to say any thing; I buttoned my breeches as soon as I could and followed them to the door; there were some people at the door; I said, I had been robbed by two women that ran out at the door; a girl came up directly, and said, I lied, that I had no money to lose; and two men came up, they d - n'd me, and said, I lied, for I had no money, and they struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this girl and these men come out of the house?</p>
               <p>Hanna. I don't know; they met me at the door, they did not belong to the house, as I saw; during the hurry, a number of people came round, and a woman came and shut the door of the house I was robbed in; I did not see her, till I saw her lock the door, I laid hold of her, and said, I had been robbed in that house, and would take care of her; I had hold of her, and wrested the key out of her hand, but was soon obliged to let her go, and was glad to get away with my life. I was then advised to inform justice Sherwood's runners of it, which I did, but I believe it was of no service, for one of them, whose name is Farrell, was the pretended husband of the prisoner Brown; they took several people but not the right: I believe they had no intention to take them. On the 7th, I was informed they had sled to the house of one Mrs. M' Carty at Deptford; I hired one of justice Sherwood's runners to go with me  Deptford after them; when we came to the house, that man did not choose to go in to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken?</p>
               <p>Hanna. The same night by one Weston, a constable, to whom I complained, and desired him to watch an opportunity to take them; there were thirty-two guineas and a half guinea found upon Brown: I was not at the finding of it.</p>

               <p>"it was about five o'clock, but that it might</p>

I then shut the gate and took him from the women's yard, to a yard of our own, and asked him, if he was sure she was the person; he laid, I am sure that pockfretten woman is the person that has got all my money: I said to him, my friend be sure, for you will be called to an account when you come to another court; he said positively Robertson was the person that robbed him, and Lawson was the person that was with her.</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse, a public house, in New Gravel-lane, Shadwell. In the beginning of July two women were brought to our house by the prosecutor; he charged them with a robbery; he pulled one of the womens hats off, and said, you are the woman, I will swear to you.</p>

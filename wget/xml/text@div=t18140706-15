On the 16th of May, we were about letting our house; the prisoner came with a view of looking at the house. I missed the watch out of my bed-room. I always kept my bed-room door locked. My servant had left the key in the door. I came down stairs, and asked her where was the key of the chamber door; she said, in the door. I went up; I found the prisoner standing at the door, and my watch was not to be found. I at last found my watch had been pledged at Mr. Flemming. The prisoner must have taken it from the dressing room case; my servant had been in the room not ten minutes before. I saw the watch in the dressing use about five o'clock, when I put my cap on.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER. I am a pawnbroker. On the 16th of May. the prisoner offered me a silver watch to pledge; she went away. The next day, Mr. Coates came, he said he had lost his watch; he described the prisoner, in consequence of that information. On the 25th of May, the same watch was offered again, by a man; he said, he had taken it out of Mr. Cotterill's, Shoe-lane, for a guinea, and in the afternoon the prisoner came again, with a tablespoon; I had her taken into custody. I am sure the prisoner is the person that offered the watch to pawn with me; she wanted twenty-five shillings upon it; I would not advance her above eighteen shillings; and when she offered me the watch I took the watch into my hand.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my watch; I lost it on Monday the 16th of May; I am positive she is the woman that was in my house.</p>

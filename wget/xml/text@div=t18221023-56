On the night of Tuesday, the 10th of September, I was the last person in the shop, but not the last person up; I barred and bolted the shop, and locked the back parlour door, and took the key up stairs with me. All the windows<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230044"></xptr>and doors were safe. I went to bed about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and did not get up till seven o'clock in the morning. I went to the parlour door (nobody had been there before me that morning); I found the door bolted inside, and could not get in. I went out at the private door, and found the shop door ajar - it opens into the street. I had secured it with a bar across the middle, and two bolts; it had been opened from inside; the entrance had been made by the parlour door - how they got there I cannot say - they must have entered by a false key. I found the inside window sash drawn aside, and missed the articles stated in the indictment; there were not above forty seals, worth 45 l.; the black lead pencils were in the pencil cases; the total value of the property was about 200 l. I found a punch ladle handle on the floor - the silver bowl had been broken off and taken away. I should know some of the ear-rings again - some of them were quite a new pattern, which I had only bought five days before. I always write my private mark on the pencils, with the price, on a place which I cut for the purpose. Some pencils have been found, which have the marks all cut off from the place I usually cut them; it is not usual to cut them, to put a mark on. I went directly to Bow-street; and in consequence of information, I went with the officers on the 11th of October, to a place we were directed to, and as we were at the back of Pancras New Church, we met the prisoner with a woman; the officer said,</p>
               <p>"Ned, I want you, and Charlotte, I want you." They asked what he wanted them for; he said, to go to their lodging; one of them said,</p>
               <p>"We don't lodge here, we lodge at Marylebone." The prisoner began to be restive, and he was obliged to be handcuffed. We took them to Draper's-place, Burton-crescent; the officer then said to the woman,</p>
               <p>"Which house is it?" She looked round, and said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know this place, I never was here in my life," (the prisoner was close to her, and said nothing); the officer told me to knock at No. 27, which I did, and said to the landlady,</p>
               <p>"Do you know this lady and gentleman?" She said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, they lodge here;" they did not contradict her - the officers went up stairs and searched. The prisoner went into the first floor with them, and the woman into the second. A pair of ear drops were produced, which I knew, the tops of these drops were found in the woman's ears, and taken out before the Magistrate and compared. I knew them to be the same which I bought on the 5th of September. I saw the officer take twenty-two pencils from the prisoner's pocket - they were cut as I cut them to put into pencil cases; I knew them in a moment, and have not the least doubt in the world of their being part of the property stolen that night. I found a handkerchief in a chair by the shop window, and a dark lantern on a table in my parlour, and a piece of silk on it. I was present when the officers found some skeleton keys, crow Bars, and phosphorous boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you never seen pencils put ready into cases - A. They are always so, I always cut a flat place to put the mark on. There is one pencil among them, which I can swear I had one exactly like; it is black with rubbing up and down; I had had it a long time by me; it went very stiff in the case. The ear-rings are brought to me by persons who get them from the wholesale shops. I was with the prisoner till Bond had done searching the room. I did not see him take the pencils from any where, and put them into his pocket, it was a month after the robbery. When I saw the bottoms of the ear-rings, I doubted about them - but when I saw the bottoms and tops together, I had no doubt, I had sold none of that pattern.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I went with the prosecutor on the 10th of October, in search of this property - Davis accompanied us. Just at the back of the New Pancras Church, I met the prisoner with a female on his arm; Davis said</p>
               <p>"Here they come." I took one, and he the other. I did not know the prisoner by name. I did not hear Davis address him; I took the prisoner, and he the woman. I asked him where he lived; he said in Marylebone. I said I was not satisfied about that. Davis said,</p>
               <p>"I know where you live." I don't recollect whether he made any answer. He resisted, and we handcuffed him, and took him to the house; I was not the first who got there. Davis or Skelton knocked. A woman came to the door; Davis asked if they did not lodge there; she said Yes. I took the prisoner up one pair of stairs; the prosecutor was with us. I did not know then but that was the room he lived in. I searched him, and found a box key, which he said belonged to his chest or box. I found two more, one a latch, and the other a fall key; I asked how he came by them - he said</p>
               <p>"What of that?" On searching his coat pockets, I found a small bundle of pencils, and a small screw-driver - he had a pair of pincers in his hand, when we took him. At the top of the cupboard I found two latch keys, a file, a broken key, five skeleton keys, and a large drop key, they were wrapped up in a piece of green moreen, and then in brown paper. Mr. Skelton found some duplicates, which do not relate to the charge. I asked if the keys belonged to him - he said No, and that he knew nothing about them. During this time, Davis was up stairs with the woman; he brought a bag of keys down, which we took to the office. I went to a place at the back of Newcastle-street, Oxford-street, with the key which he said belonged to his chest; Mr. Skelton directed me then, and in a box there, I found a bunch of large keys, and a bunch of small ones - three of which I take to be skeleton keys. The woman stood at the bar, before the Magistrate, with him. I then took from her ears, a pair of ear-rings, without drops. Davis produced a pair of drops, which were matched with the tops; the prosecutor was then quite positive that they were his. I think what the woman said was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When Davis and you met them, were you near each other - A. As near as we could be - but the prisoner made so much noise. I could not hear what Davis said; I had a bad cold in my head, and could not hear well. I understood they lodged on the second floor. I found the keys on the first.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who took you into that room - A. The door was open. He claimed nothing in that room.</p>
               <p>MR. SKELTON. I sent Bond to Castle-street, in consequence of information.</p>

            . I accompanied the prosecutor and Bond; and near the end of Draper's place, by Pancras Church, I saw the prisoner and his wife - she lives with him. I knew them before; I said</p>

               <persName id="t18221023-56-person649">Ned</persName>

               <persName id="t18221023-56-person650">Charlotte</persName>
             I want you." The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"What do you want<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230045"></xptr>of me, where is your warrant?" I said</p>
               <p>"We don't want a warrant." He was very obstreperous - Bond handcuffed him. I said we must go to their lodging; he said they did not lodge there, they lodged in Marylebone; I said I knew better, and desired him to come to Draper's place. I went first with the women, and Bond followed close with the prisoner. I desired the woman to go to her lodging; she said she did not lodge there - the prisoner was close to her, and must have heard her. I then knocked at No. 27 - the landlady opened the door. I asked her if they lodged there; she said</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, they do." They made no answer. We went up stairs to the front room, first floor. I first tried the back room door, and could not open it for some time; then we went into the front room. Bond searched, and found what he has produced. The landlady saw us go into the first floor - neither she nor the prisoner said it was not their room. I took the woman up to the second floor, and began searching the front room there - and in a cupboard, (which was open), by the side of the fire-place, I found a quantity of duplicates, and among them, one relating to a ring, which led me to Baxter's, in Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. I have kept the duplicate ever since; it is dated the 21st of September, 1822. I saw a little box in the room, but could not find the key; after looking in both rooms, the woman found the key at the foot of the bed, in the back room. I found nothing in the box, and proceeded to search further about the closets, and on the top of the closet by the fireside, I found a small crow bar; it has been used, and is broken. I went into the back room, (the bed-room), the woman gave me the keys - and in a box in the room, the key of which was on a ring with others she gave me, I found a pair of gold drops of ear-rings, wrapped in cotton. I heard her say something about them, before the Magistrate, but it was not taken down in writing I am quite certain; the prisoner stood by her at the time; the clerk was not writing. She said her brother had brought them fifteen or eighteen months ago. The prisoner said nothing to it. I continued the search and found twenty-four skeleton keys, in a bag, in a closet, at the top of two pair of stairs - and in the same bag were four Bramah's keys, and one key which would open a French lock; five of the keys which were in the bag, were in a small bag by themselves, within the large one - they appeared to be more used than the others. And in a closet in the bed-room, I found three phosphorus boxes, and some matches with them. The prisoner was committed, and the woman discharged as his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know O'Hare - A. I have known a man of that name. I do not know whether he ever lodged there. The prisoner's lodging is on the second floor.</p>
               <p>MR. SKELTON. I believe the ear-rings to be part of the property stolen - A. I had some precisely of that pattern. The pencils are all cut in the place where I cut them, to mark them, except one - here is one which I observed with black marks, from moving up and down in the case; it is a particularly small size, which I could not sell; it is cut where I cut mine - here is one cut through to the lead to cut the mark off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All you know is that they have cuts at the bottom - A. No; There were two or three which were left on sale or return, and them I did not cut or mark - the cases of them are a new pattern. One of those pencils are here. I found no cases. Customers generally move the pencils in and out when they look at them. Here is one not marked at all - that is cut, but not by me. I have no mark on the ear-rings. Here are twenty-one pencils in all; one has been cut for the purpose of writing.</p>

            . I am a bedstead maker, and live in Marylebone-passage, Well-street, Oxford-street. The prisoner worked for me at making press bedsteads. On the night of the 10th of September, I was at the White Horse, public-house, Castle-street, Oxford-market, where there is a club held, and was in the prisoner's company there from ten o'clock till half-past ten. He was very much intoxicated at half-past ten, in such a state that he could hardly walk out of the parlour. I observed at the time that Teddy had got his whack.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know his wife - A. Only by her coming backward and forward to the shop. I don't belong to the club. I don't know where he lives, as he had moved once or twice. He earned 23 s. or 24 s. a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he work at home, or at your warehouse - A. Yes; I have frequented this house for four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember the 10th of September, from any other night - A. He had had some beer at my shop in the morning, and through that he got drunk, and in the evening he went to the White Horse; he was formerly clerk to the club, and was so drunk he could not manage the books. It was on Tuesday night; the club is held every Tuesday night.</p>

He had a bedstead to make for himself, and was at work at it; the turner was to bring the feet of it home on Saturday, and did not till Monday. He was taken up a month or three weeks after. I know it was on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that - A. Why, the turner mentioned in our shop, that he had passed the house at the time the robbery was committed. I saw in the newspaper, a week after, that the robbery was in King-street - and that it was committed on the 12th. I have known him drunk before; he was not given to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you certain of the date - A. I referred<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230046"></xptr>to the club-books a fortnight ago, and reckoned that was the night he was drunk, because another man signed the book instead of him, as he was drunk; the book of that night is not his writing.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner two years, and am master of the club; he acted as secretary on club nights, which are Tuesdays. I produce the club-book which he keeps, and find that on the third Tuesday in the month he did not act, as the book is not in his writing; he has only signed the book on one Tuesday in the month, that is, the 24th. On the 3d and 10th Mr. Cantlin signed it, because the prisoner was drunk; he was not there on the 17th; he was rather drunk on the 3d, to the best of my recollection; the names of those present are not entered. Bailey was in the room on the night of the 10th, as a visitor. I remember Coleman (one of the members) asking if the prisoner was not liable to a fine, as he was not able to sign the book. The club broke up about ten or half-past ten o'clock; the prisoner was very drunk, and just able to walk out of the room.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What club is this - A. A shoe-club. Here is his writing on the 24th, it is only the words</p>
               <p>"in hand;"</p>
               <p>"J. Hopkins" is not his writing. I will swear they are not both written by the same hand; the landlord always signs the book; he paid his fees that night - a member only pays once.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was never at the club till then - A. Yes; but had not paid; he was there on the first and second Tuesday in the month.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. I don't belong to the club, but was at it on the night of the 10th, when he was there very tipsy; I was at another table with a person; the prisoner was very tipsy, and the clerk asked the favour of me to settle the book for him, being secretary to a tailor's club, which meets at that house, and I did; I settled the book once before - (looking at it) - here is my writing in it on the 10th.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before had you settled it - A. On the 3d; he was absent that night. I cannot say what hour he went away, it might be ten or half-past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure he was not there on the 3d - A. Yes; positive. It was his place to settle the book every night, if he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk on the 3d - A. I cannot say whether he was there or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said he was not - A. I may be mistaken; but recollect very well his being there on the 10th, and Bailey remarking,</p>

            . I live with the prisoner, but am not his wife. On the 10th of September I fetched him home from the White-Horse, Castle-street; he was very tipsy indeed. We lived at that time in Little Barlow-street, High-street, Marylebone; he slept with me that night, and did not not go out till between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, when he went to work.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time in the evening did you go to the club for him - A. The watchman went half-past ten o'clock as I went into Cavendish-square. I went into the passage and sent the servant into the club-room for him; I saw Mr. Beech there, and Mr. Bailey came out of the door at the same time and spoke to me; while I was waiting there he said something; as he passed I said,</p>

               <p>"How do you do Mr. Bailey?" he nodded to me and went in again; he said nothing about the prisoner's situation. I waited there about a quarter of an hour. We did not live in Draper's-buildings then, but have since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the 10th of October, had you lived there - A. Four days; we moved every thing from our last lodging, which was in Little Brownlow-street, where we went to live on the 1st of 
               <persName id="t18221023-56-person658">August. We</persName>
             had the second floor in Draper's-buildings, and had slept there the night before the officers stopped us in the street; the prisoner was going to work then; he had stopped at home to hang a window. I have lived with him between nine and ten years, some people call me by his name; I told the Magistrate I was not his wife. He was taken up three years ago, but discharged by Mr. Birnie immediately; that only happened once to my knowledge. I was taken up the same night, and was brought here as a witness then against a relation of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular reason have you for remembering this was on the 10th of September - A. Because

             ended on the Friday before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the officer took you, you lodged in Draper's Buildings - A. Yes; I said I did not live there, as I did not wish then to create a piece of work in the neighbourhood - Q. How long have you had the skeleton keys - A. Ten months, I had them of a brother of mine; they were in a bag, and he told me where they were, and he said he did not like them to be there, and I fetched them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where from - A. From a place where he had hid them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that - A. In a field, if you must know, at Paddington - they were hid under a hedge, with the crow. I hung them in a bag in the cupboard, at the top of the stairs; there was no bolt or any thing on the door. He told me to fetch them from the field - I have had them ever since. I lodged at that time in Margaret-court, and moved from there to Suffolk Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the picklock keys and crow-bar with you - A. Yes; I put them in a dust pail - I did not like to leave them behind, as I knew they were not right things - they were not kept for use. I did not like them to be exposed, or I should have sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think, if they were found in your possession, you would get into trouble - A. I thought if any honest person had them there was no harm. I did not clean them - some of them were wrapped up - I never opened them. I advised my brother to let them be where they were, but he said they might be found, and some mischief come of them. I have had them at four different lodgings. Two of the phosphorus boxes belonged to my brother and were in the bag; they were of no service - I could never get a light with them. - (Upon being tried in Court, the phosphorus produced a light instantly.) - I do not know who lodged on the first floor. The White Horse is a mile and a half or two miles from Barlow-street. He did not come home to tea that afternoon, which made me think he might be drunk - he was very drunk;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230047"></xptr>he held by my arm. I am certain I spoke to Bailey there; he came out into the passage; I went and stood talking to some women at the door, and saw the prisoner come out. I did not see Bailey return to the room.</p>

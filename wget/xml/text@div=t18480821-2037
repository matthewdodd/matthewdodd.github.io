                  </hi>. I live with my mother, at the Bricklayers' Arms, Eccleston-street, Pimlico. My father died last Dec.—he was alive at the time of this robbery, but it hastened his death—on 15th Sept. last, about a quarter-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Eccleston-street, near our house, and the two prisoners came up to me, and asked if I could tell them where the Bricklayers' Arms was—I do not think they mentioned the land<lb></lb>lord's name—I directed them—I went home half an hour after, and they were then standing at the bar, drinking gin and water—on 21st Sept., about seven in the evening, I saw both the prisoners again—I saw Lawrence first in company with another man, not Chappel—they were standing at the counter, taking half-and-half—Chappel came in shortly afterwards, and called for a glass of half-and-half—he stood talking to me about a quarter of an hour—after that Lawrence and his companion asked for two glasses of gin—Chappel was not with them—I had to turn my back to serve the gin, and when I turned round again Chappel was gone—I did not see him go—Law<lb></lb>rence and his companion had some gin and cigars—they then began to talk about their friend not having come; that they should not stop any longer, and they left shortly after—soon after that, my sister Mary, who was sitting sewing, jumped up, and ran up stairs, as though something had suddenly attracted her attention—she then called out to me that the house had been robbed.</p>

               <p>sitting in the bar-parlour, at work—there are some stairs that lead up to the sleeping apartments, across the passage, facing the bar-parlour door—I remember seeing Lawrence at the bar—I heard two men talking at the bar, and another one talking to my brother, and all at once I thought I heard a step at the bottom of the stairs, going from the stairs to the tap-room door; push the tap-room door open instantly which makes a noise, let it go, and go very quickly across the passage, out at the front door—I jumped up, went into the bar, took up a candlestick, and I saw Lawrence and another man. standing at the bar—Chappel was not the second man—I went up stairs, and as I went up Lawrence and the other man went out at the front door—I found my mother's bed-room door standing open—it had been locked, and I had seen the key in the till a quarter of an hour before, and it was there when I went down again—I smelt a smell of lucifer-matches, went in, and found the closet-door standing open, which was always kept locked, and my mother had the key in her pocket—I instantly ran down stairs, and gave the alarm that the bed-room and cupboard doors had been broken open, and the money gone—the money had been in the closet in my mother's bed-room—I had seen it safe in the afternoon—there was a hundred sovereigns in one bag, and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in the other—the closet-door appeared to have been forced open by some small instrument; the screws—were forced off the lock—there was the mark of the instrument in two places—the room-door appeared to have been opened by picking the lock; there was no appearance of violence—I had seen my mother lock the cupboard-door, between two and three that afternoon, and put the key in her pocket—she then locked the bedroom-door, brought the key down stairs, and put it in the till.</p>

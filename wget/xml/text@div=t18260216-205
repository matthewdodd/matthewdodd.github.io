I had some money in my pocket, but I did not lose that - a woman came from a street on the opposite side of the way, which startled them, and they made away with my hat, which had fallen off while I was on the ground.</p>

            . I am a dismounted patrol. About a quarter before one o'clock I and two others were near Shoreditch church; the prisoner passed with something under his jacket - we went up to him, and took the hat from under his jacket; he said he had been having a bl-t-d lark with his companion; I asked who it belonged to, and he said to a bricklayer, and then to a bricklayer's labourer - I asked the name - he said, "I don't know that I have any occasion to tell you."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman carpenter, and live at No. 2, Wood-street. On the 17th of Oct., about a quarter to five o'clock in the evening, I was passing along a lane near Temple Mills, by the Eastern Counties Railway, and saw the prisoner with a gun—he was beating the bushes—I told him he was carrying the gun in a very unlawful manner—some words passed between us—he told me to go and be b----, it was no business of mine—I said I knew it was no business of mine, I was only giving him a little advice—he said, "Go and be b——"—I said, "I think the best thing I can do is to take you to Mr. Mole, to see if he has autho<lb></lb>rized</p>

               <p>you to carry a gun about the premises in that kind of manner"—I thought Mr. Mole was the owner of the land—he said, "Very well"—he uncocked the gun, and walked alongside of me about ten yards—he then made a sudden start, and ran off, and I after him; and when I was about ten yards from him, he turned round, and fired the gun at me, the shot hit me on the right side of the head, which bled—it knocked me down—I got up and followed him as soon as I could—I got hold of him—he threw me down—we both went down together, and he got from me—I caught him again, and he was taken into custody—I was ill from the wound about a week or ten days—I went to a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner on the ground—the gun was then unloaded—the prisoner was crying, and said he was very sorry for what had happened; he did not know he had shot him, and if he would go home to his parents they would recompense him for what he had done.</p>

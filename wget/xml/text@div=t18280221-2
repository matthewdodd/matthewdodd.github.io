I knew him before, but was not particularly acquainted with him; I knew him six months ago. I walked about half a mile with him on this night - it was neither light nor dark; there was no moon: when I said I had no money he gave me a blow on the temple, with his fist; I fell from the blow, and he rifled my pockets; another person, who I could not identify, was with him; he came from the hedge, or the ditch, after I was struck - I had not seen him before that; I hallooed Murder! several times, and told him to save my life - they told me to hush; they both filled my month with gravel and dirt; they ran away and left me, after the prisoner had rifled my pocket of my purse - I cannot tell whether he searched more than one pocket, for I was struggling at the time. I only had a halfpenny left; it was a silk purse, and contained a crown-piece, two half-crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence; I had not looked at my purse after I left Osnaburgh-street, which is half a mile off; they both kicked me about the ribs, five or six times, after they got my purse, and then left me; I was perfectly sober. I knew the prisoner before, and have not the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it by his clothes that you know him? A. No, by his speech. I told the watchman and turnpike-man what his clothes were, and told the officer I knew him by his clothes as well as his dress. I had drank part of four glasses of gin and water with three people, at a house in Osnaburgh-street - Mr. Elliott's foreman was one of them; I do not know the others, or the sign of the house; I was never there before - I went there to engage with the foreman to work; I had nothing else that day except half a pint of porter at Holloway. I went to the house in Osnaburgh-street about half-past six o'clock, and left at half-past eight; I paid the reckoning, which was 2s.; I treated the foreman and the other men; I was attacked two or three hundred yards from the toll-bar; the bell of the toll-bar rang while I was being robbed; I was quite close under the bell at the time when I gave the alarm; it rang for six or seven minutes; I could see the prisoner's face as he walked by the lamps, when he first joined me - the lamps are below the toll-bar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure you saw his person? A. Yes; I had light for more than three hundred yards, and he has worked with me, on the same premises in Duvall's-lane, but we were not acquainted - I knew his voice; he had a snuff-coloured coat, a light waistcoat, and dark trousers. I came to the turnpike, and gave an alarm directly; I then went to the watch-house, and when I returned to the place I saw two officers, as I was looking for my hat, which I had lost in the scuffle - I mentioned it to them. The prisoner was taken about two o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am keeper of Kentish-town watch-house. On the 8th of February, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night, the prosecutor came to the watch-house - his right side was all over mud, and a little sprinkle of blood just under his eye; he appeared to have been ill-used, and seemed agitated. I did not perceive that he was in liquor. I sent two watchmen with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the watch-house near the tollgate? A. No, it may be a quarter of a mile from it; I heard no bell ring; I was in doors. The toll-bar bell is rather large; it is an alarm-bell; I never heard it ring in my life; I know nothing of it being out of order: it was a darkish night - I should think too dark to distinguish a snuff-coloured coat; I do not think the moon was up.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 8th of February, about five minutes past eleven o'clock. I was in the Junction-road, and heard of this robbery - I saw the prosecutor at Kentish-town; about five minutes past eleven - he appeared to have been much ill-used; he had no hat on - he said he had been knocked down and robbed, about 200 or 250 yards off the toll-gate, and said what he had been robbed of: in consequence of the description he gave me, I went, with Prendergrass, by his direction to a public-house in Duvall's-lane, to be informed who the party were; Prendergrass got information there - and about half-past one o'clock we took the prisoner, out of bed, up stairs in Pullen's-gardens; he was undressed - this is about three quarters of a mile from where the robbery was committed, if you go across the fields; Prendergrass took him down stairs to Hitchiner, who identified him as the man who had robbed him; Prendergrass brought him up stairs again, and asked where he was at ten o'clock - he said he had been at home, playing at cards with his wife, and he was going to bed at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Was the prosecutor asked "Is this the man who robbed you?" A. Yes, he had not spoken in the prosecutor's presence then; he was dressed - I heard Hitchiner say he was the man; I was on the stairs - if the prisoner had spoken loud, I should have heard him; I was about twelve yards from them: it is about three quarters of a mile across the fields to the Junction-road, where the robbery was committed; it may be a mile and a quarter the road way - there are paths across the field.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the prisoner had not spoken - had the prosecutor given any reason for knowing him? A. Only his dress; he told me before he saw him, that he had a snuff-coloured coat, with bright buttons; a light waistcoat and dark trousers; and that he had worked with him at Mr. Phillip's; I found the snuff-coloured coat in the room, he also described the other man - one was taken who corresponded in dress, but he could not swear to him.</p>

            . I am inspector of the Bow-street patrol. I saw the prosecutor about twenty minutes past eleven, in the Junction-road, about one hundred yards from the toll-bar, in company with Wallis - he was very dirty, and a little blood issuing from his cheek; I thought at first that he had been drinking in the early part of the evening - but he was perfectly collected.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you think he had been drinking? A. By his appearance, but whether it was the effect of the blow or his flurry, I cannot say; I asked if he had been drinking in the early part of the evening - he said, "No, but I have been ill-used, and am much agitated;" he appeared so - he described two men to me, and said, if I went to the Henley Arms public-house, Duvall's-lane, and described them, the landlord could tell me the man's name, and where he could be found; he told me he had a dark coat, but did not mention the colour, or what buttons; I went with him to the Henley Arms - he gave the landlord a description, and I learnt the prisoner's name; I went to Pullen's-gar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210005"></xptr>dens, Holloway, and found the prisoner on the first floor - I first asked where he was at ten o'clock that night; he said in bed - I asked if he had been out early in the evening, he said Yes, for a few errands; I then told him to dress - I brought him down stairs to the prosecutor, who was waiting outside; the light was then nearly the same as it was at ten o'clock - the prosecutor was walking away; I called him back, and said, "do you know this man;" he said,"That is the man who knocked me down, and robbed me"- I then gave him into the custody of Wallis, while I went after another man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You thought he had been drinking in the early part of the evening? A. I thought so, he said he had only had part of four glasses of gin and water; he said he knew the man, by seeing him from time to time in Duvall's-lane, but did not say anything about the man's dress or speech; he did not tell me he had worked with him, but that while he worked in Duvall's-lane, he knew where he worked; I think the prisoner said he had been out for coals and bread.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Cammerell at Hanwell; I got up between six and seven o'clock on Wednesday the 22nd of October, and went into the house-keeper's room below stairs, I found the sash thrown open; there is only one window to the room, there were inside shutters, they had not been put to; I found the locks to two cupboard doors and the locks on two drawers. in that room broke open; I missed a black silk cloak and a linen table cloth, and I missed some shirts which the young gentleman gave to me, there were three or four of them; this window looks into the garden.</p>
               <p>Was you in that room the night before? - No; I was in the day, but not at night.</p>
               <p>What time did the family go to bed? - About eleven, and I went to bed after twelve.</p>

               <p>Is the window high? - No; it is a very little way from the dresser, and there were in the middle of the room a sugar chopper and a dirty stick; the last time I was in the room before was in the morning, these cupboards and drawers were fast then; two of the locks were quite tore off, one had the wood broke.</p>

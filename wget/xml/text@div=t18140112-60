On the 23th of December, I missed one silk handkerchief, and on the next morning I missed four; they were taken by shoving the inside sash of one side; they were taken all at one time. I had just stepped backwards; when I returned my young man asked me if I had sold the silk handkerchiefs. This was just before seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that when he left your shop that these four silk handkerchiefs were safe in it - A. Yes, they were in the window, enclosed by a sliding sash.</p>

            How long were you absent from the shop - A. Two or three minutes. When I returned my servant asked me if I had sold a handkerchief. I only missed one that time; the next morning I examined the window; I missed the others. Two or three of them are remarkable ones. The next day, Wednesday, about three in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's apartment in Webb-square, Shoreditch; I took Kennedy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120032"></xptr>the officer, with me. The prisoner was at home; she keeps a clothes-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not she be as likely to have purchased them as to take them - A. Probably so. She was asked for a bundle of handkerchiefs that had been left there last night; she said, there was a bundle left there by two boys, but they had away in the morning; we were welcome to search if we choosed. On looking about, I opened a drawer: the first that presented itself was a particular handkerchief that I had described to the officer going along. I only found two; I missed four or five. She said, these two handkerchiefs were chucked out of the bundle by the two boys; she did not purchase them. I gave them to the officer. The two handkerchiefs are worth about six shillings.</p>

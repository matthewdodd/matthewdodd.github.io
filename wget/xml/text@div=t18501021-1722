                  </hi>. I keep the White Horse, in Little Britain. On the evening of 13th Sept. I saw the prisoners and another person in my house—Hutchings asked for half a quartern of gin—I had known him before at Westminster—I never knew anything bad of him—he seemed surprised to see me, and said he could not believe his eyes—he said, "Is not your name Griffin?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Did not you live at Westminster?"—I said, "Yes, you know that very well"—he gave a half-crown for the gin, and I noticed it was very black and dirty—I placed it on a partition in the parlour—the prisoners were there talking with me about five minutes—I noticed that the half-crown was bad, and went after them, just after they went out—they were standing, talking, and their hands were passing some-thing from one to the other—I came up, and said to Hutchings, "Mark, you have given me a bad half-crown; if you will give me back my change, I don't want any bother"—he made no answer—I said I should take him—I gave him to the officer, and the other two walked off—Perrin walked to the corner, and then he ran—I ran and took him.</p>

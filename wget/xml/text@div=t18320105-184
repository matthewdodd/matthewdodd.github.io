            . I am a Police-constable. In consequence of information I went to a furrier's shop, on the 12th of December, the prisoner was standing at the door, and his son was inside offering this skin for sale, at a very low price - I went in and took him; he did not hear what I said to the boy - I took him to the station, and from what he said, I went and took the prisoner to the station; I questioned him, and he said it was given to him by a young man named Watson, in Long-lane, to sell.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She said, "Let me put this skin into the drawer, and the Captain shall never have it any more;" this passed on for a month, and one Sunday, John Watson came to the door, and I let him in - he said "Is Margaret up?" I said Yes; she came to him and said, "How did you leave Henry?" he said, "In good spirits;" she said "I have the skin, do you think he will ask for it when he comes home" he said No; then said she "I will have it sold, and divide the money between us," and they gave it to me to sell.</p>
               <p>MARGARET WALTERS. That is not true - it was given to me by Captain Monro; I had shown it to the prisoner.</p>

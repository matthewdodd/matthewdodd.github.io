                  </hi>,(<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 293). About half-past 6 o'clock on the morning of 11th July, I was in Houndsditch—I saw Silk; he came from Bishopsgate-street with a cart and two cans called churns, one full and the other empty—I saw him stop at the corner of Cutler-street; he then drove on to Aldgate Church—he stopped there, took a measure from the cart, and poured six of those measures into this pail of milk—this is the measure and pail (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he took the liquid out of one of the high churns; Knight then came up in a cart, stood upon the rail and handed that pail full of some liquid to Silk—he pulled close up alongside of Silk's cart—Silk took the pail and poured the contents into the churn where he took the milk from—they then both drove round the corner into Aldgate—the milk that he took out of the one churn he put into another empty churn, and then he poured the liquid into the churn he took the milk from, and emptied the milk that he took out from the other churn into the pail—Silk then drove away, and Knight was in the act of driving away when I stopped him—I told him I was an officer, and asked him what he had in the pail, he said, "Milk," and that he bought it from the other man who had driven away, but had not paid for it—I told him he must consider him<lb></lb>self in custody, and I handed him over to another officer—I searched him at the station and found on him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and a knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper at 9, Perceval-street, Clerkenwell—Silk was in my employment as carter—Messrs.

I am a cow-keeper, and live at White-lion-street—I have known the prisoner sixteen years—during that time his character was that of an honest, hard-working, industrious man—I deal in milk—Mr. Knight has had a great many gallons of milk, and so have I, of him, in the street; purchasing one of another.</p>

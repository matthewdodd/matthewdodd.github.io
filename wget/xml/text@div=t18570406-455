                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Martin, a tobacconist, of No. 25, Ludgate Hill. On Saturday, 28th March, at a little before 4 o'clock, the prisoner came for a twopenny cigar—I was serving a customer, and saw the prisoner take a bundle of cigars from a box on the counter, put his handker<lb></lb>chief over them, and put them under his arm—I walked round the counter, took them from him, and gave him in charge—they weigh nearly 1 lb., they are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and are Mr. Martin's.</p>

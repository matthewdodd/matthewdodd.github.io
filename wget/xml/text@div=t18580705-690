About six months ago, the prisoner, whom I did not know, called upon me, and said that he was employed by the Commissioners of Sewers, that my drain wanted cleaning out, and he would do it for a half crown—I gave him a half crown, and engaged him to do it—if he had promised to clean it out without saying that he was in the employment of the Commissioners of Sewers, I should have known that he could not have done it—on 18th June, he came again, and said he was at work in the sewers, and he would clean my drain out, as it wanted it—in consequence of information I gave him in charge—I paid the half crown in Mr. Wing's presence.</p>

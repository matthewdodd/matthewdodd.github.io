             came by, and they ran away. We got a constable, and went back into Chick-lane, and searched the lodging-house, and found the prisoner; he had my cane in his possession. I cannot swear that he was one of the men that knocked me down. I was sober; I was going from Spitalfields to Soho.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house in Chick-lane, and asked for a lodging; he had lain there before; he had this cane in his hand: he threw it down, and went out again. When he came in again, I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it for a pot of beer, at the Raven next door to me. After I was in bed, I was knocked up by the constable; I let them in; they examined every person in the beds; they could not find the person suspected. After that, I was informed by some of the lodgers a cane was lost. Then I went after them, and told them of the cane; they came again, and the gentleman swore to the cane. The prisoner always behaved very well in his lodgings.</p>

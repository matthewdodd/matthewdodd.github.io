                  </hi>. I am a driver in the Royal Artillery. At a quarter before eleven o'clock on the evening of the 17th of February, I was in the tap-room of the King's Arm's public-house at Woolwich—the prisoner and five or six others were there—I pulled my purse out to pay for a pot of beer—I had then five halfcrowns and a sixpence, and enough halfpence to pay for the beer—in getting the halfpence out, the silver ran out into my hand, and the prisoner saw it—I put it into my purse, which I put into my pocket—I did not button the three lower buttons of my jacket—I then put my head on the table, and turned to speak to another young woman—the prisoner came to me—I found her hand in my pocket—I caught hold of her with the purse in her hand—she would not let it go—the was not drunk, nor was I—I had not been playing with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you missed your money, why did you permit the young woman beside you to leave your company; you had been sleeping on her shoulder; you said you knew where to find her on the morrow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not go away—when I got up to get the money from you, she sat still, and she is here now—the waiter got shoving me about and taking her prisoner's part—she went over to the other side of the room, where she had two or three more companions—the five half-crowns were taken out of the purse, but the sixpence is in it now—this is it in my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Woolwich.

On the 11th of January, I lost some pieces of wood, which we make from felling timber trees, on the premises of Mr. Fenning, at Manor-house Farm; I had felled the timber, and the wood I made in felling belongs to me; it laid in small heaps on the field - I met the three prisoners on the road, about a quarter of a mile from the field, with each a full sack, but I do not know what was in them; I asked what they had got, and Gobbey said they had got some wood; I told him they had been into Mr. Fenning's field, they said they knew they had; I said it was my property; they offered to carry it to my house if I would settle it - I would not; they said they thought the wood belonged to the gentlemen of the ground; if they had known it was mine, they would not have taken it. I left them and went on to my son; who had been left to watch the wood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you left them, where did they go? A. They went home. I took out a summons for them on the Monday, and they were before the Magistrates on the Friday; I have not got the chips here; they took them home I suppose; I never saw them at all - they would have been worth 9s. if they were sacks of chips: the Magistrate did not demand of these men 14s. a sack; or say they should go to the tread-mill for a month; he said 3s. a sack, but the whole expense came to 14s. 3d.; he did not say he would send them to the tread-mill in my presence; their families have gone to the parish since.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw these men come to the field, and fill the sacks with my father's wood; I did not speak to them; I thought I had better not go near them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from them? A. About twenty-five yards; they could not see me, it was very dark; it was about five o'clock; I could see them, because I was watching - I dare say they could have seen me if they had looked: I followed them, when they were going off with the wood, but I was not near them when my father met them - I did not go off the premises; I was not near enough to distinguish their faces, nor the colour of their clothes, but I saw three men filling sacks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know that these were the men? A. By my following them, and my father meeting them directly - I did not see him meet them: if my father had not met them, I should not have known it was them.</p>

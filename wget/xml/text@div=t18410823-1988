About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 30th of June, I saw the prisoner com<lb></lb>ing out of the Dock gate, I thought his pocket looked very bulky, I watched him across the road, and followed him about 100 yards—I never lost sight of him—I got up to him, and laid hold of his pocket—I said, "What have you got?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I am satisfied there is, I must see"—he said, "You have no business with me, as I am outside the Docks"—I said he must come back with me to the Docks—he said he should not—I said, "Well, you must come in here"—I took him into a shop—he pulled the bristles out of his coat-pocket, in this handkerchief—I put my hand to his breast, and told him he had got something there—he immediately pulled out this other handkerchief of bristles, which was spread over his front—he unbuttoned his waistcoat, and pulled them out from between his waistcoat and shirt—I asked him where he got them—he said he had them given to him—I asked who by—he said, "I refuse to tell"—I told him to come over to the Dock—he said, "I shall not"—I said if he did not I should use force, and call assistance—he went over, I took him to the superintendent's office—here is 4 1/2 Ibs. of bristles—the superintendent asked him his name—he refused to tell—he asked where</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman of the warehouse "D" at the St. Katharine's Docks. In September last there was a consignment of bristles from the <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi> to our Docks—they were put in the warehouse "D"—I have examined the bristles taken from the prisoner, and they correspond with the bristles from the That is—the casks were overhauled, they were covered with Russia mats, and roped over the mats—there had been no order to any one to examine that cask—when an order from the merchant comes, they cut open the mat, and the cooper attends, and takes the head of the cask out, to expose the whole—on going over the casks, I found the matting of one opened, not as if by authority—it was a very small space, that I could get my hand in—the head was broken, and some bristles gone, and some wrappers had no bristles in them—I found a differ<lb></lb>ence in the weight to what the cask was when it was brought into the Dock—I weighed it after this discovery, it weighed 8cwt. 3qrs. 7lb.—here are a sample of bristles from the cask—they come tied in bundles of about 2lb. weight—I have a sample of bristles fit for shoemakers—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for half an ounce of them, and these the prisoner had are worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound —those that the prisoner had are not calculated to work shoes—Cox weighed the casks when they landed.</p>

On the Saturday morning I was coming from Covent-garden; the prisoners followed my cart, and asked a boy in the cart if he would buy two boxes - they said they wanted some bread, and had just picked the boxes up in the street - the boy said he had but 6d.; he gave them 6d. for two boxes, and I bought two of them for 2d.; I afterwards heard of the robbery, went to Cuthbertson's, and delivered them up - I bought my two of Richardson.</p>

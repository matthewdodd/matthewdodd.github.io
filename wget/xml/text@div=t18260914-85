               <p>Q. When you parried the blow, did you strike his hand or arm? - A. No; I did not: the blow be struck me hit me in the left arm; I felt the arm bone stunned four or five minutes after he was gone; I went into the shop and found the blood began to run profusely, and went to a surgeon, as I found he had stabbed me in my left wrist through my shirt and coat - I had stopped his blow with my left arm - he made a blow at me, and came in contact with my left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at your deposition, and see if you say there that the blow reached you? - A. I was not asked - there certainly must be an error here - I told the Magistrate I had been stabbed - he aimed the blow at my breast - he made a straight forward rush, and I put up my arm - I was about three weeks getting well - it bled more after the first dressing - I did not discover it for four or five minutes after he was gone - it had then bled scarcely any - I discovered it first by the blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Was not your deposition read over to you before you signed it? - A. I believe it was, but I did not pay particular attention to it - I did not tell him he might go and be d-d, or that I would kick him out of the shop - immediately on receiving this thrust, I took him with my right hand and threw him out of the shop, and believe I struck him in the shop - he did not run into a butcher's shop for protection - I never said I would him kill or any thing of the sort; he went away within five minutes of my recovering the blow - I believed I told some of the neighbours I was stabbed - I do not know where I held him, when I put him out of the shop - I have not seen Mrs. Leach since I was at Bow-street - I do not know where she is.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Careless. The prisoner came into the shop and asked for Brooks - I pointed to him outside the shop - he called him in, and asked if he recollected seducing a person named Murray - Brooks asked if he was the person who had married her - he said Yes; and asked if he had 100l. to pay down for the child; Brooks said he had paid 50l. and had nothing further to do with it - they had some conversation, and, I believe, the prisoner abused him - he afterwards made a rush at him to hit him, as I thought - he aimed at his breast - Brooks warded it off with his left arm, and they came in contact with each other - they closed together - Brooks put him out of the shop - after he was gone I saw Brooks' arm bleeding - I had seen nothing in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? - A. Behind the counter; I had a perfect view of the prisoner; I did not hear all that was said.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Blackmore-street. On the 27th of June, about eight o'clock, I dressed Brooks' wound (my young man had dressed it before); the wound was near the left wrist, and not three quarters of an each long; it was a clean incision and must have been done with a sharp instrument; a small artery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140070"></xptr>was divided, which bled, and that caused me to dress it a second time; I told him to keep it quiet a few days or inflammation might come on; it was not a dangerous wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If an artery be divided would an effusion take place? - A. Immediately; in a clean incised wound it would bleed instantly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From what you saw of the wound do you think the effusion could be delayed a few minutes? - A. No; it would take place immediately; it would spout out directly, and must be perceived directly, and cannot account for his not discovering it for four or five minutes.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 28th of June - I told him I had a warrant; he said he hoped it was his death warrant; there was an altercation between him, his wife, and her sister, in the street; when I took him, I said I took him for assaulting and maiming Brooks; he said, "Oh, ah! Brooks, I know, and I hope I have done enough for them to take my life, or I will take it away myself;" I asked what he had done with the instrument he had done it with - he said,"If I have done it, it must have been with a pallet-knife, but I did not know I had done it;" he said the pallet-knife was in his basket, which he had left in St. John-street, Smithfield, but he could not tell the number, or the peoples' names, but it was on the left-hand going from Smithfield, and he left it there last night; I went to the top of St. John-street, and found a basket with a pallet knife, and two others; he is a writer, and would use them in his business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you think he was joking when you took him? A. No. I do not know where his wife lives.</p>

            . I know the prisoner - he came into my shop four or five months ago, and asked me where Brooks was; I said I did not know - he said I did - we had a few words - he got into a passion, and placing his hand on his breast, said, "I have been and purchased an instrument, and intend to put an end to the existence of Brooks, and also my wife and child - I will leave you alone for the present;" he did not shew me any instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him any time? A. Yes; by his living at a cheesemonger's where I dealt; I had some business to transact about a child; he did not say people had been saying this, but said he should do it; I was not alarmed about it at all.</p>

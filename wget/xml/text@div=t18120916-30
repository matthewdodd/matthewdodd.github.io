On the 17th of August, about half past twelve at night, I was returning home to Spitalfield, Holland came and gently laid hold of my arm; I said he was too civil; he said let us be jovial together. I had a blue coat on and my uniform. I clapped my hand to my pocket and missed my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion before - A. No, I asked him if he had my book, he said no; the watchman was coming up at the time, I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the other man with Holland - A. I do not know; I was so much in liquor that the next morning I did not know Holland.</p>

Yes, I was with him when he lost his pocket-book; my husband said he had lost his pocketbook; the watchman came up at the time, and he charged the watch with the man he had hold of I did not see the other man's face I observed there were two men; the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before he lost the pocket-book had you seen it in the morning - A. I put it in his blue coat myself.</p>

            I had information that Stitchener was in company with Holland the night before. I asked him for the pocket-book; he said he knew nothing of it. I took him to a public house; he then told me that he had found a pocket-book the night before, and if I would go along with him he would give it me; I went with him to the house where I found him at work; he took me up a ladder into a lumber room, and from behind some boards he pulled up the pocketbook; he said he found it under the window of a baker's shop, in Hope-street, Spitalfields; he said he had not opened it. I shewed it to the prosecutor, he said it was his pocket-book.</p>

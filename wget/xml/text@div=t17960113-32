               <p>On the 17th of December I was sent for to take the prisoner in custody; upon searching him I found some duplicates upon him, among which was the duplicate of this coat; it has been in my possession ever since. (The duplicate read.) 18th of November, 1795, 4s. a coat, Holborn,

               <p>Q. (To Kelly.) Where do you live? - A. I live at No. 2, Middle-row, Holborn; I am a man's mercer and salesman: I lost this coat on the 18th of November; I saw it about a quarter of an hour before the prisoner went out of my shop, he was my journeyman; it had laid upon the counter; I am certain it is my coat, I know it by the size and mark; it was the only great coat, of that size, I had in my shop; it has my mark written in the inside of the sleeve; I had written it a few days before, I valued it at 4s.</p>
               <p>Prisoners defence. That cloth I bought myself, to make a small coat for a lad; it did not sit the lad I made it for, and I pledged it to get some more cloth to make the lad another coat. I never did such a crime in my life, as take a coat from any one; I have no friend at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had this coat from a wholesale house in Thames-street, upon the 23d of October last. A house in that I am in the habit of doing business with, in Bedford-court, Bedford-street, Covent-Garden, he went there, and had goods in my name; and being taken up, the duplicate was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell us that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What did this coat cost you? - A. It cost me 8s. 5d.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What is your private mark for 8s.? - A. My private mark of the price is not upon it; but it is the mark of the size.</p>

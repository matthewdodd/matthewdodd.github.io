                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, of No. 25, Jewin-street. I was in Wells-street on this morning, and saw two men, one of whom had a bundle—it was the prisoner—I have not the slightest doubt of him—I knew him by sight—the man who has been convicted was carrying the bundle—they went towards Falcon-square, towards Redcross-square, and when they got to the corner I saw Haylock meet them—the one who is convicted threw the bundle down and mn—the prisoner followed him a little way, and then ran into Maidenhead-court—I did not see him again till he was at the station on 11th Feb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> And he was then shown to you in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but he was standing in front of the inspector, among several men—I do not know whether they were prisoners—I pointed him out from others who were standing in a row with him—I was told that he was in custody, and was fetched there to see him—I had not seen him from 7th Dec.—I dare say I have spoken to him, for I have known him many years—I knew him when he was a boy; his father was a milkman—I knew his name, and told it to Haylock—I could not tell him where he lived—I had seen him very often, and passed him several times in the street—I had never seen the other man before.</p>

            . On the 26th of March, I bought a gelding of the prisoner at Smithfield-market, here is the copy of the toll book (producing it). I gave him, 3 l. 5 s. 6 d. for it; I am positive the prisoner is the person; I should know him from a hundred; I gave him a guinea carnest till I saw whether he would draw: he came again and was with me very near three hours; so that I took particular notice of the man; the horse was challenged by Mr. Empson; a fortnight and a day after I bought it some school boys came to me and asked if my name was Freelove, and if I had bought a black gelding, and described all the marks of it; I went the same afternoon down to Mr. Empson's, and he came up with me and owned the horse; and I delivered it to him.</p>

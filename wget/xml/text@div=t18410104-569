                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant</hi> V 31) On Saturday night, the 19th of November, I was in the Merton-road, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock—I saw the prisoner carrying this coat, which I produce, under his arm—I walked with him till we came to the Six Bells public-house at Mitcham—the light was burning inside—I then said to him, "What have</p>

               <p>you here?"—he said, "Something to keep the cold out"—I removed it from his arm, and felt this bladder, which contained four pints and a half of gin—I took it to Mr. Orrae's, who said, "You had better take care of him"—the next day I went to his residence, and found eight bot<lb></lb>tles of spirits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother George—we are distillers and rectifiers, and live in Blackfriars-road. The prisoner was our carman—he drove our cart with spirits—on that Saturday he had a pipe of gin containing about one hundred and thirty or one hundred and thirty two gallons to deliver at Mr. Parsons', at the White Hart public-house, Merton—I have looked at the gin found on him—I am certain it is ours—that in the bladder is certainly part of what we sent to Mr. Parsons—the bottles may have been taken at various times, I cannot say; but the spirits in them resemble the articles manufactured by us—he got to Mer<lb></lb>ton about two o'clock in the afternoon, but he ought to have been there by twelve—he did not come back to us at all—he was taken that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart inn at Merton. I deals with Mr. Orme—the prisoner arrived at my house with the gin very shortly after two o'clock—I suppose he was about an hour and a quarter unloading—I did not gauge the cask—I discovered a deficiency as I considered, but I could not swear to it—my son saw it racked in, but he is not here—as far as I could judge, there was about a gallon defi<lb></lb>cient—my son came to me and said, "Father, there is some short."</p>

The prisoner was given to me at a quarter before twelve o'clock that night, to convey to Wands<lb></lb>worth station—he said on the way that his master must expect to be robbed, for he had reduced his wages half-a crown a week—I told him to be careful what he said—he said it was a matter of indifference to him, as it was all over with him.</p>

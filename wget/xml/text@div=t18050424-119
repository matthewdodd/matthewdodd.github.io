             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Bourdillon: On the 20th of March my master's watch was in the kitchen, it was for the use of the cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner there? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240098"></xptr>A. Yes, he was in there to have some refreshment by my master's orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring the company to your master's house? - A. Yes; I observed the watch in the kitchen just before six o'clock, when I carried dinner in; I looked at it, it wanted about five minutes to six, it was hanging up in the kitchen just by the door; I saw the prisoner in the kitchen about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner leave the kitchen? - A. About eight o'clock; I missed the watch about twenty minutes after he was gone, I saw him searched in the kitchen when he returned to take the company home, and the watch was found upon him. (The watch produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I thought it was the servant's watch, and with that I took it, I thought he left it in a very careless place; I put it in my pocket, and went to the stable to get my horses ready, thinking to return it to the servant again; I had no thoughts of keeping the watch, nor to part with it; if I had had any idea of not returning the watch, I should have made away with it, or concealed it somewhere, or dropped it, or thrown it in the street.</p>

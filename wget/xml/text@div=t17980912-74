             sworn. - I am a brasier, No. 19, Little Carter-lane; all that I know about it is, that I picked up some property which Mr. Tinkler owned. On the 11th of July I was alarmed by some of the watch; I got up to see what was the matter, that was a little after three; I went out with my little boy, about thirteen years of age, to see what was the matter; when I came into St. Paul's Church-yard, I looked about to see whether the house was broke open; I walked round St. Paul's Church-yard till I came to the north side of it, near the pump; I there saw the place that had been broke open; I then looked about and saw a bag in St. Paul's Church-yard, upon the wall inside the rails; I put my hand into it, and found there were some stockings in it; I then carried it to the watch-house; Mr. Tinkler was apprised of it, and I saw the articles counted out and put down upon a piece of paper; I went away, and then my lad saw another bag inside the rails in the grass, and I went and picked that up, and took it to Mr. Tinkler's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you bound over before the Magistrate? - A. I was sworn at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not refuse to come here without being paid your expences? - A. I asked Mr. Tinkler about it.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you you would be paid by a share of the reward? - A. No, he did not, but one of the men did.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; I was walking along, and saw three men at the trunk-maker's door, the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard, just before two o'clock; by that time there were two of them parted, and went towards Newgate-street, and the other man went towards Ludgate-hill. In about half an hour after I was sitting in my box, and I saw the three men come past my box again; I took them to be the same three men; they had all brown coats on; my box is against St. Paul's school; they came from towards Cheapside, and were going towards Watling-street; by that I watched them, and they made a stop about three doors on this side Watling-street, at the bottom of my beat, and there they stood with their faces all three of them towards the window shutters in my beat; upon that I got out of my box and went up to them, and they turned up the Old Change; I followed them up the Old Change, and I turned up towards Cheapside; I went upon my beat again, and then I saw the same three men at the other end of my beat, with their faces against the window shutters again; I went up to them again, and they crossed the way to Newgate-street to a post there; I then went and told Apothecary that I saw the three men, and he went and told Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they about with their faces to the window shutters, were they trying the window shutters? - A. No, I did not see them trying to do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think that odd? - A. I thought they were going to bore or cut the shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them first before two 
o'clock? A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. When was it you saw them last? - A. About half past two, it was hardly day-light I believe then; Humphreys then pulled off his coat and followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same men that were afterwards apprehended? - A. I believe they were two out of the three; there was only one brought to our watch-house, and I am sure he was one that I saw at the bottom of the beat the last time altogether; I saw them four times, I saw them twice at the bottom of my beat; after I saw them go towards Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The bottom of your beat is Watling-street? - A. Yes, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120090"></xptr>top of my beat is at the trunk maker's door by St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>Q. The east side of St. Paul's is your beat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw three men looking at some window shutters; you don't mean Mr. Tinkler's shutters? - A. No, my beat is not of his side.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they were the same men, because they had all brown coats on? - A. They seemed so.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see their faces? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had had the misfortune to be going that way, with a brown coat on, you would have supposed I was one? - A. No, they were all three together.</p>

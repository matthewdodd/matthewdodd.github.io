            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Cubitts, at their nail-room. The prisoner came there on the 16th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, and asked me for some nails - I gave him about the quantity here produced, of ten-penny and twenty-penny nails - he had no orders to have them - they are allowed to the carpenters for their work.</p>

            . I am a Thames police surveyor. On the 16th of March I saw the prisoner on Saffron-hill, with this basket, and 111/2lbs. of nails in it; I stopped him and asked what he had got there - he told me nails, which were given him by Messrs. Cubits' foreman, of the name of May, and he was going to take them to Hanover-square, to one of the carpenters; I told him he was going out of his way, and he said he meant to call on a friend first: I said I would go back with him to his masters', but when I got within fifty or sixty yards of the house, he said, that what he had stated before was not fact, and that he had taken them; and he told Mr. Cubitt, in my hearing, that Briggs had given them to him; the boy was called, and admitted he had given them to him to be used in the yard.</p>
               <p>The prisoner pleaded distress.</p>

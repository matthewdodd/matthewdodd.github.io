                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edmund Hearn, a grocer, in Clerkenwell. The prisoner was in his employ from 19th May to the 27th, as shopman—I watched him on 27th May, and saw him put his hand into the till, and take out something, I did not' see what—he came round the counter, and put his hand down—I said I had seen him take something out of the till, and I asked him to give it me—he held out his left-hand, and there was nothing in it—I said, "It was with your right-band I saw you take it; "he then opened his right-hand, and there was five shillings—it was my husband's—he said he took it to pay a small debt, and he would have put it back again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went to a tub of sugar, and took the five shillings and a penknife out of my waistcoat-pocket to put it into my trowsers-pocket—I came to the end of the counter, and my mistress said to me, "What have you in your hand?" I showed her the five shillings; she said, "This is my husband's;" I said, "No, it is my own; I brought it out of my bedroom this morning;" the policeman knows that I went back, and took my penknife.</p>

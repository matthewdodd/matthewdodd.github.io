            . I am a chair-maker. I owed Hamlin 1l. 18s. 6d. - on the 2nd of March I was present, when my father paid the prisoner one sovereign - I entered it in this book, and took his receipt for it, which I have mislaid - I am sure he was paid 1l. on account - he wrote the whole receipt himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He paid me 20s. in silver. Witness. It was a sovereign, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JOHN HAMLIN re-examined. I do not recollect his having received money before for me - he ought to have accounted for it - on the Sunday morning he gave me 15s., and said that was all he had received from Dunkley - he has shown a great deal of contrition; and I should not object to try him again - he has suffered a great deal - he may make a bright man yet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will consider it is a very hard case - I have been nine months in suspense and great anxiety of mind - I have been sent on board the hulks, and to a ship, to be taken to my destination; then back to the hulks, and remained there five weeks, and then sent here, and brought up for the last six Sessions and put back.</p>

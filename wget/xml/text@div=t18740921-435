                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective P</hi>). On the night of 3rd August, I was with Nash in the Station Road, Newington, about 9.30, and saw the prisoner standing outside the Elephant and Castle Railway Bar Tavern—he said "Good evening"—I said "Good evening."—he-said "I was just looking after a policeman, we want to get a prostitute from this room"—I said "All right"—he went into a little room, I followed him, and saw a female sitting quietly at one of the tables with a small glass in front of her—he said "This is her," or "Now, will you come out"—an old gentleman (the deceased) was sitting behind her—it is a wide seat serving for two tables—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210062"></xptr>
               <p>two young men were sitting at the other side of the table and one other female—the prisoner caught hold of the first woman's hand when he spoke, and she said that she would go out as soon as she had drank her wine—he then caught hold of her arm—she had the glass in her hand—he pulled her out of the seat, caught hold of her hand and smashed the glass up in it—he then swung her round in his arms, carried her to the door and dropped her on her legs on the pavement—they are folding doors and she caught hold of them, but I loosed her hand—I then stepped outside and said to her "Now you had better go away, if you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> locked up it will be serious"—I had not said the words half-a-minute when I heard a rustling in the little passage which leads into the room—the folding doors are the outside doors into the street, they have embossed glass half way down, and one of them was half way open—I looked through them and saw the prisoner with his arms round the old gentleman who I had seen sitting on the seat, and saw him swing him round to the folding doors, and shove him very violently, and he came out backwards with his head about two feet from where I was standing—his head fell about two feet from my feet, right on the pavement and it went off in a crack like a cocoa-nut, you could hear it at some distance—I stood and looked at him for a moment; I went to his left side, but could not see that he fetched any breath—I then felt for his pulse, but found he had only a wooden stump for his left arm—I raised his head up on my knees but could not find that he breathed—my brother officer and I then <hi rend="italic">slewed</hi> him round with his back to the house, and sent for a doctor—we got a glass of water and a chair from the house, and while bathing his head I saw blood running from his left ear—Dr. Hogg came and examined him and sent him to the hospital—he was then insensible all the time—I stayed at the hospital till 11.40 or 11.45 and saw the contents of his stomach pumped off—the women were both sitting quietly in the public-house when I went in—I did not notice that either of them was in an indecent position or had her dress disordered—when I got back from the hospital, the prisoner was just closing his house—he said "Stop a minute, I want to speak to you"—I said "I have taken that gentleman to the hospital, he is senseless and has not spoken since"—he said "It is a bad job."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said that he was very sorry for it—this is a ground plan of the premises—Mrs. Smith sat by the deceased's side, and Argent is the woman who was sitting at the other table side by side with him, and who was turned out—(<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out the potions on the plan</hi>)—the house is in front of the railway station, and the doors in question are just opposite the booking-office—this photograph shows both the doors pulled back, the counter is then shown to anybody standing on the pavement—these doors are, I dare say, about 2 feet 6 inches each, and the doorway would then be 5 feet wide—I should say that the distance from the cill of the door on the foot pavement to the counter is 3 feet 11 inches, within an inch 'or so—the door which swings back against the passage was open, and the front door being closed you could pass with facility to the sitting-room—the doors give inwards, not outwards—the left hand door was open, and you might then hardly pass into the sitting-room, there would not be much room—this other photograph represent the doors when they are closed—the sill at the threshold of the door is three-quarters of an inch above the flooring of the bar, and I would not say that it is not an inch—to get out of the house persons have to raise their steps to get over this little sill—the pavement</p>

               <p>rises about three inches outside and slopes down a little towards the road—the deceased fell directly backwards on the back of his head—the right hand door was closed and the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> hand door was on the strap, about 18 inches open—I was not on the opposite side of the way—I never went off the footway after I came out of the house.—I did not hear what passed inside when I was outside—all this happened in a minute or two—I know that witnesses for the defence were called at the police Court—I adhere to the statement that I actually saw the prisoner with his arms round the deceased—the wine glass was, I should think, broken into a large quantity of pieces, but I did not notice it afterwards—it was certainly broken into more than two pieces—Nash did not enter the house on the first occasion—he was on the pavement—he was never out of my sight after returning from the hospital—he was in the waiting-room—he was ordered out of the police Court, I believe, while the witnesses were examined—I was examined before, him—I said that I had a glass of beer at that time—Nash was out of court then, and I believe he was afterwards asked if he had a glass of beer and he said "No"—I should say that there was a teaspoonful of liquor in the glass which was broken, there was very little—the prisoner did not ask the woman to leave more than once—he spoke to her about twice—the first words were "Now, perhaps, you will come out," and before he would allow me to speak to her he got hold of her hand and pulled her out—he might have repeated what he said, but it was in a very short time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smith, a carpenter, of 27, Edward's Place, Aldersgate Street—on the evening of 3rd August, I met the old man who is now dead, outside the public-house—I had seen him before at Chichester Market as a cattle dealer—he invited me to have something to drink and we went into this' public-house—nobody was there then but ourselves—two glasses of wine were ordered, and we remained there fifteen or twenty minutes—I then went out, leaving the deceased in the waiting-room—no impropriety took place between us and no complaint was made by the barmaid or the prisoner of any immorality, nobody spoke to me—I saw Argent outside the public-house, something passed between us—I went back into the waiting room and she followed me—two young men were there then, sitting at a table, and Argent went and sat at the same table Argent and I and the deceased had three glasses of wine between us—a young woman who was called for the prisoner at the police court, served us and Argent paid for the whole—she was the young woman who had served us at first—she made no complaint—about five minutes after the three glasses were brought, the prisoner came into the waiting-room and told Mrs. Argent to go out, as he did not want prostitutes in the house—she said "I will as soon as I have drank my wine"—the prisoner then took' hold of her and pulled her out of her seat and broke the glass in her hand—he did not say anything, he lifted her out very roughly to the door—she had made no disturbance and had only been in a minute or two—as the prisoner came back, to the parlour the deceased and I were going towards the door and the deceased said "I suppose you would serve me the same if you thought you could"—the deceased had a wooden left arm—I went on and went out at the outer door, and after I got out I heard a scuffle and saw the prisoner into he passage with his arms round the old gentleman, trying to force him out very violently—he had got his wooden arm in his pocket at that time—the prisoner pushed him out at the front door, and he came down on the back of his head on the pavement very heavily indeed—Nash and Berry, who</p>

               <p>were outside, picked him up and supported him and I bathed his face with cold water—the prisoner did not come out—he nearly lifted the deceased round in putting him out—there was no indecency or immorality on the part of the deceased or Argent or myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said to the Magistrate "I cannot say whether his heels caught on the sill or not;" "The prisoner pushed him with one hand first out of the door;" "He had one hand against his shoulder and he pushed with both"—I don't think. I told the Magistrate that the prisoner had his arms round the deceased—he was a very stout man—I am not separated from my husband, but he is in Millbank Prison for deserting his regiment—I was in the New Kent Road, about 100 yards from this public-house when the deceased came up, and he spoke to me first—I had seen him at Chichester about six years ago, but did not know his name, I only knew him as a cattle dealer—he said "I have seen your face before," and I said "Not in London, it must have been in Chichester," and he said "In the market"—I had started for a walk with Argent at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but was not with her long, because she left me about 8 o'clock; we walked together from Aldersgate to the Elephant and Castle—we were in the public streets all that time—I think we went into two public-houses—I did not perceive that the deceased had too much to drink—I sat at the furthest table from the waiting-room—I know the counter from which we were supplied with the sherry—I did not unfasten the bosom of my dress while I was sitting at that table, nor did I take the old gentleman's hand and put it into my bosom—I did not go out with the intention of finding Argent—before I left, the deceased gave me a shilling to pay for the wine—I did say before the Magistrate "When I went out to look for Argent I met her"—that was a mistake; I did not go out to look for her, but I met her in the same street, and told her I was at that public-house with a friend—she said that she would be in in a minute, and she came in about a minute after me, and the deceased said to her "This little girl I knew at Chichester," and she directly sat down with her back to us—I did not" see the prisoner's wife or the barmaid call him, and nothing was said to the deceased in my presence about behaving improperly—I was absent from him five minutes—it is true that the prisoner asked Argent two or three times to go out, before Beny came in—I don't think I told the Magistrate that he was about five minutes asking her to go out—I did say "I did not see him put her out," and to-day I say that he carried her out—I have no explanation to offer of that—I was standing up; I had passed the doorway of the waiting room, and the deceased followed me; my back was to him—I did not hear a voice say "Take care, Mr. Brisco's head will be pushed through the glass"—I did not pay attention to what was said—I did not hear any one say that they would smash his b——y nose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am twenty-two years old—I was quite a girl when I knew the defendant at Chichester—when I left the public-house it was for my own convenience—I intended to return, and I left my wine on the table—I had parted with Argent at 8 o'clock, and met her again at 8.45; that was quite accidental—I had made no appointment to go home with her afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Argent, a printer, of Edmund's Place, Aldersgate—on the-evening of 3rd August. I went alone to the bar of the Railway public-house by the Elephant and Castle—Mr. Massey was there and Mrs. Smith—I went to the bar, called for a glass of sherry, and sat down—I had not sat there three or four minutes before the prisoner came in and said "How dare you be here? you are a prostitute"—I said "How dare you say that to me? you had better mind what you are saying"—he said "Well, go out"—I said "I will, certainly, when I have drank my wine, but not before"—he went to the door, came back with Mr. Berry, and then said "Now, will you go?"—I said "Yes, when I have drank my wine"—there had not been the slightest impropriety; I had done nothing and had seen nothing done—I took up my glass to drink my wine, and he seized my arm and smashed the glass in my hand, and threw me out in the street—of course, I tried to prevent it, but I could not—I then turned to Mr. Berry, and said "Sir, you see the way in which he has served me, and I am neither drunk nor insulting"—I had hardly got the words out of my mouth, when I turned round and saw the prisoner with the deceased—I was between three and four yards from the door—they were struggling, but the deceased could not do much because he had only one arm; the prisoner had his arms round him, and the barman, I think it was, just opened the doors for him—perhaps nobody else saw the barman, but I did—he only opened one door, the left-hand door as you come out of the little waiting-room; the outer door—as they came out they faced each other—the prisoner seemed to have turned him round, he seemed to then push him with two hands, and he fell and lay there three-quarters of an hour—Mrs. Smith bathed his face, and Mr. Berry held his head—a little blood came from his ear—the prisoner did not come out—I said "You cowardly villain, look what you have done"—I can't say exactly what I said, but I called him a coward—he did not say anything, but went back into the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the Magistrate that I did not leave home till 4 o'clock—my husband lives with me—he was not out with me, he was at work—I have been drinking at the bar of this public-house six or seven times—I have friends in the neighbourhood—I have lived in the neighbourhood and often go there—I may have been in the house half a dozen times with Mrs. Smith during the last month and with other friends—I left Mrs. Smith at 8.30 and met her again at 8.45—I have not said "I met Mrs. Smith first at 8.30," they have it quite wrong; I said that I was at the Elephant and Castle at 8.30—I did not notice that it was wrong when it Was read over to me—I told the Magistrate I had gone down there simply for a walk—I told the Magistrate that I was married at St. George's Church—I did not say what St. George's—I left the gentleman to put that himself—I will not answer where I was married—I am not married at all—the prisoner did not tell me to go away or I should get into trouble—the deceased's hand was on the bar to prevent his being thrown out, and the barman moved it—I was looking through the embossed glass—I was not at fill excited when I was put out, but I called him a villain after he had thrown the old gentleman out—I saw the chair sent for, some minutes after the deceased had lain on the ground.</p>

I was House Surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on the night of 3rd August Charles Maffey was brought there insensible—his age appeared to be 53 or 54—he was a very heavy man, about 18 stone—the house physician saw him first, there was a history about his being in a public-house, and it was considered that he was drunk, but when they pumped his stomach and found there was not much alcohol they sent for me and I examined the back of his head and found a very serious bruise—I thought the insensibility was due to that, and so I took him in—he continued under my treatment till he died on 12th August—he had never recovered his sensibility, he used to ramble in his talk—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination on the afternoon of the 12th and found the brain very much bruised and partly lacesrated, and in the centre of the brain there was a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187409210067"></xptr>
               <p>large spot—the whole surface was bruised, and there was also <hi rend="italic">blood</hi> effused between the brain and its membranes—there was a slight fissure in the skull, but I cannot say whether that was caused by the fall or not—the injury to the brain was such as would be caused by an old and heavy man like that falling on the back of his head on the pavement—the injuries to the brain were, in my opinion, the cause of death—what was pumped from his stomach smelt very slightly, and therefore he could not have been drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some people get drunk much more easily than others—I actually saw what was pumped from his stomach that night, and some one said that it smelt of spirits, but I cannot say positively that it did—he was brought in at 10.30—it is disputed what appearances on the brain drink produces, as no one has seen a man's brain when he was drunk—the vessels were charged with blood and it has been stated that the brain is congested by drink—but my examination was nine days afterwards.</p>

I am a butcher of Brixton Hill—I have known the deceased about six years—I informed Mr. Crib of the Crown and Scepter public-house, that I had been with Maffey on the night of the accident—I attended and gave evidence at the prisoner's request—up to that time he was a perfect stranger to me—August 3rd was the bank holiday and I recollect the day on that account—I was near the Rockingham Arms about 8 o'clock that evening, which is not far from the Elephant and Castle Station, and saw Mr. Maffey in a state not capable of taking care of himself—I offered to accompany him in a cab to Streatham, but he would not allow me to do so—he abused me to some extent, but I tried all I could to persuade him <hi rend="italic">to go home</hi>—he asked me to drink and I refused—I left him about 8.15—he was a powerful man of a little more than eighteen stone.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband's name is Alfred—he is barman at the Railway Bar public-house and I attend in the bar—on the Bank holiday, August 3rd, the deceased came in in the evening, and went into the little waiting room—a, female was with him who I now know as Mrs. Smith—they sat down to a table and had two glasses of sherry—he walked steadily—while they sat there Mrs. Smith opened her dress in front and put the deceased's hand in—I am quite certain of that—they saw me-looking and then she put her dress up—I was then called to the other part of the bar, and while I was gone, the other barmaid served them with another supply of sherry, and Smith went out, leaving her sherry on the table untouched—nothing had been said to the deceased then, but I then said "You have not been conducting yourself properly, and if you don't conduct yourself properly I shall have to call Mr. Briscoe's attention to it as he will not allow it to go on in this room"—he said "Can't I enjoy myself with a friend over a glass of wine, it is very disagreeable"—Mrs. Smith then came back and Argent followed her—she had only been away seven or eight minutes—she</p>

               <p>sat down by the man's side and Argent sat on the same seat, with her back to him, or rather sideways—I noticed them speak together—when Argent came in a glass of wine' was called for, and then three more glasses of wine—I then saw the deceased's hand under the table rubbing the woman Smith about, and I could see that there was some indecency going on under the table—I shook my head and said "That is not allowed"—I went away and waited to call Mrs. Briscoe's attention to it, but she was up dress<lb></lb>ing—she came into the bar in about seven minutes when I was serving. Somebody—she then came to me and said "Do you see what is going on?'—I said "That is what I want to speak to you about"—I made a complaint to her, and she fetched her husband from the other side of the bar—he went to them and said "Here, you are not going on in that way; you know you are not allowed to go on in that way in this room"—he requested them all three to go out several times—he said "I wish you to leave this room"—I heard Argent say "I shan't"—she also said "You dare not," or "You can't"—Mr. Briscoe then went to the door and fetched in the detective Berry—he then took hold of the woman by her shoulders and led her towards the door—she resisted and was very abusive, so he lifted her up and put her outside the door—she had had ample time to go out before Berry came in, and afterwards too—Mr. Briscoe then turned round to go into the room again, and the man and woman had risen and were standing between the fireplace and the door—he tried to persuade them to go out quietly, but the deceased said "I suppose you will try to serve me the same"—he said "I wish to do nothing of the sort, I wish you to leave my house quietly"—the deceased said "If you press me I will smash your b——y nose," and backed a little towards the door which leads out of the waiting-room, which is generally kept open—he then turned round, and somehow he got into the lobby where Mr. Briscoe was—he was still abusing Mr. Briscoe, and repeated twice that he would smash his nose—the two folding doors were open—the man was nearest to the waiting-room, and Mr. Briscoe was nearest to the door which was open—he had his back against the glass door, which was open—both the glass doors into the street were open—there was sufficient room for a person to pass through because it swings a little—one was on the strap and the furthest from the room was bolted back—the left one as you go in is kept on the leather, and the other swings if the bolt is up, but both doors were open wide—when Mr. Briscoe was in the lobby I saw the man pushing him, and I called out two or three times "Mind, Mr. Briscoe's head will go through the glass"—he was the nearest to the door which was furthest from the waiting-room—the deceased got hold of him and was trying to struggle, and I said "Mind Mr. Briscoe's head, for heaven's sake, will go through the glass"—Mr. Briscoe then put his hand on the man's coat and I saw the mango backwards—when he was falling I saw his feet inside the sill of the door—Mr. Briscoe never had him round the body with both arms from first to last, nor did he strike or push him in any way: had he done so I must have seen it—he had not put his hand on the deceased till the deceased laid" hold of him in front with one hand—there was no unbolting of the door by my husband: that is not true—he was behind them in the waiting-room near the fireplace—he could not have touched the door without my seeing him—when Mr. Briscoe found that the man was insensible, he gave directions that everything that could be done should be done, and I went out and bo did my husband, and a chair was taken in and come water—he asked my husband to go and see what could be done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From first to last Mr. Briscoe had treated him in the most gentle and-friendly way—the deceased was not much the worse for liquor, but he did not speak to me—he was perfectly sober to all appearances—he drank three glasses of sherry altogether in the house, and Mrs. Smith had the same, and the other woman two glasses—they were served with eight glasses—I was at this corner looking into the street when the deceased was going out of the waiting-room-first—the last I saw of it before I saw the man falling was Mr. Briscoe with his back against the door, but he was not leaning against it to support himself—the deceased was facing him, and almost instantly after that I saw the deceased fall out of the house.</p>

About 6 o'clock in the evening of 23d January, I went to 23, Brook-street, Ratcliff, where the prisoner was lodging in a back-room on the first-floor—I saw him there with three chil<lb></lb>dren—there was an old chair in the room, and a bit of an old table, and in the corner of the room on the left-hand side, I saw two children; one was groaning and appeared very ill, one of those was the child that died—they were lying on a bit of an old mattrass, very scanty indeed, and an old oil-skin table-cover partly covering them—there was a very small fire; not more than you could put in your double hands—it was a very cold night; there had been snow, but it had thawed and was frosty again—I said to the prisoner, "Your name is Hyland?'—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You are the man that came from Heath-street?"—he said, "Yes"—I got a light and</p>

               <p>looked at the children—I saw a quantity of lice crawling all over the faces of the two that were lying down, and very little hair on their heads—I got a candle and looked at the deceased child, and saw two holes at the back of the head, full of lice—the child was turned three years old—I said to the prisoner, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, leaving your children in such a state"—"Oh!' he said, "the children are all right, we shall all die some day"—I then sent for some arrowroot, and had some made for them, which they ate ravenously, I could scarcely hold it in my hand for them taking it out of the basin—I then sent for the relieving officer and Dr. Ross, and they were removed to the workhouse; they were forced to have some brandy given to them before they could be removed—I have known the prisoner for some years working at the ballast getting, in the employment of the Trinity Corporation—he is a man of very drunken habits.</p>

I am cook and superintendent of the kitchen at St. Pancras Workhouse, and have a private room there to take my food and keep my clothes—I do not sleep there—the room is detached from the main buildings—there is an area underneath it, and it opens into a room where forty-eight male inmates sleep—I left it safe on 8th June, about 6 in the evening—I went again next morning and found it in disorder, and all the things gone, the window broken and a drawer forced open—I missed a coat, waistcoat, and trousers, which I had left there the night before, an entire suit of black, an overcoat, and some other things—the window was down, but the hasp was broken—it not be entered on account of the area under<lb></lb>neath—I found a small screwdriver on the mantel-piece, which was not there when I left—the prisoners have constantly been in the workhouse—they were discharged on the Monday morning, and the robbery was committed at night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of labourers at St. Pancras Workhouse, and live in the workhouse—on the night of 8th June, I went up stairs past the door of Mr. Cole's room, and noticed that the door and window were fast—the prisoners were in the workhouse before the 8th—</p>

               <p>they were taking down the tables in some of the wards a fortnight or three weeks previously, and it became necessary to take out some of the screws—Solden took this screwdriver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his pocket, and said, "I will lay two to one I have got the little tool that will do it;" but it would not do it, as the screw was rusty—a day or two afterwards, I saw him take it out of his pocket a second time and lay it down—I took it up and looked at it, and have no doubt this is the same—the master's name is Alexander Cameron Morrison—the building is one wing of the workhouse—it is built on the outside wall.</p>

I am watchman at St. Pancras Workhouse—on the morning of 9th June, soon after 4 o'clock, I found a ladder against the outer wall—I afterwards found Mr. Cole's room had been broken into—the door and the drawers were wide open, and a square of glass was broken—no one could get to the ladder without assistance over.</p>

On 9th June, about half-past 2 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners and two others at Eve-terrace, about 100 yards from the workhouse—about half-past 7 o'clock, I received information and went to the workhouse—I found a square of glass broken in Mr. Cole's room—I saw a screwdriver there which fitted some marks on a drawer which was broken open—I found footmarks in the yellow clay near the outer wall; a mark of a boot and other marks, as of a person having stockings over their boots—in one mark there were twenty-two nails plainer than the rest, as if they had been recently put into the boot—I covered the footmarks over, and after apprehending the prisoners, I took Smith's left boot off, took it to where I had seen the impression, and compared it—this is the boot, and here are twenty-two nails fresh put into it, which correspond with the marks—I told the prisoners the charge, and they denied it.</p>

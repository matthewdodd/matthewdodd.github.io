                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 79, New-North Road—on Monday, 19th April, about 2 p.m., I was at Hoxton police station when the body of a female child was brought there—it is impossible to say its age, it was a very fine child, and I 'put it down as under 2 months old—I examined it superficially—there were no marks of violence, but the legs and arms were drawn up, the tongue was protruding, and there was mucous in the mouth; those are signs of suffocation by drowning—it appeared well nourished and fully developed; no decomposition had taken place then—it is impossible to tell how long it had been in the water, it would depend upon temperature; but in consequence of its having blue skin on. different parts of the. body I should say at least forty eight hours the umbilical cord was per<lb></lb>fectly healed—by the Coroner's order I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, examination—I first opened the skull, the brain was soft and congested I opened the chest, the lungs were gorged with blood, and both ventricles of the heart were full of fluid blood; the spleen was gorged, and the intestines, stomach and kidneys were all congested; that confirmed my diagnosis that death came by drowning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> the Court, The organs were perfectly healthy, there were no signs of disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said that it had been in the water at least forty-eight hours—being in the water retards decomposition—t was under two. months old, but we can only judge by size after the umbilical-cord is healed—did not state before the Coroner that the child was a two months child; the Coroner pointed out to the Jury that I said it was under two months—I did" not state as a portion of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination which was afterwards returned to the Coroner, that in my opinion the Child had lived about two months—if that has been taken down it has been taken incorrectly—I-gave-my evidence before the Coroner orally, but I had got a statement with me—when I make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem I</hi> always note down the particulars at the time, but I was not speaking from that note—I deny that I said that the child had lived two months, I said that it was less than two months; I only judged by the weight it weighed 9 1/2 lbs—I said "The ventricles were charged with fluid blood"—I did not say "The spleen empty and not inflated;" that is a mistake, the spleen could not be empty—said "The intestines, stomach, and kidneys were cangested" the Coroner was not a medical man; this was the Deputy Coroner the post-mortem was made on Thursday the 22nd, that was the day of the inquisition—the case was twice before the Coroner, it was adjourned to the following Tuesday, from the 22nd to the 29th I received the order late on Wednesday night, and I did it the first thing the next morning, Thursday, which was the day of the first examination—was examined on the 22nd, and it was on the morning of the 22nd that the post-mortem was made when I saw it at the station I came to the conclusion that the death arose from drowning—the legs were drawn up, the hands clenched, and there was mucous in the month—in ordinary convulsions the tongue would not be protruded, but the other conditions. I should expect to find in convulsions to a certain extent—the congested state of the brain, the chest, and the. lungs, might be explicable by the fact that the child had died of convulsions—mucous in the mouth which gathered there in. a violent attempt at respiration would not be likely to remain unless the effort to breathe continued for some considerable time—I found nothing at all in the stomach, no water—that is a thing I should expect to find, but not always—it is an indication</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030086"></xptr>
               <p>of death by suffocation from drowning, but not a leading one; it is very often found, but not always—the stomach was completely empty—the state of the brain and stomach could all be accounted for by the fact that the child died from convulsions—both ventricles of the heart were charged with fluid blood; that would be adverse to convulsions; it would be impossible for the child to die of convulsions and have fluid blood in the ventricles—with that one exception you may take it that the general appearances all indicated that convulsions might be the cause of death—it was only at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> that I discovered the fluid blood—you would not find the protrusion of the tongue in convulsions; I should say that would be quite incompatible and impossible—the tongue would not hang from the mouth after death if it had not done so before death—the" mouth was shut on the tongue.</p>

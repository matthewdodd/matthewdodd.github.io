               <p>I saw these breeches, and the hatband taken from the prisoner in Kingsland-road, I lived in the same house; the things were taken between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Court. You told me, that the prisoner was in the house at the time the things were taken, what did you mean by that? - I meant because the landlord missed them out of the house.</p>
               <p>When was that? - Between eleven and twelve of that day, the landlord told a young fellow to go up stairs to bring down his things; that was after this young man came home to the house from the country.</p>
               <p>Who told you that any thing was lost out of the box? - I did not know it till after.</p>
               <p>Did the young man own them? - The young man said, he left them in a chair, in a bundle tried up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court. You were in the house when Friend came home from the country? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was there too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoner been in the house? - I cannot tell, he was in and out.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in the house at any time before Friend came home? - I cannot tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, of 32, St. John's Terrace, Hackney Road—on the morning of 9th May, at 1 o'clock, I was going home, and about eight yards from my house I was knocked down, just as I turned the corner, by a blow from behind, on the back of my head—I did not see</p>

               <p>anyone before I was knocked down, or hear any footsteps—I was sober—I was returning from the theatre—when I was down they began to rifle my pockets—there were two of them—I could not distinguish their features, but I know the prisoner was one of them, by the light coat he had on—my clothes were torn right off me, and a half-crown and a shilling taken from my pocket by the other man while the prisoner held me down—there was a lamp directly opposite where I was knocked down—I did not call out at all; I could not—as soon as they let me go I got up—they went round the corner—I then cried, "Stop thief!" and Police!" and I had not got more than six yards before I saw the prisoner in the hands of the police—I only lost sight of him for two moments—the person who first stopped him is not here, but he walked with me to the station—I don't know what became of the second man—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man who held me down.</p>

Q.</hi> What became of the man who you say stopped the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went away—he gave his address, and said he would appear, but he did not—I had only had one glass of beer with a friend as I came out of the theatre—I did not see who knocked me down—it was while I was on the ground that I identified the man in the light coat—that is the only way in which I identify the prisoner—the lump was not a yard off—I lost sight of the one that got away, but not of this one—I was a little stunned by the blow, but not to have any effect—I was alone—my friend had left me some time before.</p>

I was on duty in Hackney Road, near St. John's Terrace, on this morning, and heard the cry of "Police!" about seventy yards off—I ran in the direction and saw the prisoner stopped by a gentleman about thirty yards from where the prosecutor was knocked down—the gentleman said, "This is one of the two who were running"—I took the prisoner to the prosecutor, who was then about ten or twelve yards away, and he charged him with assault and robbery, in company with another man—the prisoner said he knew nothing at all about it.</p>

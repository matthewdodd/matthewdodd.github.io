                  </hi>. I am lock man at the Shadwell entrance of the London Docks. On Thursday, the 6th of September, about 10 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner underneath the bows of the <hi rend="italic">Signet</hi>, in a boat, moving some nails about with his feet, scattering them about the bottom of the boat among some water—he closed the bottom boards over the nails in the water to cover them—I asked him who the boat belonged to—he looked up, and pointed to the <hi rend="italic">Signet</hi>, and said it belonged to a man onboard there—I went about my duty, and was absent about three minutes—I then saw him sculling the boat away—I mentioned this to a Dock muster, who sent</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-surveyor. On Thursday evening the prisoner was brought to me by a waterman—I asked him how he got the nails found in the boat—he said I could not hurt him, that no<lb></lb>body saw him take them—I took him to the station-house, and he there said, "You are two pretty b—to take a boy like me to the station-house."</p>

About 11 o'clock I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Signet</hi>, in consequence of information—I found nobody on board—Thomas Ward came on board while I was there—the cabin was opened, and on the larboard side I found a nail bag with half a hundred weight of nails, and by the side of it one apparently empty—I found only two nails in it, which I produce—I have compared them with the nails found in the prisoner's boat, and have every reason to believe they are exactly of the same description.</p>

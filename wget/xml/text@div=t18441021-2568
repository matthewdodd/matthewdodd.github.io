                  </hi>. I am a tanner, and live in Turner's-place, Bermondsey. On Friday night, Sept. 20th, between seven and eight o'clock, I was standing at the passage near my house, and saw a wagon with two horses standing in the street near me—the little boy, Michael Manning, and a good many children, were playing about the wagon—there were about ten or twelve of them—some</p>

               <p>were going up the hind part of the wagon, and <hi rend="italic">fiddling</hi> and play<lb></lb>ing with the spokes—the prisoner, who was the driver of the wagon, was at that time inside a public-house, close by—he came out, spoke to his horses, and made a little motion with his whip, and started off his horses—they went on—a great number cf children were at that time playing about the wagon, and some of them were on the hind parts of the wagon, and handling the spokes and the wheels, and all round it, playing with one another—some were from five to sixteen years of age—the deceased was at that time standing between the fore and hind wheels, and I saw the hind wheel go right over his head—the witness Brennan called out, "Michael Manning is killed; Michael Manning is killed"—I went over, and found the child in Brennan's hands—I left it to him, and went after the prisoner—he went off a little dis<lb></lb>tance with the horses, and then stopped—I came up to him, and said, "Do you not know that you have killed a child?"—he said, "No—I did not do it"—I said, "Yes, you did"—he said, "Well, if I did, I could not help it"—I said, "Could you not have cleared the children off before you started the wagon, at the time you came out of the public-house?"—he said, "That was not my business "—I and another man followed him a good way, till we met a policeman, and gave him in charge—he could easily have cleared away the children before he started, if he had had the sense of doing it.</p>

I was looking through the window on the evening in question, and saw the wagon standing still—I afterwards saw it move on, and as soon as it moved on I saw Michael Manning lay on the ground, motionless—I heard somebody exclaim, "He is dead"—I ran down stairs, ran after the prisoner, and said he had run over a child—he said, "Well, I could not help itit"—I saw the child afterwards—he was quite dead.</p>

               <p>a cheese-factor, in George-yard, Snow-hill. The prisoner was in the same employ—I was his mate—on the night in question I had been with him in my master's wagon, from the Birmingham Railway warehouses at Camden-town, with goods to Mr. Smith, a tanner, in Orange-road, Bennondsey—on our return, after unloading the wagon, about eight o'clock, we came to the corner of a street where the Horns public-house is—we stopped there—the prisoner went into the public-house, and I remained with the horses—he came speedily out, with a pint of beer in his hand—there were some boys playing about the wagon, some getting under it, and some into it—the prisoner more than once or twice drove away the children—I saw him do it two or three times—after having done so he went to the leading horse—(I was standing by the shaft)—he could not see from there whether there was any child between the two wheels—it was dusk at the time—he moved on the leading horse with his whip, and im<lb></lb>mediately after there was a cry that a child was killed, and in a very few minutes the prisoner was taken into custody—I went home to my master's, to tell him what had happened.</p>

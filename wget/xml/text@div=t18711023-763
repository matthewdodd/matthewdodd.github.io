I am a labourer, of 3, Church Street, St. Giles'—on 8th October, about 4 o'clock, a.m., I was in bed, and was awoke by hearing the clock stop—I did not hear it going before it stopped—I got up, and missed it—I heard the door open, ran down stairs, and heard the clock drop on the stairs—the prisoner ran out, and I followed him up George Street, into Oxford Street, where he was caught by a policeman—I had not lost sight of him—I gave him in charge for committing a robbery in my place—he said that he did not know it was my room, or he would not have done it—I knew him before—he lives in the same street—I found my waistcoat on him when he was stopped.</p>

            . I am a sergeant major. The prisoner did not sleep in the Tower; his company had occupied the room were the clothes were. I was present when he was apprehended near the draw-bridge, on the 7th of January. Burgess pointed him out - he was dressed in a white flannel jacket. The battallion had been drawn up before that, and Burgess pointed him out. I afterwards placed him among others, and he recognized him again; he denied all knowledge of Burgess. I went that day to assist in searching his lodgings at a tobacconist's shop, and found a trap-door in the attick, over his room, and there the officers found a soldier's forage cap, and a bag containing skeleton keys. The prisoner said they were his, and he considered them as lumber, and put them there out of the way. Twenty-three of the coats were traced to Burgess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What had the room been used for before the coats were there - A. A barrack room, until the coats were put there, which I believe was on the 10th of December; they were moved into another room on the 27th. I cannot say which room they were stolen from. Burgess inspected about four hundred men on parade before he saw the prisoner; he was not among them. After that three or four people were with Burgess; the prisoner was brought - I said he had not seen that man, and then he said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." The prisoner's room was on the first floor - the house is but two stories high. When the keys were opened, he acknowledged that they were his. Two of them opened two doors of the rooms the coats were deposited in.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 6th of January, I went with a search warrant to Allen's in the Minories, with Sutton, and found some coats there. I went to the prisoners lodging next day; it is a second floor back room. He was not there, but his wife was - I went up into the attick, which is used by all the lodgers, and in the loft found the cap in a bundle, with a quantity of other things used by soldiers, and after the prisoner was pointed out, I asked him how he came to leave his keys and files in the garret; he said he generally used them there, and that he put them in the loft - I then produced them, he claimed the cap, skeleton keys, and other things. I shewed him the keys and asked for what purpose he bought them; he said he did not buy them, but found them in a cupboard where he formerly lodged - I asked if he had altered either of them; he said No, he had done nothing to them since he had had them. One key opens a large room, and another opens two doors, and another small one has fresh marks where it has been filed. He denied all knowledge of Burgess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Every thing but the keys are what he used to his gnn - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a dealer in old clothes, and live in Glass House-yard, Rosemary-lane. I have bought about forty soldiers great coats of the prisoner at different times - the first was last Monday four weeks; 3 s. was the average price I gave him. I asked if he was allowed to sell them; he said he was, that they were three years old, and he had bought them of his comrades, and was in the habit of doing so to make a trifle for his family. I sold some of them to Allen - I saw them again last Monday week at Allen's, and afterwards at the Mansion House. I was taken into custody, and afterwards made a witness.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you in custody -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150009"></xptr>A. From Monday till Wednesday. The officer said Allen bought them of me, and asked if I sold them to him, I said I did. I have dealt with the prisoner about five times; he was dressed in a regimental undress - I never asked what regiment he belonged to. I told the sergeant who I had them from. I was taken down from the Compter next day to identify the man. I deal in rag-fair, and have no shopman. When I bought the first, he said he should have more another day; I gave him 3 s.; 2 s. 9 d., and 2 s. 6 d., for them. I sold some to Allen - 3 s. 6 d. was the average price I got for them. I told them directly that I would find out the man.</p>

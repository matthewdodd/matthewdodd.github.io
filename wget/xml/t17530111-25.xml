               <p>I was coming home about 11 o'clock that night, and coming into the court, there was the deceased and his wife swearing and cursing : they said, here your rogue of a son has beat me, and robbed me of ten shillings and a handkerchief. I said, I had educated him better than to do so. My son was opening the door; and said, how can you say I robb'd you of ten shillings, when you borrowed one shilling to give earnest for some earthen ware to day. He and his wife both struck my son, and she struck me also in the face; then my son and the deceased had a struggle together for about a minute, and then it was all over. After that he came up again in a riotous manner, and I stood before him, and shov'd my boy in doors; then we both went to bed, and left them raving. After that I got out of bed to the window, and said, if they did not cease their noise, and go away, I'd charge the watch with them.</p>

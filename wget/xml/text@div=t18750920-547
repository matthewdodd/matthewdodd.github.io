                  </hi>. I live at 6, George's Place, George Street, Lam beth, and am a carpenter—on the evening of 9th August, about 5 o'clock, I was in Regent Street, Lambeth, talking with a man named Casey—the pri<lb></lb>soner came up and said "Good evening"—I said "I don't want to have any thing to say to you"—he said "I have something to say to you, though"—I moved away a pace and he struck me behind the left ear with the butt end of a revolver—the blow felled me to the ground, and when on the ground I saw the revolver and he held the muzzle of it against my chin he struck me several blows over the head after that with the revolver—when I was on the ground I heard the hammer of the revolver go down; I heard the click from the pulling of the trigger—I am quite sure I saw the pistol in the prisoner's hand—his finger was on the trigger and I am quite sure I heard the click—I called to Casey to help me—a constable was fetched and I gave the prisoner into custody for assaulting me with fire arms—he said "I meant to shoot him and I will do it again."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Magistrate—I don't know that I mentioned then that the prisoner said he meant to shoot me; another witness did—I heard him say so myself—I don't think I said it before <hi rend="italic">the</hi>

               <p>Magistrate—I don't think I was asked the question—I have been a witness in many cases, and I have had some experience in Courts of Justice—I was convicted 18 years ago as a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> boy, about 13 years of age—I had three months and four years in a Reformatory—I did net do all the time—I was let off in consequence of good conduct—I came out in 1861 I believe—I have been in the Police Force some portion of the time since then—I did not tell them anything about my conviction; I was not asked that question—I was asked as to character, and I produced characters—it is necessary to produce characters for the last five years, which I did—I wrote down that I was a single man—I married the prisoner's daughter, and she was away from me—she had left me, and I considered I was a single man—I said I was a single man, and I knew I was married—I subsequently asked for leave of absence in order to go and get married—that was in July or August 1873—I did not get married—I went back again, and took a woman as my wife to whom I had not been married—that was discovered, and I was dismissed the next day from the Police Force—that was in December, 1873—I am a carpenter and joiner now, nothing else besides—I was secretary to the Magna Charta Association, but I did not get any pay for that—I am not a member now—I ceased to be a member the same week that this happened—it did not suit me to belong to it any longer, I did not think it worth while—there was not a Committee of Inquiry into my conduct in connection with the Magna Charta—I was not there, and I don't know anything about it—I believe a committee was appointed in my absence, and I believe Casey was one of them—I don't know what it was appointed for, I was not there—it was not to inquire as to certain sums which I had received and not paid in—I had nothing to do with the money, and it could not have been so—the Committee were holding an inquiry without my consent at the Mason's Arms, and I went up to know what it meant, and to stop them—I had not got my jaw bandaged up then, nor when I was before the Magistrate—I had a piece of sticking-plaster behind my ear, where the prisoner had wounded me with the revolver—I had it on for a week, till the place was well—I will swear I had not a bandage or a handkerchief on when I was before the Magistrate—I had seen the prisoner about ten days or a fortnight before this occurred—I have seen him several times, but have not spoken to him—I had seen him more than once in two years before this affair; it is not two years since he was the means of getting me dismissed from the Police Force—that was in December, 1873—I had only seen him once since then before this occasion, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I was talking to Casey—it was in Regent Street, and Casey lives there, and it was close to my house as well—I was standing talking to Casey when I saw the prisoner, and that was the first time I had seen him since eight or ten days before—I will swear that I saw his finger on the trigger at the time I heard the click—I believe the prisoner has been in the Army; in the East India Company—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the revolver I saw in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Regent Street, Lambeth—on the evening of 9th August, about five o'clock, I was talking to Reeve in Regent Street—the prisoner came up and looked very heavily, like thunder, at Mr. Reeve—Mr. Reeve said "I don't wish to have anything to say with you"—he said "But I do with you," and he rushed at him, and struck him with his fist—he did not fall at that—he returned back and said "Do you see this"—I could see something in his hand, but I did not know it was a</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live at Uxbridge. This bowl of a spoon was brought to me by Cooper, on Friday evening, the 28th of December - I bought it for 1s. 5d.; I asked where he got it; I knew he lived somewhere in the town; the bowl is not worn out - it weighs about 6 dwts.; Franklin brought the other part about two hours after; I told him it looked suspicious, for I had bought the bowl, and would not buy that: I then went over to Green's, in consequence of information, and the prisoners were taken a few days after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a boy like Cooper had brought you a whole spoon, would you buy it? A. It depends on whether he told me a plausible story - he said he had found it on Brown's dung-hill; we often hear of such things; I asked where he lived, and where his father worked; I found I knew his father by sight, and believed he had found it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoners: Franklin said he found the spoons in some stuff which his mother washed the pots in; I said he must have known it was Green's, as it had his name on it; he said he could not read, but he signed his examination before the Magistrate. Cooper told the Magistrate Franklin gave him the bowl, and he had found it.</p>

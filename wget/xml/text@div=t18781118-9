I am a porter, of 9, Earl Street, Finsbury—on 16th October the prisoner spoke to me in a public-house opposite Fenchurch Street Station—we went to the George, on Tower Hill—he spoke German, and I am a German—he said, "I am very rich, and, if you do not object, I should like you to travel with me"—I said I didn't object—another man was there, but I did not know that they were friends—he said "I am going to France"—he then said to the other man, "If you believe I am a real gentleman, will you give me your purse for a moment, and I will go out of doors, and when I come back again I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—the man gave him his purse, and the pri<lb></lb>soner went out and remained out about two minutes, and came back and gave the man his purse and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—the prisoner then had two rolls of notes in his hand—the man said that He was very much obliged to him, and then the prisoner said to me, "If you believe me, give me your purse, and when I come back I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. like the other man"—there were some German notes in my purse, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in German money, and some English money, amounting altogether to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I handed him my purse, and he and the other man left me in the public-house—I waited there about 10 minutes, and they never came back—I saw them again in Smithfield, followed them into a yard where they could not get out, and stopped them, and asked the prisoner for my money—he said, "Will you come with me to my lodging in my hotel, and you shall have the money back?"—I said, "Yes, it is what I want; I have not got a halfpenny"—he took me into the street, and I held him (the other man got away)—when we got into Newgate Street he offered me his watch and chain to let him go, but I would not take it—I called a constable and gave him in charge—this is my purse; there was only 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it when I got it back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I met the prisoner's friend first, and we had a glass of beer, and the prisoner came in afterwards—we only went to two public-houses—I was going with the prisoner to his hotel, but he wanted to run away, so I held him tight and called a policeman—I tried to hold the two—I should know the other man if I saw him again—I had only arrived from Germany about 2 o'clock that day.</p>

I am barman at the George, Tower Hill—on 16th October I saw Jager there with a man and another man, who to the best of my belief is the prisoner—the man spoke broken English when I served him—I saw two of them go out, and did not see them again till they were at the station.</p>

On 23rd October, Jager gave the prisoner into my custody in Newgate Street, and charged him with stealing by means of the confidence trick, money amounting to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were struggling on the footway and I took hold of the prisoner—Jager said that the other man had run away and got on an omnibus, the prisoner said that he had never seen the other man before, he had just come from Belgium—I took him to the station, where I found on him this purse containing about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two stamps, also a watch and chain which I believe are not gold, and in a pocket inside his left trousers leg I found 17 notes on the <hi rend="italic">Bank of Engraving</hi>, some for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but mostly for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in his coat pocket I found some tissue paper of the size of the notes.</p>

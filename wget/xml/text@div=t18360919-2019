                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Castle public-house, in Broadway, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. On Friday evening, the 16th of September, I was at home—we shut up the shutters an half-past eleven o'clock; and at twenty minutes or a quarter to twelve o'clock I myself shut the street door and fastened it—the other persons in the house had gone to bed—there are four tills in the bar—one of them was entirely empty; in another there was sixpence in silver and a few half-pence; in another, a shilling, and sixpence, and a few halfpence; and in the last, one half-crown, three shillings, one sixpence, some fourpenny-pieces and a few coppers—I cannot speak to the exact number of the fourpenny pieces—it is always my custom to examine my tills every night before I go to bed—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in penny pieces, all done up in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packages, on the side-board in the bar, with 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in penny pieces, not done up—there was a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief on the left-hand side in the side-board drawer—after seeing every thing secure, and the house fastened, I went to bed—I was awoke about half-past four o'clock, or rather later, the following morning, by the police—there is a back door to my house, leading into a small yard, and that back door leads into the parlour, which has a door from it into the bar—I found both those doors open—they appeared to have been opened by violence—a pannel was taken out of the back door—on looking about, I missed all the money from the ma<lb></lb>tel-piece, the side-board, and all the tills, and the blue pocket-handker<lb></lb>chief—I know both of the prisoner—I had seen Davis in the house about four o'clock both afternoon, when I went out to come into the City—I had seen Lucas many times at my house, but do not recollect seeing him there that duty day—I accompanied the policeman into the back, yard, and found a ladder there, placed against the wall—that would enable persons to pass from the yard of the next house over the wall into yard—I afterwards accompanied the policeman to the station-house—I have since seen the blue cotton handkerchief, and believe it to mine—it is like the rest of my handkerchief—I also saw some money, with a number of fourpenny-pieces among it.</p>

I was coming past the same place, and found nine packages of penny-pieces in five-shilling parcels in a privy, in St. Herman's-hill, tied up in a blue pocket handkerchief—Coller was with me—the prisoners had come past that place at ten minutes after twelve o'clock—I look them into custody in the Almonry, about half-past four o'clock as I suspected them—I had heard nothing from Coller—he was gone to see if any rob<lb></lb>bery had been committed—I took the prisoner to the station-house—I found nothing on Lucas—in Davis left-hand waistcoat pocket I found thirteen fourpenny-pieces, and amongst them was the one which Mrs. Cleg<lb></lb>gett identified just now—I also found half-crown, four shillings, three sixpences, and a halfpenny, on him.</p>

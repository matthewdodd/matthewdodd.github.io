I was in the shop on the 27th of October, about six o'clock in the evening - the shop window had been broken before, and three sheets of paper pasted over the hole; they must be broken before any thing could be got at; I observed nothing till Tett came and told me something was gone; I looked at the window, and the paper was broken quite large enough to admit a person's hand; there were shoes within reach, and I missed a pair which I had seen there shortly before; I went out and the prisoner was pointed out to me about eight yards off - I pursued, and never lost sight of him before I took him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040032"></xptr>I took the shoes from under his coat - they are worth 5s.; he said nothing.</p>

            . I am a paper-stainer, and live in Dean-street, Soho. I was in Newgate-street, and observed the prisoner put his hand through the paper and take out a pair of shoes; I immediately went in and informed Mr. Foster, pointed the prisoner out to him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken, and brought back with the shoes in his possession; I saw them taken from him - it was near six o'clock, and dark.</p>

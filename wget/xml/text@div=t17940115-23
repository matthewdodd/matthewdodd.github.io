As I was coming out of the shop, after putting my cap and bonnet on, a young woman and a gentleman together bid me not to go down the Strand; and the young woman told me their names, nothing more passed then; I was obliged to go all round the back streets to get away with my life from them; nothing further passed that night, I went home all tore to pieces as I was, I got my cap and bonnet but I lost my fox muff and tippet, and a check muslin apron, and two yards of sattin ribbon.</p>

There was a girl along with these two girls that came, that gave the names of the two prisoners; we made an appointment to meet them at half past seven, to go round the streets to inspect after them; we were going about in Drury-lane, who knows almost all the girls about St. Giles's; we asked her, if she knew the girls? she said, she did; on which, we went along with these two girls about the Strand, Temple bar, Chancery-Lane, and Holborn, two nights, Friday night, and Saturday night; on the Saturday night when we could not find them, we made an agreement to meet Sunday morning, to go to their apartment, to see, to get them in bed; we knew their lodgings were in Lukener's-lane; we went, and they were both in bed; we rapped at the door, and the door was opened; Judith Clancy came in, and said, these were the girls; the prisoners were both in the same bed.

On the morning of 14th March, about 1 o'clock, I was on duty in the Westminster-road, just by the Female Orphan Asylum—I saw the prisoner and three others standing at the corner of Francis-street—they were talking very loud, making use of very obscene language, swearing at each other—they were making a very great disturbance—I do not know that I can justly express the words they were making use of—I thought it my duty to interfere, and 1 went up and asked them to go on; I told them I could not allow that noise and disturbance there at that time in the morning—I then turned round to go away, thinking they would go, and the prisoner made use of some observation which I did not understand—I turned round and asked what he meant, upon which he made use of a bad expression—I then went to them again, and said I must take them into custody if they did not go away, upon which the prisoner said he did not care a d—for me; he wished I was out of my clothes, meaning out of my uniform—one of the others standing by said he did not care a b—for me, clothes, and all—the prisoner then said, "We will <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> the b—"—another one said, "Oh, give it him; he is only a b—thing; we don't care for him"—I thought it my duty to take the prisoner into custody—I drew my staff, and was going to take hold of him to take him into custody, when the three that were behind me seized hold of me—the prisoner was in front of me, and he rushed in and snatched my staff away, and the instant be got hold of it, be hit me a blow on the side of the head, which caused the blood to flow—there was a wound, my head was smashed just at the side, and I found the blood running down my face—he then made another blow, which caught me on the back of the head, and caused a swelling half the size of a hen's egg, but it did not cut the skin—they then all seized on me, and got me down, and tried to gouge my eye out; they <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> their fingers under my eye—I could not swear whether that was the prisoner's fingers or the others—I struggled and got round, drew my rattle, and sprung it, and they ran away—I knew two of them before, the prisoner and another—I have no doubt at all about the prisoner being the man that got the staff from me; I am certain of it—I had my wound dressed four times by a surgeon, and was off duty a week in consequence of the wound.</p>

Q.</hi> The London-road is a long way from Old-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I formerly lived in Newington, and had acquaintance with Mr. James, and went there to see him, and I went from Mr. Bunyan's, where I first met him, to the Princess—I was with him at the beer shop I should think two hours, I saw the prisoner there, he was standing in the room; I saw him several times take beer from the counter—I went with Mr. James alone, from the beer shop to the Princess, but one or two followed from there who I do not know—I have known the prisoner by seeing him backwards and forwards something like two months—I am not there every night; I have been there twenty times in the last two months; I do a great deal of work there—James is a tailor—I am my own master—I left the Princess about a quarter past 1 o'clock—I know that because I kept looking at the clock, thinking I should be late, being at a distance from home—I know Duffett; I rather think we left him there when we left; I know Glover by sight, but do not know where he lives, he did not leave with us, we left him there—I went straight home from the Princess, leaving the prisoner there.</p>

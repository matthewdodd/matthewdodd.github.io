Baylis confessed he had taken them at different times, and carried them to this man.</p>
               <p>How was this confession made, did you make him any promise to induce him to confess? - No, there was no promise made him whatever, nor any thing of that sort hinted to him. When we carry our files to the file cutters, as they have so many, they mark the names of the persons they belong to upon them; my files were so marked. There is about a third of them are broken off just at the mark; I am certain to about thirty of them, the quantity laid in the indictment, being my property. Hedge very well knew Baylis was my apprentice; my dwelling house is at a distance from the house of Hedges but the place where I work is within ten yards of his house.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I took Mrs. Hedge up on being informed by Mr. Jackman that these things belonged to him. I went with Jackman to Hedge's house; we found him in bed; I found the things mentioned in the indictment in his shop; they lay about the shop; some in one place, some in another, some of them rather out of sight; the mandrell was open in the shop. I took Baylis, and told him the best thing he could do for his master, now he had robbed him, was to confess what he had taken.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I borrowed the Mandrell to round some handles, and the screw I borrowed to mend a brass fronted stow; as to the box and pin the young man asked me to let him leave them there till he fetched them away. I have often lent him tools out of my shop for his master's use. I thought there was no harm in borrowing a tool of a man.</p>

I am a private in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich—the two prisoners are also privates in the Artillery—on 1st July I was about with them till nearly 11 o'clock at night—I was at a public-house called the Three Daws; Sophia Harris was there with me; while I was there, I gave the prisoners a pot of beer; I paid for it with some money which I took out of my pocket—I had a bag which hung round my neck, between my flannel</p>

               <p>and my skin; I had three 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces in that bag; the prisoners had seen me put money in that bag, and take it out—shortly afterwards I left the Three Daws—Sophia Harris lives nearly opposite—I went home with her to her room, leaving the two prisoners behind in the public-house—I had not been in Sophia Harris's room more than five minutes; I sat down on the bed; I heard a noise at the door; I got under the bed, and Harris said, "What do you want?"—the prisoners said, "Is not one of our men here?"—she said, "No"—they forced the door open, and came in; Chadwick got hold of my leg, and pulled me from under the bed into the middle of the room, and then Rivett and another man, who is not here, "tried to get me out of the door; I stuck fast at the door, and they could not get me further, and then Chad<lb></lb>wick unbuttoned my jacket, and got hold of my bag and gave it a jerk; he broke the string, and he said, "Come on," and they all ran away together; I went to the police, and the prisoners were taken at the Coach and Horses half an hour afterwards—I had been having some beer, but I was sober; the prisoners were sober.</p>

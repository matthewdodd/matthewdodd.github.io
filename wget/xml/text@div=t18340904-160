            . I am a surgeon, and live in Cannon-street-road. I know the prisoner and her husband, they were the father and mother of the deceased - I had attended the child for seven months prior to this - he had an inflammation on the lungs, for which I ordered a warm bath, and the child received benefit from it - on Sunday, the 2nd of August, the child was brought to me with a case of catarrh - I gave it some medicine - the father came again in the evening - I gave a powder to be added to some water to form a lotion, and directed how it was to be used - I saw the child the next morning - it was very much distressed - I ordered poultices to be applied to the feet, and a small portion of brandy and water to be given it - the skin was off the left foot - I saw it three times that morning- the second time the convulsions had taken place, and it died about twelve o'clock, I understand - I consider the death arose from the irritation of the scald of its feet and legs, and the fright it had received - I should consider the feet and legs had been immersed in water - the line of heat was the same height on each leg - if a person had put the child's feet into water, without applying their own hand, they might have made it too hot - a mere immersion into hot water would have produced the effect in so young a child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not been applied to, to go in the course of the night? A. Yes, once; three applications were made for means to use - I think I was first applied to about nine o'clock, and I observed to the father, "If I go to see the child, it will be a loss of time - there is but one treatment for burns and scalds - I advise you to go and use those means through the night," giving him directions what to do - a man came to me afterwards who was very impudent, and said if I would not go, some other person should be got - the father was with him, he apologized for it - I can hardly say whether I was applied to, to go a third time or not.</p>

             - we live in the same house with the prisoner - I knew the unfortunate child - his name was George Thomas Forsythe - about seven months ago it was ill - it appeared to me that its father and mother did their best to assist it - the child could just move about with assistance, and was a sweet-tempered child - on the day mentioned, I heard the child scream about nine o'clock at night - I ran into the room, the prisoner clasped her hands and said, "Ridley, I have scalded my child" - I asked her how she did it - she said she had got the child into the pail, and in pouring the water into the pail, the lid of the kettle came off, and the water poured out and scalded the child - there was a kettle by the fire-side - I have seen the kettle since; the rim of the lid was off - the legs of the child were severely scalded, as if they had been immersed in water - the prisoner always appeared fond of the child, and attentive to it - I know she had used the warm bath before, when the child was ill - as far as I could learn, it was the effect of accident - I think she had forgotten to put the cold water in.</p>

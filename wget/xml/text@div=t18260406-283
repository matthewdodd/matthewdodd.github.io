On the 8th of March the prisoner left me four sacks of mixed corn - he should have left me five; I told him there was one short; he said his master had no more corn in the yard, and he would bring six on the Wednesday afterwards, but on that day he brought but four; I told him I should send his master word of it - he said I might send and be d-d; he appeared to be drunk on the 15th, but on the 8th he said it was all right enough about the corn.</p>

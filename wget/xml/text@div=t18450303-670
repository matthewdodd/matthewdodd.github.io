I am in partnership with George Brown, a tailor, of Jermyn-street, and am also proprietor of the Pavilion Theatre, In the early part of last Dec. a person who gave his name as George Tidmarsh was introduced to me by my partner, Mr. Brown—before that I had not heard that any charge had been made against me of keeping a brothel—I had just got out of an indictment for keeping a gaming-house at Manchester—I saw the defendant Jacobs, at Mr. Croft's some time afterwards—he did not know me—I had no conversation with him—I had no conversation with him after that, only meeting him at the Judge's cham<lb></lb>bers—I never saw Tidmarsh at the Judge's chambers, or in company with Jacobs—I have seen Partridge, Brown, and Jacobs together, but not Tid<lb></lb>marsh—I went to the Metropolitan Police-office that day month, I think, after Tidmarsh came to me, and made a communication to inspector Shackell and Haynes—that was in consequence of the proposition made by Tidmarsh.</p>

Mr. Richardson is a partner of mine—I am the senior partner—we are tailors and drapers there—a person who gave his name George Tidmarsh, called upon me, I think, on the 2nd of Dec—I communicated the fact to Mr. Richardson immediately—Tidmarsh introduced me to Jacobs and Partridge, on the next day (Tuesday)—I had never known either of them before—I inquired what was the reason they indicted Mr. Richardson—Jacobs said that they had a warrant against Mr. Richardson on an indictment in the name of Thomas Richardson, or Thomas Fletcher, I do not know which, that they would take 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to quash the indictment, and give up the warrants—this was at the Black Horse, in Coventry-street—I had gone there with Tidmarsh—he retired when he introduced me to the parties—he intro<lb></lb>duced me to both of them, and then retired to some other portion of the room, but not sufficiently near to hear any conversation that passed-when he introduced me, he merely said, "This is Mr. Brown, the partner of Mr. Richardson"—he merely brought us together—he was an intermediate party—Jacobs said they had got an indictment against Mr. Richtrd<lb></lb>son, and if he would give 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they would quash the indictment, and give up the warrant—I said I did not believe there was anything of the sort, unless he would produce the warrant—I appointed to meet them at my house next day, Wednesday, at five o'clock in the afternoon, to prodoce the warrant—Partridge and Jacobs came on that occasion—Mr. Richard<lb></lb>son was out of town at the time—Partridge showed me the warrants, and said in Jacobs' presence, that Jacobs was the prosecutor—I said I would communicate with Mr. Richardson, who was out of town, and I should have his answer by return of post, as to the payment of the money—I wrote to Mr. Richardson on the subject—I did not see him till the Saturday evening following, at ten o'clock, when he returned by coach to my house—I had seen the parties in the interval every day, and sometimes twice a day.</p>

Shackell and Haynes desired me to secrete myself behind the curtain in Mr. Brown's drawing-room, in Jermyn-street, to hear a con<lb></lb>versation—I did so, and <hi rend="italic">Moe</hi> Jacobs and Partridge came—Mr. Brown told them that Mr. Richardson had come to the determination of not giving them more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he must have the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deducted that he had given them on account—(nothing was said then about the purpose for which the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be given)—Jacobs said he must have 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Partridge said he might do as he pleased about receiving the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he was the prosecutor—Jacobs then agreed to take the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not re<lb></lb>member the words he used—he said he would take the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and deduct the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had received on account; and he asked Mr. Brown if he was prepared to pay the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, that they might deliver up and destroy the warrants then—Mr. Brown said he was not prepared to pay them n gold, but if they would call at five he should most likely be ready to pay, them—nothing passed about notes that I am aware of—I heard nothing—they said they would call at five—at that time Shackell and Haynes were in the front shop—Jacobs and Partridge then went away, and came again at five—Mr. Brown told them he was not then prepared, and asked if they would call again at eight, or half-past, in the evening; and about eight, or half-past, <hi rend="italic">Moe</hi> Jacobs, Partridge, and Tidmarsh, came together—they saw Mr. Brown, and waited for an hour, or an hour and a half—Mr. Brown told them he was not prepared to pay them—they then left, and one of them, I do not know which, told Mr. Brown that he had been making a fool of them—they had seen Shackell and Haynes at three o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> In the early part of Dec. Tidmarsh came to Mr. Brown, and I saw him afterwards—he is the man I have in<lb></lb>dicted, with Jacobs and Partridge—he opened the ball, by professing a great deal of concern for me, and asked me if I knew I was indicted for the house in Duke-street—(I knew him before—I had seen him occasionally, but never to be intimate with him)—I asked him what house—he said Mrs. Fletcher's house—I asked what I had to do with that, and who sent him—he said Partridge and <hi rend="italic">Moe</hi> Jacobs, that they had preferred ft bill against me at the Crown Court of Westminster, in the name of Fletcher, as keeping the house in Duke-street—I asked him how they could get a bill against me—he said they had done it on the evidence of old Bayley—I asked him who Bayley was, I did not know such a person—he said he had been porter at the gaming-house, No. 7, Leicester-square—I said, "What does he know of me, then?"—he said, "Why, he does not know anything of you, but Jacobs and Partridge have persuaded him it is your brother Henry that he has indicted, because he has a spite against your brother Henry; for when he had three months in Cold Bath-fields, your brother Henry refused to be anything towards a subscription which was raised for him amongst the <hi rend="italic">play</hi>-people"—he was indicted for No. 69, Jermyn-street—I said, "Well, I suppose the long and short of it is, you want some money?"—he said, "Why you know what Jacobs and Partridge are; of course that is what we want"—I said, "What sum do they demand?"—he said 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he thought would settle it—30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or thereabouts, he thought he could settle it for—I told him I would communicate with Mr. Brown, and expressed my disbelief of there being any indictment—he then told me that Jacobs had got the warrants, and my partner, Mr. Brown, could meet them, or they would come to Mr. Brown's, and produce them—I said I wanted Mr. Brown to see the warrants, because I expressed my disbelief of there being any indictment—Tidmarsh said, "Well, I will go and see</p>

               <p>Partridge and Jacobs, and will make an appointment for them to see Mr. Brown; I know they would object to see you"—he did not say why—I then left, Tidmarsh undertaking to bring Mr. Brown and the whole of them together—I went to Ipswich for that week, and on returning on the following Monday, I heard from Mr. Brown what had occurred, and in consequence, I went to the police-office on the Monday, to speak to Haynes and Shackell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Tidmarsh mention what the number of the house in Duke-street was, or describe it, so that you knew what house it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he, knew nothing about the house—he called it Mrs. Fletcher's house, in Duke-street, and said he had been over the way to Blockey's, to see if they knew anything about me, and they did not, and, consequently, he had come to Jermyn-street, in consequence of their not knowing anything about me in Duke-street, or the neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you have anything to do with gaming transactions at Manches<lb></lb>ter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a lease of the Grand Stand, and let it out to people, until the last year, when it was put down—I took it for the purposes of gam<lb></lb>bling, and let it, and made a profit of it, till Sir James Graham put it down—I have got different stands for gaming in the country, for which I pay. a rental of about 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which I let out to other parties, and have done so till the last year—I remained at Manchester till last October—Mrs. Fletcher left four years ago—I was indicted with a person of the name of Minter Hart, but I was never tried—I went to the Court of Queen's Bench, at Westminster, and made them go to trial, and there was a verdict of acquittal—it was for a conspiracy that I was shoved into—it was not for possessing myself of 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills, but for conspiring to negotiate some acceptances which had been obtained by Minter Hart—Hart was not convicted and transported on that charge—I have read in papers that he was so on a similar charge, but he was no acquaintance of mine.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—I live at Twyford, Berks—on Saturday evening, August 12th, I was at home at work—my husband came home at 12 o'clock—I do not know whether he knew what he was about; he had been out of temper for two days—he asked me for money; I gave him no answer; I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put it on the table before him and then went upstairs to put the child to bed—on coming down as I went through the warehouse into the front room, a knife came and struck me in my eye; it cut mo to the bone and bled very much—my little boy was there—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fish dealer at No, 1, London Court, London Passage, Whitecross Street. On 17th Oct. I was in a coffee shop in Botolph Lane, between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was eating a haddock there, and I asked for some pepper—the prisoner was sitting beside me—I did not know him before—I said, "Who has got the pepper box?"—the prisoner made use of bad language—I took no notice of him—he was sitting at my right hand side—he drew a knife, and said he would stick any one that insulted him—Worster then said to him, "You are a dirty old man"—after that he got <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with him, and got out of temper—Worster was in fun, and the pri<lb></lb>soner got angry—the prisoner had got a stick in his hand, and he said he should hit any low-lived fellow on the head that insulted him—Worster got <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> him again, and he got out of temper, and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with the stick—I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> the stick, and as soon as I did so, he picked up the knife, and stuck it in my hand, on the middle of the fore finger, and on the palm of the hand—I ran out to fetch a constable—I said "Don't let him go, I will take him up"—I then ran to the doctor's, and the doctor said I most go to the hospital—I ran there, and they dressed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Which hospital did you go to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> St. Thomas's—I had it dressed there—I did not state before the Lord Mayor that it was Guy's Hospital—you were not eating half a pint of peas when I first saw you—you were afterwards—I heard come of the conversation between you and Worster—Worster did not look round to me, and say with an oath "There now, listen to what this fellow says, strike me dead"—nothing of that sort passed—I did not come forward, and say that you ought to be the last who would call any one low-lived—all I said was that you ought to be the first one to be hit with your stick, for the language you made use of—I did not then immediately look round, and tell the other people in the shop what you had said, and then throw some tea in your face—I saw tea or coffee thrown in your face afterwards, I do not know who by—there was nothing else that I saw—the others were scolding you—when you put up your hands to wipe</p>

               <p>the tea or coffee from your face, I did not say that some of the people took the stick away—I attempted to take the stick from your hand when you went to hit Worster—they did not throw the tea till after you cut my hand—you were not rubbing the tea from your eye at the time the stick was raised to hit Worster—I did not see anyone else throw anything afterwards—nobody hit you—when my hand was cut, I did not look round to Worster and two or three others, and say, "G—strike me dead, look how my hand is cut!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital. Mr. Whitham came to me with his hand cut—I ordered it to be dressed—there were two clean cuts, which had evidently been made by some sharp instal<lb></lb>ment like a knife—the one in the palm of the hand was in a very dangerous situation: it might have been very dangerous—I believe they are nearly well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in this coffee house on the day the prisoner was there—I was eating a bit of haddock—the prosecutor was there, and he asked for the pepper box, and the prisoner made use of a very bad expres<lb></lb>sion—it went on, and he said, "The first man that makes use of a bad expression, he ought to be hit on the head with this stick"—he then pulled a knife out of his back coat pocket, placed it on the table, and said, "Any<lb></lb>one that insults me, I will stick him with this"—he then got on the table to hit me with the stick; Mr. Whitham tried to protect me, and the prisoner stuck him with the knife—I did not see any tea or coffee thrown in his face; I believe there was some, but I did not see it—there was some tea thrown on the table—I said to him, "Do you see what you have done!" after he struck the man; and one said, "You ought to know better, "and others threw some tea in his face—Whitham was gone to get a constable then—I cannot say exactly where the prisoner was—he had got off his seat.</p>

Between three and four o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 4th of August, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for 1/4 lb. of 8 s. tea, 1 lb. of 1 s. lump sugar, and 1/4 lb. 4 s. coffee; she produced a 1 l. Bank note. I took it in my hand, rather suspected it while I was looking at it; another customer came in, I laid the note down on the counter, and put a brass weight on it, and after waiting on the customer, I took it up again and inspected it - I did not like it, but gave her the change, 16 s., and sent her out of the shop. Before I gave the change, I asked her what address I should put on it, she said, "Roberts, Hart-street, Covent-garden," but if you do not like to put that, you can put "Mr. Norton, No. 16, Cross-street," that is where I am, and she recommended me here for tea and sugar. I put down "Mr. Roberts, Hart-street," in full, and underneath, "No. 16, Cross-street," with the date. I generally put Mr. on the note, she did not say either Mr. or Mrs. I wrote this before I gave her the change. I told my boy to follow her to Cross-street, and if she did not go there, to follow and see where she went - he followed her. I watched, and saw her go into the church-yard, which was the way to Cross-street - the boy is not here; in about ten minutes he returned - I have the note here. I carried it to the Bank on the Tuesday following, the 7th of August, and left it there with Mr. Fish. I saw her again the Monday following, the 6th of August. Between three and four o'clock,

             came into my shop and said, "I want two ounces of tea, and 2 lbs. of sugar, but I want change for a note." I said, "I can't give change, my good woman, but will you allow me to look at the note;" she gave the note into my hand. I suspected it, and could almost take my oath that it came off the same plate as that I took on Saturday. I asked who the grocery was for, she said, she did not know the person, but it was a person who came to Cross-street, where she lived, and asked her to go and get the grocery, and change for a note. I asked her if she should know the dress of the person who sent her; she said, Yes. I described the dress, and it answered my description. I said, "I am doubtful of the note being good, I will get an officer and take this woman on suspicion of uttering forged notes." I told her to wait till I returned; I went to Mr. Post, a neighbour, and asked his opinion, and then went and got the officer and returned, found Leach still there. We all three went into Cross-street - the prisoner was gone from there. I left word with the woman of the house, if she came back, to detain her. I was standing in my shop about two hours after, and saw the prisoner go by on the other side of the way, and directly I went up to her I knew her, got an officer and gave her in charge. I put the note that Leach presented to me in my pocket, and kept it in my possession till I went to the Bank next day. I then gave it to Mr. Fish, and marked it in his presence - it was never out of my possession till I marked it. I enquired at Hart-street, Covent-garden, but could find no such person as Roberts, neither Mr. nor Mrs. - I enquired at every house.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were consulting your neighbour, was the note out of your possession then, or at any other time - A. Only two minutes, while Mr. Post's young man took it into his counting-house, but I know he returned the same note, by the signature of Lambert, and by its being cut about so.</p>

            . I live at Cross-street, Islington; my husband is a labourer. On Monday, the 6th of August, I saw the prisoner down stairs in the parlour, talking to Mrs. Norton, the landlady. I had seen her there on the Saturday, sitting there, talking - she did not lodge there. On Monday, I heard her talking to Mrs. Norton, asking her to get change for a note - she said she would not.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120012"></xptr>I was up stairs, I went down and said, if it was a good one, I would go; she said I might depend on it, it was a good one, and gave it me; she told me to get two ounces of tea and 2 lbs. of sugar, and she would give me some of it for going. I went to Newman's, and asked Bloomfield for it, and told him a person was waiting for it, he asked how she was dressed - I told him, and gave him the note, and waited till he came back from enquiring. We then went with the constable to Cross-street, the prisoner was gone - I had been gone about half an hour; I saw her again in about an hour and a half; a little girl came from her with a message to me, saying that she was coming again next day. I went with the girl to the bottom of Cross-street, and found her in the street, talking to a boy, about 100 yards from the house. I went up to her and said, "You are the person I want, you must go with me to the grocer's to clear me, that you gave me the note;" she said, "Dont hurt me." I said, "I don't want to hurt you;" she went with me and the boy; I met Bloomfield by the church-yard, and he took her - she was no acquaintance of Norton's that I know of.</p>

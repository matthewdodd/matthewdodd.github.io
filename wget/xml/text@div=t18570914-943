                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, and live in Bethnal Green. On 24th Aug., when I went to bed, my window was not quite down; the shutters were closed, but not bolted, because it had been painted—I could not say whether there was room for anybody to get in—I was disturbed about half past 4 o'clock in the morning—I heard a noise in the front room; I got up, and saw a man going out and pulling the door to—I ran out, and saw the prisoner forty or fifty yards off—I hallooed, and he came back, and said he had taken nothing from me—I laid hold of him—he tried to get away, and said he had not taken anything, that he saw the door open, and went in for a necessary purpose—he asked me to let him go to his work, and he would give me what he had got, as he did not want to get into trouble—he then said he was hungry, and he had done it through hunger—I held him till a policeman came, and gave him in charge—I examined my house, but missed nothing—I expect he got in at the window, which might have been left wide enough for him to get in—I had left the door shut and hasped the previous night, and in the morning it was open—I gave an alarm, and he opened the door, and got out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I saw the door open, and went in to go to the back yard; I went on some yards, and heard some one call after me; I turned, and said, "Do you mean me? what do you mean by calling 'Stop thief!' after me?" he then collared me; I used to work two doors from his house; he came and looked at me many times.</p>

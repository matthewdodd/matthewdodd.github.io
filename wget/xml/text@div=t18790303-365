                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher, of 353, Rotherhithe Wall, which business was assigned to me by Mr. Harrer, at Easter, 1877—the defendant was then a customer—he paid for one order under the other—in October, 1877, he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was the last order he gave me—I sent my son for it, and applied myself—he said "When I pay you, I shall owe you nothing"—in November, 1877, I took out a County Court summons, and when it came on I was non-suited—I took out a fresh sum<lb></lb>mons—that was heard on 3rd February—the defendant was sworn, and said he did not owe the money, and that I charged him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a <hi rend="italic">lb.</hi> more than Mr. Harrer used to, and that he paid Mr. Harrer, and the daughter receipted the bill behind the counter, and he produced this receipt marked F.—the Judge gave judgment for the defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was Mr. Harrer's man for 10 or 12 years before I took the business—the defendant was a customer of his for more than that time—he paid cash regularly—for some time he used little bills bike this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and that would be receipted when he bought another supply of meat—if he called without the bill a receipt might be given on another piece of paper—before I took over the business, sometimes Mrs. Harrer would take the money or Miss Harrer—I did not alter the name over the shop—after I took over the business Miss Harrer came occasionally on a visit to my daughter—my daughter never took large bills, but merely trifles, behind the counter—I never saw them behind the counter together—I did not pay. a sum to Harrer for the business, but I pay him so much a week for the use of everything—I pay the rent and taxes—Harrer comes there occasionally—I took possession on April 3, 1877—Harrer took his book with him—I do not know whose writing this is on this paper, between "33<hi rend="italic">lb.</hi>" and "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is not mine—I would not swear it is not my wife's—I may have sent in some bills to the defendant which Harrer left me—I never gave receipts on blank pieces of paper—the meat in respect of which I sued was supplied on October 17, 1877—I sued him in December because he ceased to deal with me—I do not know why—that was merely the complaint he made in Court, that I charged him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per 1<hi rend="italic">b.</hi> more than Harrer used to—I believe the defendant has been highly respected in the neighbourhood—I have not heard anything against him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Friday night the 14th of this month, I lost my pocket-book, with the bills mentioned in the indictment, at near ten o'clock at night in a place I think they call <placeName id="t17790519-37-crimeloc206">Butcher-row, Temple-bar</placeName>

               <p>When did you see the book? - Just before I came out of the punch-house; I was doing some business there; I put it into the inside pocket of my coat.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was secure then? - Yes. As I was going through Butcher-row, I met two girls; they caught hold of me and asked me to treat them with a glass; I kept going on, and they kept up with me, entreating me to give them a glass; I said there was no house to treat them; they said there was one just by; I went with them and gave them a glass a piece. I came out and was going home; they followed me and begged me to give them more liquor. I would not; I said I would have nothing to do with them, that I was a married man. One of them came up before me with her petticoats up in a very indecent manner, jumped upon me, and got hold of me round the middle; I was sometime before I could loose myself from her; I asked her what she wanted, if she wanted to rob me; I believe I might damn her; I felt for my watch and money and found it was safe. I did not then recollect my pocketbook. When I had gone a little from them, I thought of my pocket-book, and missed it. I went back, but could not find them; I never found my book or notes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did not slip it out of your pocket in the punch-house? - Yes, I felt it in my pocket in Fleet-street, as I was going along.</p>
               <p>Do you know the persons of either of the women? - Yes. I went home to my lodging, got up in the morning, and went to the place where we had the liquor, and described them to the woman that served us; she said she knew nothing of the woman. About nine o'clock in the morning I saw the two girls come out of a passage by Clement's-Inn. On seeing me they bustled along, and held down their heads; I pursued them, they divided, one ran towards Temple-bar, the other, which was the girl that jumped upon me, to Clement's-Inn. I pursued her, and took her, and asked her what she had done with the pocket-book she took from me the night before; she would not say any thing; I told her I would not hurt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190051"></xptr> her if she produced the pocket-book; she would not confess at all.</p>
               <p>Are you positive to the person of the prisoner? - Yes; I took particular notice of her at the bar, where we had the liquor.</p>
               <p>Was she dressed as she is now? - I did not take notice of their dress, only of their features as they stood at the bar. The prisoner is the very same.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This I understand was on a Friday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any previous knowledge of the prisoner, had you ever seen her before that night? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>The meeting was accidental? - To me it was.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the girl ran up to you and embraced you that you missed your pocket-book? - It could not be half a minute I had gone but a few paces.</p>
               <p>Did not you when you met the girl in the morning ask her who she was and where she lived? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not she tell you who she was and where her friends lived? - No she would not say any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Did you go home with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you when you went home with her find her a different person from what you expected? - No, they were all strangers to me.</p>
               <p>I understand you to swear that you was perfectly sober - Yes.</p>

               <p>Positively? - Yes, surely.</p>
               <p>Do you remember your making use of the expression that if her skin was stripped from her bones you could swear to her skeleton? - No.</p>
               <p>When you had been at her house how came you not to have her immediately taken into custody, as you knew her so well? - From the man at the Robinhood saying I had better not take her up.</p>
               <p>You did leave her at the house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoners four or five years, they have been customers of mine. On Saturday, the 1st of December, the female prisoner came into my shop, about a quarter-past three o'clock, to pay their last week's account, and to order some other goods—she paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—shortly after Mrs. Mitchell followed her into the shop, and accused her of picking up her purse—Mrs. Higgins said, "My good woman, I have not seen your purse, if I had I would give it you, but I am willing to be searched"—I am sure about that—I asked Mrs. Mitchell what there was in the purse—she said, "8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—she then said to Mrs. Higgins, "If you will not give it up by fair means we will make you do it by foul"—Mrs. Higgins then went to join her husband next door—Mrs. Higgins gave me a sovereign, and I gave her change—she came back very shortly and said they would not search her there, they were going to take her to the station-house—I went with them—Mrs. Mitchell then gave a different account of the contents of her purse—she mentioned three sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoners are highly respectable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the landlord of the Cock and Mag<lb></lb>pie. I have known the prisoners about twelve months, by seeing them pass—on the first Saturday in this month, I saw them at my father's house—Mrs. Mitchell said she had lost 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told her it was too much for any one to lose, I was very sorry for it—I asked her as she was coming out of the tap-room door what she had lost, as I had heard her complain in the tap-room that she had lost her bag, and she said 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>(Several witnesses gave each of the prisoners an excellent character.)</p>

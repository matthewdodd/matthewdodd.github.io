            . On the 4th of August he went out in the morning, leaving me and Wedgwood at home-Wedgwood went out at ten o'clock, and I went out between twelve and one, leaving no person in the house; I locked the front door, and put the key under the flower-pot in the front window-the house is in a garden-there is a gate, which I bolted, but it could easily be opened. No person saw me put the key under the flower-pot - I was in the habit of putting it there. I had told Wedgwood that I should put it there for her to find it-expecting she would return before me; the window is not very high from the garden, any person could get in at it. I returned in about an hour (before Wedgwood), and found the key in the same window where I had left it, the door was fastened, but the window was a little open-it was the same window where I had left the key. The flower-pot was not exactly in the same situation as I had left it. I went in and missed the watches immediately, I had seen them before I went out, and after my husband and his brother went out. I know the prisoner. I had not seen him about the house.</p>
               <p>JOHN SNOWSEL. I am a constable. I went to look for the prisoner from information which I received, and found him at Putney fair, on the 17th of August, about three o'clock - I knew him before; he lived about a hundred yards from me up to the time of the robbery, and then moved. I took him to the Police-Office - He was discharged. After that I went to Morritt's, the pawnbroker, in York-street, Westminster, and found a silver watch there-there was a duplicate with it; I had no particular reason for going there; Johnson produced it to me. I took the prisoner into custody a second time. I said nothing to indnce him to confess. He told his mother, in my presence, that the duplicates of the two watches were under a tile in the garden. He said the other was pledged at the corner of a court in Princes-street, Soho - I went and found a watch there; next day his mother gave me the duplicate.</p>
               <p>CHARLES JOHNSON. I am shopman to Mr. Morritt, who is a pawnbroker. On the 4th of August, the prisoner pledged a silver watch with me for 25s. about the middle of the day; I have our duplicate, it is in the name of

               <p>JOHN PURDIE. I am shopman to Mr. Bartrum, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Princes-street. On the 5th of August, about half past seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner pledged a watch with me for 10s. he asked 1l. for it; he gave me the name of James Nash; the duplicate found is the one I gave him, it was written in my presence.</p>

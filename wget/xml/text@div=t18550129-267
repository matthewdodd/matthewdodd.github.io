                  </hi>. I keep a shop at Hampton, it has con<lb></lb>fectionery on one side, and fruit on the other. On 2nd Jan., Grout came in between 2 and 3 o'clock; he asked for a halfpenny stale bun, which I had not got—I sold him a halfpenny worth of gingerbread—I saw Richard<lb></lb>son looking in at the window—as Grout went out I went to shut the door, and there was a piece of Christmas holly on the ground, which had been by the side of the gingerbread—I then looked, and missed a shilling cake of gingerbread that had not been in the same end of the window that Richardson was looking in—he was at the fruit window, but I should think he could see Grout take the gingerbread—I should think he could see all over the shop—as soon as I missed the gingerbread I went to the door, and saw the two prisoners going down towards Hampton Church—Mrs. Barnes told me something, and as the policeman was going by I spoke to him—he followed the prisoners, and took Richardson, and brought him back to me.</p>

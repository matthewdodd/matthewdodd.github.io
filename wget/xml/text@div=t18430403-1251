                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Chippenham—on the 2nd of March I sent eight carcasses of sheep in two packages, four in each, addressed to Mr. Masters, Newgate-market—they were in cloths, and skewered—there was no difficulty in undoing them—there was a mark on one of the kidneys of a sheep—I have since seen the carcass of that sheep at Marylebone office—this is it—the mark is on this kidney—the other kidney of the other portion of the sheep was gone—the fat appears to have been torn from the sheep—I should say this kidney and fat came from this place—the kidney was in it when I sent it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I received a packet of carcasses from Slade, of Chippenham, in packets of four—in one of them the kidney and the surrounding fat was missing—this is it—the kidney that was left had a particular mark on it—I have fitted this other fat and kidney to the same saddle of mutton—I believe this to be one that came from there.</p>

I am the night superintendent of the Great Western Railway at Paddington—the prisoner is porter there—the train that these should come by arrived on Friday morning, the 3rd of March, about one o'clock—the prisoner would have access to the goods—in consequence of information I took him on the platform on Friday morning, the 3rd of March, about a quarter to five—he was near some sacks—he was taken to the sta<lb></lb>tion,</p>

               <p>and I returned to the sacks, where he had been sitting—I found in a space this kidney in between the sacks in the goods-shed—previously to taking him in charge I spoke to the sergeant, and something occurred which induced me to look there.</p>

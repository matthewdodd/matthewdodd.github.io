Last Sunday about five or six Minutes before ten at Night, two Men came up the Passage into my Yard and went into a Room in the dark and rung the Bell. I carried a Candle to 'em. They called for half a Pint of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173507020015"></xptr> Port I sent my Drawer with it. They rung again for a Porter to call a Coach - Do they take this to be a Coffee house, says I. Do they think that out of half a Pint of Wine I can afford to fe d a Porter on their Errand? Let 'em walk - My Porter however was not then in the way tho' he soon after came in and went of several Errands for them. I was told they expected more Company and would stay and sup - They had a cool Tankard - some Steaks - and a Tankard of Oat Ale. They went away at near eleven without paying the Reckoning; and carried off the two Silver Tankards, as I have too much reason to believe. I cannot swear that the Prisoner was one of them, for when I carried in the Candle, one of them turned his Face from me.</p>

            , Porter. The two Men were in the Fourteen The Prisoner ordered me to go to The Swan Alehouse about three Doors off, and ask for one Mr. Emes. I went, but no such Person was there. I am positive to the Prisoner, for I know perfectly well that he is the Man. Then they sent me to The Bull Head in Fleet-Street to enquire for the same Person. I was told that a Gentleman of that name had been there, and that he was a very topping Gentelman, but he was not there then. I came back with this Message and found the Prisoner standing at the Head of the Alley, and looking as I thought for me. He went in and I follow'd. I then saw but one Tankard. They bid me drink, and as I was going out, the Prisoner called me in again, and said, Porter do so much as step to Tom. King's, in the Market ( 'tis a Night-house in Covent Garden) and see if Mr. Emes is not theres. I went, but could not meet with him - I believe I was not gone above three Minutes, but when I returned the Prisoner and his Companion were gone.</p>

            . My Master carried a Candle into the Fourteen, and sent me for half a Pint of Red which I carried to them - They asked- for a Porter to fetch a Coach. They ordered a Cool Tankard. My Master said, I don't like those Men take care of the Tankard; Its yours if its lost They would fain have made the Cool Tankard themselves, but I told 'em I wanted the Strainer and Spoon. So I made it, and took the Spoon and Strainer away. They had some Steaks. They bid me give the Steaks to the Cook to set them before the Fire for a Gentleman who was not yet come. I did so. I believe the Prisoner was one of them; indeed I am not sure of it, but I think I know him by his Speech - Our Porter having subscribed him to several Persons, we heard that his Name was Dun, and that he lived in Flower de luce Court I enquired at his Lodgings, but was told he had been gone thence three Days; I spoke to a Silver Smith just by, and the Prisoner came up and leaned over the Rails, and then pursued away. I follow'd him to the Golden Lion in Fetter Lane and sent for our Porter; but when he came, the Prisoner was gone, and we were told that he was to come there again at three o'Clock. But understanding that he was gone to his Lodgings, I went thither, and his Landlady still denyed him. But at last a Man in the House said that he was there, and I said, that I had got a Warrant for him. So the Prisoner came down and push'd me from the Door, but he was soon secured - When he was carried before the Justice, he said, that he supp'd that Sunday Night in Salisbury Court, and that he had a black Suit of Clothes on. I went to the House in Salisbury Court and they told me there, that he went away from thence a little after nine o'Clock.</p>

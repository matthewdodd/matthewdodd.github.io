               <p>Q. How happened it that you did not go back for them on the first day? - Why, they did not come when I stayed, but I find they did come afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know why you that had prosecuted this man, went home and and did not go to the guards to know why he was not brought? - I thought they would not come at all, I thought no more.</p>
               <p>Q. And the next day, Moore and Harrison were both carried to Bow-street? - Yes, I went with them, I went to St. James's that time, I went with them, I went there because they were going on guard, and there we went to take them; it was Friday I believe that we took them.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was it they came to your house? - Sunday night, on Monday, Harrison was carried before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have been saying that it was the next day after that, that you took them from guard; now you recollect and say, it was Friday? - I am wrong, it was Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. From Monday till Friday, what did you do? - I did nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that? - Because I was informed they were to be on duty that day by some soldier, I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Moore and Harrison before they used the house? - I know them very well by sight, I knew one of their names, Moore, but I did not know the other</p>
               <p>Q. Then on Monday, when you was at the guard, did you tell the serjeant that Moore was the other man? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were they not taken? - The serjeant said, he would bring them both up to the office, he told me so, and Mr. Townsend was with me.</p>

            Whether they were both brought to the office or not you cannot tell? - They told me so at the office the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen your watch before? - I had my watch at the stroke of twelve, and pulled it out to shew them what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Q. I went to know why you waited till the Friday that they should be on duty, without going again and having them taken up? - I was very ignorant of the matter, I was told by some soldier that I should catch them, and he did not know how I should catch them before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had these men frequented your house before this? - I had not lived in the house but four days, I had seen them at another house that I kept, they knew that I knew them, I dare say, as for Harrison he never laid hold of me at all, because when the other three came about me he was sitting down, and I heard him say don't hurt the old man, and according to his voice, he was where they were before they laid hands on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there is any thing given if a man who is not a grenadier puts on a grenadier's cap? - They make it a forfeit among one another, I believe I have heard it said, it is a forfeit, but I never saw it done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Moore. Did you miss the watch as soon as we were gone? - I did.</p>

            Why was the reason you did not make a complaint to the officer of the guard? - I did.</p>

We went up to Bow-street, and Mr. Sellwood was gone, Mr. Sellwood never came to seek after us till Friday, when he came with the constable here, and I was in the ranks in St. James's, he pointed to the constable at me, and said that was one of the men, Mr. Townsend spoke to the colonel of the guard, and I was called out of the ranks, I went into the sutling house to the serjeant, and Harrison was on centry; when he was off centry we all went up to Bow-street, where he said, he did not think we knew any thing about it, but we knew the men that had done it, we were committed down to Tothill-fields, and came up for examination on Tuesday following, Mr. Sellwood said then we were innocent of the affair, and wanted us to be discharged, and Mr. Addington committed us down to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harrison. He has been saying it was twelve o'clock when we went away, we were in the guard room by half after eleven; I went in first and had two pints of beer before this man came in, when I came back again, and we had one pot of beer first, and the other after, and we left these men behind us, the men I never saw in my life before; when I heard he had missed his watch in the morning, I went there to Mr. Sellwood, and he said he would give me any thing if I would go and find the two men, I asked him what I had to pay, I had had a pint of beer, and a roll and butter, and he said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Please you, my lord, Harrison, is as innocent as a baby of robbing me; but I never said so of Moore.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called two serjeants to their characters, who said they were honest men and good soldiers; and in the guard room that night by eleven at farthest.</p>
               <p>Court to Sellwood. I would wish to know of you, whether Harrison and the two men came in as one company, or whether they came in one after another? - They came in very nigh together, but Moore he came in after, he was the last, they all joined in one company, I understood them all to come in as one company, they never called for beer separate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider it as a joke, putting on the cap? - I thought they had done it for that; I resisted it at the first time, they did not get it done.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose cap was it? - It was Moore's cap, it was taken off Moore's head before, it was then on the table; it was one of the men in coloured clothes, that ran after me the first time to put it on my head.</p>

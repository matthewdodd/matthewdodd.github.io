                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty about far o'clock in the morning of the 31st of March—I saw the prisoner pass<lb></lb>ing—I sent Watson after him—after he was stopped I asked him where he brought the candles from—he said he had got them at Mr. Arm<lb></lb>strong's, he had just left work, and was going home with them—I asked him who gave them to him—he said, "Michael"—I asked if Mr. Armstrong was aware of it—he said he was not—I asked him if he had paid for them—he said no, he had not, he should pay for them when Mr. Armstrong settled with him, as he had done before; that Mr. Armstrong owed him some money—I took him and the candles to the station—I found two packets of candles wrapped up in his pockets, some in cloths, and some in paper—altogether there was about 131bs. weight of candles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Robert Armstrong, a tallow-chandler, in Gray's-inn-lane. I saw the prisoner last at eleven o'clock at night, on the 30th of March, in the workshop—he was employed there as a candle-maker—I left him there at eleven—on the 31st some candles were brought by the policeman—I bad no dealings with the prisoner about any candles—he said nothing to me about any candles—he had had candles before—he always had them strung by pounds—they were either entered in the book, or paid for,' at the time he had them—no one was at work in the candle-warehouse but I and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. I suppose it was the watch you wore? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe there had been a bell-hanger in the room, had there not? - Yes, the same day that I put the watch in the trunk, and there was no lock on the box; he was there all the fore-part of the day.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner a servant? - She was, a servant of the gentleman of the house, Mr. Davis.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came up stairs, it was on Monday week, it was after twelve.</p>
               <p>Court to Miss Comber. At what time did you see it? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Pate. She opened the trunk case directly, and took the watch case out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she was there? - She took out the case to shew me, she held it up in her hand, and asked me is it was not very handsome? I said yes, she then said, here is a very handsome pair of golden-rings! I begged of her not to pull them out, and to put the watch in again, she then stooped down and took hold of some clothes that were there, and said, are these not handsome clothes? I said, for God's sake shut it down, she then shut it down, and she then went and stooped, and put something in her pocket, but I cannot tell your Lordship what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing there at this time? - I was there to clean the room, and the trunks were moved out of one room into the other room; as soon as ever she shewed it me, by her desire the door where the trunk was, was latched, by herself, or somebody else. I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You desired her to put this watch back again, and she put it back again? - I did not see her put it back, I see her shut the trunk, but I never see put the watch in.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in a box with the lid open? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The washerwoman used to come to the house to wash? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never found the watch since? - No, I never see it before nor since, and if I was to see it now I could not swear to it.</p>

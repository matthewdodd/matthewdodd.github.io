The prisoner was in my service, and received money for me. On Saturday, the 24th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I sent Mr. Pearson (who I had employed as a carpenter) to purchase some goods with two half-crowns and three shillings, which I had previously marked.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I received some money of Mr. Kirby - I went to the shop and bought six pairs of stockings, at 1s. 4d. per pair - I gave the same money to the prisoner that I had received from Mr. Kirby- he asked me if I wanted any thing, and I said some stockings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you want these stockings for your own wear? A. Yes, and I bought them for myself, six pair at 1s. 4d. per pair - I did not give Mr. Kirby 8s.; I received his 8s. on account - I paid the same money to the prisoner - this was about half-past nine o'clock - I took the stockings home for my own use.</p>
               <p>MR. KIRBY re-examined. After the stockings had been purchased I told the prisoner that I had been daily robbed, and I thought he was the person; I accused him of having property about him - he denied it; I said, "You can have no objection to being searched;" he said No, not at all; he then drew the two half-crowns and three shillings, with my mark upon them, from one pocket, and five shillings from the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You asked him if he had any property? A. Yes, any property of mine. I have three young men in my shop who act as cashiers, and receive money from the others, but the regu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050057"></xptr>lar cashier was gone to his supper. It was the prisoner's duty to give this money to one of those cashiers directly he received it - about ten or fifteen minutes had elapsed before I spoke to him about it. The prisoner immediately put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out the money; I do not know whether it was all he had; I went to search his boxes afterwards, but could not find any thing which I could venture to swear to.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Kirby's service. Mr. Kirby deputed me to take money in the absence of the cashier. I was in the shop; Mr. Pearson came in; the prisoner should have called out "Cashier!" as soon as he received the money, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have not some of your young men objected to act as cashiers? A. There is one young man who has objected to act as such, in the absence of the cashier; the cashier had been gone to supper three or four minutes; I expected him to return after his supper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might not the prisoner have called out Cashier! and you not have heard him? A. No. There was no person in the shop but Mr. Pearson and myself.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I was sent for, and found the prisoner in the front room up-stairs; Mr. Kirby said he suspected he had robbed him. These are the two half-crowns and the three shillings which I saw there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner's box searched? A. Yes; he gave up the key, but there was nothing that Mr. Kirby would swear to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Pearson called me, and said he wished to purchase half-a-dozen pairs of brown cotton stockings, at about 1s. 4d. per pair, and he said, "I will pay you for them, because we have had some words about having things set down to me;" I took the money, and put it behind me; I then tied up the stockings, and put them in the window - I thought it was rather strange that he should pay for them, when he had had a piece of linen without paying for a day or two before; while I was thinking of that Mr. Kirby came in, and said, "I want to search you;" "Very well, Sir," I said - he then took the money which I gave from my pocket, and went out of the shop into the parlour; he staid there some time, and then came out, and said that was his money; he said, "You rascal, I will hang you if I can;" our regular cashier was at that time out of the way, and I have frequently called out to the other young men to take money, and they have all objected to take it; when Mr. Kirby has been in the shop I have called out cash, and he has said, "Take it yourself."</p>

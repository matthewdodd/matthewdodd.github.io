               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you a friend of the boys? A. I never saw them; we had been drinking - the shove appeared an effort of the prisoner to extricate himself from the deceased; nobody else was present.</p>

            . This scnffle happened right under my window; I was in my room, up one pair of stairs - the gas-light is right over my door; I could plainly see what passed - I did not see the beginning of it; I heard a man fall, and heard the deceased tell somebody to go for an officer - I opened my window, and saw the deceased on the ground; there were two person there besides the prisoner - I saw three persons beating the deceased very much indeed, as he lay on the ground; there were two besides the prisoner, and all three were striking the deceased with their hands, and kicked him while on the ground - by that time some neighbours came out; they stamped on his legs, and then a black and a white man, who came by, picked him up, and took him home - all three struck him.</p>
               <p>Q.Your deposition before the Coroner states that two were kicking him, and a third man stood by, but did not strike? A.All three struck him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The neighbours came out and saw this? A. Yes, two or three of them; I cannot say that all three persons kicked him - I saw one stamp on his legs, and all three might kick him; all three struck him four men carried him home; the Policeman came up when it was all over - the prisoner was there then, but the other two ran off as soon as they saw the Policeman,</p>
               <p>ANN BOND. I live near this place. I was at my stall, about three doors from the gas-light over Coombs' door- I saw the decesed and King coming up arm-in-arm, and a boy behind them; the prisoner and another man was coming down the other way, and met them - the deceased said to one of them, "How came you to strike the boy?" and what few words happened I do not know - one of the men said it was no business of his; I did not hear all that passed - I was four or five yards from them- I saw the prisoner strike the deceased; I did not see the deceased strike - they both fell; I saw nobody jump on the deceased, nor kick him - I did not see him taken away; I saw the prisoner and his companion run down the street, and as they passed me I heard a bad expression, but cannot say who it was from; the prisoner said to his companion, "Oh, old chap, you are done - you are* * * like dolly."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say this instant you could not say which of them used the expression? A. Yes, I did say so at first, but Cannon was the last man who spoke, and it was him - I am quite sure the prisoner went away leaving the deceased on the ground; King went away when the blow was given - I did not see the deceased strike, nor take hold of the prisoner; I left the deceased laying there, and came to my stall - the prisoner was there when the Policeman came up; he had come back.</p>

I was at my door, about twenty yards from the spot; I walked towards them, and just before I got up I saw the prisoner knock the other man down, but I did not force myself very forward; I stood a little distance off, the prisoner and his companion ran by me - they returned; I went and told the Policeman, and saw no more.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was fetched, and saw the prisoner looking for his hat; the deceased was standing against a house - twenty persons or more were assembled; I said to the prisoner, "You appear to have been ill-using this man;" he said he had not, that he had had a fight; the deceased said he had ill-used him - the prisoner denied it, and asked the by-standers if they had seen him - they all said it was a fight, and the deceased had given the first offence; I thought the deceased sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not take the prisoner into custody? A. No, because I understood it to be an affray, which often takes place in that neighbourhood, and he was not given in charge; I saw the deceased go towards home - he walked with assistance, and the prisoner and one Cope went down Union-street; I do not know him.</p>

            . I am a pupil of the London-hospital. The deceased was brought there on Thursday, the 15th of September, about twelve o'clock in the day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200031"></xptr>for an injury in the ancle, in a quarrel with another man; on examination I found a large bone of the ancle joint broken - it was much inflamed and swollen; he became delirious on Friday night, and continued so at times till his death, on Monday, the 19th; the bone was set in the first instance, and during his delirium he kicked his leg about so as to force the bone through the skin; it became a compound fracture, and mortification came on - his death was caused by delirium, occasioned by the fracture- he had two black eyes, which he might have got in fighting; as he became delirious it would have been improper to take off the leg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not his walking on the leg tend to inflame it? A. Certainly; the mortification was very recent, and had not time to cause death; he died about twenty-four hours after it became a compound fracture - we were obliged to confine him in a straight waistcoat; it is not uncommon for severe delirium to take place in cases of fracture, with persons who drink much - when he first entered he had a tremulous motion in the eye, and I suspected delirium would take place.</p>

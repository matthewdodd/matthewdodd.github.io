                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Prussian Eagle, in Ship Alley—on the night of 17th January last I was in front of the bar about eleven o'clock, and saw a coloured man standing before the bar—he was talking to a shipmate of the prisoner's and seemed rather quarrelsome—he had a knife in one hand and a pipe in the other—I took the knife from him and put it behind the bar—he was the worse for liquor—I then went up stairs and saw no more.</p>

I keep a refreshment house in Ship Alley, Wellclose Square—between eleven and twelve on the evening of 17th January I was in front of the bar at the Prussian Eagle—there were ten or twelve persons there—I did not see the prisoner there at first; I saw the deceased there; he was the worse for liquor—I saw him and a Dutchman having a row, jangling words—my back was towards them for a time, and when I turned round I saw the prisoner strike the deceased with his fist in the</p>

               <p>face—the deceased then took hold of the prisoner and tore his coat—the prisoner then put his hand to his side, and made an attempt to draw something—I did not see anything—I put my hand on his shoulder, and told him not to do that there, it was not allowed—I believe the prisoner and deceased were put outside almost directly after—the prisoner was outside the door first, but they were both out nearly together; I think they were touching when they were going out at the door—I followed them and stood on the step of the door, with my back against the door—I saw the deceased strike the prisoner in the face with his fist—it stag<lb></lb>gered the prisoner a bit—he reeled back about three yards—as soon as he recovered himself he walked up to the deceased, put his hand to his side, pulled out a dagger, and put it into his belly—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the dagger—the prisoner ran away directly—I ran after him, and as he ran I saw him throw the dagger away over the railings in Well close Square—I continued running after him, but my shoe burst and I fell down—I afterwards met sergeant Barnes, and went with him to the spot where I had seen the prisoner throw the dagger, and we then found this instrument—it was about four yards inside the railings, sticking point downwards in the ground—the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The Prussian Eagle is situated in an alley, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Ship Alley—it is a long narrow passage; the public-house is at the top, which leads into Well close Square—when the men were turned out they were in Ship Alley; they would not have more than ten or twelve yards to go to get into Well close Square—I was before the bar when the wrangling first commenced between the deceased and the Dutchman—I did not see the prisoner at that time; I was merely there casually—the persons in front of the bar were seafaring men; some were foreigners—a great many foreigners use the place—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner come down stairs—I first saw him on turning round when I heard the rowing between the deceased and a man in a brown coat, whom I took to be a shipmate of the prisoner; he was a foreign sailor—that is not the man I call the Dutchman—I had not seen the deceased strike the prisoner, the first I saw was the prisoner strike him—from that time till he ran the knife into the man about two minutes elapsed—when he was struck outside by the deceased he rolled up against some shutters—the deceased was not a very powerful man; he was shorter, but rather stouter, than the prisoner—when I saw the prisoner in the house his face was not bleeding; afterwards he was bleeding from the eye—I should say that was most likely done by the blow from the deceased's fist—I did not notice whether he wore a ring—I did not see any knife in his hand then—I had seen the knife taken from his hand, and put behind the bar—that was five or six minutes previously.</p>

I am a grocer, 39, Wellclose Square—my house is about eleven yards from the Prussian Eagle—on the night of the 17th January, about eleven o'clock, I saw the deceased and the prisoner come out of the Prussian Eagle together—I saw the black man (the deceased) strike the prisoner a rather severe blow, it nearly knocked him down; indeed, he would have fallen if it had not been for the shutters behind him—when he recovered himself ho put his hand to his side—I could not see anything that he drew from his side, but he took his hand from there and struck the deceased in the belly—the deceased hallooed out as a person would who was hurt severely, doubled himself up, and fell down—the prisoner ran away—scarcely a quarter of a minute elapsed from the</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the London Hospital when the deceased John Henville was admitted, about half-past eleven on the night of the 17th January—I examined him and found a wound in his left side about two or three inches below the ribs—it was about two inches long, and from it protruded a large amount of intestine—on examination I found four wounds in the intestine—there was only one wound externally, but it went through two layers of intestine—there was a large amount of blood in the cavity of the abdomen—he was in a state of syncope, very low and depressed—he died in about thirteen or fourteen hours—he made a deposition before a Magistrate before he died—he was then very low, certainly too ill to be able to recover—he was aware of that fact—this dagger would produce such a wound—he died of that wound—I was present when he signed his deposition, and saw him sign it. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of John Henville was put in and read, as follows</hi>:—" I belong to the <hi rend="italic">Punjab</hi>—I was among the foreigners—I ran down stairs with my guts in my hand when the fellow stabbed me—I did not surely know who he was before—it was in Ship Alley—my shipmates had left—I was rather stupid with drink, and the stupid foreigner poked the knife into me through revenge—I did not know who he was.")

                  </hi>. I am groom and valet to Mr. Lawrence, and live at his stables, in Oxford-street. About five o'clock on Thursday morning, the 25th of July, I was going into the country with two horses—I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to go to the stables—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man drove some distance, then the prisoner and Mr. Shaw got up and rode with the driver—I went to sleep, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man and the other two went into the Marquis of Anglesea public-house, at the corner of William-street, Devonshire-street—when I awoke I got out, and went into the public-house—I met Shaw at the door—he asked if that watch-key, which he had in his hand, belonged to me—I had a watch-key when I went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I looked to see if my money was safe, and it was gone—the others heard Shaw ask if it was my key—I sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge—I had been fast asleep till I got to the Marquis of Anglesea—I had never seen the prisoner before—I felt some one where my watch was, and that awoke me—I cannot tell who it was—this is the key—I cannot swear to it—they found 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the prisoner—I cannot swear to any of them.</p>

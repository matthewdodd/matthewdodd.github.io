               <p>ROBERT BRAXTON. On the 28th of March I was in <placeName id="t18280410-149-crimeloc805">Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me behind you? A. No; he was just opposite me, on my right hand - the handkerchief was partly out of his pocket; I know the handkerchief by the hemming of it - my name is not on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is a handkerchief, which came off the same piece, (producing it) and they are both mine.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge - I searched him, and found another handkerchief on him; he said they were both his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can prove both of these are mine - I told the Magistrate there was no mark on it.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister - I hemmed this handkerchief; there are two hems, one on the right side and the other on the wrong. I have not seen it since this charge, (looking at it) here are the bems as I stated - I did it about seven months ago; the one my brother has produced, is the same pattern; but not off the same piece. I know the pattern as well as the work.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BRAXTON re-examined. I had my handkerchief safe in my right hand coat-pocket, just before the prisoner was putting it into his pocket - the prisoner did tell the Magistrate that there was no mark on it: he had not seen it then. I have nobody here who hemmed it - I came from Gloucestershire. I said, myself, that it was not marked before the Magistrate; I know it by the hem being uneven - I would not have it cut even; it is hemmed in the border in some places.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 728). On the evening of 23rd November, I was on duty in Pudding Lane, and saw the prisoner take a parcel from a van standing there, and put it into another empty van—another person was with him—I went up to the van, and, as soon as they saw me, one of them escaped—I asked the prisoner what he had got?—he said he did not know—I found the parcel contained loaf sugar and moist.</p>

No; the other man was covering you with his coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Curtis &amp; Co.—on the 24th November, I was in Arthur Street, with a trap, from which I missed this parcel—I had seen it safe at 5.55.</p>

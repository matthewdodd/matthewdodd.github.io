               <p>Had any body else been into the the toll house, after you had put down the money? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had you fallen asleep? - I do not know, I believe I had not.</p>
               <p>Can you say positively you had not? - No, I would not say positively.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot swear that nobody else came in? - No, I cannot, as the door was open, I knew the prisoner before, by going through the gate most days.</p>
               <p>Alderman Sanderson. Were there sixpences found upon him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many? - Four.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. It is usual for you to lay several hours on this couch? - It is for that purpose.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear to money; there is one with a hole in it, very much like one that I took; but I take more of that sort.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the affair; I had been out with my goods that day, and coming home I got rather drunk, and I did not know what I was about; I came to the turnpike gate, and I asked the man to let me leave these baskets there; I knew nothing of the money being in my shoe; I was in liquor; I took several shillings that day, and sixpences too.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

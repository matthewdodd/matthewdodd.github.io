                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 22, Broad-street, Lambeth. The prisoner lodged in the same house on 18th Sept.—on Saturday night, 18th Sept., between 8 and 9 o'clock, the prisoner went out, and his wife followed him out directly—soon after that he returned, went upstairs, and I heard him say, "The door is locked"—I believe he had some coals with him; I heard him putting them down on the landing—as he was returning downstairs the street door opened; I heard his wife's voice saying, "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, is that you?"—he said, "Yes"—she went upstairs—the staircase was dark—while she was unlocking the door, he said, "Why did not you leave the door unlocked?"—she said, in a joking or laughing manner, "What a pity!"—shortly after that they went out together—they were gone about three quarters of an hour, or an hour, which brought it to between 9 and 10—they then came in, went upstairs, and began quarrelling in their own room—I heard the woman call the man a b—y thief, and he said, "You are a b—y wh—"—after that I heard the woman come down, and go out alone—she was out till a few minutes after 12—she went up to her room on her return—in my opinion she was greatly intoxicated—I then heard bad words in their room, which is directly over mine, and then heard a very heavy fall in their room—it is my firm opinion that the prisoner was sober—I heard no screaming after the fall, but heard the man putting on his shoes a few minutes afterwards, and after that he came downstairs—I should say it was dark on the stairs—when he was at the bottom of the stairs, or nearly so, he said, "Halloo, who is this?"—no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250070"></xptr>
               <p>one answered him—(my room is not on the ground floor; he was on the landing, by my room)—he said again, "Who is here?" or, "Who the devil is here?" or words to that effect—he went upstairs again, struck a light, came down again, and said, "Oh, it is you, is it?"—I was in bed—I had not heard anybody come downstairs but himself from the time the woman went up—the words "It is you" were not addressed to me, but to somebody on the stairs—he then called out to me, "Mitchell, are you awake?"—I did not answer him the first time, and he called out again, "Mitchell, are you awake?"—I said, "Yes; what is the matter?"—he said, "My old woman don't appear to have any strength in her limbs"—I said, "Nonsense," or something to that effect—I got out of bed, put my trowsers on, opened my door, and saw the prisoner supporting his wife, with her head over his right arm, and her feet towards my door—I said, "Let us get her upstairs"—I took the candle, and the woman's legs; he took the other part of the body—there is a turn in the staircase, about five or six stairs up; and while he was turning round with the upper portion of the body, I caught a sight of the face, and said, "Good God Almighty, the woman has got no breath in her body!"—I went down stairs, got a drop of cold water, and poured it into her mouth, but it would not go down her throat—from the time I heard the fall down to the time I came out to assist, if she had come down stairs herself, or had fallen downstairs, I should have heard it—I had not been asleep at all—if she had been carried downstairs when he came down, I could not distin<lb></lb>guish it from his coming down—I afterwards found she was dead—she was the woman I call his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I knocked at the man's door, and asked him to lend me a hand upstairs with my wife; I did not know she was there till I came down.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you were not asleep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I went to bed about 11; I had been in bed nearly an hour—I did not answer the first time he spoke to me, because they have been in the habit of quarrelling, and I did not like to interfere—it is a small house—there are only three rooms on each floor—there is a landing on each floor—the landing opposite the prisoner's door is over the staircase, not over my bedroom—I should say a noise on the landing would not appear to sound over my room—I can decidedly say that the fall was in the room—I can say that, by having heard falls when they have been in liquor before, and from the sound of that I draw my calculations that the fall must have been in the room—I did not hear anything like a stumble when he said, "Halloo, what is here?" only a sort of a stop, like a man kicking against something—I am married—my wife was with me in bed—I believe we both agree as to where the noise of the fall was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I knew Mrs. Perry—I saw her go up stairs on Saturday night, 18th September, at a few minutes past 12 o'clock, very much intoxicated—I was following her up the stairs, up to my own door—I heard her go into her own room—I am positive she went in; and then I heard quarrelling and very bad language</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250071"></xptr>
               <p>from both of them, but I did not take notice of it, because I am so used to it—I closed my door just as he called her a b—y w—e—I am positive she was not in bed, but I think he was by the voice—she said, "What did you call me?"—"A b—y w—e," said he, "and worse than a w—e for if I had picked up with a w—e in the street, she could only have taken my money, and left me in the street"—the <hi rend="italic">retally</hi> was, "You are a b—y thief," she repeated that three times, and with that I heard her make a dart, as I supposed, from the fireplace towards the door—she used generally to sit by the fireplace; and with the words "b—y thief," came the heavy fall over our bedroom door—I have known her during the three years which they have lived there—I supposed it was Mr. Perry that fell, because I have heard him fall repeatedly when he was in liquor, and he falls very heavily—the fall sounded to me exactly over the door, in the room—I have not said, to my knowledge, that I thought the deceased was on the landing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "I heard a fall, and thought it was the prisoner; and I thought the deceased was on the landing," that is what you told the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my knowledge—there was only one fall, and that was in the room—after the fall, I heard the woman say, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, I can't," or, "shan't nurse you;" and from that minute there was a deadly shocking silence—I could not tell who it was that fell, but I thought, by the heaviness of the fall, that it was the man that fell, until I saw the body in the morning, and saw the bruised state of the body—after the fall I heard the prisoner put on his shoes, and come downstairs—when he got towards our door, he appeared to be fumbling or kicking against something, and said, "Who are you?"—I then heard him go upstairs, and heard him strike a match over the fireplace—he brought a light down with him, and complained to her about his being out all the week, and she spending his money—he appeared to be picking her up, and called to my husband, and said, "Mitchell!" but Mitchell did not answer him—he called again, "Mitchell, are you awake?" Mitchell said, "What is the matter, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>?"—he said, "Will you get up, for I think my old woman has not got any use in her limbs"—I did not see her, for I was blindfolded; I had a poultice over my eyes; and I went up<lb></lb>stairs naked as I was—when the deceased was tipsy, and had dropped off to sleep, she would tumble down, chair and all; we have often heard her tumble down, but not latterly, as she has been very hard at work lately—I cannot say how long it was between the time of the fall and my husband being called up, because the whole occurrence took place in a short time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your deposition read over to you before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I believe it was; I put my mark to it—(<hi rend="italic">The deposition being read stated</hi>: "At that moment I thought the deceased was on the landing")—I do not recollect that I said that; I have no idea of it—whether she was on the landing or not, I am positive the fall was in the room; and I am positive she never came downstairs—I cannot say whose the words, "I cannot," or, "I shall not be your nurse," were, because it was in a stifled voice, a kind of half voice—they were the last words before the man came downstairs, but who it was came downstairs, I cannot say.</p>

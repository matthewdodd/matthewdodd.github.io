I formerly lived at 243, City Road—I am a pawnbroker, out of business—on 22nd March, about 12.5, I got out of a cab to go home—I settled with the cabman, and just buttoned my coat up—I had a watch and chain in my waistcoat pocket, and my scarf pin in my scarf—I had just started on my way home when I received a blow on the nose which knocked me down, and I fell on my head, and became almost senseless—a crowd of young fellows got on top of me, and endeavoured to pull my coat off—they nearly broke my finger with trying to get my diamond ring off—I had just pulled my glove off—when I got up the parties said "Have you lost anything?"—I said "It is gone!"—I did not miss the watch and chain</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, Sidney Street, and am a trimming maker—on 22nd March, Saturday night, I was in the City Road, about 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and five or six more there—I saw the prosecutor also—they were at the back of him—they surrounded him, and the prisoner rushed into him, and knocked him down with his right shoulder—he fell, and one not in custody snatched his watch and ran down Nelson Street.</p>

             a Scrivener, (who was tried last Sessions on the same Account.) He desired me to get Money for it. I told him I would try. It was then indors'd,

            . I enquir'd who Morris was, and Northall answer'd, that Morris was a Smith at the lower End of Broad-Street. Northall came several Times about it, and at last he said he was employ'd by Devenish (the Prisoner) to whom the Note belonged, and to whom I must pay the Money. After this, the Prisoner came himself, and said it was his Note, and that the Name at Bottom was his own Hand. I had directed the Note, that Morris was a Smith in Broad Street, and asked the Prisoner if that Direction was right, and he said it was. I then asked him if he dealt with Morris, and how he came to owe Morris such a considerable Sum. His answer was, that he himself was a Back-maker; that the Money was owing for Nails and other Things in the Back-making Trade, and that the Sum was not considerable for a Man of his Dealing. This Account I thought was natural enough; thereupon I told him I hoped to get it discounted in two or three Days. For this Purpose I applied to Mr. Conran, and he to Mr. Green a Jeweller, who offered to give Rose Diamonds at a Market Price for the Note, which I agreed to, because I deal in them my self - It's Part of my Business, as a Broker, to get Notes discounted. The Brokers don't usually enquire after the Indorsers; though it's what we ought to do, but we leave that to the Person who discounts the Notes - The Prisoner came five or six Times to see if I had done it - As to the Indorsement, there is not a Letter in Morris's Name that is like his Writing.</p>

            . Mr. Conran brought this Note to me to see if I would take it for Jewels. - My Glasier living near Morris's, I asked him if he knew Morris, and if he was a Man of Worth. He said he did not think he was worth Twenty Pounds; upon which I returned the Note. Mr. Conran came the next Day to know the Reason of it; I told him it was but a coined Note at best. We went to Morris and shew'd him the Note. He said the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173510150019"></xptr> Name was none of his Writing, and he wrote his Name before us, and it was not at all like the Indorsement.</p>

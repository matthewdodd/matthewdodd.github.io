                  </hi> I am a custom-house locker, doing duty in the sugar department, at the London Docks. On the 27th of July, four hogsheads of sugar were weighed—one of them was marked "No.7., I.P. M. S. G."—the weight of it was 16 cwt. 2 qrs. 21lbs.—I only took the weight on the part of the Crown.</p>

                  </hi> I am a grocer, and live at Lower Marsh-gate, Lambeth. On the 27th of July, I ordered some hogsheads of sugar to be fetched from the docks—one of them was marked "No.7., I.P.M.S.G."—Mr. Coles was or<lb></lb>dered to bring them—my porter Swaincott assisted him—they were delivered at ordered my house, and pitched up on end—I was engaged at the time they were delivered—I afterwards found the weight of that hogshead was 15 cwt. 3 qrs, 14 lbs.—that was 3 qrs. and 7 lbs. short, making 91 lbs. deficient—the others were the right weight—I saw the prisoner unload the hogsheads—they were covered and perfectly secured—there was a piece of iron nailed over the drawing hole—I examined them, and I am confident the one on this hogshead had been removed—my father is in partnership with me—the prisoner did not put any nose-bag on the horses, when he was unloading—it is mostly done.</p>

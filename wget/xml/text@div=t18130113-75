We lost this pork last Monday week, about a quarter before nine in the evening, I was sitting in the back parlour. I was alarmed with a great noise in the passage. I saw the prisoner, Archer, with the pork in his hand, as he lay on the ground, and the officer was there. I had left the pork in the window, hanging on a rail inside of the window where we hang the meat on. I sell offal, butter, and cheese, and now and then a bit of pork.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On Monday evening, I was going down Bethnal-green-road; I saw the prisoners, Archer and Wall, standing at the prosecutrix's window. I passed by them twice. I went about half a dozen doors further on. I stood in a door way. I saw the prisoner, Archer, ascend the steps, and go into the shop. He then brought out the half cheese. He gave it to Wall. Wall took the cheese, and went and secreted it in Harp-lane, Bethnal-green-road. Then Archer sung out, George. George would not answer until he had secreted the cheese. Archer came to the shop with Wall; he looked to see that the coast was clear. I saw Archer go up the steps again. He took a leg of pork out of the window. I ran over the way, and just as Archer was coming out, I knocked him down in the passage. Wall was outside at the time; he ran off. I took Archer to Bethnal-green watchhouse. On my return back to the prosecutrix's house, I saw Wall just coming out of Harp-lane. I went to him, and asked him where he was going. He said, home. I said, what have you got here. He said, nothing. He had the cheese in the handkerchief that had been round his neck. He said, he had picked up the cheese. I said, I thought so, I was looking for it. I took them before the magistrate the next day. Archer had been in the House of Correction for robbing the toll-gate of some halfpence.</p>

               <p>Archer said nothing in his defence.</p>

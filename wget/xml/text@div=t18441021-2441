                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No</hi>. 19.) I was employed in con<lb></lb>sequence of something I heard from Messrs. Parrott and Co., to watch their premises in Tenter-street, Moorfields. I went there for that purpose about seven o'clock, on the evening of Saturday, the 5th of Oct., with William Payne, the engineer, who was employed with me—I concealed myself—the business of the day ceased about that time, and the men went away—the prisoner was employed there as a sort of foreman, and looked after the pre<lb></lb>mises—after the engineer had left the premises the prisoner went out, and remained out about ten minutes, between eight and nine o'clock—when he went out he locked the door, which locked me into the warehouse—he was not aware that I was there—he returned in about ten minutes alone—he unlocked the door and came in—the gas was burning in the warehouse—I could see him come in at the door perfectly clear—he took a yard measure from under the table close by the door<lb></lb>way—he went up stairs, and I could hear him rolling about some cloth, or something soft—he remained there about half an hour, to the best of my knowledge—he then came down stairs with two bundles, one in a red handkerchief, and one in a blue one—he had the yard measure with him, and placed it under the table, where he took it from—he then took a Mackintosh cape from behind a post in the ware-house, and threw it upon his shoulders, took both bundles off the table and placed one under each arm, reached the key from behind the door, opened the door, and was going out—I rushed out, and gave the alarm of fire—the prisoner said, "I thought it would come to this"—I asked what he had got—he said, "I have got some canvas"—I said, "I shall take you for steal<lb></lb>ing this from the premises of your employer"—he said, "I took it that I might be transported for life"—I took him to the station—he admitted that he took it in hopes that he should get fourteen years of it—I went back to the warehouse, and went up stairs, and found four pieces of canvas rolled up in the same way as that in the two bundles that I took from him—they appeared to have been cut from bolts of canvas and rolled up, and there were four pieces and one bale of goods at a considerable distance from where the can<lb></lb>vas was kept—I allowed that to remain on the premises till I got the foreman, and then I marked the goods—these are the pieces of goods that I took from the prisoner—it is new canvas, and such as is used for packing—I went to the station the following day with the engineer—the engineer said to the pri<lb></lb>soner,</p>

               <p>"George, you had some more canvas packed up?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, I meant to take that too before I went home"—I searched him, and found 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some pence in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the clerk at Trinity Church, Tun-bridge Wells, Kent, in October—there is morning service thereon Wednesdays at 11 o'clock—on Wednesday morning, October 4th, in consequence of a communication I went to the church and found that two boxes had been removed from the wall and laid on the chairs on either side—the right hand box was forced open and empty—the left hand box was empty but not forced open—the box at the south door was open and empty, but not removed—the the box at the east door that was also empty but not removed—I went into the vestry and found this stick on the heathrug—I had not seen it before—a pane was broken in the vestry windows—I examined with the policeman the wall outside and under the vestry window—I found several scratches on the stones as if some hard instrument had been drawn across them—the wall was scratched—the boxes were all right the day before, but I cannot say if the vestry window was fastened outside.</p>

The pane was not broken—the window was ajar the day before—it was closed, not fastened, but just put to—it rather hangs, so that it would require a good blow from the outside to put it open—the glass would have to be broken to put it open, because there are two bars outside, and it would require a hard blow to open it; it opens inside—force would be required because the window is heavy.</p>

On 4th October, I went to Trinity Church, the vestry window was open, one pane of gloss was broken, about 3 inches in diameter—it was a lead frame—there were marks upon the wall under the window as if some persons had been trying to get in with nails in their boots—there were scratches on the stone—I never saw this stick until it was at the station—I went in search of the prisoners; I found Divall and charged him with breaking into Triuity Church; he said "I never broke in sir,</p>

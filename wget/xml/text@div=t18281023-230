On the 24th of September, there was a knock at the door; I went, and saw the prisoner there - he had the appearance of a gentleman; he gave a note into my hand, which was not sealed; I asked who he brought it from - he said from Mr. Oxley, or some such name; I said "I don't think this note is for me" - he said "If you open it you will see;" I took it up stairs, but did not stop hardly a minute - I came down again, and missed a travelling pelisse, a box-coat, and an umbrella, from the passage - the door was wide open, and the prisoner gone; the value of the articles was at least 9l. - one of them was quite new and had not been worn above once or twice in the chaise; I was much alarmed - I went out, and a woman asked me if I had lost any thing, and I told her - I have never got them again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time was it? A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - it was quite a moon-light night; I had not a light; I stated at the office that the person had light trousers, and a blue coat buttoned quite close.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure he is the man? A. Yes - I am quite positive I saw him at the door - I stood talking with him I suppose about five minutes, I had no light, but it was quite light - I could see to read at the door; it was a beautiful night - the 24th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the woman say to you? A. She asked if I had lost a coat; I said I had two; I saw her at Hatton-garden, but she is not here; her name is Shanks - she is the prisoner's mother-in-law, as she stated; this is the note the prisoner brought.</p>

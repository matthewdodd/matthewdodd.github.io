I came to the corner of the New Compter, and I saw this man, and another, and two women standing, and a coach coming by, as soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160089"></xptr>as soon as ever I came up, he turned about made a very bad expression, and said, who was I? and knocked me down directely, cut both my lips, and grazed both my cheek bones; it was not the prisoner at the bar, another man that was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he knock you down with? - With his fist of his left hand, I called out to the watchman, and he sprung his rattle directly. The prisoner he did something to the watchman; he seemed to be some where near the watchman, what he did I don't know, he had a hat box in his hand and off he ran. We closely pursued him, and he had his pistol in his right hand, and he said d-n your eyes keep off, or else I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he present the pistol to you? - Yes he did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did he present it to you? - We were pursuing him, knowing him to be in company with the man that knocked me down, and seeing him with a pistol we pursued him. We followed him as far as the Grey-friars and there we got to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - Yes I did, but others see him and told me of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were did you find him? - Behind the corner of a dust bin, lying on his face, the pistol was found about twenty yards from him, between some casks that had some dry goods in them, something like some old sugar casks.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man and women? - I did not see. The prisoner he said nothing, only what he said when he presented the pistol to me. The man that knocked me down had an oil skin hat on.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - A watchman at the corner of Newgate. The prisoner is the young man that the prosecutor gave me charge of, the other man got off. The prosecutor, Williams, was behind this young man and the other, and one of them turned about and knocked down the prosecutor. He immediately called out, watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two men were in company? - Yes, and two women besides.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before Williams came up? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they in company with the women? - I am not sure the women were at the side of them, but whether in company I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you say that the two men were in company with each other? - I did not see there were any but these two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them speak to each other? - No, I did not; the prisoner got up, and he that knocked him down got off; I see him turn about and go, the prosecutor immediately gave me charge of the prisoner, and before I took charge of him, he gave me a blow and knocked me down, and I recovered, and got after him into Grey-friars, where he got over the rails, and got into a dust hole in Greyfriars, Newgate-street: how he got over the rails I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he taken? - In about two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner was the man that knocked you down? - Yes, he was the man that knocked me down; there was nobody there but myself and him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. But you lost sight of him after that? - I did, so far as this, I was very close to him, and kept all the way up to him till he came up to Grey-friars.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no thoroughfare there? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did he get over the rails? - I cannot tell; there was a cart going down at the time, I could not pass the cart till the cart came down.</p>

               <p>Q. Rather close or open? - Close, there is a door way at the railing, what let the patrol in.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is a palisade close to the door, and they must get over to get in.</p>

               <p>I am an Exchange-broker. On the 7th of March, as I was crossing Newgate-street, between the hours of eleven and twelve in the evening, I observed a man coming across towards me, and another man was coming up and presented a pistol to him, he presented a pistol to him, and he said some words. I don't know what; he made off up Newgate street some few minutes after, and I believe it to be the same man at the bar; the other man then came up, and at the same time he presented a pistol to Williams: he was coming up from behind the dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. The first man you see was Williams, was he followed by, or was he following any body? - Williams was going down the Old Bailey this side, and there was some dirt, and it was by the lamps that that man presented the pistol to him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Williams. Can you explain this? - I ran round the dirt, and I turned about from the other, and met him the other way, and when I came up to him pretty near, he did as I related before. I heard him utter some words, but what I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming along the same time, I was coming along with two women, there was no man at all with me; I never clapped my eyes on Williams till he cut me with a cutlass; I have the cut on my hat at this time, this watchman came to me, and I cannot say whether I did not knock him down or no.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with a pistol at that time? - I had no pistol on me at that time nor any other in my life.</p>
               <p>Williams. I was never nearer the man than seven yards: when we found him there was on his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you cut him there? - No, I never was near him.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are sure it was a pistol? - I am, I have got it in my pocket at this time; it was as light as it is now; it was about the full of the moon; says he, keep off or I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loaded? - Yes, It was, I let it off, there were two pistols, one found on him, and the other found between some casks near where the prisoner I did; a young man found that, and said, here it is. (Produces the pistol that was found on him.)</p>
               <p>Jury. You found one pistol on him that was charged, and you let it off? - Yes, it was, and I let it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not shew the other pistol? - The other witness has it.</p>
               <p>-WILLET sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the pistol that you have now? - Between the casks, about twenty yards from where the prisoner laid.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a patrol; I heard a rattle, and saw a mob of people in Newgate-street, against the corner of Giltspur-street, they turned into Greyfriars; the prisoner had got over some pales with some sharp pikes to them, he got inside there; I tried to get over, and I could not get over; I said, throw me over. I was thrown over; I took him and searched him, he had a knife and nine halfpence in his pocket; I took him over to the Compter, he said, he would wish to speak to me in the morning, he said say that I was drunk and asleep. The pistol I have was not taken from him, it was taken an hour and a quarter after, near the place where he was; I took it myself behind<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160091"></xptr>a couple of oil casks within four yards from where we took him, the pistol I have; I took the powder out.

               <p>I am a patrol, belonging to St. Sepulchre's parish. On the 7th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock on Saturday night. I and my partner, two of us were left in the watch-house, and we heard the rattle spring, and we ran out directly, and there was a cry of stop thief, and we see the watchmen run, and we ran after them, and when we came there, at the Grev-siyars, they said is the man here? there was no thoroughfare to go through; we see him by the watchman's lanthorn there, he was laying down, my partner and me when we got the gate open, we got him into custody and brought him to the watch-house, the pistols were fired off by the prosecutor; there were two pistols, one was brought into the watch house with him, and my fellow servant went out about an hour afterwards, and found another, and they seemed to be fellows.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Willet. Did you see any thing of this kind in my possession? - I did not, you had three halfpence and a knife; you made no resistance; I said, come along with me, or I will out you down, if you was my own brother I would say the same. I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>HUGHES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a printer; I was constable of the night, the only thing I know about it, is the man being brought to the watch-house, and soon after one of the patrols went out and found a pistol, which I have.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in company with two women, there was no men in company with me, I never clapped my eyes on fire arms till he cut me, and he said that is the man, whether I struck or no I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. You was speaking that the prisoner had a hat box; had he that hat box when he was taken? - No, he threw the hat box down, and made off immediately; whether it was empty or no I cannot tell. The watchman had some bustle with him, but what I cannot say, whether he touched him or no, or knocked him down I cannot say. I did not see the prisoner at the time; the other man knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the hat box? - I don't know, I was so bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any cutlass? - I had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is the cut on my hat now.</p>
               <p>Williams. That was there when he was taken</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any body that knows what was in the hat box?</p>
               <p>Willet. I understand from a man that there was some stolen property in the hat box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no hat box.</p>
               <p>To his character the prisoner called Mrs. Miller, who said he was a printer, and lodged in Noble-street, Goswell-street.</p>

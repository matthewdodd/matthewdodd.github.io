                  </hi>. I am a tailor at 5, Cross Court—these scissors (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I believe belong to the witness McCarthy—I have seen some coats which were produced at the Police Court and which I identified as my property—I had seen them on Friday, 18th September—I locked the door and bolted it at 10.30 that evening and the property was Tall safe then—the shutters were up and all was secure—about 4.30 the next morning,. I received information and went to Cross Court to my workshops, and found a hole had been cut in the partition inside the house large enough to admit a man—the door of the passage into the shop was opened and the lock had been forced—the back window of the workshop and the shutters were open they had been closed the night before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 126). I was on duty on 18th September in "West Street, about five yards from Mr. Gould's door—about three o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner come out of the side door of 5, Cross Court—I saw another man inside the window as I passed—I gave an alarm and went after the prisoner as he was making off—I brought him back—I said "You have just come out of No. 5, Cross Court, and you will have to go back with me till I see whether it is all right"—I took him back to the house and there I found a quantity of coats; trousers, and waistcoats in the pas-sage ready for removal laid up loose in the corner—they were afterwards pro<lb></lb>duced at the Police Court and identified by the prosecutor—I took the prisoner to the station and found this pair of scissors in his inside breast pocket—I examined the premises and found a part of the partition inside the house cut away and the lock forced open—an inside door leading from the back shop into the front had been tried and this piece of screwdriver was between the lock and the door, broken off—the screwdriver was on the floor—the back window and the shutters were open, so that anyone could <hi rend="italic">get</hi> in that way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was through the open window and shutter that I saw the man inside the house—that was after I saw the prisoner leave—I. have always said that I saw the prisoner come out at the door—there are lamps there; there is one at the. corner of the court—the court is not above 10 or 15 yards long, and there is a lamp at each end—when I took the prisoner he was going away from his home—he lives at No. 3, next door but one to the prosecutor—he is a tailor, but he has had not regular employment lately—I had just stopped at the court and while I was standing there he came out.</p>

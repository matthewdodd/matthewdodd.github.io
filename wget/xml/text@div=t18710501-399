                  </hi>. I keep the Railway Tavern, Hornsey—on the morning of 15th April, about 6.45, the prisoner came to my house—he was the first person I let in—I then went round the counter, and he asked me for a half-pint of beer, which I gave him, and he sat down—I knew he had been there previously, and I went about my business—after I had been there half an hour I said "You were here yesterday, have you seen the gentleman you were waiting for?"—after some conversation he stood at the counter, and kept his eye on me, watching me about—one or two customers came in, and I turned the key, and went backwards and forwards into the other room—near 8 o'clock I went into the room, and stooped down, putting two or three bits of wood under the kettle—the prisoner was watch<lb></lb>ing me, I suppose, for he came gently behind me, and gave me some severe blows on the head with a weapon—I did not see it, but I thought it was a piece of iron—I did not fall—I felt as if I was losing my senses, but I recovered immediately, and saw his coat tail going out of the room—I had strength and presence of mind to pursue him—he was going out of the bar, and I called out, as loud as I could, "Stop him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and physician, of Hornsey—on 15th April, about 8 o'clock, I was sent for to Mr. Scole's house, and found him suffering from two wounds, and a bruise on the back of his head, extending through the scalp to the skull—there was a third wound on his forehead also extending through the scalp—he was suffering a good deal from the shock, and from loss of blood, and was in a critical condition—any blunt heavy instrument would cause those wounds—very great violence must have been used—he was bleeding.</p>

I live at Hornsey, next door to Mr. Scoles—on 15th April I heard cries proceeding from Mr. Scoles—I tried to open his back door, but could not, as it was bolted—I opened the side door, went round to the front of the house, and saw the prisoner leave the house by the front door, and run down the steps—I saw Mr. Scoles come out close behind him, covered with blood—he asked me to follow him—I ran after the prisoner about 300 yards, and then saw Mr. Gray, a neighbour, coming up the road—I called to him to stop him—I felt exhausted, and seeing that Mr. Gray and Mr. Masters had got him, I went no further—I saw the prisoner dis<lb></lb>tinctly, and never lost sight of him.</p>

I am a carpenter, of Hornsey—on the morning of 15th April, about 8.3, I saw the prisoner running towards the Railway Station—that is in an opposite direction from Mr. Scoles' house—I was meeting him—Mr. Bennett was chasing him, and halloaing "Stop him"—I took up the chase, and Masters, a railway porter, stopped him, and gave him into my hands—I took him back to the Railway Tavern, and kept him half an hour, till a constable came.</p>

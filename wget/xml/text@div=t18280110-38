            , with his fist; I came up, and said it was a shame for a young man, like him, to knock an old man down; he told me he would serve me so; he pulled off his coat and hat, and came towards me; he made a blow at me; I laid held of him, and brought him down on his knees; the prisoner came behind me, and laid hold of me across the middle; he put me down on my knees; I was down on the pavement, and could not see whether any body came to help him; my head laid on the foot-way, on the stones - I felt the prisoner putting his hand round towards my watch, and thought he meant to take it; I just shifted my head up, over my right shoulder, to see who it was, and it was the prisoner; when I looked up, his jaw-bone laid on my cheek - I saw his face as well as I do now - I have known him from a child; when he had forced the watch out of my fob he left me; I suppose my watch was gold, for when I went to pawn it, it was described in the duplicate as gold; there was an old ribbon and plain key attached to it; I was on the ground for about two minutes after he left me; I could not get up, as I was pressed down by others - when I did get up, I could not see him; my coat was torn into two pieces - I know the prisoner's mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has the watch been in the family? A. About twelve months; I got it from my brother, who is not here - he made me a present of it - he is a marine - I will swear it was not a silver watch - I did not know where the prisoner lived at the time of the robbery - I knew where he was employed - I do not know whether he surrendered to this charge or not; I saw him at the office; I charged nobody else with the robbery - I went to Marlborough-street next morning, and in the afternoon I went out, expecting to see some of the young men; one of them came up, and gave me a violent blow, and knocked me down - I went to Marlborough-street next morning, and asked for a warrant against the party, for an assault - I accused nobody else of stealing my watch; I know a man named Barnes - he is outside; I did not accuse him of stealing the watch; I asked for his name to be included in the warrant which I asked for.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards, for money, or any thing else, withdraw the charge against Barnes? A. Never; there were a good many people present at the quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after the quarrel was over, pull out your watch and chain, and show it to any body? A. Never in my life - I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not, on doing that, say you would swear a robbery against Clines and the prisoner? A. I never expressed such words, or any thing like them; I know Lavell - I did not say so to him; he told my wife he would swear that I showed him the watch after I was robbed - I heard that, and went to him, and said if he had the face to tell me that he had seen the watch in my possession after the robbery, I would quit it; I was sure he never saw it - by quitting it, I meant I should think nothing of him if he said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Lavell walk home with you after the row? A. No; he came stripped to my door, with the gang to see if he could ill-use me; he did walk about a yard or two home with me - the robbery was committed about sixty yards from my house; I do not know what the prisoner is- he professes to be a labourer; when I knew him he was hod-boy in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Lavell came to your door stripped? A. He did - there was a lot of them with him, about eight or nine, I suppose.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James, Westminster. Peter-street is at the top of Berwick-street, Soho. On Friday, the 28th of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was at Queen-square, and saw the prisoner nearly opposite the back entrance of the office - I had been in search of him all day on Thursday, in the neighbourhood of Peter-street, but I did not find his mother's house; I asked if his name was Mitchell; he said it was; I asked if he had come to give himself up; he said,"No, I have come to hear about the watch;" I had not told him about any watch; I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He came into the midst of all the officers himself? A. Exactly so; I happened to be at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100040"></xptr>Marlborough-street when the prosecutor applied for a warrant; the Magistrate said there was no occasion for one, and then he came to me about it.</p>

            . I have known the prosecutor about six years in London; I was present in this row, on the 26th of December; the first I saw of it was when I came up in the street - there was a mob, and when I got up I saw them striking each other; I saw the prosecutor strike Clines - after the row was over, Culpin, being a particular friend of mine, I took him by the arm, and pressed him to come along home, and he did - and he certainly said that he would swear a robbery against Clines; I asked him what they had robbed him of; he said, "My coat is torn, and I believe my watch must be broken" - he, at the same time, took hold of his watch, and took it out of his pocket; I am quite certain I saw him produce it after the row - I parted from him within a few yards of his own door, and did not see him again till about seven o'clock that night, when I saw him come up, and strike Mitchell in the street, and Mitchell's hat fell off; the prosecutor ran away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far did you go with him towards his own house? A. From the place where the row was - it was about two minutes' walk; but he stopped in the way, saying, he would swear vengeance against these parties.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was not Mitchell in that row? A. Yes, he was there; I did not see the prosecutor down on his knees; he was not down when I saw him, nor was any body upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at seven o'clock, when you saw him come up and strike Mitchell? A. Very near where the first row was - there are gas-lights in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prosecutor's house that evening, with your coat off? A. No, I did not - nor did I go to his house in company with any man that evening.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor in liquor? A. He seemed tipsy - I do not know whether he was drunk.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220155"></xptr>
               <p>skins did not make much difference, I would take them of him at the rate of 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me a receipt for the money, which I have here—on 22d August, four days afterwards, I saw a newspaper parcel lying on the table of my warehouse—my wife told me something—I did not open it till next morning, I then found it contained these half-dozen skins—they were not dry, but partly shaved; they were not in a marketable state—I never sell or buy skins in such a state—I placed both parcels in the hands of the police.</p>

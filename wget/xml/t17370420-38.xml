               <p>Isacc Hone. I had a Door in my House broke open, and a Chest of Drawers; I lost 27 Pounds in Money; there was a 3 l. 12 s. Piece, a 36 s. Piece, 16 Guineas, three half Guineas, and 3 l. 5 s. 6 d. in Money. I lost all this Money the 16th of February out of a Room up two pair of Stairs. I saw it all there, but the Day before in my Chest of Drawers. One Green was concerned with the Prisoner in the Fact, and it was upon his Information that I charged the Man at the Bar. He had lodged in my House, but had left his Lodging about a Week, and the very Day the Robbery was committed, he had been to pay me a Visit.</p>

            . Mr. Hone sent for me, and told me, he believ'd he had heard of the Men that had robb'd him; so I went with him to Shadwell to see for them, and could not find them; but returning Home, we met the Prisoner in Fleet-street, and carry'd him before Justice Robe; there he confess'd that Green was concerned with him in taking the Money; that Green took the Money and gave it to him. These are the Instruments they made Use of, in breaking the Door and Drawers, and we found them in a Cistern according to the Prisoner's Direction. He told us, that he waited at the Foot of the Stairs while the other got the Money, and when he had got it, he brought it to him. He said likewise, that he had bought him a Suit of Cloaths, with the Three-Pound-Twelve Piece, but he would carry us to a Place, where the rest was hid, and accordingly Mr. Hone and I and the Constable went to a Cellar with him, and at the Bottom of the Stairs we found 15 l. (all but 6 s. 6 d.) hid in a Bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that he and the other Person went to the House, on purpose to do this?</p>

            , Constable. This is the Money which by the Prisoner's Directions we found under the Cellar Stairs, and he said it was all that was left of it. He took it himself from the Place where it was hid, and deliver'd it to me; I told it over, - there was 14 l. 13 s. and 6 d. in it, and 'twas seal'd up before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Hone. This is my Bag.</p>
               <p>Constable. He directed us to the Instruments, and told us, they were the same with which Green open'd the Door and the Drawers.</p>

            . After Mr. Hone had been robb'd, I went to him and told him, I was sorry for his Loss, and knowing the Prisoner to be but a sorry sort of a Fellow, I went the next Day to see him I told him his Cousen Hone had had a Loss, and finding him in a new Suit of Cloaths, I asked him, how he came by Money to buy them? I am afraid says I, that you have had a Hand in this Affair. He said no, he had not, but Mr. Hone's Sister had got her Sweetheart (a Journeyman Taylor ) into his Room; that this Taylor took the Money, and that he and she divided it between them, and that she had lent him (the Prisoner) 5 Guineas to buy him those Cloaths. I let Mr. Hone know this; he took up the Prisoner, and then he threw the Matter upon me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Green was with me all the while; He would fabin have perswaded me to have gone on the Highway. I am a poor young Fellow, come out of the Country, and have not any one to stand my Friend. It will go hard with me I know: I beg for Transportation, though it should be for all my Life. <rs id="t17370420-38-verdict205" type="verdictDescription">

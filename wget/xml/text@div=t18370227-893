                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Royal Kent-court, Kent-street, and am single. This bonnet and ribbons are mine—my mother had given the prisoner a lodging, on the 14th of February, and something to eat, and allowed her to share my bed—she was to pay nothing for it—I had my bonnet in a bonnet-box—I got up at seven o'clock, and left the prisoner in—ghe thanked me for the night's lodging, and went away—I after<lb></lb>wards went up stairs and missed my bonnet—she mentioned Woolwich as the place she came from—I went to Deptford, and there found her in custody, and saw this bonnet in the officer's bands.</p>

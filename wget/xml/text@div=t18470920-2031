                  </hi> I assist my father, Henry Gray, a livery-stable keeper, in Earl-street, Blackfriars. The prisoner owed my father about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the hire of a horse and chaise and the hire of a carriage and horses—on the 6th of Aug. he called on me, and gave me this check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked me to take the amount which he owed us, and to give him the change—he said it was not always convenient to get a check changed, which was crossed—(check <hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"London, 11th of Aug., 1847, Messrs.

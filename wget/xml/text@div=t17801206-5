               <p>On Wednesday, between twelve and one o'clock, as I was coming from the cornmarket, I saw a crowd standing opposite the Mansion-house; when I had got through the crowd, I had the curiosity to stop a little to see what was the occasion of it. Mrs. Steward was standing against the second door from the end of a court almost facing the Mansion-house, there was no person near her but two little boys, one I understand is her son. She was out of the crowd within about a door of Mildred-street; I observed the prisoner go and look round the people's pockets as they were standing. Where Mrs. Steward was, the people were standing upon the kirb-stone, and the prisoner was standing behind them, with another little woman; I saw her come up to the prosecutrix and the other woman with her; she came close to her, and I could see her working into the pocket, the other woman stood up to her to support her, and if an hackney-coach had not come by, I should have taken her with her hand in the prosecutor's pocket, but the coach went by and she got off. As soon as opportunity would permit, I came over to the prosecutrix, and said, feel if your pocket is not picked.</p>
               <p>You was on the opposite side of the way? - Exactly; there was no person to obstruct my fight; I did not see any thing taken, but it was very clear to me what she was doing.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough to be sure whether she put her hand into the prosecutrix's pocket or not? - I am certain she had her hand in her pocket; I saw her put it under her apron; I could not see it in her pocket. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060008"></xptr> went over and asked the prosecutrix if her pocket was picked? She was frightened and did not know how to answer me; I thought she would have dropped; she recovered herself, and felt in her pocket, and said, she had lost her money. I described the prisoner, and the prosecutrix's boy went after her up Cheapside, and brought her back.</p>
               <p>Did you know the woman again? - Yes, I have known her by sight many years.</p>
               <p>Was she examined? - I believe she was, but I believe there was nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you attack me at the time? - The coach came by and she was off in a moment.</p>
               <p>To Steward. Did you ever recover the money or find it again? - No.</p>
               <p>Was your pocket cut off or the money picked out of it? - The money was picked out, it was loose in my pocket.</p>

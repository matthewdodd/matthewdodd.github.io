There were but three of us, and he robbed us all; I kept him from robbing us for about ten minutes, by catching at his pistol, so I had an opportunity of seeing his face: one gentleman gave him four halfpence; he threw them into the window at him, saying, Do you give me such as this? He took from me three shillings and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Macdonald . I am positive he is.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the night for matter of light ?</p>
               <p>Mackdonald . It was as fine as a moon-light as ever was: there are two gentlemen here who were robb'd on the road that night in another coach, and they look at the prisoner at the bar to be the man that robb'd them.</p>

I keep the Plume of Feathers at Buckingham-gate , the prisoner at the Bar call'd at my house that very evening , on the 11th of Feb. he once did live within two or three doors of me, and I had not seen him for two years before; I said to him, Who thought of seeing you here at this time of night? says he, I am going to Chelsea; he went out of my house about 8 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mackdonald. What time was you robb'd ?</p>
               <p>Mackdonald . About half an hour after eight o'clock , and by hearing Mr. Wrench give a description of the prisoner, who told me he liv'd at Chesson in Hertsorshire : I went there, and by seeing the prisoner in the street, I said, that is the man that robb'd me.</p>

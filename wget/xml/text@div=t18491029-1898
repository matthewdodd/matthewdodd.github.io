I have known the prisoner five or six years—I met him and another man near the Duke of Cumberland at Kensington, on 22d Sept.—I went into the public-house and called for a pot of beer—I had a half-sovereign and a fourpenny piece in my tobacco-box and when I took out my box to pay for the beer I dropped the fourpenny piece—I picked it up, and then a man told me I had dropped something else—I looked, and missed the half-sovereign—the prisoner stooped, and 1 asked him if he had got it—he said, "It is all right"—the boy said he had picked it up, and I thought he would give it to me—I said to him, "Drink," which he did—we went along, and I said to him," Give me my half-sovereign; if you don't I will give you in charge"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I gave him in charge.</p>

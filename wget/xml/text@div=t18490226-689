On 27th Dec., between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at a walking match at Arling<lb></lb>ton—a row took place fourteen or fifteen yards from where I was standing—I was not engaged in the row—some of the people ran away—I got out of the way, and the prisoner heaved a stone at me, which struck me in the eye, the prisoner then knocked me to the ground by a blow with a stick, and while I was down I was beat by three or four persons—I begged them not to murder me, and the prisoner said, "Murder the b—while you are at it"—I was afterwards</p>

            . I reside in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington. The prisoner lived in my service for about twelve months - I discharged him three weeks before the 1st of February; he was my <rs id="t18300218-9-deflabel57" type="occupation">groom</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18300218-9-defend204 t18300218-9-deflabel57"></join>, and occasionally waited at table, and assisted in the house. On Monday, the 1st of February, I came down stairs about nine o'clock in the morning, and discovered that two sideboard drawers, one containing plate, and the other which money is at times kept in, had been forced open - all the spoons were stolen; I had used one of them at half-past twelve o'clock the night before, and the sugar-tongs; Mrs. Scott kept the key of the drawers, and put them away - I stood at her side, and saw her put the spoon into the drawer, and saw there were others in it; I saw her lock the drawer - I cannot speak to the state of the house that night; I usually examine the doors but on this night omitted to do so - there are four doors' a person must have come through to get at this parlour; I missed ten table, sixteen dessert, seventeen tea, two mustard, and four saltspoons, and the sugar-tongs I had used; there was other plate on the sideboard - one of the spoons was left on the parlour table; I lost a silver watch out of a stand; it was a very common one, worth about 15s. - I lost a razor, and have since discovered that I lost a musical snuff-box- the value of all the things is about 22l. or 23l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you or Mrs. Scott go to bed first that night? A. We both went up together - I have only one maid-servant; I do not rightly know Chitty - he acted for the prisoner when he was ill; there was a degree of shyness about him that made me suspect him; he never came up stairs - I do not know him by the name of Chitty; I do not recollect describing his person to the officer - the maid-servant knew him; I knew the prisoner lived with a gentleman named Vale, but did not trouble to go for his character; he was known down the mews - he was ill when in my service: I rent the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>CAROLINE DOMINICO. I was in Mr. Scott's service till the 3rd of February - I was in the house on the 31st of January; the two middle doors were merely shut too, but the outer door was bolted and locked, and one middle door also; the house was made safe that night - I was up first in the morning, about half-past six o'clock, and in coming down stairs I did not discover that any body had come in, till the boy belonging to the stable came in and told me - that was about seven; I then found somebody had broken the middle door open - that leads into the long room; I know that door was shut and locked the night before - it was broken open; there were marks on the door, and the lock was loose - I had locked that door myself the night before; I know the door leading to the mews - that was both bolted and locked on the 31st of January - that is the street door, and was found forced open; it is an outer door - the stable boy found it open; it is an outer door - I let the stable boy in by unfastening the kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the young man who came while the prisoner was ill? A. Yes, by sight - he was three days at the house; he went by the name of Chitty - he only came into the house for the knives and boots; I suppose he is about eighteen years old - the prisoner was ill, and obliged to go away.</p>
               <p>JOHN DOMINICO. I live with my mother, at No. 5, Exeter-place, Chelsea. I was servant to Mr. Scott, but did not sleep in the house - I went to the house about seven o'clock on Monday morning after the robbery; I went through the stable door, which I had the key of, and let myself in; it is an outer door into the mews - I found that locked; I then went through another door into the garden - that is never locked; the stable is detached from the house - my sister, Dominico, let me into the house, through the kitchen door; when I got into the house I got a candle, went up stairs, and found the door leading to the long room broken open - I had found the door leading to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180018"></xptr>the mews unlocked and unbolted; the bolts are inside - that door had not been broken at all; it was shut too.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are two outer doors, by which you may get into the house? A. Yes; one of them I found locked, as it had been left, and the other open - a person must have been inside to open that; the door that was broken is inside the house - it is the second door from the mews, and not an outer door.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Slater. I heard of Mr. Scott's robbery - I have known the prisoner about three months; I saw him on the 31st of January, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, at the back of Mr. Scott's stable door, in the mews; a young man was with him who I knew by sight - he went by the name of George Chitty; I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Scott's door which enters into the shop, I believe; it is one of the doors of the house - he put his hand to the latch of the door; I heard the latch rattle - he found it bolted; he did not open it - he came from the door to my stable, and stood talking to me for about two minutes; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe what became of Chitty? A. He went with him out into the street; he was just by while the prisoner was talking to me - I do not remember that Chitty spoke to me; he is about eighteen years old; I have not seen him since.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 1st of February I went to the prisoner's lodgings with Mr. Scott, with a warrant to search the place; I found the prisoner there - I told him there was a suspicion that Mr. Scott had been robbed, and I had come to search his place, to see whether he had any plate or any thing; I searched, and found neither plate nor money, but a few shillings - I found nothing belonging to Mr. Scott; the prisoner said he knew nothing of the robbery, and I went away; I went again on the 8th - he was not there then, I only saw his wife; I was searching for other things, and during that time I saw his wife go and hide something under the head of the bed; I then went and searched there, and found a purse with eight sovereigns in it - I did not see the prisoner then; I saw him about half-past seven o'clock the same night, at the corner of York-street; I took him before a Magistrate, according to his own wish - Mr. Gregorie was the Magistrate; he told me he had come to tell the whole truth, and it was his mother's wish he should go and speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you when he was not before the Magistrate? A. Yes, after he came from before the Magistrate he told me the same as he had told the Magistrate - I had not told him it would be better or worse for him; he said he had been to Mr. Scott's house with Chitty, and that he stood in the coach-house - that he went out from his own house at a quarter past eleven o'clock, and stopped in the coach-house while Chitty went into the house; he said he did not see the things Chitty had taken - that he returned to his own house at two, and the next day Chitty brought him ten sovereigns as his share; I asked where he got this canvas bag which the sovereigns were in - he said it was made by a young woman. I went to Mr. Scott's house on the 1st of February, and found the middle door had been broken open, either by a chisel or crow-bar; that is the door which leads into the long room - I examined the sideboard, and found the top of it had been lifted up, and the drawer drawn out; the bolt had pulled away the veneering.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had told his story before the Magistrate in your presence? A. Yes - there was a good many people about when he told the story to me; I do not know whether they heard it - we did not talk out loud.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he happen to tell it over to you again, when you had heard him tell it before the Magistrate? A. Because I was putting questions to him about where he sold the plate; he begged me not to lock him up, and he would tell me the whole truth - I have told you word for word what he said; he said he waited in the coach-house and had not been inside the house - I mentioned this robbery to him on the 1st of February; he could have absconded between that and the 8th - Chitty has absconded; I know that now - I have been an officer twenty-eight or twenty-nine years; I have done all I could to find Chitty - I did not look for him till he said he was with him; I found none of Mr. Scott's property at the prisoner's lodging.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you present when he was examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes; he told the Magistrate the same as he told me, as near as could be, within a few words, but not at the time of the examination; when the witnesses were examined he denied it, and said he was innocent - what he said was the evening before, when he first gave himself up; that was not taken in writing - he was examined on the Thursday, and said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not state to me that he told you the same story as he told before the Magistrate? A. Yes, that evening, when he desired to be taken before the Magistrate; our chief constable heard every word that passed, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the officer came to my mother's, he said I had better tell the truth how I came by the money, as my wife was in custody, or else it would be worse for me, and I told him Chitty came to me, gave it to me, and said if any thing happened I was to say I knew nothing about it.</p>

He represented himself as a country lad, he said he had never lived in London; he had a brother who lived in Newington, I sent to the brother and the brother said he knew him to be an honest lad. I took the lad, he conducted himself well till on Saturday evening the 4th of May; my servant maid went to my butchers, he informed her that the lad had taken up two pound of mutton chops in my name. He did not lodge with me he lodged with a brother in law. On Saturday night he received his wages, he might have paid for them on Monday. I questioned him, he acknowledged he had them, I asked him if he had been in the habit of taking any thing, he said not, at last he acknowledged that he had taken one pocket book home to his brother, I asked him why his brother did not bring it home to me. The prisoner was searched and we found a silver pencil case and silver thimbles upon him, which he acknowledged taking out of a drawer in my accompting house. I got an officer, we searched his lodgings, I found a key on him which he said would open his box, with that key I opened his box, in the box I found a variety of articles belonging to me, and in his brothers box I also found things belonging to me; I brought the things home and put him into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You said to him if he would lead you in the way to detect the brother you would not be harsh with him. - A. I certainly should have done that.</p>

I keep a public-house at Harling<lb></lb>ton—I have seen the prisoner pass—on 23rd July he came to my house—I had this tumbler, which I had had for ten years—I know it by these marks on the bottom of it—he had a bottle of ginger-beer—I gave it him in this glass—he drank part of it, and then went to the tap-room, and said he would drink the rest there—he went away.</p>

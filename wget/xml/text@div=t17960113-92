               <p>Q. Did you deliver any others? - A. Yes, fifty-two, directed to Mr. Poole, Overshaw, near Bridgewater; they were marked on the inside of the hide, on the fleshy side; there was a piece of sacking tied on, with a tar rope, such as is made use of to tie up raw hides.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you deliver them? - A. I delivered them to William Saunders; I saw them delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Saunders? - A. I believe he is servant to Richard Gearing; he likewise gave me a receipt for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time afterwards see any hides that were delivered to him? - A. On the 29th, I was in Leadenhall market; Mr. Cork asked me if I had lost a hide, I said I did not know; he told me a hide was brought by a porter that morning, and desired he would sell it; Mr. Cork observed that it was a hide that was salted, and he supposed it had been stole or lost, and therefore he did not offer it for sale; he asked me if I had lost a hide.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, did you go to the barge? - A. Not immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined the hide, did you know it? - A. I knew it; I shipped the same on the 21st, in Saunders's barge, at Brook's Wharf, I went to the barge and found Mr. Saunders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look over the hides? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt as to the hide? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it one of the fifty-two? - A. Yes; I marked it, as I seldom mark them; I bought fifty for Mr. Poole, of Overshaw; I marked them with P, that I might knew them, they are falted hides, to preserve them from putresaction.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not saleable in this town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CORK sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a salesman in Leadenhall-market: On the 29th of December, a man, who was a stranger to me, throws down before my window, a hide, his name is Cranfield.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that the same hide you shewed to Mr. Alston? - A. On the person's putting it down, I said, my friend, how came you by this hide, I am afraid it is either stolen or lost; he said, a man brought it to a public-house, at the Saracen's-head, in Friday-street, where he was porter, and asked him to bring it to market to some salesman to sell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he tell you who he was? - A. No; it remained on my premisses, and I enquired of three gentlemen, if they had lost any; upon enquiring further, a person told me he thought it was one of Mr. Alston's, and said, he would enquire, desiring me not to dispose of the hide.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the hide you shewed to Mr. Alston that which you received from Cranfield? - A. The hide I received from Cranfield, I shewed to Mr. Alston.</p>

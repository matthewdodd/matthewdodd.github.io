                  </hi>. I am porter to Francis Tucker and two others, of South Moulton-street. In consequence of observations I made of the shop cash, during Aug. and Sept., I made a communication to my employers—I after<lb></lb>wards observed the entries made in the cash-book—I took particular observa<lb></lb>tion of the dripping and other stuff that was purchased during the 9th of Sept., 1843—on that day John Tarrant, who is usually in the shop, went to Gravesend—I remained there besides the prisoner—we were the only persons in the shop—at two o'clock the prisoner went to dinner—I looked at the drip<lb></lb>ping and the change—the dripping is kept in a large tab in the cellar, and the change on a board about three feet by two and a half—the tub would contain about three hundredweight of dripping or a little more—I took the trowel which is usually kept in the cellar and smoothed the surface of the dripping in the tub, and I made a cross on it all the way across the tub—I then examined the changes on the board—there was about two stone of it, just sufficient to cover the board—I returned to the shop and looked into the drawer which is used for the reception of dripping in the shop, before it is taken down to the tub in the cellar—I found the drawer quite empty—I have the shop cash-book here—it was the prisoner's duty to purchase dripping and articles of that description in the shop, and enter them in the book—while he was out that day I examined this cash-book—I found the last entry was two stone of changes, by which it appears that they had been delivered before he went to dinner, and there was about two stone of changes on the board or dresser—on the prisoner's return about three, I left the shop—I returned a little after four—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184402050176"></xptr>
               <p>then looked at the shop cash-book and found an entry of thirty-seven pounds of dripping, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two stone four pounds of changes 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making together 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went in the cellar and examined the tub, and found there had been no dripping whatever added to it—I looked in the drip<lb></lb>ping drawer, and none had been put in there—I looked at the dresser, where the changes were kept, and none had been added there—the cross which I had made on the dripping in the tub was quite visible, and if thirty-seven pounds had been added to it that would not have been the case—on the 25th of Sept. Tarrant returned from Gravesend and I made a communication to him on this subject—here is the shop cash-book—it is balanced on the 8th of Sept., and the balance carried forward in Tarrant's writing—he went to Gravesend about twelve o'clock, and on that morning this book came into the prisoner's possession—he had to examine it and see that the cash corresponded with the entries—he balanced it on the evening of the 9th, and the balance is 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. over in the till, which will often occur—the balance brought forward is 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was the prisoner's duty to pay for changes and dripping out of the shop-till.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I warrant, as soon as you made this discovery on thr 9th, you went to your master? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say a word about it till my brother shopman came back—I do not know how much money, per month, would pass through the prisoner's hands—it might be 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—there was only one receptacle for dripping in use at that time, be<lb></lb>sides the drawer—we have several tubs which are used at different times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not the prisoner frequently purchase in the morning and not enter them till the evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not a usual thing—I have frequently seen him purchase dripping—I do not swear that on every occasion he has entered it—I do not know that he has not done so—I have not made any mistakes—I know Mr. Clarkson—I believe he keeps a little shop in Ebury-row—I do not remember his borrowing three papers of Palmer's wicks from our house—he frequently borrows them—I do not remember his borrowing three pupen of Palmer's wicks—I did not go to Mrs. Clarkson and tell her that I had for<lb></lb>gotten to enter three pounds of metallic wicks, and ask her what I should do, nor did I say, "You must not let our people know it, for if you do, Sargeant will find it out and kick up the d—I's own <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about it"—I will swear there was not an omission of entering three pounds of Palmer's candles—the prisoner has never found fault with my conduct—there might be a few little words perhaps—I do not remember omitting to enter some goods purchased by Mrs. Clark<lb></lb>son, on the 24th of Dec.—I will not swear I did not omit it—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber an entry that should have been made on the 27th of Jan. that was not in<lb></lb>serted till Feb.—I swear that was not the case—I never make entries in the book—I make them on a slip of paper—I have on every occasion made that entry at the time the sale took place—I never failed to do so—I am porter to the prosecutors—it might be the case sometimes, that when goods were de<lb></lb>livered at our house, instead of paying for them at the time, a ticket was given to the person who left them, and they would come some days after and receive the money; but that would be entered on the day on which the goods were bought, not on the day on which the cash was paid—I am certain of that, be<lb></lb>cause there is always a ticket left in the till, and that is brought in as the money paid out—it stands as cash in the book—when the cash is paid the ticket is then destroyed—I know that to be invariably the case—I have seen it done—I do not keep the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you take the cash out for that ticket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and it is put in a piece of paper with the ticket—I think there is one family that sell their own dripping and wax ends instead of allowing it to their servant</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184402050177"></xptr>
               <p>the dripping and wax ends come from Lord Liverpool's house to our house for sale—I do not know what his lordship does—other noblemen and gentle<lb></lb>men send their dripping and wax ends—I do not know whether it is the practice of our house to allow the house-steward or the principal servant 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound on every article brought—there is a perquisite allowed—I do not know whether that 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound would be put down as a separate item—the prisoner's department was in the counting-house—he did not usually attend the shop, only when other people were absent, but he might come into the shop—I do not know who has got the prisoner's place, or whether it is settled—my wages were raised about five weeks ago, or a little more—it was since this affair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you look at all the tubs in which dripping was usually put? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I examined them all on my return—these tickets are given by the person in charge of the shop at the time, to those who bring the goods instead of cash, as perhaps we might not have change at the time—there was no deficiency of cash on the 9th of Sept.—if any of these tickets had been given after twelve o'clock that day, the money would appear among the cash—one ticket is given to the person, and one is put into the till, and in the evening, when we have sufficient change, the money is rolled up in the paper for the persons when they come for it—I am a yearly servant, and am paid quarterly—my wages have been raised from the 1st of Jan.—they were 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a-year, and are now 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you when you returned examine all the tubs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was only one that had dripping in—I looked into the others, and none of them had any.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Tucker and Co. I went to Gravesend on the 9th of Sept., about twelve o'clock—on the evening of the 8th I balanced the cash-book—I returned on the 25th, and on that evening Murrell made a communication to me, and on the 26th I communicated with one of the partners—the money in the till on the evening of the 8th corre<lb></lb>sponded with the cash-book, when I balanced it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do not some of the nobility and gentry keep an account at your house for dripping and wax ends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know that the servants are allowed 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound on dripping or wax ends brought to our house—if we buy the wax ends of servants, of course we give them the money—there is something allowed to the servant for himself—it is entered in the book as for goods bought—I have never seen the prisoner make entries in the evening, of goods that he had purchased in the morning—I will swear that he has never done so—I go to dinner at one o'clock, and to tea at five—I sometimes go to the Bank, and sometimes to collect money—I am perhaps absent two hours—the prisoner has found fault with me for what he said Was negligence—he has reprimanded me for neglect in making entries in the book—I am Mrs. Tucker's nephew—I remember some time ago omitting to enter 721bs. of candles sold to Messrs. Ferguson and Co., of Ox<lb></lb>ford-street, and some sold to Watkins'—I do not remember omitting to enter goods sold to Hughes, in May Fair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember receiving goods from Mr. Clarkson that you did not enter till some days after, when the mistake was discovered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know whether I omitted it, the porter might have done so as well as myself—when Clarkson brought his invoice, he said there was something omitted, and I entered it then, and he paid the money to me—it does sometimes happen that parties deliver dripping and wax ends, and receive a ticket for them and do not get the money for several days—in that case the ticket is put by, and entered in the book on the day the money is paid sometimes, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said something about servants, what is that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The wax ends are considered the perquisite of the butler or footman, and when they bring them we give them less than we do to a collector, but what<lb></lb>ever we receive from a collector, or from a servant, we make an entry in the book of it, so that the book shows everything—there is no separate sum paid to a servant, except for the amount we buy—when the omission which has been asked about occurred, I had not received any money which I had not accounted for, but I had left out an item in the customer's bill, and my omit<lb></lb>ing it caused the prisoner's displeasure.</p>

I had a bay gelding pony; at nine o'clock that evening I gave it to the boy to take to the paddock near my house; I did not see it in the paddock; I saw the boy take it, and he brought the halter back; there is a gate and a lock to the paddock; I made some inquiry for the pony, and a little boy said he could not find it; in consequence of some communication, I came to Hampstead on the following Monday, and found my pony in possession of John Hinton, who keeps ponies and gigs; I have got it since - it is not worth more than 5l. in the market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the boy here? A. No, I could have had him here; the paddock may be about one hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What age is your poney? A. Upwards of twenty years, but he was a great favorite with my children.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Holland Arms, Kensington. On Friday, the 20th of June, I saw the prisoner there a little after eleven o'clock in the morning; I was out exercising a horse, and met him going up towards my stable - he had a little bay gelding, which he put into the stable, and in a little while after a man named Wilkinson came by with some potatoes; the prisoner brought the poney out, shewed it to Wilkinson, and rode it up and down Back-lane, and then put him in again; soon afterwards, the prisoner went after Wilkinson; when I went out, about twelve o'clock, I saw him and Wilkinson together; I heard Wilkinson say "I have bought this poney of Collins for 4l. 10s.;" the prisoner made no answer; they all went away together about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he go away with the poney open in the public road? A. Yes, there was no concealment of any kind.</p>

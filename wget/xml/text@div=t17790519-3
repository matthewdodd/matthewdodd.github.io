               <p>These are the sashes we found in the prisoner's shop. On the 14th or 15th of April the prisoner was in custody; we had a warrant to search his house; we found some pieces of sashes that belong to Mr. Harrison.</p>
               <p>Did you find any whole sashes? - No; they were in pieces.</p>
               <p>Had you seen them at Mr. Harrison's house? - Yes; I fitted them in; I made a cross upon them with a chissel; I know them to be pieces of Mr. Harrison's sashes. they were only put in temporarily.</p>
               <p>Must they have been taken out again to be hung? - Yes; to put in the weights and lines.</p>
               <p>Is it the common practice to put up the sashes before they are hung? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had they been in? - I suppose six months.</p>
               <p>Were they completed? - So far as that they only wanted hanging; when they are hung and the beads nailed they are complete.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When did you make this cross? - When I fitted it in.</p>
               <p>Why did you make this cross? - We generally make private marks to know how to fit them in.</p>

               <p>Carpenters make sashes don't they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not other carpenters make marks as well as you? - They do not make use of the same mark I suppose.</p>
               <p>You will not swear that no carpenter makes a cross for a mark but yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you find in the prisoner's shop besides? - A great number of new sashframes cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>You cannot swear positively that this is your mark? - There is a fellow sash now marked just the same.</p>
               <p>Were these sashes glazed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a glazier, and live at No. 5, Jewry-street. On the 15th of April, I had the prisoner taken up on suspicion of stealing six pair of sashes from a building, belonging to one Mr. Seagrow, in Constitution-Row, leading to Pancras. On the 14th he came to my shop with sixteen squares of glass in a box; I had had some of him a few days before, which I had not paid for; coming again with sixteen more, I suspected him; I did not pay him for them, as he said he was coming again in the afternoon. I went to a person and told him I had bought squares of a man several times, and did not know what to think of it; I was then informed of an advertisement of six sashes that had been stolen. The prisoner came the next morning, and I had him taken up; he then said he bought them at sales, and got them from old houses he pulled down; that he took the glass out and made rounds of ladders of the frames.</p>
               <p>Can they take the glass out of the frames without breaking of it? - They must break a great many; those brought to me were not broke.</p>
               <p>Can you tell by the glass when it has been taken out of frames? - Yes. I did not think that the glass was taken out of new frames.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190005"></xptr>What did you give for the glass? - Sixpence a foot; that is as much as any body gives for old glass.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the business? - Sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see a house where the sashes were put in their place without being hung? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen any houses that were inhabited where the sashes were in their place but not hung? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not carpenters frequently buy sash frames? - Yes; old sash frames and glass together?</p>
               <p>Do not they sell the glass to glaziers? - Yes if they choose it.</p>

               <p>I made the frames for Mr. Harrison. I I have seen the pieces of frames; as far as my knowledge goes they are the frames I made; they answer the dimensions in every point.</p>
               <p>They seem to be remarkably stout frames? - They are what we call two inch sashes.</p>
               <p>(The pieces of frames and a square glass were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is a remarkably crooked square and it fits the putty in that frame exactly.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was coming out of Mr. Maddox's timber-yard one day, a man called to me and asked me if I would buy a couple of old sashes of him; I looked at them, and thought they would do for my own shop; I bought them of him at five pence a foot. When I brought them home they would not fit; I took them to a glazier, and he would not buy them, the putty being hard, without I would take the glass out. I went home and took the glass out and carried it to Mr. Smith, and he gave me six pence a foot for it. A few days after a man brought me two pair of new sashes, which he said belonged to a widow who wanted to dispose of them. I took a pair of them to Mr. Smith, and he would not give me any more than the price of the glass for them, upon which I took them back and took the glass out; one Kelley was in the shop when I bought the two pair, I borrowed four shillings of him to pay for them.</p>
               <p>To Smith. Did he bring you two whole sashes? - He brought me a pair of little sashes, which he said he made himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been in business but three months. I did not know but I was very safe in buying them. Kelly said he would not come till two o'clock; he was obliged to go to the Excise-office. I did not think my tryal would come on so soon.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. What is the value of it? - About 2 s. 4 d. a foot, the whole is worth about five pounds I believe.</p>

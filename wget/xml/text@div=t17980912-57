The next day I went in search of the prisoner: I went to Paddington first, the Monday following I heard she was at Greenwich; accordingly I went to Greenwich, she had been there, and was gone away; she had left a direction with a person there to come and see her, that she lived in Cow-cross; I went to Cow-cross, but no such person lived there. The next day I heard she had been at Paddington, and on the Wednesday following I found her, according to the direction, in Cow-cross; in her pocket I found two duplicates of a shift and a stuff petticoat; she said he had put the other duplicates loose in her pocket, and had lost them, but the gave us a direction to the pawnbroker's, and we went and found a gown and cloak, and a coat, at Greenwich; the bonnet we found where we took her.</p>

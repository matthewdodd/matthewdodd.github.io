                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 34). I was on duty in King William-street on 21st Aug., about half past 11 o'clock in the day—I saw the prisoners at a picture shop window, near London-bridge—I saw Beames put his hand into a gentleman's pocket at the window—at that time he was closely covered by Shea, so as to prevent anybody from seeing what Beames was about—he did not get anything at that time—Shea touched Beames on the shoulder—I believe he saw me—they then walked away, and one crossed the road—one of them went towards London-bridge, and the other towards East Cheap—I was in plain clothes—I then crossed the road—I saw that Shea had returned and gone to Beames, and they had returned again to the shop window—I saw Shea look at several gentlemen's pockets, and then point to them to Beames—Beames directly went behind the gentlemen, and Shea was right behind him—I could not see exactly what they were doing at that time, because I was directly behind them—they then went towards East Cheap—I followed, and kept them in sight—at the corner of East Cheap I saw the prosecutor—he was going from London-bridge—I saw Shea look at the prose<lb></lb>cutor's coat pocket, and touch Beames, and show Beames the pocket—Beames immediately stepped up to the gentleman—I got behind an omnibus—I saw him put his left hand to the bottom of the gentleman's pocket, and his right hand into his pocket, and take from it this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—Shea was as close behind him as possible at the time—Beames put the handkerchief into his side pocket—I seized them both on the spot—I called the prosecutor—another officer came up, and we both took them to the station—I took the handkerchief from Beames's pocket—I found a handkerchief on Shea's neck, which Beames said that he (Shea) had stolen in Gracechurch-street, on the Saturday previous—Shea made no answer to that—I found this knife on Shea, and Beames said that Shea had stolen that knife that morning, and it belonged to little <hi rend="italic">Davy</hi>—Shea did not make any answer—Beames said that Shea had made him a thief; that he was in place, and that Shea had come out of prison the Wednesday before, and took him out a thieving—Shea made no answer to that—there was a sort of recrimination going on at the time.</p>

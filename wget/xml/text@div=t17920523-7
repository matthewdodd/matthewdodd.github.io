I saw the pigeons in question the night before they were missing; I locked them up myself; I feed them every day almost; they were of a particular sort; I missed them early next morning, between five and six, I lost eighteen; I have recovered seven, which I am perfectly sure are mine, and two I would not swear to. On Wednesday, the 21st of March, I recovered them at Mr. Wooller's; I am certain they were my property; I recovered two others the 7th of April, at Mr. Lowe's, Spitalfields, one of which I am certain of; I brought them home in the cages lent me, and turned them into the pigeon-house; they all resorted to their nests, particularly two of them that left their young behind; I have not the least doubt in the world. I know nothing of the prisoner; I saw him once before; he offered to sell me a dog within a fortnight from the time I lost my pigeons.</p>

               <p>I am the footman; I know these pigeons: (produced and deposed to): they were turned into the pigeon-house, and they took to their old places; I have not the least doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Miss Debonnair. They are my pigeons; they are tame; I valued the six at a guinea and a half, and a crown for the other; some of them are worth a guinea apiece.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I worked for Mr. Raike, cooper at Stratford, for twelve months. About nine or ten weeks past, I came to town, and stopped in Whitechapel Road, and there came in a person who I knew by sight; we had a pint of porter; he wanted to dispose of some pigeons which he had, and asked me to buy them; I said I could help him to a customer; I told him he might sell them in Holborn; he said he had a dispute with the man, and he thought, if he went with them himself, the man would not buy them; and if I would go and bargain with the man, he would pay me; so I went; the man bid me eleven shillings, which I took, and came away, and gave the man the money; we went to drink. On Thursday evening, he waited for me at the Swan in Brown's-lane, and told me he had seven more; and I sold three for five shillings and three-pence; so, my Lords and gentlemen of the Jury, you will consider in your own breasts, whether you think any person can with safety swear to the pigeon which is brought, which always shifts its feathers twice a year.</p>

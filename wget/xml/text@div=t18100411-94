               <p>JOHN PERCIVAL. My partner's name is Matthew Percival. The prisoner lived with us as a <rs id="t18100411-94-deflabel527" type="occupation">carter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18100411-94-defend839 t18100411-94-deflabel527"></join>; his work was within doors, as well as out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you missed these dusters - A. On Wednesday evening, the 7th of March, Mr. Kent, a brush maker, called at our house, Mr. Prentis was with him; I received information, which led me to Mr. Prentis, a brush-maker. The prisoner came to Mr. Prentis's and asked for the money for the dusters that he had left the day before. When the prisoner asked for the money I collared him; he said they were his own, he had them in his possession for nine months.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENTIS. I am a brush-maker, in Chandois-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner apply to you to sell any brushes - A. Yes; that dozen in question. On Tuesday the 6th of March, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner called at my shop, he had a dozen brushes with him, he asked me twenty-two shillings; the fair value would be about thirty-two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, know with whom he lived - A. No. I agreed to buy them, but avoided paying for them, that I might make enquiry; Mr. Kent, the maker's name was upon them. I went to Mr. Percival in consequence of the enquiries I made of Mr. Kent; Mr. Percival suspected his carman. I went into the stable, and there I saw the prisoner, and it not being convenient for Mr. Percival to come down that evening I kept out of the way, and told my servant to tell him to come the next evening.</p>

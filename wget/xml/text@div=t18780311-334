                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 1st February, about a quarter to 5, I was in King William Street with Wolsey, another officer, and saw Phillips wheeling a truck with a chest of tea; Willow walked beside him through Prince's Street and Moorgate Street into Moorfields, where Willow began to wheel the truck—before that I saw Parrott in Moor<lb></lb>gate Street; he walked on the pavement behind the other two as far as Moorgate Station, they then turned to the left to Moorfields—I went up to Willow and asked him where he got the tea from; he said "I suppose from Tooley Street"—Phillips said "I know nothing about it"—I said "Where are you going to take it?"—he said "To St. Luke's Church, Old Street; we are going to meet a man, we do not know his name"—Willow refused his address; Phillips gave his, and I found that his mother lived there.</p>

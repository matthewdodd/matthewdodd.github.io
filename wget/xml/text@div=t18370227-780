The prisoner was a sailor in the same ship—I lodged at the house of John Plowman for two nights before this happened—I came to the King William in New Gravel-lane, and fell in with him here—he told me he had lost his money, and said he had no place to go to—I said I had some money, and would give him part of it—I treated him at my own lodging, and he slept in the same room—I had a pocket-book with a ££10 note in it—it was in my inside jacket pocket—I looked at it when I went to bed, and it was safe—I awoke in the morning at half-past seven o'clock, and he was getting up—I told him it was too soon—while he was dressing 1 fell asleep—I awoke again at nine o'clock, and my pocket-book and ££10 note were gone—I went down, and the prisoner was gone—I have never seen my note since—I have known the prisoner three years—he bore a good character.</p>

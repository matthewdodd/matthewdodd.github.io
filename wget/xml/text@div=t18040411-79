             went out, the other man stopped, and drank his porter; and after he had drank his porter, I shewed him the way out, because it was sermon time; about ten minutes after that, I went to look after my shirt, and found it was missing from the parlour table; I then went out after the last man that went out, and found him; I insisted upon his going with me to find the prisoner, it was almost dark before I could find out where he lived; I then got an officer to take him, the officer was afraid to go in; the officer desired him to come out, and he came out; the officer took him to the Crown, in Bunhill-row.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the lodgings? - A. No, we did not search the lodgings at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him? - A. I accused him of taking my shirt out of the parlour; he said, he was not guilty; he offered me three shillings and sixpence and a duplicate of another shirt that was in pawn, in lieu of my shirt.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know he was in bed? - A. The prisoner said he was in bed himself; the room he sleeps in is on the ground-floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go into the house? - A. I knew his character before, he was a very bad one; the prosecutor did not tell me his name, or else I should have got some assistance; I staid at the door for fear he should abscond; he got up, and I took him in charge; I did not search him, he had nothing to be searched of; the ticket that he would give to Mr. Prentice was of another shirt; I told him, I would not let any thing of that kind be done; he said, that he had not got the shirt, nor did he take the shirt.</p>

            . My husband keeps a goldsmith's shop on the corner of Tower-hill. On the 28th of May in the afternoon there came a woman with this watch, and said it was her brother's, and if I disputed it, she would fetch him, she said, he was cook to the Sea-horse man of war. A man came and told me the same, and that he had a pension for loosing his leg; I observed he had a wooden leg; he said, he was waiting for his prize-money, and was forced to sell his watch. I sent it to a workman to have it valued, who sent word, it was old, and a very bad one, and not to give above 30 s. for it; I gave them that for it. (produced in court, deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Catherine Cartwright. I was coming home to my lodging, Murphy was standing at a door, he got hold of my cloaths and made me drink with him; after that I went to a chandler's shop and got a candle and lighted it; it was then almost 12 o'clock. I was going home with my lighted candle, the prosecutor came by, I saw Murphy knock him down, my candle went out. One said, That's the barber; and another said, they had got the watch; there were more persons than Murphy, but cannot swear to any but him; I immediately went home to my lodgings, I knew Murphy before by seeing him in the neighbourhood.</p>

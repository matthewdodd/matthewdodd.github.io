                  </hi>. I am a waiter at a coffee-shop in Lisson-grove, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's. On the 14th of Sept., about a quarter past six o'clock, the prisoner and two other young men came in, all three smoking cigars—the prisoner had some cigars in a silk handkerchief—he sold some cigars to my master, and I bought the handkerchief of him for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a dozen of cigars for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I afterwards pare the handkerchief to my master, and it was given to the policeman the next, morning—I asked the prisoner where he got the cigars from—be said he had brought them from Manchester, in a boat. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE TILBY</hi>. I keep the coffee-shop. I saw the prisoner there about half-past six o'clock on the morning of the 14th of Sept.—he showed me some cigars tied up in a handkerchief, said he had brought them up by the boat, and would let me have a lot cheap—I bought between seventy and eighty of him—he offered to sell me the handkerchief, which I refused, and Cooper bought it—it was afterwards given to Somes, the policeman—he also offered me a child's thimble, but I did not buy it.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged with me six months, and absconded a few weeks ago. A chest and pair of drawers were in his room, he had the use of them, except one drawer, which was locked, and I kept the key. I opened it on the 18th of December, and missed some black silk; I afterwards saw him with a waistcoat, which I can swear was off the same silk. He stopped three or four weeks after, and then something occurred. I told him to leave, and he must pay for the silk; he refused, and said he bought it of a man who worked with him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140026"></xptr>at Ratcliffe-highway, whom he would try to find - he never found him. After he left, I missed a blanket which was on the bed, where he and his wife slept - it was worth 20 s. I never recovered it; I found the prisoner near Whitechapel. He went by the name of Frazier then. I discovered a key in his drawer, which opened my drawer, easier than my own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. - A. How long have you had the silk? - A. Fourteen years. I would not take 39 s. for it. His wife shewed me the waistcoat herself in his presence.</p>

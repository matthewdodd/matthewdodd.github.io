                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MARIAN BLACK</hi>. I am the wife of John Trafalgar Black, a tutor, of 4, Hamilton-place, Brixton-road—on 27th April, the prisoners came—my servant let them into the dining-room, and then into the drawing-room—I followed them, and asked them what apartment they wanted—they said a dewing-room floor and two bedrooms—they told me they were professional singers, engaged at different houses, and that they kept a "trap"—I showed them the drawing-room floor; there was no property of mine them—the servant then took them to this second-floor—my bedroom is on that floor, Over the drawing-room—I heard some one overhead, in my room—the servant then brought them down—they said there was another professional singer, and wished to know what other bedroom I could let them have—knowing that they had been in my room, I suspected them, and directed my servant to show her bedroom, to give me time—they went up stairs again, and I ran up to my bedroom, and missed three rings, which I had left on the looking-glass, worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then came down, and waited at the drawing-room door until the prisoners came down—I went into the ball before them—they said the apartment would suit them very well—I said, "I wish to speak to you; step into the dining-room for a minute,"—they said their time was up, and they must go—I said, "I cannot allow you to go until you have given me the three rings which you have taken from my bedroom"—I put the chain on the front door—they were then in the hall, coming towards the door—I stood before them, and would not let them pass—they said, "Oh, dear no, madam; the very idea of such a thing! we are too respectable; we have never been guilty of such a thing"—I said, "You have them"—there was a life-preserver hanging on the folding-door between the front and back room; Kemble took it off the door—I said, "You had better give me up the rings; what do you intend doing f you will be trans<lb></lb>ported; if you have no fear of man, have you no fear of God? if yon give me up the rings, I will release you"—there was a friend of nine down Stairs—I called him up—as he was coming up, the prisoners said, "If you</p>

               <p>look round the room, you will find your property"—I had seen Brown put something on the sofa, and I said, "I saw where you put them"—he then took the three rings between his thumb and finger, brought them to me, and said, "Now you have got your property, you will allow us to go"—I said, "No"—I thought I saw the life-preserver in one of the prisoners' pocket—it had been lying on the table when my friend came up, and one of them took it off—they refused to give up the rings until the police were at the door.</p>

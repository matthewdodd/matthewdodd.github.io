                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Ponder's End, opposite the Two Brewers. The prisoner George was my servant—it was his duty to drive my carts to London—on the afternoon of the 25th of May, I saw some mixed oats and beans under my manger—those which are produced are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. In consequence of information I took the prisoner George in the prosecutor's yard—I then went to the Two Brewers, where Bennett lived as ostler—I told him I wanted to go into his corn place—he went with me, and unlocked the door—it is a small place parted from the stable—I saw a corn—bin there with a quantity of oats and split beans, in a peck measure, covered over with white oats—I turned round, and came to Mr. Allen—I then went back, and found these beans and oats in the peck measure—I took Bennett into custody—he said he had just swept them from a manger, that they were left from baiting some horses, and that was all he knew about them—I took him into his master.</p>

               <p>house, and produced some of the marked beans in the presence of his master—some of the beans had been marked by Mr. Allen, in my presence, the evening before—I had seen George go into Mr. Allen's stable, where the corn was, and saw him come out with the corn, and go in the direction of the Two Brewers, but I did not see him go to Bennett's stable—when I charged Bennett, he unlocked the stable door with a key immediately.</p>

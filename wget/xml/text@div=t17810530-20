               <p>I am servant to Mr. Trenchard. The prisoner lived with a relation of my master's; I don't know how long he has left the service: last Saturday se'nnight he called at my master's, to see a fellow maid servant; he came about three in the afternoon, and staid till seven. He was intimate with the family, and had been in my master's house frequently. About five minutes after he was gone, I missed a gold watch of my master's, which was kept in the kitchen, for the use of the cook: I went up, and told the cook, I thought Cantofer had taken away the watch. On the Sunday morning I went to the Rotation-office, and got Macdonald to go with me to the prisoner's lodging: upon entering the room, Macdonald asked him, Where the watch was? he immediately confessed the fact, and said, he had lodged it at a pawnbroker's in Long-Acre, as he came along.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made to him, to induce him to confess? - None.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Heather, a pawnbroker, in Long-Acre. The prisoner brought the watch to me, to know whether it was gilt, or gold, on Saturday the 19th of May, at near eight o'clock; I perceived the watch to be gold. I questioned him, how he came by it? he said, he bought it at Blackwall, of the Jews, for a guinea. I stopped the watch.</p>
               <p>What is the watch worth? - The box, without the outside case, is worth three guineas; and the inside may be worth a guinea more: it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>(That was likewise produced in court, and deposed to by Watts.)</p>

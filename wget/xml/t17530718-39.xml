            . On the 22d of June, about 9 o'clock at night, as Mr. Bradshaw was settling his cash, I observ'd the prisoner come into the passage, I believe he did not go quite to the coffee-house, then he went out again, then he came in again, and as he came up the last time I turn'd my head, and the hat which was upon the counter but a little time before he came in, was gone, and he had got it shuffling it under his coat, and I saw him drop his own hat, and he kept the lac'd one; I saw a hit of it as he was putting it under his coat. I told Mr. Bradshaw of it, and directly as soon as the prisoner heard me tell Mr. Bradshaw, he ran away, Mr. Bradshaw desir'd me to run after him, I did, and lost sight of him at every corner I came to, but I cried stop thief! and he was taken.</p>

            . As I was coming through 'Change-alley, on the 22d of June, about nine at night, I heard somebody cry stop thief! I saw a person coming without ever a hat, and a little boy pursued him; I took him just by Garraway's coffee-house, and he dropp'd a gold lac'd hat from out of his coat ; I took the hat and the prisoner over to Mr. Smith's, he said it was his, and I told him I saw it drop from the prisoner.</p>

             (Police-consable N 41). I was on a piece of waste ground, behind the Haberdashers' Alms-houses, on the 18th of May; I saw the prisoner going from that ground to the East-road, at a quarter-past ten o'clock in the morning - it is two or three miles from the prosecutor's; I caught hold of Dear as he was going past a cart, and I got a person to stop Pinder, who had got round the horse - I asked Pinder what he had in his bundle (each of them had a bundle); he said he was going to the mangle for his mother - his bundle appeared wet; I asked Dear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170121"></xptr>what he had - he made no answer; I took them to the station - I found this table-cloth in Dear's bundle, and these three shirts in Pinder's; Pinder was asked, before they were opened, what he had, and he said three shirts, one of his own, and two of his father's, and they were not marked.</p>

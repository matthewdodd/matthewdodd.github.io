               <p>LANCELOT KNOWLES sworn.</p>
               <p>I met the prisoner in Holborn; she inveigled me into an house to treat her with a glass of wine; we staid in the house till about half past two.</p>
               <p>Did you sit up or go to bed? - We did not go to bed. At the corner of Kingsgate-street, while she and I were talking, the patrole was coming by; he came up, and said, Before you part with this woman, I beg you will see that every thing is right. I put my hand down, and missed my watch. I said, She has robbed me of my watch, I desire you to secure her directly; upon that he laid hold of her. She cried, and said that she would have an action for scandal, for taking her up upon such an affair. Another man was going past;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030029"></xptr> he took hold of her other arm, and they led her along the street to St. Giles's watch-house. There she was searched, and I saw the watch found in her right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Was you at this time drunk or sober? - I was in liquor a good deal.</p>
               <p>Was you so sober as to be able to say, upon your oath, whether you might not have given her this watch? - I am pretty positive that I had not given her the watch.</p>
               <p>But you must be very positive; what money had you about you? - A guinea and a half, and some silver; I gave her, I fancy, between four and five shillings, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You did not lose any money? - No, only the watch. I am very certain I did not give it to her.</p>

               <p>I saw the watch taken out of the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor asked me where I was going? I said, Home, into King-street, Bloomsbury. He asked me to drink a glass of wine with him, for it was a cold night. We went in and had two pints of wine. He was very much in liquor. He was so much in liquor, that he let his money fall about the room, and the people of the house picked it up. He said he was afraid he should be too late to get in at home, and should like to leave his watch. I said he might leave it in the house, and have a bed there. He said he did not know these people, he would give it me, and come and dine with me next day. We were both in liquor. They asked me if I had the watch. They laid hold of me in a rude manner, and dragged me to the round-house. He was so much in liquor, that he did not recollect that he had given me this watch.</p>

On 29th Aug. the prisoner came to my house with Mr. Whitewood—I did not know the prisoner before—he called for a pint of ale, which I served him with—the conversation commenced by the prisoners saying to Whitewood, "If you will go with me to the Chatham, and say you know me, you will do me a kindness, and I shall be much obliged to you"—Whitewood answered directly, "I have no objection"—they were drinking and talking, and the prisoner produced this advance note—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st Aug.</hi>, 1856, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable to William Mennie, thirteen days after the sailing of the ship Same, Captain Coyle, provided the said William Mennie sailed in the said vessel; signed, George Cole, addressed to Alexander Dunn, Lime-street)—the prisoner said the landlord of the Earl of Chatham was going to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I read the note; and when I came to the I name of William Mennie, the prisoner said, "That is my brother"—he said, "Well, governor, you can have it if you like; the vessel sailed last Monday"—this was on Friday—I said, "The money can be drawn then"—he said, "Yes; you or anybody can draw the money; if you like to give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it you shall have it"—I said, "Has your brother sailed in the vessel?"—he said, yes, he has—I said, "Are you certain of it?"—he said, "Yes, I am; he sailed in it, or I should not bring the note to you, or to any one else, to cash—Whitewood is a neighbour of mine, a tradesman, and he said he knew the man, and whatever transactions he had had with him he had found him upright, and, had he the money by him, he would have cashed the note for him—I believed the statement, and gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and received the note from him—next morning I took the note to Mr. Dunn, in Lime-street, and was refused payment—on the Monday I went down to see if I could see the prisoner, but could not—I gave him the money, believing Mennie was his brother, and that the vessel had sailed on the Monday previous.</p>

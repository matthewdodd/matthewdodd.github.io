                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Carter and Bell—we are solicitors to Messrs. Thomas Brown and Co., and have acted in the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy proceedings from the time the proceedings were taken in the Bankruptcy Court—we are acting as agents for the Treasury in this prosecu<lb></lb>tion—there is no foundation for any suggestion that there was at any time any desire or intention to take money from Downton to stop the prosecution—after his examination, and the disclosure of the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we required payment of the money, and did not get it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. F. FULTON</hi>. Downton's examination was on the 22nd of January—this letter is signed by me for my firm. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "30th January, 1879. Sir,—Re Henry Stanborough. The trustee is advised that the steps you took in relation to the business of the bankrupt as to selling the goodwill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the stock for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were not lawful as against the creditors, and we have therefore to apply to you for the pay<lb></lb>ment of 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if not paid to move the Court in respect thereof. Will you be good enough to say whether you are prepared to pay this to the trustee, or any part thereof? Signed, Carter and Bell.") Mr. Cooper Willis advised that the money belonged to the creditors—the trustee is not informed of every step taken in bankruptcy; we hold his retainer, and we do what is necessary—the letter was written in consequence of Mr. Cooper Willis's advice—Mr. Downton was first examined at great length, and then on the 30th we wrote that letter—the order for this prosecution was dated the 7th March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. This is the answer to our letter of the 30th January. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "4th February, 1879. Messrs. Carter and Bell, re Stanborough. In reply to your request for the payment of the sum of 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by me to the trustee of the above estate, I beg to say I am not prepared to pay that or any other sum. A. Downton.") The application to the Court was by the advice of Mr. Willis to apply in the Bankruptcy Court to get the money—on getting Downton's letter we proceeded to the Court, and took their directions upon the whole matter—there was no view at all of getting money for the purpose of stifling the prosecution.</p>

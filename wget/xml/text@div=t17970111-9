               <p>Q. Was any thing said before you went out, for what purpose you were to go out? - A. No; James Waring asked me to take a walk up the Bethnal-green-road.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say for what? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said about the letter? - A. His mother said she had got the paper, nor ink; we went out together, and when we got into Bethnal-green-road there was a shop open, and Waring stuck his knife into the putty and broke the window; he told us to stop just as he got to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he was going to do there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk about what you were going to do before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not ask him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to Milton and Green? - A. Not that I heard; he cut the window, and broke the glass, and took the things out of the window: two shawls, and two pieces of lace, a white piece and a black piece, some ribbon, some black shoe-strings, and a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you and your companions do while he was so employed? - A. We stood over the way; and young Green brought me some pieces of ribbon which he had taken from the same shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Milton do? - A. I did not see him do any thing, he was standing the other side of the way, and walking backwards and forward; Waring told him to watch, and if any body was coming by, to whistle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Milton go to the place where he was told, and walk backwards and forwards? - A. Yes; and some persons went by, and Milton whistled, and then he came away from the window; a man saw the window, I believe, and then he ran away. Waring and the sweep ran over to me, and told me to take the things home to Waring's mother; I took the shawls from the window from Waring, I carried them to Waring's mother, while they went down Brick-lane; they told me to come and meet them, and I did, I left them at Mrs. Waring's; I put them upon a bit of a counter that is there, and Mrs. Waring saw me; I told her Jem took them out of a window; she looked at them, and put them upon a little shelf, and covered them with a little bit of cloth, and then we all went to the mother's, and she cut the ribbon in pieces, I had two yards and a half, Milton had two yards and a half, and Waring had two yards and a half, and the shoe-strings were given to the mother, and Green had the same, two yards and a half; the shawls the mother bought of us, the gave eighteen-pence for the dark shawl, and nine-pence-halfpenny for the other; we all had the money divided among us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Honesty, you know that by giving evidence here, you are come to save yourself from being tried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in a Court of Justice before? - A. I have never been in confinement before in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110028"></xptr>Q. When did you tell this story for the first time; was it before the 
Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. You never told the story till after you were taken up for the felony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Peach). Q. Did I understand you right, when I supposed you to say, that when, after you had been at Mrs. Waring's, and found the shawl, you did not take her into custody? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. And then she herself came to the office, and then she was taken up? - A. Yes; she came to her son, and then she was detained.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Ivy. There is no mark upon these shawls, but they answer the pattern exactly; the white lace and the shoe bows answer the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say, there is not one article but what you know, merely by bearing a similitude to what you lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you don't mean to swear to their being your's, but from the pattern? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The shawls are a very common pattern? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other things are common patterns? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose ribbons of that sort, and of those different colours? - A. Yes, exactly the same sort; there was about seventeen yards of this satin ribbon; of this blue ribbon I don't know how much there was.</p>

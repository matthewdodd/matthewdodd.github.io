             sworn. - I am warehouseman to Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman: On Tuesday, the 3d of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I employed six men with knots to remove this fruit to No. 90, Lower Thames-street; the prisoner was one; we numbered the knots, and No. 5, did not come in; I went out and met No. 6; I had information that No. 5 was gone up St. Mary-hill; I went up St. Mary-hill into Gracechurch street, but could not see any thing of him; I then returned home and found the prisoner it our house; he had been stopped; it was a barrel containing raisins, weighing 100 cwt. and 4lb.; the prisoner said a woman desired him to carry it to No. 54, Milford-lane; the cask is marked F. P. L. and the other barrels that were landed that day had the same mark; my master is liable for the goods as soon as we take them up from the quays.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk with Messrs. Clarke and Anstey, fruit-brokers, Philpot-lane; I met the prisoner on the 3d of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, in Philpot-lane, which is about half a mile from the quay; he had a cask of raisins on his back, which I knew by the mark to belong to a parcel then laying at Ralph's quay, which were to be warehoused at Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman's, from which I suspected he was not in the right road; I asked him where he was going with it; he told me to No. 54, Milford-lane; I asked him where that was; he said through Temple-bar; I asked him to whom there; he could not tell me; I then took him to Mr. Aylwin's, and left the cask at No. 40, Philpot-lane; I left him in custody, and the constable fetched the barrel. (Lindsey, a constable, produced the property).</p>
               <p>Everitt. I desired him to bring the barrel to No. 90, Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was employed by that man as he says, and the knots were all numbered; there was another man with me, and we had forgot the name of the place we were to take them to; I was going back with the barrel when this gentleman stopped me; he helped me with it off my shoulder, and we both went together.</p>

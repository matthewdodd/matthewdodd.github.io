                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">A prisoner</hi>). I have come from Pentonville Prison, where I am undergoing sentence—I know the prisoners—my acquaintance with them commenced about last October—I think I first saw Noble at the Alexandra Park with Maxwell—Maxwell proposed to me, in Noble's presence, to go down into the country and represent myself as a cattle dealer, and to send up meat to different salesmen—this took place at the Star and Garter in Poland Street—they told me to get cheques from different people and bring them to them, and they would alter them into a larger amount—at that time I was living at 70, Margaret Street, Clerkenwell—Maxwell was living in Crownfield Street, Leytonstone Road, Stratford, and Noble at 18, Poland Street, Oxford Street, within a few yards of the Star and Garter—I was out of employment at the time—I never knew the prisoners to do anything—Maxwell told me, in Noble's presence, to go down to Watford, that being a market town, and send up things from there, and to go and stay at St. Albans and buy things there—I did so, in the name of Ellis, and sent up meat to Dean and Hatton, and Lee and Cowall, and Thomas Wylde and Sons—in return for that meat I received crossed cheques—I gave them to the prisoners, they were both together at the Star and Garter; they said they would have to get a banking account—the cheques were shown to Noble—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them, it is made out in the name of Ellis—I gave the cheques to Maxwell and he took them away—I saw him fill this one in afterwards—they were trying for some time to find a place to open a banking account—on the Monday I and Maxwell went down into the City together and he went to Barnett, Hoare, and Co.—Maxwell ascertained from a book he had that they had country agents—Noble was there at the time, in the parlour at the Star and Garter—I don't know whether Noble was there while he was looking at the book; he knew we were going to Barnett's—Maxwell was going there to send some money from there down to Messrs. Stevens and Blandy's bank, at Heading—I went there with him—we left Noble in Poland Street—at first Maxwell was going to send me in, and then he went in himself and did it—when he came out he made a communication to me—I went down to Beading that day with Maxwell—he was looking about for a place that would do for an office—we returned to town and saw Noble that evening in Poland Street—I think that was on 22nd December—I know it was on a Monday—we told him we had been down to Beading, and that 2001. had been sent down there in the name of Hunt, and I was to go down there and represent myself as Hunt—Noble joined in the con<lb></lb>versation, and we made arrangements that me and Maxwell were to go down to Reading next day to see if we could find a place either for apart<lb></lb>ments or offices—we did go, and engaged apartments at 42, Zinzan Street, in the name of Edward Hunt—I paid"half a sovereign in advance for a week's rent—Maxwell gave me the money to pay—we returned to town and told Noble we had been down and engaged apartments there in the name of Hunt—Maxwell told me to get some bill heads printed and appear to set up in business as a cattle dealer—he said, in Noble's presence, that he should send a letter to me at the place where I had engaged apart<lb></lb>ments, as if it came from a Mr. Soames, the man that had sent the money, stating that he was glad to hear I had set up in business there, and I was to take that letter to the bank to show my authority for drawing this money out—I went to Reading and there received the letter—an arrange<lb></lb>ment</p>

               <p>was made as to references; Maxwell said he would send some some letters—I don't know whether Noble was present at that time, but he knew what he was going to do—on 3rd January I went down to Reading with the letter that Maxwell had written—I think that letter has ben destroyed—I went to the bank and showed it—to the clerk and drew out 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a cheque which the clerk wrote out and I signed—I had a cheque book—I then returned to town and went to the Star and Garter between 1 and 2 o'clock—I waited till 5 or 6, and then Maxwell and Noble come in together—I told them what I had done, and showed them the pass-book and cheque-book, and I gave Maxwell the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 5th January Maxwell gave me a letter to go down to Greenwich with some foreign money in it, and a day or two afterwards I called there and received a reply to it containing a cheque of Venables and Co., of King William Street, for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the proceeds of the foreign money—I paid that in to my account at Heading, after Maxwell had endorsed it, and I endorsed it as well—I received it at the Greyhound Inn, at Greenwich, in the name of Carter—I saw Noble that same night—I showed him the cheque I had got from Venables—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at this time an arrangement was made about the engagement of a clerk—Noble said that he knew of a young man that would do; he was going to put an advertisement in the paper, and I was to answer it—the advertisement was put in and I answered it and engaged a person named Wordley, who came down to me at Reading on Saturday, 10th—I think I first saw Wordley at Paddington; I had seen him before, I don't know where, in company with both the prisoners—I was told by Maxwell, but Noble was present at the time, to buy dead meat and send up to the people I had got the cheques from—on Monday, the 12th January, I purchased some pigs from Charles Lampe, to the amount of about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and consigned them to Dean and Hatton, Central Meat Market, Smithfield, and in return, on 15th September, I received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by post for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took it up to London and gave it to Maxwell at the Star and Garter on the Friday evening—Noble was there at the time—Maxwell said he would take it home and alter it—that was in Noble's presence—I don't know whether he made any remark about it, but he stopped there—I stopped there with him—on the Saturday Maxwell brought the cheque down to me at Reading; it was then altered to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I endorsed it in the name of Edward Hunt, and, sent it by Wordley to the bank—I had taken Wordley with me to the bank and told them that any cheque I sent signed "Self" that were to pay him; I don't know on what day that was, it was Tuesday or Wednesday, before the cheque was paid in—I came back to town on Sunday, the day after paying in the cheque—Maxwell came back on the Saturday—on Sunday morning, the 18th, I received this cheque from Lee and Cowell; it was then for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on coming to town on that Sunday I went to my mother's house, 70, Margaret Street; I brought up the cheque with me; Maxwell met me at my mother's, and I gave him the cheque—I had drawn out 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cheque on the Saturday, the 17th, at Beading, and I gave 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it to Noble at his own house in Poland Street—I told him that I had paid in the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I saw Noble again on the Monday evening, the 19th, in Poland Street—Maxwell said in his presence that he was going to alter the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and what amount he was going to alter it to—on Tuesday, the 20th, about 10 a.m., I met Wordley</p>

Beading notes to change at Barnett Hoare's; they were the notes I had given him on the Sunday night—I got them changed into gold at Barnett's—Noble said he did not want to be seen about there—he went on, and I was to meet him at a hairdresser's shop in Bishopsgate Street—I went there and gave him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remained in town that night—I was with Noble up to 5 or 6 in the evening—next morning, Wednesday, the 21st, I met Noble, Maxwell, and Garrett at the Underground Railway at Praed Street, and I and Noble and Garrett went to Beading—Maxwell gave me these two cheques, Lee and Co well's and Thomas Wylde's; they then represented 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 890l—I had the pass-book and the cheque-book—we conversed on the way down; they said what they were going to do—Noble was present when these altered cheques were given to me—Noble said when we got to Beading that I was to go on and not take any notice, and they were to see if any one was looking out—I was to stay some distance away from the bank, and Noble and Garrett were to go and stand near the bank to see if Wordley-got the money—I was to write out two cheques, one for 230?., and send in, and if we got that I was to write another for a smaller amount and send in and pay the other two cheques in—that arrangement was made in Noble's presence before we went down, and it was referred to by him on the way down—when we got to Beading I saw Wordley outside the station—I went straight on down the road alone some distance from the station—I went into a little public-house on the road on the way to the barracks—Noble and Garrett were following on behind—Noble went into the public house with me—we had something to drink, and Noble borrowed a pen and ink of the landlord when he came in to serve us, and I wrote out the two cheques, one for 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I endorsed the other two—that was in Noble's presence—I gave them all to Noble, but he gave them back to me, except the one for 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave that to Wordley, who was outside in the main road with Garrett—this was about half-past 10 in the morning—Wordley then went on to the bank, Noble and Garrett followed; they told me to stop behind—I remained some distance behind—Noble said I was to wait there and they were to come back after getting the money for the 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I retained the altered cheques and the pass-book—as they were rather a long while gone I went to see where they were, and met Wordley coming back in custody of Detective Randall—I then threw away the cheques and pass-book in a timber yard, and I went to some other station and got back to town—I saw Noble about 7 or 8 that evening in Poland Street—I and Maxwell met him—he said he had had a narrow escape, he had been very nearly taken, he had to run for it; he said that he had walked some distance, he did not know where, but he got in at some different station</p>

               <p>and got back to London—he said that Garrett and Wordley were taken—he asked me what had become of the cheques and the pass-book—I told him I had thrown them away—they were very much put out about that and said I ought to have destroyed them—I said I did not know what to do with them; I wanted to get rid of them—they said I had better get away for some time—I said I had nowhere to go and had no money to go away with—they said did not I know of any place where I could go and stay—I said I could only go to my sister's—they said I had better go there for a time, and they would come and see me and let me know how things were going on—my sister lives at Myrtle Cottage, Cdbbold Road, Starch Green, Shep<lb></lb>herd's Bush—they said they did not want to get away then because they had not been seen in it—I continued at my mother's for a week or two after this—I saw Noble and Maxwell very frequently, always together, in Poland Street, and Finsbury Park, and Wood Green—I eventually went to my sister's at Myrtle Cottage; that was before Garrett and Wordley were tried—Noble said I had better keep quiet down there; that was after I had got there; his wife came down there—on the Sunday after I had been there he met me by his wife's appointment in the New Road, Hammersmith, outside the Railway Tavern, near the station—he came again with Maxwell one Sunday afternoon—they said it was very warm for me; Noble said I had better go away from there, hut Maxwell advised me to stop there; he said it would be all right if I kept quiet—he said "It is very warm for you; they only seem to want you n—Noble said he was going to Italy; would 1 go with him and do something there; he said he could get some money, and he could take me with him, and that would be out of the way—Max<lb></lb>well said he thought of going to Liverpool; they had got something to do there—he said he knew of something there; that he could get a cheque and alter—it there—I knew Noble by the name of Dan, Dan Noble, and Maxwell by the name of Jim, Jim Maxwell—I also knew Noble by the name of Dyson; he used that as a surname, but I believe it is his Christian name; he was sometimes called Mr. Dyson; I saw him twice while I was at Shep-herd's Bush, and his wife twice—I remained indoors most of the time there—I was apprehended there on 10th March—I had a letter from one of them, I don't know which, on the Saturday after I was there, telling me to keep quiet—I did not see either of them after 10th March—I was committed for trial and pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude—the day after I communicated with the authorities of the Bank of England—I gained nothing at all by participating in this fraud; in fact 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am one of the warders of Newgate—I saw Noble write this paper on 22nd May, and sign it "Daniel Dyson Noble"—the signature to this letter is written by the same person to the best of my belief. Gross-examined by Mr. Besley. I had seen him write previously—I did not study the character of his writing—I did not expect to be a witness.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The letter was partly read; it was from Noble to hit wife, dated March 11th, 1880, and stating that he should leave for Rorme on Saturday.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>). I am a native of Ireland; I have confessed myself guilty of this crime—I do not think Noble was present when it was arranged between me and Lester, that Lester should go to Heading in the name of Hunt—Noble had not been at Heading that I know of before 21st January, but after Wordley was taken I told Noble that I was in this scheme of forgery—I owed Noble first 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he pressed me to pay him, and I told him I would pay him on Wednesday, 21st January—I saw him the day before in Poland Street, and told him if he would meet me next day he could go to Beading, and Lester would meet him there and pay him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but previous to that I had paid him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw him in the morning at Praed Street, and told him to go with Lester to Heading, and Lester would give him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lester was there—Noble never saw the altered cheque that I am aware of; we parted company at the station, and he went to Beading with Lester—I did not see him again for several days—I went with him one Sunday and his wife and daughter to Lester's sister's house—I told Noble of the scheme before going down to Mrs. Hope's on the Sunday—I knew of his going down on the Tuesday before; I told him to go there, and tell Lester if he saw him to get away—I have passed some time in America, but did not know Noble there</p>

               <p>—he has never had anything to do with altering cheques that I am aware of—he was not to get any of the money abstracted from the Heading hank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Noble about two years in London; he has been a friend of mine the whole time; our families are slightly known to each other—I am a betting man, and have been attending races for two years—I mostly get my living by betting—I have in this case taken out the ink from a cheque, and filled it np in a feigned writing to look like as original—I have never done it before; I mean that this is the first one I have done—I never did any in America—Noble had money at times; he lent me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and gold at the close of November, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. early in November—he has borrowed from me several times, and I have borrowed from him—he did not press me till after November—I paid the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the bank in the name of Soames—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that was not Noble's money; some of it was my own; I do not know that any of it was Noble's, only what I borrowed—I have not been in prison in America, and never escaped from gaol—I did not go by the name of Salone there—I was a commercial traveller—I do not know Walters, who used to alter cheques—I only went occasionally to Noble's when he lived at 18, Poland Street—I went up to his room—I read him at the Star and Garter, and Lester (came there occasionally—we have all three been there when others have been present—we have been in the parlour and the billiard-room together in November, December, and January—Lester used some of his own money to get some cheques; I do not think he brought them to the Star and Garter—I altered three cheques in this case—I knew Garrett slightly, but only about a month before I went to Reading—I did not associate with him; I do not know Mrs. Tyler's, 51, Lindley Street—I saw Wordley first at the Alexandra Palace; he and Lester were together—I did not take Lester to Wordley—I met Noble at Praed Street; I did not see them off by the train; I left them at the station—I knew what Lester was going to Reading for; it was to draw out part of the proceeds of the altered cheque—it is true that I gave him part of the proceeds of three other altered cheques, Lee's, and Covills, and Wilde's—I do not think I saw the pass-book—I suppose the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was credited by thai time—I do not know what Garrett was to go down for; he was not to watch the bank that I know of—Noble was to go to Reading to receive the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Lester, instead of waiting for Lester to come up, because he said that he was pressed for the money, and wanted to go away—I did not explain to Noble how Lester, a man out of place, was to get 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a bank at Reading—I had told Noble the night before that Lester would give it to him—I went to Lester's sister's house once—I did not see him that very night; Lester told me that same night that Wordley and the other man were taken—I saw Noble two days after 21st January at a public-house in Shoreditch—he did not say that he ran away from Reading because he saw the police, he said that Lester left him, that he went to Reading and waited, and he did not come—I was living at Stratford; I left there about 5th March, and went to Liverpool, leaving no address behind me—when I was arrested I said that 1 did not know Noble's meaning, that I know nothing bad about him—I never mentioned anything to the officer about my owing Noble this money—I do not know that Noble left Poland Street and went abroad on the day that Wordley and Graham were sentenced—I went to see him once at Graham Road—I did not know that he had gone to Italy—I was taken in Liverpool.</p>

               <p>when the account was opened, and only occasionally came to London—I saw Noble in Lester's company before he went to London and assumed the character of a cattle dealer—I have seen them together in Shoreditch, and at the Alexandra Palace, and several places—I did not introduce Lester to him—Lester was making a book—I was never present with Lester when there was any conversation with respect to the Beading business and the cheques—Noble has known me for two years as a betting-man, and I him—he was apparently betting at the Alexandra Palace on several occasions—Lester was supposed to be lodging at Reading, but no arrangement was made for him to remain there; Lester went down to Beading at 9 o'clock, and he was to meet me that evening or next day in London—I did not see Noble that evening, but I saw Lester—I saw Noble several days afterwards; Noble was not present when these two cheques were altered to 890<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he never saw them in my presence—I gave them to Lester one morning at the station; I think it was in a public-house—Miller was present, but he did not see me hand them, as I did not want to let him; as far as I know and believe Noble had no knowledge of the altered cheques.</p>

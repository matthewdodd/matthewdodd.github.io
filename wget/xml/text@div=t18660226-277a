I am the wife of William Lack, a shoemaker, and live at 107½, Brick-lane—he is not in England just now, and I keep the shop—on 21st January, I was awoke at twenty minutes to 4 in the morning by the officer who had taken the prisoner in custody—three shutters had been taken down, and a pane of glass was cut out sufficient for a man's body to get through—at first I only missed a bundle of morocco, worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—which I thought I would not say anything about, as I hoped the case would be then settled at Worship-street; but afterwards I found I had lost as much</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 124). I was on duty on 21st January, in Brick-lane, and heard the crash of glass breaking—I saw the prisoner running away from the door of the prosecutrix's house down St. John-street—he turned back and met me—I went up to him, and catching hold of him said, "Where are you going to?"—he said, "I am going home"—I took him back to the place from which the noise seemed to have proceeded, and found two bars broken, the shutters thrown on one side, and a pane of glass broken out, large enough for a man to get through—I called up the pro<lb></lb>secutrix—afterwards I went down the street, and found in different places, two bits of leather, and at the railway arch to which the prisoner had gone, and from which he was returning when I took him into custody, I found the little bundle produced—this book I found under the window—I charged the prisoner with burglary—he cursed and swore and said he did not do it—I could not see when he was running first whether he had anything in his hand or not—there was no one else about anywhere to be found.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you ask me where I was going to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did not ask you if you knew anything about the window—I told the Magistrate at Worship-street, that I lost sight of you for a few seconds—it was only a few seconds—I am sure I did not tell the Inspector at the police-station, that I could not be sure you were the party.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any doubt about the prisoner's identity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he had no cap on when I saw him running towards the arch, and he had not one when he turned back, and I met him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Could not persons have found their way out at the end of Johnson-street through the railway-arch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and there are several other thoroughfares.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The policeman says I went down the turning, and come up the turning, that was my way home; I had come from Mile-end, and had been drinking in the night with my shopmates; I don't know exactly what time I left the public-house, but I was perfectly sensible, and was going home to my sister's, that was my nearest way; there is egress at both ends of the street, and on both sides of the way down the street; if I had done it, I should not have attempted to come back that way, when I could have got off without; I was discharged for this last Sessions, and I went back to my work, and the policeman took me again afterwards; if I had been guilty, I should have gone elsewhere instead of going back to my work, where the policeman would know where to find me.</p>

The witness is liable to make a mistake in a man after five years; I never worked in a shoemaker's shop in a prison in my life, so that I know the man must be mistaken; I have been working as a shoemaker, until I was taken into custody, and the policeman took me from my work when he took me the second time; he waited while I finished two pair of boots off. <hi rend="italic">

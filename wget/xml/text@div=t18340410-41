            . I am a police-officer. On the 12th of March I was at a house where the prisoner was - I understood she had picked up a note - I sent for her, and asked her to let me look at it; she did, and I put down the number in my pocket-book - I then went to the station, and told the police-constable - in about half an hour Evans came to me and said he had lost a note - I gave him a direction where to find the prisoner - the prisoner afterwards called on me, and asked me what she was to do - I said, as it had been lost by a servant, she could not expect the same compensation from him as from another - I went to the prisoner in the evening with Miss Brown - she then said she had sent to town and cashed the note, and must abide by all the consequences, and she told the magistrate so the next morning - the bank clerk described the person who got change for the note, and he answered the description of the prisoner's husband.</p>

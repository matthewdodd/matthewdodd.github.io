             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. On Monday the 28th of July, about twelve o'clock at noon, I went, in company with Ray, Ferris, and a woman of the name of Lack, to <placeName id="t18000917-1-crimeloc3">No. 2, Ebenezer-court, Cherry-tree-alley, in the parish of St. Luke's</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did Lack make her appearance when you first went into the house? - A. Yes; but, I believe, not so soon as I did; up one pair of stairs hung this bed-gown, with this dirty appearance that it has now, (producing it ); in the chimney corner, where there was no stove, lay this piece of linen, it was then very wet, and the liquid had drained upon the hearth, it appeared to have been used with aqua-fortis, or nitre-fortis and salt; Ray then being in the room with Mrs. Tunstall, I desired him to search her person; I heard Ray say, have you any thing about you; nothing, she said; she was searched, and I saw, I think, twenty-six counterfeit shillings, and eighteen counterfeit sixpences, taken from her, they were in a bag; I was then called down by Ferris, I went down, and some counterfeit blanks, not finished, were produced to me by Ferris, which he has got; I was then called into the room over the one pair of stairs, which had a sky-light, which went out of the bed-chamber, and there I saw a bench, (producing the top of it), and a box containing other things, which Ray has got; then we brought her and the things away; we had Lack with us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not find any thing but what you have produced? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no aqua-fortis found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither by you or any of the other officers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This place, where you found the gown, was in a room where Lack had access? - A. Yes; She said she and the prisoner laid together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Lack's father is? - A. A porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever taken up? - A. Yes, for having bad money upon him; but was discharged.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was with Armstrong and Ferris; we left Ferris at the bottom of the house, and I went up stairs with Armstrong; I asked Mrs. Tunstall if she had got any thing about her; she said, no, she had not; she was very willing to let me search one pocket, and then she turned her side to the wall, and said there was nothing in that pocket; I then put my hand into her pocket and pulled out this bag, containing twenty-six shillings and eighteen sixpences, (produces a paper bag); they were then in a sit state for circulation; I then went up into the two pair of stairs room, above the sleeping room, where I found this bench, and this box, containing corks, scowering-paper, and files; on the bench laid this file, and this cork, and a pair of pliers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those ingredients necessary to carry on this business? - A. I have not a doubt of it; these two punches I found, which correspond with the impression upon the shillings. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you say you found every thing necessary to carry on the business, you do not mean to say that without the assistance of aqua-fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any bottle of aqua-fortis? - A. No; we found a bottle that seemed to have had some in it.</p>

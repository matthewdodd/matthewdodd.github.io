                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, keeping the Horse Shoe, in the Goswell Road—in May, 1876, Field offered himself as barman in my service—I asked him who was his last employer—he said Mr. Hart<lb></lb>land, of 182, St. George's Road, Peckham—I told him to make an appointment for me to meet Hartland the next day at 11 o'clock—I went the next day to 182, St. George's Road—I was shown into a front room in a house on the ground floor—Hartland was there—I said I had come respect<lb></lb>ing Field's character, and asked, "Is Field honest, sober, and industrious, and a good barman?"—he said "Yes"—I said I wanted such a person, because I was very much out of the business driving, and I wanted some one I could depend upon—Hartland said Field was a very good young man, and well up to his business, that he (Hartland) had been in busi<lb></lb>ness in Rotherhithe, I think, and if he went into business again, he should be pleased to take Field back—Field afterwards came to me, and asked if his reference was satisfactory—I said "Yes," and engaged him—he remained four or five mouths—I noticed some one frequently coming to the bar—Field said he was a detective—I never noticed him before Field came nor after—Field was discharged for bad language and assault—some one came for his character—I declined to give one—Hartland came twice—the first time he asked me why Field had left—I told him—he said, "You must look over these things in young men; you ought to give him a character"—I said I would not—he said, "It is very hard for a young man, you know; perhaps you have got sons of your own"—I said I should not think of giving Field a character—Hartland then went away—he came a second time about the character within a month or six weeks—I said "No," and he left—a Mr. Hornby had applied for Field's character.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hartland</hi>.

I keep the George, 238, Waterloo Road—on 17th August, 1876, after seeing an advertisement, Milton came to me in the name of William Matthews, and offered himself as barman—I asked him where he had been living—he said "With Mr. Hartland, at the Duke of York, Adam Street, Rotherhithe"—I asked him how long he had lived with Mr. Hartland—he said "Two years"—I asked why he left—be said because Mr. Hartland had disposed of his house through ill health, and the new people did not require him—I asked him where I might see his late employer—he said at 47, Lorrimore Road, Walworth, and I went there and saw Hartland—it is a private house—Hartland was in the ground-floor front room—I said I had come about the character of William Matthews—he said "Quite right"—I said "How long has he been in your employ?"—he said "Two years"—I said "Where?"—he said "At my late house, the Duke of York, Adam Street, Rotherhithe"—I asked him if he was honest, sober, and understood his business—he said "Yes, like all barmen, they want looking after," that he had left him because he had disposed of his house through ill health, and that as soon as he got into business again he would take him into his employ—he said he had just disposed of his house—I next saw Matthews on 18th August, and told him that from the character I had received from Hartland I should take him into my employ—he entered my service on the 19th as barman—the same day, my manager having spoken to me, I called him into the bar parlour on the 21st, and in the presence of Inspector Witney said, "From information I received since you have been in my employ your conduct is very suspicious; I find a deficiency in my takings, and I find that you have obtained this situation by a false character"—he said "I have not robbed you"—I said "If you have not robbed me you have obtained this situation by a false character; you said you were single"—he said "I am very sorry; I am a married man; all Mr. Hartland said was wrong, I never was in his service"—he cried and asked me to let him go for the sake of his wife and children—I did so—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Peckham's son, who is now solicitor to the Licensed Victuallers' Protection Society—Mr. Peck<lb></lb>ham, sen., was my partner—he died early this month—in December, 1876, a Mr. Wood, who kept the White Hart, Long Acre. and a barman were under remand at Bow Street for conspiracy—on 18th December, 1876, I was with Mr. Whitnall at my offices in Doctors' Commons—I saw Mr. Peckham write this memorandum of an interview with Hartland—there was then no charge against Hartland—Witney was present to get in<lb></lb>formation—Matthews's name was mentioned—I have frequently looked at this paper—Hartland was told by Mr. Peckham that Matthews had obtained a situation with Mr. Simpkins by a character given from the White Horse, Long Acre, and he was asked whether he knew Matthews—he said he did not—he was asked to give a personal description of him—I only recollect two points in the description, that he was a tall man, and dark, or that he had dark hair—Hartland was then asked where he himself was residing, and he said at 64, Carlisle Street, Lambeth—Mr. Peckham then asked him as to his connection with William Wood, of the White Horse, Long Acre, who was then under remand from Bow Street—he said Wood had been in his employment at the Duke of York as barman for a short time—he was asked what Wood did after he left the Duke of York, and he gave some particulars which I do not recollect—all the questions were put by Mr. Peckham—nothing further passed with regard to Matthews—I have my call-book—there is a pencil tick made by me which enables me to say positively—the interview took place on Monday, 18th December, 1876—Mr. Peckham had nothing to do with this prosecution—he was ill—he may have called on Hartland in January, 1877, but not since.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Buck. My Lord, I am humbly obliged to you for your advice, but I can bring people to my character.</p>
               <p>Court. As for the man, it will be very fit for him to prepare for a future state; because one of such a gang, as I much suspect him to be, cannot expect any mercy here.</p>

On the 13th of October, about eleven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290011"></xptr>oclock at night, I had been drinking a few pints of beer at a public-house from eight o'clock till eleven; I was sober. I saw the prisoners standing at the corner of the Brown Bear public-house, in Moorfields. I had seen Edgar about Bethnal-green before, but never spoke to him. I asked them if they would have any thing to drink? they refused. I never spoke to them before. They said, "Go and get something yourself." I went into the public-house and had a glass of gin. I came out in about ten minutes, they were still there. West asked where I lived? I said, at Bethnal-green; they both said they lived there, and would see me home. They went as far as Brick-lane with me, which is about a mile and a half. When we got to Spicer-street, they both said, "You had better go down here;" I said I would not, I would go down Bethnalgreen; they said it would cut off a corner, and went down. When I got to George-court, which is near my house, they both said, "You have got money about you, and we will have it." I said, "You shall not." I had told them I had 24l. - when I came out of the house I happened to mention it. One of them held me while the other took it out of my pocket - I was nearly on the ground with the hustling; they did not strike me. I called out murder! they ran away. I called out, Stop thief! Edgar was taken in about an hour. I had received the notes of Mr. Ford, of Wood-street, he is my master. I had taken three of them a fortnight before; the others I received three years ago on board a ship, in which I was near eleven years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had 21l. in your pocket, which you had received three years ago - A. Yes; 21l. was brought from sea. The person next door to me had been robbed four nights before, and I put the money into my pocket to secure it. I only had the money in my pocket about three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. The person had been robbed four nights before, why did you not put them in your pocket then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q.This is a strange story; the house was broken open four nights before, and on this night you put the money into your pocket for safety - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you see two men, whom you never spoken to before, and tell them you had the money about you - A. I knew one of their faces. I was a little fresh, but not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not drunk yesterday - A. No. I had kept some of the notes three years. I have heard of a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not accused a man with a highway robbery before - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. About losing your watch - A. I lost a watch. He was taken up, I did not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Do you remember a person coming to you about it - A. No; I had no conversation about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Never! - A. Edgar's father offered me 10l.; I said I would not take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would take it, and swear you was drunk, and did not know one from the other - A.Never. I had two or three pints of porter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to say you had three or four - A. I said so. I had four, or more. When trade was bad, I used to buy clothes and sell them. I was out of work three months, but never parted with my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you the money - A. I know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Name him - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ever saw the money in your possession - A. Mrs. Agnes. I took it out of my pocket to shew her sometime back.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. On what occasion did you shew it to Mrs. Agnes - A. I do not know. I took it out of my box to shew her.</p>

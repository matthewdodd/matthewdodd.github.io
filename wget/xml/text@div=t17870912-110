               <p>I have been at sea almost all my lifetime; I have been home about eleven weeks; I never saw the prisoner before the day she robbed me.</p>

               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - Sober.</p>
               <p>Where was it at? - About a fortnight ago, I saw the prisoner at <placeName id="t17870912-110-crimeloc521">the King's-Arms, in New-Gravel-Lane</placeName>

               <p>How much was the reckoning? - My reckoning was about half a crown.</p>
               <p>Where did you put the guinea? - Upon the table.</p>
               <p>Who took it up? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I saw her.</p>
               <p>What did she say when she took it up? - She did not say a word, but clapped her left hand upon it, and took it up.</p>
               <p>How many people were present? - About half a dozen.</p>
               <p>What were their names? - Here is one here.</p>

               <p>Then she did not go out? - No, not before the constable took her out.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was this? - Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>At night? - No, in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Did she make no excuse for taking of it up? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a plaisterer by trade; I was at this house in Gravel-lane, and I saw this young man sitting in a box right opposite to me; the prisoner came and sat down by him; he have a guinea down upon the table to pay his reckoning, and she clapped her hand upon the guinea; he asked her if she wanted to rob him? and she said, Yes, you bloody b - gg - r, I do! and she said she would not give it to him again; then one of the servants of the house ran for an officer, and she put it in her mouth, and had it there for ten minutes or thereabouts, then she put it into some part under her petticoats, or some where or other, and when the officer came and she was searched, it could not be found.</p>
               <p>To Loveman. did you ever get your guinea again? - No.</p>

               <p>I was sitting in this house drinking a pint of beer, and I never spoke to him, or he to me, till he challenged me with having stole the guinea; I was searched before I went out of the house, and no such thing was found upon me.</p>

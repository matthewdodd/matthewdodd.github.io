On the 24th of January the watchman alarmed me at four o'clock, and told me my house was broke open; I came down and found the shutters of the kitchen-window down, and two panes of glass taken clean out, and a mahogany tea-chest taken away; that was brought to me about six o'clock broke to pieces; Walker's sister told me he had been out all night, and very likely he knowing the house might come and do it; she took me down to the market where he was; I told him I would forgive him, if he would let me know if he did it; he would not confess; I brought him to the fitting Alderman in Guildhall, there he was cleared; after that, the man where he works at, a paper-stainer's, came and told me there was Ross that worked with Walker was likely to be concerned; I went to him, and told him I would forgive him if he would tell; then he told me that Walker and he did it; we found the tea-spoons by his directions; he went with us to the pawnbroker; he said there were three of them concerned, and that the other boy pawned the spoons; I really believe this is the first offence that Walker has committed.</p>

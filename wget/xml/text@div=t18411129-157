                  </hi>. I am matron of Hans Town School of Industry, Elizabeth-street, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. I live in the house, which is governed by a committee of ladies—I have the sole management of the house—none of the ladies reside there—the prisoner has been under my care there for five years in January. On the 4th of November, between eight and nine o'clock, an alarm of fire was given—I went up stairs to my bed-room, and observed the bed on fire—I got assistance and ex<lb></lb>tinguished it—about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of damage was done—the bed and furni<lb></lb>ture were burnt—the wainscot was injured very trifling—it was not blazing—the floor was a little injured—it was only scorched, and the paint of the wainscot blistered—the governess, who was in the adjoining room, told me of it.</p>

Mr. Fry Elvein, who is minister of the Lock Chapel, and was chaplain of the establishment at the time—Mr. Nevill is the chaplain now.</p>

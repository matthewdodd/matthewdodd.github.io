            ; my husband lost a metal watch the 6th of May; it hanged up by the chimney<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290025"></xptr>piece; I left my door to go to speak to my neighbour; there was no one in the house; when I went to go in again I saw the prisoner Collyer coming down the steps, I asked him what he wanted? he asked me if I sold bread and cheese? I told him no, he might have it at the last house in the railing, and I watched him on to see if he went in, seeing him not go in, but to make up to his companions, and they shuffling on together and looking back, gave me a suspicion, I went in and missed my watch, I came out and gave the alarm; they were pursued after, and the one that took the watch came back to a public house and called for some bread and cheese, and beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go into the house? - I did not, I was told by one that see him go in there; I went and see him there, and left him there and went home, I had young children at home, and I wanted to get home to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken? - Between the hours of two and three.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them? - I cannot say, he was kept there till the other two men were brought to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. You are a married woman you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is your husband? - He is a <rs id="t17930529-12-viclabel58" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Q. Has your husband any partner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been out? - About the space of four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hang the watch there? - It hung there always.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it there when you went out? - Yes, because I left the chair just by it, and I saw it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that you saw it there, or only surmise it was there from being usually hung there? - I saw it there.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was this you saw Collyer at? - A public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was this from your house? - About an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see your watch then? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I was drinking of a pot of beer at the Red Lion at Acton; I heard an oration there was a watch lost in the town, and I went out to the door, and I saw two of the people going up the hill, two of the prisoners at the bar, the two outside ones, under Mr. Venn's garden wall, they made a bit of a scuffle and put their hands underneath their breasts, I cannot say what for, but afterwards I found this here crow underneath the nettles close to the wall, then I thought by that, by the watch being lost it might be thrown over the garden wall, and I went and asked the gentleman's gardener to let me go into the garden, whereof he did, and I could not find any thing the first time, then I went in the second time, and I found this watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that place you found the watch to the place where you saw the man? - They went up to the top of the wall and turned round, and it lay at the top of the wall, about twenty yards from where the crow laid; Short and Steele were the men that I saw up there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. What time of the day was this? - Between the hours of two and three.</p>

               <p>Q. A good many people pass that way? - There is; it is the turnpike road to Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners were in no other kind of action than what you have described? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290026"></xptr>Q. Then all you know is, that the prisoners were on one side of the wall, and the watch on the other; the watch is not bruised, nor is the glass broke? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is the wall? - About seven feet high.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

On the 23d of August, the prisoner came to me, and asked if the bundle in the blue apron was done? I said, "from Burton-crescent? she said, Yes. She asked how much they came to? I told her 5d. - she said she had but 4d., and must owe 1d. I told her there was 1d. owing; she said she knew it, and the servant would pay it herself. I asked her if she had brought the silk handkerchiefs? she said she would bring them in half an hour - She took the things with her. I went after her, to see if she carried them home - She went a contrary way. I told her to stop; she would not. I called out, and sent for an officer. I stopped her - She said she would give them to me, if I would let her go. She threw them down, and tried to get away; the officer took her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Beecham, and live at No. 16, China-walk, Lambeth—the house is let out in tenements; the prisoners lived in the garret—they had four children—when he took the room he said he had but two—the baby was a year and ten months old, one boy about ten years old, a girl fourteen, and another boy about six—they lived there five weeks—on 28th Oct., about 2 o'clock, I was at home taking my dinner—I heard a rumbling noise, and just after I heard the baby cry—the rumbling noise came from the attic to the second floor door; I occupied the first floor—the house is only three storeys high—the ground floor has nothing to do with it; it is only a shop separated off—on hearing the noise I instantly went up stairs, and there I saw the baby lying against the second floor door—it had rolled from the attic—I screamed moat dreadfully, and brought the assistance of my sister—the baby was taken up, and brought into my room—it was in a most dirty, filthy, and neglected state; it had but one little flannel round it, and that was as dirty as the gown on your back—it was very dirty—it had nothing on but the piece of flannel; it was naked, except that—its body was in a most miserable state, in a starving state—I gave it some bread and butter, with some sugar to it—it made two mouths at it, and then dropped it—it took it ravenously—it could not partake of it, the food was too heavy—it was a female child—it could not stand by itself—as soon as it took the bread and butter, it ran through it—I had never seen the child before; I did not know there was such a child in the house—I knew the parents by seeing them—some one sent for the landlady and the police—I wrapped the child up in a handkerchief, put it in my ironing blanket, and put it in a warm shawl I had got, and took it with the policeman to the station—it had no warmth in it; it was as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280132"></xptr>
               <p>cold as ice—the body of the child was filthily dirty—the prisoners were not sober pretty nearly all the time they were in the house—the woman was more in liquor than the man—I have seen them drunk very often—he is a shoemaker by trade—I afterwards saw the child dead at the inquest, I think a week afterwards—the prisoners kept, I may say, all hours—the man was at home sooner than the woman, because he has come down to let her in, and she would not come in—I once saw the boy clean, one Sunday; at other times, I always saw him ragged and dirty—the prisoner had work, by what I am given to understand; I do not know anything at all about his work—in my judgment, the child had not been properly taken care of; it had been totally lost by neglect and inattention—if it had had the common attentions of a mother, it would no doubt have been a fine child—it would never have been in the state in which I observed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Patrick Conner.</hi> It is true no one was at home, but I left the girl, fifteen years old, in charge of the child; when I took the place of this old woman, she said she could not let it if there was many children, and asked how many I had, and I said two; I was on strike at the time, and was glad to get any place that was cheap. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not take the room of me, but of Mr. Page, the landlord; he paid 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 133). On Friday, 28th Oct., about half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was called to No. 16, China-walk, Lambeth, and saw the child in last witness's room, lying on the carpet—it was in a most filthy and emaciated state—it had on a dirty piece of flannel, which only partially covered its body—it did not appear to have had any of the proper offices of a mother addressed to it—the flannel was in a very dirty state, and the body also—it appeared very weak, it could scarcely crawl—I directed it to be taken to the station—I went into the garret of the house—I did not find any children there, nor any one at all—the room was in a most filthy condition; it looked as if it had not been cleaned for six months; the dirt completely covered the floor—there was no firing in the place—there were two beds lying on the ground in one corner of the room—it was a shaving mattress, and a flock bed on the top of it—the clothing was one sheet and a dirty blanket; in another corner was another shaving bed, and no bed clothing to it—I did not see any food in the room—after I had examined the room, I endeavoured to find the parents—I went to a public house called the Fountain, in Lambeth-walk, and there found them sitting in front of the bar—that was about an hour after I had ordered the child to be taken to the work house—I did not know them before I took them into custody—they were both the worse for liquor—I afterwards saw the dead body of the child before the Coroner—from the appearance of the child 1 should say it had been properly treated as regards food and nourishment; it had been neglected—I found no money on the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the relieving officers of Lambeth parish I remember the child being brought to the workhouse on 28th Oct.—it was in a most filthy and emaciated state of body; it was the greatest shock I ever had to my feelings when it was uncovered—I afterwards went to the prisoner's room; it was in a most filthy wretched state—there was no table, no fire; two apologies for beds, made of shavings, on the ground, and altogether in the most filthy wretched state—I sought the eldest girl in the neighbourhood, and soon found her—she was shoeless, and in a very dirty and filthy state—I took her with me to identify the parents—I found them at the public-house, and gave them in charge—they were both intoxicated—I examined their room when I was there, to see if there was any food for the children, and there was none, and I also questioned the girl—no application has been made to me by the prisoners for any relief; if he had applied, and he required it, I should most decidedly have afforded it to him—if I had found the children without food, and his room in the state I found it, I should have thought he did require it—that was the object of my visit, to see if they did require it—the child remained in the workhouse eight or nine days; it was attended by the surgeon.</p>

On 28th Oct. my father and mother left home about 10 o'clock in the morning—my father went first, and my mother followed—she said she was going out to try to get us some victuals—we had had nothing to eat from the night before, only a pound of bread; my brother fetched it in about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I was not at home at the time the baby was taken away—on the Thursday my brother and I did a job for a woman that my father had to do, and we got the money for it, and bought a loaf, and brought it home—my father and mother did not provide any food for us on the Thursday—I cannot tell how much of the Thursday they were out—they were not at home very long—I do not know what became of them when they went out—they are in the habit of drinking—they had been drinking for three or four days before the Friday—I remember taking the child to the Waterloo Dispensary on the Thursday—the child had been ailing for some months before—my mother said she was ill, and could not go, and so I took her—my father made me take it—my mother was not well; she had a headache—when my father and mother</p>

               <p>medical officer of the parish of Lambeth. On 28th Oct. I was called to see this child—it had then been washed and dressed, but I found it emaciated to the very last degree—I had it put into a ward, and it was properly clothed and fed, and had medicine—I saw it partake of its food—it took it very ravenously, as if it had been insufficiently supplied with food—I continued to attend to it up to the day before its death, 7th Not.—it rallied for about three days after its admission to the house—at the time I first saw it I believed it to be suffering from mesenteric disease—it would be rash to form any opinion of the source from whence that disease had sprung—it is a disease common among children; it is similar to consumption—after its death I made an examination of the body—I believe that it died from, that disease—I do not know what produced that cause—if a child was left insufficiently provided with food or clothing, that would be the most certain means of producing that complaint—I found that the lungs were affected; there were tubercles in them—that was evidence of a growing disease for some time past.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, if the child, in the state in which you saw it after its death, had been properly cared for, would there have been any reasonable probability of arresting its death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The disease had made too great progress when I saw it—if it had been attacked with that disease constitutionally, the neglect to supply it with sufficient food would decidedly aggravate that disease, and expedite its death—I have been in Court during the examination of the witnesses—I believe from what I have heard stated, that the neglect to provide properly for the child hastened its death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form a judgment of how long standing the tubercular disease in the lungs was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should imagine several months; the disease was not confined to the lungs alone, it extended to the liver, and other organs—it was an organic disease, and that organic disease caused the death; although it might have been hastened by the circumstances to which I have referred—it is not always incurable; so far as I saw it, I should imagine there was no probability of a cure.</p>

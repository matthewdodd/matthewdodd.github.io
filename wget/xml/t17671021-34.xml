               <p>Mrs. Cain. I live in the Fleet-market; a woman brought this gown to me on a Sunday night, about a month ago; I knew nothing of the woman; she asked me if I would buy a gown; I said, I did not want one; she said, it is Sunday night, and I cannot go to the pawnbroker's with it; said I, is it your own; she said it is not, it is the property of one Mrs. Morris, in Salisbury-court; she desired I would lend her 2 s. upon it, and said, she had not had a morsel to day; I lent her 2 s. I said, do you come for the gown to-morrow morning; she said she would; my maid said it is a pretty colour, she should like it, if I could get it for a guinea; I never opened it, nor looked at it; the next morning the woman came, and gave me the money I lent her, and said, if I had a mind for it, the price was 16 s. I said, if there is any dispute about it, bring me my money, and you shall have your gown again; that same day I saw the prisoner, who said it was her gown; I asked her if she had had the money; she said she had; I said, how came you to sell your gown; she said, she sold it for want.</p>

               <p>I never knew that Mrs. Letter had such a gown in her house; the reason I quitted my lodging was, I owed her a little money, and could not pay.</p>

I was to give him change for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I made a feigned assent, and he left the premises—I told Mr. Hays directly—the next evening he came as usual for his beer, and asked me how long I should remain—I told him about three weeks—he said, "You know what I told you last night; if you like to adopt the same plan, we will go halves; it is impossible for them to find us out"—I made a feigned assent, and directly he left I went and told Mr. Hays—I saw no more of him till the Monday evening, when he came about the usual time—he called for a pint of porter, and put down 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—as I was about to give him change, he said, "Not to night, though I am not very particular"—I said, "No, it would not be safe"—I had not the police by me then, to detect him—he went away, and I told my master again—I did not see him again till Tuesday evening—(I was at home on Monday)—he first came about half-past seven—I was not in the bar then, but in the bar-parlour, and could see him—I was receiving the money to detect him with—I told Mr. Hays that was him, and I went round to the bar by a side-door—he was then outside the door, about leaving, and he turned round and nodded to me—at half-past nine he came again, called for half-a-pint of porter, put down 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said, "Is it all right?"—I said, "Yes, I have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for you," and I put the two shillings into his hand, at the top of the 5 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he left immediately—the police, who were in the bar-parlour, followed him out, and took hold of him before he got the money out of his hand—these are the two shillings my master marked for the purpose (<hi rend="italic">produced by Harvey.</hi>)</p>

On the 25th of May at night I left my lantern in my box, while I went to look about the premises; I also left my gloves and keys there - when I returned they were all gone; I saw the prisoner getting over the pailings with the lantern in his hand - I asked what he took them for; he said, it was a lark, and I said, I would take him to the watch-house: he ran away - Campbell stopped him; the keys were found about four yards from my box - I had seen the prisoner before, but he was no friend of mine.</p>

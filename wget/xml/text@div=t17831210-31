               <p>I was going with a knot load to Ratcliffe Cross, and under my right-arm I had a piece of British callicoe containing twenty-one yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the same thing as printed cotton? - The same thing, I put the bundle on the bulk where I pitched my other load, the corner of <placeName id="t17831210-31-crimeloc175">Lime-street</placeName>

               <p>Jury. Was he dressed then as he is now? - He had a brown great coat, and a green coat, and a red plush waistcoat, I had the bundle in my own care all the time, till the prisoner was committed, then it was in the possession of the constable, I wrote my name upon it, it is now in Court.</p>
               <p>Was the bundle that you gave to the constable the same bundle that you picked up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council, Mr. Sylvester. The man turned up Lime-street immediately? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Then you pursued him behind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not then an opportunity of seeing his face? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you laid hold of a man and the bundle, and the man instantly got away? - He crossed over and went about the length<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100058"></xptr> of this place, I saw him by the light of the lamp, I saw him particularly and his clothes, I can swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Round or cocked? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>You could not observe him for a second? - I saw the side of his face when he crossed over, and I particularly took notice of the waistcoat, and the brown coat with the yellow buttons.</p>
               <p>Who took the man? - A taylor, his name is Bull, he gave a false direction, he said, he lived in Hare Court, Aldersgate-street, and he had not lived there for same time.</p>
               <p>How was Bull dressed? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Why you had longer time with him than the prisoner? - He had a rough head of hair, I did not see the man when he was taken, they brought a man to me.</p>
               <p>Which man you never saw before nor knew nothing of him? - I saw him plain enough that night.</p>
               <p>Not plain, friend? - I saw the side of his face, I saw it plain enough.</p>
               <p>You never saw but half of his face? - Yes, I met him in front.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that Bull gave you a false direction or that you could not meet with him? - He gave a direction that he lived No. 9, Hare Court, Aldersgate-street; he had lived there about eight or nine weeks, he was a stout thick man, he had no great coat on.</p>
               <p>Could you mistake Bull for the prisoner? - No, they are as different as any two in the world could be, Bull had a rough head of hair, and the prisoner's hair was tied, I observed that at the time.</p>

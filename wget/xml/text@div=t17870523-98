               <p>Was it not in the very court in which Captain Ogden was robbed, was not there a back door into that court? - I was informed Captain Ogden was robbed in Bell court.</p>
               <p>Was not there a back door out of your friend's house into the court where the Captain was robbed? - No, Sir; there is a back door comes into Bell-court, I was informed it was Charlotte-buildings.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say he was robbed in Bell-court? - I said, I did not know where he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Had your friend a back door into Bell-court? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Have you ever gone out of that back door in your life? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>How lately before the Captain was robbed; how many minutes? - Not that night, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>You do not know Mr. Jordan? - No, Sir; not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you dare to swear you do not know him perfectly? - Yes, I dare swear I do not know him perfectly; I never saw him; never was in company with him; never conversed with him; I do not know that he is in London.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe that he is in one of the galleries? - I do not believe it, and I do not know it.</p>
               <p>I do not ask you whether you know it; upon your oath do you, or do you not believe that he is in Court? - I do not know the man; he may be the man, or he may not; I do not know there is such a man in the world; positively I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know any such man or not; do you positively know any such man as

               <p>But with John? - He may be dead for what I know; I have had no correspondence with a man of the name of Pearson lately; Mr. Pearson is an agent to a man of the name of Jordan; Mr. Pearson is a little relation to me; I believe he is either my uncle or my cousin.</p>
               <p>Which of these do you really believe he is? - They tell me he was my mother's brother; I left home when I was very young.</p>

               <p>You was a buckle-maker when you was in that trouble? - What trouble?</p>

               <p>Was any body with you when you bought this handkerchief? - No, Sir; I gave four shillings for it; it is almost new.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, had not you been in company with Caldwell that very morning? - Upon my oath I had not.</p>
               <p>Are you a married man? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Nor the night before? - Not to my knowledge; I believe I spent my evening at the Fleece in Gough-square; I was going from the Fleece at that time, to the Adam and Eve at Pancrass; not by any particular appointment, merely for a walk, and to spend my evening.</p>
               <p>Any tobacco or any thing of that sort in your pocket that was particular? - Nothing but my gloves and my handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Who is your attorney? - That gentleman.</p>
               <p>Who is he? - I never saw the man before last Tuesday in my life.</p>
               <p>Where did you pick him up last Tuesday? - I was going to Epsom races, and I stopped at the Admiralty Coffee-house, Charing-cross, and I saw that gentleman there; I was talking about it to a friend that was with me, and this gentleman said he was an attorney; and I said I knew no attorney; and he said he would do my business for me.</p>
               <p>So you engaged this attorney at the Admiralty Coffee-house; now tell us his name? - He informed me his name was Ashfield; he said he lived at the Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>How often may you have met him? - I did not come from Epsom till Friday morning; then I called at the Coffee-house and saw him.</p>
               <p>Did you know him at all before? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was Caldwell with you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You state, that by mere accident you fell into the hands of this attorney; then he never was a Worcestershire or Staffordshire attorney? - No.</p>
               <p>So Mr. Ogden's matter was the only time you was ever in trouble about? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now just look round the Court, and repeat that answer upon your oath; was you never in custody except for Captain Ogden's business? - No, Sir; excepting debt.</p>
               <p>Whose custody was you in for debt? - I was in the Poultry-compter; I suppose it is four years ago.</p>
               <p>Do you know Townsend? - I have seen the man before.</p>
               <p>I think you have; where did you get acquainted with him? - I have seen him about Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>And that is all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean me to take that as your answer? - Yes, that is the only acquaintance I have with him; no correspondence, no dealings with him.</p>
               <p>Then I dare say you will venture to swear, that you never was in his custody in your life for a foot pad robbery? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Positively? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor upon the suspicion of a foot pad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230115"></xptr>robbery? - Never; nor upon any other charge whatever.</p>

               <p>I was going across Clerkenwell green; I think it was Wednesday the 9th of May; and I think I saw this gentleman, who calls himself James, going before me; whether it was for fashion sake, or what it was, I do not know; but he had a red and white silk handkerchief hanging out of his pocket, and the prisoner snatched it by the corner out of his pocket, and the prisoner clapped it to his left side in his coat; I called to this Mr. James, and said, Sir, Sir; have you lost any thing? why no, says he, not to my knowledge; and he felt, yes says he, I have lost a handkerchief; says I, this is the man that has got it; I suppose there were twenty people by that saw me.</p>
               <p>Did you search the man? - I saw Mr. James search him, and he took the handkerchief from his side pocket; I saw James put in his hand and take it out of his pocket; and I saw the prisoner before take the handkerchief out of James's pocket, or else I will suffer death; I know the consequence of an oath.</p>
               <p>Who are you? - I am a distressed person at present; I have been a person possessed of property; a chief magistrate of this city knows who I am; he knows me very well if he is here; I was born within a few yards where he lives.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw his hand, when he was putting it in his pocket? - I will not positively say that; at the Rotation Office they asked me if I knew the handkerchief? I said, it was very hard to swear to the handkerchief, but I believed it was the handkerchief; the prisoner said before the magistrate, he was not come there to be made a fool off, he could hang folks if he chose it; the Justice said he did not doubt it, because many of them sort of folks could hang one another if they liked it; Justice Girdler got up and asked him, he said he had an uncle at Billston, who was a man of property; he asked him after three or four different people, but he could give no account of either of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You live in London? - I do.</p>
               <p>And have done for some time past? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Ever been in Staffordshire? - No, 
Sir.</p>

               <p>Then you was vastly glad of having an opportunity of saving a handkerchief for a countryman? - I knew nothing of him, I served my time in Worcester.</p>

               <p>Never heard of his name? - I have heard of his name.</p>
               <p>But you never heard of Ashfield? - The first time I saw him, was when we went to find the bill on this business.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that you was a distressed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230116"></xptr>man? - Yes, I have been a man that have been possessed of a deal of property, I have run through it, and I have had an accident to put my arm out.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Mutton-lane.</p>
               <p>You have lived there some time probably? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Field lane? - Why it is only the length of Saffron-hill?</p>
               <p>Now do you know that handkerchief? - Why I would not swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>You never saw it till you saw it hang out of the gentleman's pocket for fashion sake? - No; what profit or pleasure can I have to say that this man took the handkerchief out of this man's pocket?</p>
               <p>I will tell you, it is to prevent his giving evidence against your friend Mr. Jordan in Staffordshire.</p>
               <p>Do you know Billstone? - I never was there in my life.</p>
               <p>You never heard of such a place? - Yes, I have heard of such a place.</p>

               <p>Has it never happened to you to have heard in conversation that it was a lucky thing that this sad dog was taken, because he was going to swear away the liberty of this Mr. Jordan of Billstone? - I do not, so help me God, nor against any other persons, nor never heard such a thing.</p>
               <p>Have not you been acquainted with Mr. James for three or four months? - I never was acquainted with him before; I have seen him by coming to the Coach and Horses, in Mutton-lane, that I used.</p>
               <p>You have been in the army I take it? - I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Egerton is what they call a crimp in the East India Company? - You may as well say a kidnapper.</p>
               <p>That was the first time you saw Mr. James? - I never saw him above three times there in my life.</p>
               <p>Was the last time you saw him a week, or three weeks before the time he had his pocket picked? - I think I saw him about a week before.</p>
               <p>Who were the people that he supped with that evening? - I do not know that he ever supped in the house in his life.</p>

               <p>Had not you a drop with him? - I never drank with him till after this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Who was his company at the kidnapper the last time he was there before he had his pocket pricked? - He had no company, he was there alone.</p>
               <p>What country man is your landlord? - I do not know, I believe he is Worcester.</p>
               <p>What way of life did you understand this Mr. James was in? - I did not ask him, I understood his name was James.</p>
               <p>That was all you knew about him? - Yes; I said, Sir, Sir, have you lost any thing?</p>
               <p>When he said he had not, you said yes, you have Mr. James, you have lost your handkerchief? - I did not say Mr. James, I did not know his name was James, I told you that I had seen him two or three times.</p>
               <p>Then you have forgot what you said a minute ago, that you saw him take the handkerchief from Mr. James? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that that puts an end to the capital part of this charge; why he will not be hanged; are you sure you saw him take it, or did you see it in his hand after he did take it? - I saw him as I told you before, snap it out.</p>
               <p>Have you never been in Ashurst's company before? - Upon my oath, I have never been in his company before, I swear it positively.</p>
               <p>You never drank with him of course? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>You do not know Mr. Jordan of Bilstone? - I do not indeed.</p>

               <p>Perhaps you may know Mr. Pearson? - I do not</p>
               <p>You told us of being in the army? - I have.</p>
               <p>That is probably not the only profession you have been in, in your life, since you was a distressed man? - I have been a glover, and worked at my trade; I get my bread now by writing; I can write as well as any gentleman in the Court.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may have written the brief upon this occasion? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Who was you clerk to as an attorney? - I do not tell you I was clerk to any attorney, I never wrote for any attorney.</p>
               <p>Did you ever write for Mr. Waling, he is dead? - Yes, and what I wrote for him I was paid for.</p>
               <p>How many years did you write for him? - I do not know, I have wrote for different people.</p>
               <p>Name a few of them? - I have wrote for that gentleman that put up for coroner of this hall, I forget his name, he is an attorney in the Court of Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Oh, Mr. Gosnell, that was clerk to Mr. Priddle! Did you write for him before or after he left Mr. Priddle? - I know nothing of Priddle, I only did three or four bills.</p>
               <p>Do not you know Freeman? - I do not know him if I see him.</p>
               <p>Have you never made any affidavit in the Court of King's Bench for Priddle, or Freeman or Ashfield? - Never in my life; I never saw him at the Admiralty coffee house.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively that to this hour you never learned that this man had been at Staffordshire, or Worcestershire, and that he was to be a witness at the next assizes? - Upon my oath I never did hear it.</p>
               <p>Neither from James, nor Ashurst, nor Pearson, nor Jordan, nor any other whatever? did you ever hear this prisoner was to be an evidence against Jordan, in Staffordshire? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Have you never been in custody in your life? - Never indeed.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Egerton's house after this thing happened? - No, Sir, never;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230119"></xptr>Yes, I have drank with James since this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Very often? - No, he came when he was going from the Bell, and I believe we drank together than.</p>
               <p>Was Ashurst with you then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you express yourself in some such way as this: well, we have done Jones at last? - No, Sir, I should be very sorry to say so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you never said in conversation in Egerton's house, we have done Jones? - No, never, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you never say we shall now be rid of him? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>You have never said either we shall do Jones, we shall get rid of him, he will be hanged, or any thing of that sort? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>What militia was you in? - I was serjeant and clerk in the eighty-eighth regiment of foot.</p>
               <p>Did you know James when you was in the army? - I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>- ASHURST sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going about my master's business about three weeks ago, I did not take notice of the day of the month, and I heard the last witness call out Sir, Sir, have you lost any thing? Mr. James looked round, and said, no, but putting his hand in his pocket, he said he had lost his handkerchief; the last witness said, this man has your handkerchief; Mr. James said, have you my handkerchief? and he denied it, and he felt in his pocket once or twice, and he did not find it, however, he put his hand into a side pocket, and pulled out a silk handkerchief; Mr. James took him to the Justice's, and I was there; upon his positive denial of the fact, the question was put to me, whether I did see Mr. James take the handkerchief out or not, I said I did; there was another gentleman offered to give his evidence on the same thing; the Justice said he was very well satisfied, and that my evidence would not have been required if he had not denied it; Mr. James was a perfect stranger to me before this, and his character was very much spoken against; I have enquired into it, and all that I hear is, that he is a very honest gentleman, and there is one man that takes on himself to swear that he was at the place at the time, and saw Mr. James put the handkerchief in the man's pocket; I am sure there never was so great a falsity; he said he thought it was a joke; after a few more words, he said he heard they were gone to the Justice's, and he was so struck that he could not go down, and that is the sum of what I have to say of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. James was an entire stranger to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you have enquired into his character, and you found he was a very honest character? - I never enquired into his character till I heard he was a great rogue; I found it a very good one as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Did any of the people you enquired of tell you that he had been in the strong place, Newgate? - I have heard it intimated that he had been concerned with persons that have been hanged, since I have been at the door.</p>
               <p>So you have heard this lately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any of these people tell you that he has been in custody for a robbery on Mr. Ogden? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you know the Fooman in waiting, in Gray's-inn-lane? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You do not know such a house, upon your oath? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>In Bell-court, or in Fox court? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know such a house in Feather's-court? - I came from the city of York; I am not ashamed of my country.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with Caldwell at the time the robbery was committed; have you no connections with Worcestershire, or Staffordshire? - I have heard tell of these places, I have not heard of Freeman; James is a stranger to me, and I to him, before this happened.</p>
               <p>What way of life may you be in? - I am a linen varnisher, such as they cover umbrella's with.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230120"></xptr>Perhaps you know Mr. Kegan? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never work for him in the preparing a balloon? - Upon my oath I never worked for any one in that branch, but Mr.

            , Little St. Andrew's-street, Seven-dials.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Jordan, of Billstone, in Staffordshire? - No, Sir, I do not know Staffordshire, nor Billstone, nor Worcestershire.</p>
               <p>Have you had any friends in Newgate lately? - I never was in any part of Newgate, unless this is called Newgate.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Jordan of Billstone, or a Mr. Pearson, or any body connected with him? - No, Sir, I think he said he came the day before from Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that Mr. Jordan, of Billstone, took him home, and made him drunk, put him to bed, gave him a new suit of clothes, and sent him to London? - I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath you did not? - Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know the fact to be so, that Mrs. Jordan sent this man to London, that he might not be a witness against her husband? - I know nothing about it, I never in my life heard so.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, this man said, Mr. James, I have not got your handkerchief? - He did.</p>
               <p>James insisted upon it, then he said Mr. James again, I have not got it? - He did not call him by his name that I know of, if I said so, I was mistaken; I asked about his character of the gentleman where he was employed: I said that hearing a very bad character of Mr. James, I had enquired into it, and found he bore a very good character as a very honest man.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Ashfield ordered out of Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Now remember you are upon oath, and do not get yourself into a scrape for any body, speak out the whole truth.</p>
               <p>(James sent out of Court at another door.)</p>
               <p>I will speak the truth as far as I can recollect, a gentleman came to me on either Wednesday or Thursday where I work, he was a stranger, that is the gentleman that stands up, the minister of Billstone, and a conversation took place between him and me; he said it was a piece of iniquitous business, and he said he thought Mr. James would be afraid to appear in Court; and upon that supposition I enquired of Ashfield with respect to James, and he said that James was a gentleman; and further than that, I heard the woman at the public house opposite to Hicks's Hall say she had known him for fourteen years; and as far as I understood he was what we call a gentleman.</p>
               <p>What did Ashfield teld you respecting the prisoner? - I cannot positively swear, I wish to be cautious, but I think Mr. Ashfield said (on account of the gentleman's asking) that the prisoner was concerned in a trial in the country, and I spoke to Mr. Ashfield about it, and I think he told me he had been concerned in a robbery with people there, stealing lead off a house, and he turned informer, and so he supposed they wished to have him back to give his evidence; that is nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did Mr. Ashfield tell you who it was that was charged as a receiver of that stolen lead? - No; that was all the conversation I recollect we had about it.</p>
               <p>Who did he tell you he supposed wished to have him back to give his evidence? - He did not say who.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you that there was a person charged as a receiver in that business too? No.</p>
               <p>Now what did he say more, that if he gets back again, he will hang some, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230121"></xptr>transport the others? - He did not say that.</p>
               <p>What did he say would be the consequence of his going back? - He told me no further than what I have related that I recollect.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you would be the consequence if this man escaped? - He never told me any thing that would be of consequence.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that he wished to convict him of felony, did not he say it would be a sad thing if he should get back again to give his evidence? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Or that he hoped he would not? - No, he never said any thing about it positively, he never related any thing to me about the matter.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you what would happen? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not he name to you a man of the name of Jordan? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that he did not mention the name of Jordan? - I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that positively? - I wish to be cautious.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not he last Friday name the name of Jordan to you? - Then I give my oath that he did not, for I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that this man would go back and convict Jordan for receiving stolen goods? - No he did not, nor any thing like it, he said this man had turned an evidence.</p>
               <p>Against somebody for receiving stolen goods? - No, I swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Nor that any body would be convicted if this man got back again? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, did not he tell you that the whole from the beginning to the end, was a scheme laid to cut off this man, to prevent his being a witness? - No he did not.</p>
               <p>Nor any thing like it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you swear positively, that you did not collect from their conversation, that it was their wish to have cut off this man? - No I did not particularly.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand it so? - I did not, I understood so far as this, that if the man was tried and convicted, it might prevent him going back into Staffordshire to give evidence, but I did not suppose it was done entirely for that.</p>
               <p>Then did not you understand as one good effect of it, it would prevent him from going back to give evidence? - I understood their view in prosecuting the prisoner was for stealing a handkerchief, and that it certainly would tend for the good of society.</p>
               <p>Both by convicting him, and by hindering him from going into Staffordshire? - I never recollect that.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall begin to change the opinion I entertained of you, I will read you what you have sworn this very minute,</p>
               <p>"I did understand that if this man was convicted it might answer the purpose of preventing him from going down into Staffordshire to give evidence? - That is as I understood it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not Ashfield expressly tell you, that if they were not able to convict this man, that Jordan would be obliged to leave the country? - No nothing like it.</p>
               <p>And if he was not convicted he would go back and be a witness? - No, I collect that from the circumstances of the case, not from what they said; I do not know that he was a witness in the country but from them, he never said he was a witness against any body.</p>
               <p>Court. I will read you what you have said, Mr. Ashfield said he heard this young man had been concerned in an affair in the country, and had turned evidence, and that Ashfield told you the prisoner had been concerned with some people that had been stealing lead, and had turned informer, and he supposed they wished to have him back to give his evidence? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know, except from James or Caldwell, or Ashfield, that this man was to go back to be an evidence against Jordan? I understood from them, as they related the affair to me, that if this man was set at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230122"></xptr>liberty, he would certainly go into the country and give evidence against them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manley. Have you seen any other person upon this business before you saw Ashley, have not you seen this gentleman? - That is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>When did he call upon you? - I believe it was Wednesday or Thursday, he asked me if I knew one Jones and James, and I said yes, I told him where they worked, but I found I had mistaken the people, I told him what I knew, and he said they had an affair, or a cause, or a trial in the country, and that the man was a witness, and that made him enquire.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to this Ashfield about this mans' being a witness before he said any thing to you? - I did, and he told me that the prisoner was concerned in an affair in the country for stealing lead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. James. Upon your oath, was not you taken up upon suspicion of being concerned with

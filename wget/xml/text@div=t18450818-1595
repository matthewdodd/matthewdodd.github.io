                  </hi>. I am the wife of Theophilus Carr. On the 23rd of July I was coming up by the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> steamer from Margate, and near Billingsgate I lost a purse containing two sovereigns and about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the prisoner pushed me very much, and I begged him not to push me so much—that is all I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in St. George's—place, Southwark. I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> steamer when she came from Margate—I saw a person, who I think was the prisoner, put his hand into the lady's pocket—I saw his hand come out of the pocket, and asked the lady what she had lost—she said she had lost her purse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long is it since you only thought it was the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I was at the Mansion-house I was very positive, but I may be mistaken—nothing has made me less positive—I am not so positive as I was then—I went for an officer, and pointed the prisoner out to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have been asked if anything occurred since to shake your conviction of his being the boy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing but my con<lb></lb>science—I thought he was the lad who did do it—I saw a boy like him on Fresh-wharf the day after the examination at the Mansion-house, and it is that has done it—I was on board a steam-boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you then say if you had not given the prisoner into custody the day before, you should have given the one you saw on Fresh-wharf into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say so, and that is true.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of Fresh-wharf, London-bridge. The last witness fetched me, and pointed the prisoner out—there were four</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180015"></xptr>
               <p>or five of them round him at the time—I took him into custody—there wai a resistance made by two who were with him—I found four sovereigns four penny-pieces, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a gold watch on him—the prisoner's solicitor had the watch by order of the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you have no charge respecting the watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not—I was with Hillier the day after—he did not point out another boy on Fresh-wharf, nor tell me he had seen a boy who he should have said was the one if he had not given the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he ever express a doubt of the prisoner being the boy to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there other boys round him at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were lads bigger than him, four or five young men—he was the smallest—the prisoner himself made resistance—he tried to get away, and so did the others, who I took down to the cabin to search—I took three—the prisoner struggled to get away—he shook himself, that was all.</p>

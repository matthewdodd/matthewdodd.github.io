               <p>ANN WORLINGTON. I am housekeeper to Mr. Madan, of the Museum; he dealt with the prosecutor - I paid the prisoner 3s. on the 19th of September, and on the 13th of October I paid him 7s. 6d.; I have no receipt - I am sure I paid him.</p>
               <p>MR. HAWKINS. He never accounted to me for these sums, nor did I know he had received them till he was taken three or four weeks ago - he had run away about ten days before I found this out; when he was apprehended I told him I had been at the Museum to inquire about this 10s. 6d. - he said he had done it, and so on; I do not know that he said any thing further.</p>

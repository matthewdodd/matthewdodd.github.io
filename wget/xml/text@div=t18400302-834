On the night of the 10th of February, I was between St. Giles's church and Day and Martin's, in Holborn, between ten and eleven o'clock—I missed a handkerchief from my pocket, which I had occasion to use about two mi<lb></lb>nutes before the witness spoke to me—I went back, and saw the prisoner in the hands of an officer—he was searched in my presence, and my hand-kerchief found on him—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—the pavement was very wet and dirty, if the handkerchief had fallen, it would have been soiled, but it was not.</p>

About eleven o'clock at night, on the 10th of February, I was going from St. Giles's church to<lb></lb>wards the City—I saw the prisoner, and two other persons about his size, together—I saw one of the three take a handkerchief out of the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's pocket—I pointed out the three persons to the officer—I ran after the prosecutor, and brought him back to where the prisoner was in hold—I am quite sure he was one of the three who were in company together when the pocket was picked—the pavement was very muddy—I did not see any handkerchief on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-surgeon in the Infirmary of Greenwich Hospital. Cave was brought in there on 5th July—I did not attend him from the 5th to the 8th of July—Mr. Beits saw him—he is now in Scotland—Cave died, and I helped to make the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on raising the breast-bone there was a fracture extending across it—the ends of the bone were in a state of ulceration, indicating that the injury must have been some days previous—I found the fourth rib fractured, near the junction of the cartilage of the breast-bone—on raising the breast-bone there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180153"></xptr>
               <p>found on the heart-side a small clot of blood, and slight abrasion of the part corresponding with the line of fracture—in the breast-bone there was also some inflammation in the heart-place—the left lung was extensively inflamed—that must have existed four, five, or six days—there was also evidence of previous inflammation of the lungs—in the cavity where the left lung is con<lb></lb>tained, there was from twelve to fourteen ounces of fluid; that was the result of inflammation—I found sufficient evidence of inflammation to account for death—there was also an effusion of water on the brain, resulting from in<lb></lb>flammation, probably coeval with the inflammation of the lungs—the appear<lb></lb>ances were such as might have been produced by one man stamping on the other's breast—in my judgment the immediate cause of death was inflamma<lb></lb>tion, which might have been caused by the wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of Greenwich Hospital; I know the pri<lb></lb>soner; I knew the deceased, Thomas Cave. On Wednesday, 2nd July, I was in the hall of the hospital, at 6 o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner was there, and Cave came in—he belonged to the same mess as the prisoner—I said, "Here comes poor Tom"—Cave said, "Poor Tom, indeed; been seventeen years on board, and don't know how to tie a knot"—Cave had been a seaman; the prisoner had been a marine—the prisoner said, "I don't think you do know how to tie a knot, not even a bowling knot"—Cave said, "What does a b—y marine know about tying a knot; he knows more about man-catching"—Cave had got a handkerchief in his hand, and he tied a knot in it, and said he should like to hang Cambridge up to the gas-pipe in it—Cave had had some liquor—he was not to say drunk—they remained in the hall about a quarter of an hour; they both went out together—Cave was carrying his pitcher of tea in his hand, and his bread and butter—I saw no more till the next morning when I saw them at breakfast, and the prisoner said, "You have whipped me into a serious job; I have got to go before the Council on Friday"—he meant the Council of the hospital—Cave said, "I own myself to be in fault, and I shall speak the same when I come before the Council"—Cave afterwards put his hand across the table to the prisoner; whether they shook hands I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Sir Charles Adams, the governor of Greenwich Hospital. On 2nd July, about half-past 6 o'clock, I was in the court-yard, at the back of my master's—I saw the prisoner and a shorter man walking towards me, side by side—they were having some very high worth—I could not distinguish the words—they were thirty or forty yards from me—I saw a form in the yard—I saw the prisoner give the shorter man a sudden push—I had not seen the shorter man do anything to the prisoner before he pushed him—the shorter man, Cave, had a jug in his band; and is consequence of that push, Cave went on the end of the form, but he did not fall—something spilt out of the jug—Cave recovered himself, and threw the contents of the jug into the prisoner's face—I think he threw the contents of the jug only—I am not sure whether the jug went also—it fell, but whether it struck the prisoner, I do not know—it was a common brown jog, con<lb></lb>taining about a pint or a pint and a half—on Cave's throwing the tea, the prisoner pushed him down—Cave fell with very great violence; and while he was down, the prisoner kicked him on his hinder part with his right foot—I could not distinguish whether the kick was violent—Cave got up, and rushed at the prisoner, and the prisoner threw him down again in the same manner—Cave was on the ground three times—after Cave had been down the second time, he got up, and rushed at the prisoner; and the prisoner struck him in the face with his fist, and knocked him down—Cave fell upon his back; and while on his back, the prisoner stamped his foot on his chest—it was a regular stamp—he took his foot up, and stamped upon him—I had a clear view of all that was going on—the prisoner then went his way, and Cave went his way.</p>

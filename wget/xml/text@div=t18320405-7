On the evening of the 26th of March, about a quarter-past nine o'clock, I heard an alarm of thieves; I ran out, and saw the prisoner running - I pursued him about three hundred yards, and took him, without losing sight of him; I took him into a shop at the corner of the street, and a Policeman came up - I gave him to him; he searched him, and found this seal in his jacket pocket - I had seen it on a card in our window about a quarter of an hour before; the window was then whole - I heard a noise just before the alarm was given, but did not know what it was: when I came back I found a square of glass broken near where the seal was; it would admit a hand - it was plate glass: the door was open at the time, and Mrs. Telfer in the shop; I know the seal to be master's - the prisoner was running - he turned up a court by the side of the house; nothing else was missing - our shop had four gas-lights in it.</p>

On the night of 17th October, I went up-stairs about five or ten minutes past 10—I had fastened the house before that—the doors were all fast, and all the windows except the back kitchen window; that was quite closed, but there was nothing to prevent it being opened—there were six knives and forks left in the back kitchen—I came down next morning at twenty-five minutes to</p>

I am seventeen years old, and live at 21, St. James'-road with my mother—I know the prisoners—I was with them on the night of 17th October, at St. John's-park—Prail got over the wall of Mr. Godlington's house, and went in at the window, and came back and said to Flatt that it was unfastened, and they went back and both entered the house and brought from it six forks and one knife—I was on the other side of the wall—they came back and said that they could not get any farther—we all had two forks each—I gave mine back to Prail and he took them to Mr. Armstrong's rag-shop, and sold them—it was about half-past 5 in the morning when they went into the house—I had been with them all night.</p>

On Monday morning, about 17th October, I went near St. John's-park—I saw three lads come away from the back of the prosecutor's house—I know Flatt—I could not recognise the last witness—there were three, and Flatt was one of them—I did not say anything at all to them—it was from twenty minutes to half-past 6 in the morning—I heard of this robbery that afternoon—I saw Flatt again at Clerkenwell; he was net alone; I believe there were six or seven persons with him—I picked him out as being the person I had seen that morning—I cannot speak positively to either of the other persons—I could not swear that Perfect was one.</p>

There were other Evidence that corroborated hers, and declared that the Prisoner had confest that he was one that committed the Robbery, and the Goods were found upon them, but he said that Arnold gave him the least share, because he was but a Younger Brother; he was heard to confess likewise, that he was one that robbed one Hart the Carrier of Norfolk about the same time; but none of the Goods of Fryer were found in Middlesex in the possession of the Prisoner; So he <rs id="t16930713-24-verdict103" type="verdictDescription">

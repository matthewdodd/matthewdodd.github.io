                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Daniel Dodson, a bookseller, in Fleet-street. He has an open window—on the 8th of June, about half-part six o'clock in the evening, I missed two large books—I did not see then taken—I was out—I had seen them safe at eight o'clock in the morning, but not afterwards—I did not say before the Magistrate that they were safe at five o'clock in the afternoon—the constable brought me two books—this is one now produced—it is Mr. Daniel Dodson's, and was safe in the window at eight o'clock in the morning—I cannot swear to the other, but it fits the vacancy in the window—this is my writing—it was read over to me before—I signed it—(<hi rend="italic">deposition read</hi>)—"The books were safe at five o'clock; I saw it safe at five o'clock."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 10.) On the 8th of June, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Chancery-lane, coming towards Holborn with this bundle, with these two books in it—I stopped him and asked what he had got—he said two books, that he was a dealer in books, and that I knew that—he said, "Do you want to look at them?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You don't, without you take me down"—I took him to the station and took the books to the prosecutor—the prisoner said he had bought the books in Ave Maria-lane, at a public-house, and did not know the name of the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Dodson, bookseller. On the 8th of June I was at my master's shop all day—I left at half-past nine o'clock—I went behind the window to have my tea, about half-past five o'clock, and left nobody outside the shop—I came back about half-past six, and was</p>

               <p>shown a place in the window where the books had gone from—in consequences of what somebody told me, I watched, and taw the prisoner going towards Temple-bar—my master's shop is opposite Salisbury-court—the prisoner had a red book on the top of these two books under his arm—I went back and told the clerk, and in about three quarters of an hour the constable brought the two books back.</p>

I am eleven years of age, and live at the Greyhound, at Fulham-field—on a Tuesday in May last I was playing there with a shovel in my hand—the deceased man Bailey tried to take it from me—the prisoner came up, and said that Bailey was beating me—Bailey told him to mind his own business—the prisoner turned round, and was going to hit him, and Bailey took off his belt, and was going to hit the prisoner, but he snatched the belt away from him, and said he would break it and cut it up—Bailey said, "Cut it up, and I will give you a chance"—the prisoner then threw Bailey down, and was going to kick him, and the, prisoner said he would stamp his guts out—he, was then on the ground—the prisoner did stamp upon him, and kicked him in the side—Bailey stood up, took off his coat, and said he would fight him fair, and then called to Mr. Connor to catch hold of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor—on 20th May I saw Bailey lying on his back in the road and the prisoner standing over him, looking at him—they were abusing each other and having some aggravating talk—the prisoner stooped down to give him a clout, and at the same time Bailey shot up his legs and caught the prisoner on the chest—the prisoner said, "I will stamp your guts in"—he leant towards him, and jobbed with one leg and kicked with the other—he rested one leg on his body and kicked with the other, on the right side—I hallooed to him, "Don't kick, whatever you do"—he stopped directly and came up to me—Bailey rolled on the road for a second or two, and then got up, walked up manfully, stripped off his jacket, and said, "D—you, don't kick, and I will fight you fair;" and all of a sudden he folded his arms, and said, "Oh, Mr. Connor, I feel as though there were pint and needles sticking throught my body; pray do something for me or else I shall go lock jawed;" and he was taken to the hospital.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the West London Hospital—on 20th May Bailey was brought there—he was in a state of collapse—when he was roused he complained of pain in his right side, over the liver—he was put to bed and stimulants were administered—he died the next day—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—his death was caused by a rupture in the liver, happening in a previously diseased part, that could not have happened except from external violence—a kick on the right side would be very likely to do it—there were no external bruises—it might have been done by a kick without there being any external bruises—there was a bruise on the surface of the stomach—that might have been from a blow—that was not connected with the injury—the prisoner was brought to the hospital and Bailey made a statement there in his presence, which was taken down by the Magistrate's clerk.</p>

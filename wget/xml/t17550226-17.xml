            . I have known the prisoner two years: he came to my house on the 30th of November about eleven, and staid till between twelve and one; he came again about three in the afternoon, and went away between five and six. I had eight guineas and two thirty-six-shilling pieces in my bureau in the room where he and I sat, which was locked. I had occasion to go up stairs about three or four o'clock, and left him alone for about fifteen minutes. My keys were all in a bunch together, left in the book-case lock which was over the bureau. When I came down I found him sitting where I left him, and the keys where I had left them. And between nine and ten at night I had occasion to go to my money, and missed four guineas. I had lodgers above, but I could suspect nobody but the prisoner at the bar, having left nobody alone in the room but him, from the time I had seen it to the time I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>C. Hogg. I had taken three half-crowns out that morning when he was there, and it was safe then.</p>

            , all lodgers in the prosecutor's house, deposed to seeing the prisoner in that room with the prosecutrix the day the money was missing; and that the prisoner had some little time ago lodged there. On their cross-examination they all said they knew no ill of him.</p>

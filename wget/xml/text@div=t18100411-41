On the evening of the 20th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I had just done supper, I had no company in the house, except one person that was at supper with me, and my wife; I heard a riot in the street, I went out and endeavoured to put my shutters up; there were a party of men fighting in the street, and before I could get the shutters up some of them pushed the tap-room door open and went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How many came into your house - A. About eight or ten, the prisoner was one of them. On their coming in I left the shutters and returned into the house to endeavour to get them out; they were quarreling and fighting together; the prisoner was one that was fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the party been in your house that night - A. No, not one of them. In about five or ten minutes, by my persuading them not to fight, the prisoner and all his party, except the prisoner's wife, left my house; they were in two parties; three or four of the other party staid in the house, and the prisoner's wife. On Briant and his party, leaving the house I missed my hat, I went to the door and saw it on one of the men's head's, not the prisoner; they were on the threshold or the door just going out; I told the man it was my hat, and I took it off his head and gave it my wife, she put it in the bar; my wife put on the spring lock door and put it to; at this time the prisoner's wife was in the tap room, with three or four more; I persuaded her to go out of the house, she asked me to draw her a pint of beer; I told her I could not, if she would go home I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110026"></xptr>send her some.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew her before - A. Yes, and him; they live within ten yards of my house. While I was talking to her, and persuading her to go out. I heard a pane of glass break in the tap-room, I opened the door to see who was breaking it; I saw the prisoner at the window, immediately I got out (the same instant) he turned from the window and struck me upon the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your hat on then - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he struck you with - A. No; I judged it to be some iron instrument; I could not see what it was. I turned into the house immediately; I found myself very badly wounded indeed in the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe in what manner you found yourself wounded - A. I felt the cut in my head, and the blood run very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner that gave you that blow - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there other people with him at the time - A. I saw no other; there was none near. When I got into the house, his wife then seeing me wounded, threw up one of the sashes and got out, and the other party that were left when Briant went out, went out at the back door. I then sent for a surgeon, Mr. Jackson,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of the prisoner that night - A. He continued twenty minutes or half an hour at the window, and broke the windows all to pieces; I saw him and spoke to him at the window; he said, through the window, he would massacre the first person that came out of the door. This was after I received the cut on my head, and after his wife got out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then go away, or was he taken in custody - A. He went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he lived near you - what is he - A. A coal-heaver.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the surgeon come - A. In half an hour, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you ever see any thing of the prisoner afterwards - A. The police officer brought him in my bed room about three o'clock in the morning, and the magistrate was with them. When the surgeon came to look at my wound he said it was dangerous, he wished to have further advice called in; he wished to have sir 
               <persName id="t18100411-41-person380">

            , and by the advice of sir William Blissard the magistrate was sent for to take my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave your evidence about it - A. Yes. The prisoner denied it, and said it was not him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what instrument he had in his hand when he struck you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any instrument in his hand while he was in your house - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Was it not before you received the injury that the woman attempted to get out of the window - A. After I received the injury, it was. I persuaded her to go out of the door before, and she would not.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said it was only one blow that you received - A. Only one blow.</p>
               <p>MR. JACKSON. Q. You are a surgeon - A. Yes; on Wapping-wall. On the night of the 26th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was called upon to go to the prosecutor's house; I went there, he was bleeding when I saw him; he appeared to have lost a great deal of blood; the blood was proceeding from the side of his head; upon examining the wound I found a large wound through the bone; it had gone through the bone on the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. What breadth might it be - A. Very near a quarter of an inch, and it separated the membrane over the brain, not the one underneath that lines the scull.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, could you form a judgment what sort of an instrument it had been inflicted with - A. It appeared to have been done with an edged instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any judgment what sort of an edged instrument - A. It appeared to have been done with a piece of iron that had been blunt.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean a broad piece of iron - A. It diverged from the edge to the back of it, whatever it had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not very deep this wound - A. It went through the bone; the membrane underneath it was not divided.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say it was inflicted with an instrument contrived for cutting - A. That I cannot exactly say; there was no contusion; it was an incised wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of a fracture of the scull at all - A. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for saying it must have been an instrument with a blunt edge - 
               <persName id="t18100411-41-person381">A. </persName>
            Because the membrane underneath it, not being divided, must have been separated from the bone.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your distinction between not being divided, and its being separated - 
               <persName id="t18100411-41-person382">A. </persName>
            Because if the instrument had been sharp it would have cut through it, and, not being divided, but separated from the bone from being pressed down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then am I to understand you from being pressed down, a blunt bar of iron might have created such an appearance - A. If there had been an edge to it.</p>
               <p>Q. The edge of a blunt bar of iron might have done it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us the breadth of it was near a quarter of an inch, what was the length of it - A. About an inch and a half.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18100411-41-person383">Q. </persName>
            Would a cutlass produce a wound of that sort - I think it might if it was blunt.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18100411-41-person384">Q. </persName>
            But would there have been such an appearance, the breadth and length of it by a proper cutting instrument - A. No; I think it must have gone deeper, and and not have been so broad,</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you attend him - A. He is still under my care now.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. You called in for farther assistance, we learn - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q. When you found him, was he in bed. - A. Yes, I got into the house the back way; I broke into his room, and found him and his wife in bed; I apprehended him. I found by his bed side this rusty old cutlass; it is in the same state now as when I found it. I could not see any appearance of blood upon it; I took him to the prosecutor's house, where the magistrate took the information. I have part of a window-frame<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110027"></xptr>from the prosecutor's house; it appears to have been cut with the same sort of instrument; it is a part of a window-frame; it laid inside of the house, under the settle; there was a number of pieces; but none appeared to have any cut in it except that.</p>

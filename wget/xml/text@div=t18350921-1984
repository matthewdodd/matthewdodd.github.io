I went to the shop of Meale, a pawnbroker, in Duke-street—I found Leary in one of the boxes—t e shopman brought the table-cloth to him, and said he could not take it in—Leary took it up and put it under his arm—he turned round to come out—I asked what he had there he said, "A table-cloth"—I asked where he got it from—he said from home, and that it was all right—I said I was not satisfied, and he must go to the station-house—he said, "Very Well"—we came out—I went to lay hold of him—he begged I would not do, that because there was a party standing by who gave the table-cloth to him, and if he saw me holding him he would run away—I said I must do so, and did—he went very quietly to the corner of Stratford-place, he then made a desperate attempt to get from me, and struck me a violent blow between my eyes—the cloth fell, and he said to somebody, "Make off with that"—I told Hodson to take charge of it—I threw the prisoner on his back—he kicked me several times, and struck me violet blows, which disabled me from duty for three days—I secured him with assistance.</p>

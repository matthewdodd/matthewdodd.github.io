On the 20th of August, I was at the back part of my shop, and heard a noise at my door; I went out and saw my apprentice contending with the prisoner for a boot - he was knocked down by some other person, and the prisoner got away; I lost sight of him, for a short time, in turning a corner, but I am sure he is the man - my boots were picked up by different people.</p>

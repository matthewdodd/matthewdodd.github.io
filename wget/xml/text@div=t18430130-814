                  </hi>. I am a solicitor; until lately I was in partnership with Mr. Sutcliffe; we carried on business in New Bridge-street, Black friars—we were professionally concerned for the late Richard Constable—I believe our engagements with him commenced in May, 1838; he was at that time residing in Manor-street, Kennington—he had a life-interest in a place called Mount Pleasant, at Lewisham, at that time—I prepared his will—I cannot say when—he died on the 31st of December, 1840—this is the probate of the will—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—after the execution of his will I prepared a deed of settlement, by way of conveyance of his property; that must have been about Feb., 1839—I prepared the deeds on behalf of Mr. Constable—these are the deeds—I pre<lb></lb>pared this deed of the 1st Feb., 1839, and here is another of the 4th and 5th—they were prepared at the same time—I attended the execution of them—all these instruments assume to dispose of his real property—Mr. Constable was introduced to us as a client, by a Mr. Joseph Stanley—I do not know when Stanley died—from time to time, during Mr. Constable's lifetime, Stanley saw me on the part of Mr. Constable, about his affairs—Mr. Constable was very old and infirm—I have no doubt that Stanley came to me in July, 1840—he came, I think, in Aug., 1840, and gave me instructions about preparing a deed—I prepared the deed, in pursuance of written directions, which I believed were given by Mr. Constable—I had a letter, which I believed, at that time, to have been written by Mr. Constable—that letter was handed, with all Mr. Constable's other papers, to Messrs. Hale, Boys, and Austen, who succeeded us in the business—I am not attesting witness to all these instruments, only to these two of the 1st of Feb., and 4th and 5th of Feb.—I think I am acquainted with the handwriting of Mr. Constable—I have seen him write, and have bad frequent letters from him—I also attested his will in January, 1839, and a mortgage-deed, in 1838, the transfer of a mortgage—this is the letter which Stanley brought to me in August, as from Mr. Constable (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> A)—in consequence of that letter I prepared the draft of a deed—Stanley brought me back the draft—it remained in my office till Dec.—I got it engrossed by Stanley's direction—this is the deed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the deed charged to be forged</hi>)—it was engrossed on the 30th of Dec., 1840, and handed to Stanley on the 31st—I am quite sure of that—I cannot form any idea as to what time of the day Stanley had the deed from us—it was the last day in the year, and we closed our office rather earlier than usual that evening, but I cannot remember the time—our office opened at ten, or a quarter to ten o'clock, and closed, I should think, at four—at the time it was given to Stanley, it was not exe<lb></lb>cuted by any body—it had just come from the stationer's—I cannot re<lb></lb>member how soon I saw the deed again—it must have been a few days—it was brought to me by Stanley, and I rather think Stanley signed the deed in my presence, but I am not sure—when he brought it, it was executed as</p>

               <p>it now appears, signed by Mr. Constable, and attested, as to the signature of Mr. Constable and his daughter, by the prisoner—I did not see that done, it was brought back in that state—I cannot be certain whether Stanley signed it in my presence—I remember baring some conversation with Stanley about the deed—I think he signed it—he was a party to the deed—his signature is to the deed as a party to it—I know the prisoner—I do not think I saw him at all during Mr. Constable's lifetime—after his death, and the deposit of that deed with us by Stanley, I saw the prisoner at my office some few times—he came, relative to the Lewisham affair, and the affairs of Mr. Constable generally—he came from Stanley—he assigned Stanley's illness as a reason for his coming instead of Stanley—he told me where Stanley lived, when I was desired to go down and see Stanley at Mount Pleasant—I went down, and found Stanley there—that must have been in the summer of 1841—it must have been shortly before his death, which was in August, 1841—I remember the prisoner calling at my office while Stanley was ill, when Miss Constable was there, and I introduced them—I told Miss Constable that the prisoner was a nephew of Stanley's, and she said in his pre<lb></lb>sence she was glad at seeing him for the first time—after introducing them, I left them to talk by themselves—Miss Constable was very desirous of knowing the state of Stanley's health—before that I bad not looked at the deed with any atten<lb></lb>tion—I was not aware that the prisoner purported to be the attesting witness to Miss Constable's signature to the deed—on that occasion Miss Constable expressed herself to him as a person she had not seen before—something was said about Stanley's being ill—Miss Constable desired to know where he was to be found, and to be informed of his state of health from time to time—the pri<lb></lb>soner did not tell her where he was to be found—he did not give hit address, but promised to inform her from time to time of his health—I do not know what he said about the address, but it was concealed both from me and her—the forged deed remained at my office until Stanley's death—after Stanley's death, the prisoner called on me, and produced a paper, which he described as being Stanley's will—after I had read the will, and discovered that Stanley had been devising this gentleman's estate to the prisoner, I explained to the pri<lb></lb>soner, or to Mr. Jones, a professional gentleman, who was with him, that Stanley had no interest in the estate beyond the payment of a debt that was secured by this deed—at that time I considered this deed to be a genuine document—he produced the original will at the time—it had not been proved—I still re<lb></lb>tained the deed in my possession—I had a lien on it for costs incurred in the preparation—application was made to a Judge for an order to compel me to deliver it up, which was refused—my costs were something above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I ultimately delivered up the deed without an order—I cannot give the date when the deed left my possession—it was delivered up on the payment of my costs due from Mr. Constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The application about that deed to the Judge occurred on the 1st of Dec., 1841? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then the deed must have gone out of our hands a few days after that—I was not present when the deed was handed to the party—I had examined it before it left my office, to see how it was executed—at the time I parted with it to the prisoner it had the same attestation and execution to it as it has now—it purported to be signed by Richard Constable, Elizabeth Hollis Constable, and Joseph Stanley—at the time I introduced the prisoner to Miss Constable I had paid no attention to the mode in which the deed was attested.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300212"></xptr>
               <p>dare say I also received notes from him upon the subject of which I afterwards saw him—Miss Constable was living with her father at that time—I think he always wrote his own letters—I do not know of Miss Constable's sometimes being his amanuensis—I saw her frequently at the house in the course of my communications with her fathers, and he used to come on the subject of her father's affairs as well as Stanley—those visits of hers did not continue up to within a short time of Mr. Constable's death—I should say I saw nothing of her from Trinity Term, 1840, until her father's death-there was then a bill of foreclosure in Chancery with respect to the mortgage—this deed purports to be an arrangement for paying off the demands on Mr. Constable, and also paying off the mortgage—if that had been carried out, it would no doubt have relieved him from his embarrassments—it would depend, of course, on the value of the property, supposing it realised the amount, he would have the surplus, if any—I bad not been consulted by Mr. Constable himself as to the best means of proceeding to get out of his difficulties—the occasions on which I saw him were on business—Stanley lived in the house with him part of the time when I was doing business with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And Miss Constable too? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the last time I saw Mr. Constable must have been in the early part of 1840—I transacted his business myself-I drew the draft of this deed myself—it was settled by a conveyancer—I think the draft was ready to be perused in Aug., 1840—I did not go down to Lewis ham with it—I gave it to Stanley—I cannot say how long he kept it—I know the business stood over till Dec.—at that time the proceedings in Chancery could not go on-I declined patting in the an<lb></lb>swer—the cause stood still for that time—I have looked at all these signa<lb></lb>tures to the deed—I think this one of Stanley's I saw him write—I will not be sure—I cannot say how long it was after the 31st of Dec, 1840, that I saw the prisoner—I think the first time I saw him was in consequence of his having made a bill of exchange payable and lodging some money with us—I think it must have been some months after Mr. Con<lb></lb>stable's death-the deed has blanks in it—I was applied to by Stanley to perfect this deed immediately after I got it, after it was returned executed—I have never been applied to by anybody else to fill up the blanks—I told Stanley we could not supply these blanks unless we had the authority of Miss Constable-I got that authority—this paper (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> B) purports to be dated Feb., 1841—at that time I had the deed in my possession—I saw Miss Constable after this letter was delivered, not repeatedly—I saw her very few times after receiving that letter, two or three times—I think I must have seen her in the summer of 1841, but I will not swear that—the blanks have not been filled up—I did not tell her I would not fill up the blanks—I never spoke to her at all on the subject of that letter—I did not ask Stanley to get her authority to fill up the blanks—I refused to do it-after this letter purporting to be Miss Constable's authority came, I took advice as to the propriety of stamping the deed and filling up the blanks, and found it would be injudicious-it was in consequence of that advice that I did not do so—here is a sum of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. referred to in this letter—there had been a sum of about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid, which had been borrowed of my partner, not of the firm—that was paid by Stanley on the 24th of Dec, 1840—perhaps there might be interest on it-Stanley had borrowed 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Sutcliffe, and deposited the deeds of the Lewisham estate—he borrowed it as Mr. Constable's agent, as he assumed—the 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to my partner—I did not make the slightest reference to this letter when I saw Miss Constable-I did not expect there was any thing</p>

               <p>to he said about the deed—I had no suspicion—I never accounted to Miss Constable for not filling up the blanks after receiving this letter—I should have mentioned it if I had been asked about it, but I never was—in my in<lb></lb>terviews with Miss Constable, no reference was made to the deed or the let<lb></lb>ter—her attention was never called to such a letter purporting to come from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then were you never applied to again to fill up the blanks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think Stanley, after the receipt of that letter, mentioned the subject, and there the matter dropped, as far as I was concerned—when the prisoner was intro<lb></lb>duced to Miss Constable I think he was there on business of Mr. Constable's—the prisoner and Miss Constable never met at my office but that once to my knowledge—I think I never saw them together after that—I think the deed and the papers were delivered up without a Judge's order—we had retained them for our bill against Mr. Constable—when that was paid we delivered them up—the bill was paid to our clerk, who is here—at the time I received the deed back from Stanley, apparently executed, I believed it to be genuine—I made an affidavit, in which I stated die time the deed came out of my pos<lb></lb>session—that affidavit was read to Mr. Constable's medical attendant—that must have been five or six weeks after they paid the bill—that was when I first questioned the validity of the deed, in consequence of what the medical man said to me—the last payment was 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—that was some time after the 1st of Dec., 1841—I do not believe I ever applied to the prisoner for payment of our account—I did not apply to anybody—Hale and Co. had applied to us for the bill—they paid the bill that they might get the papers out of our hands—the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was the first bill that was paid, and the other bill for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for business done for Mr. Constable—I did not endeavour to raise a loan on the deed while it was in my possession—I entered into negociation for a loan, on the old title, in Trinity Term, 1840, never after that—that money was to be raised for the purpose of paying off the mortgage—I was not then in possession of Mr. Constable's deeds—there were no deeds of Mr. Constable's in our possession, except a deed left as a deposit for 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we wanted to get money to pay off the incumbrances on Mr. Constable's estate—we endeavoured to do that—I do not think I saw Mr. Constable on that subject, nor Miss Constable—all that took place was with Stanley—I do not remember ever seeing Miss Constable at any time when there was a question about getting money to pay off her father's incumbrances—I do not think she ever evinced any wish of that kind—I believe all the conversation was with Stanley. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the object of your seeing her at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When she came, she came for advice on particular points, in reference to giving a notice to quit, and those sort of things—I rather think I did though, try to get money after Dec. 1840—if yoa will give me the bill, I can tell—this is my bill against Stanley—oh, yes, I remember I saw Mr. Vigors, of Chancery-lane, on the 23rd of Feb. 1841—that was soon after the deed came into my possession—I saw Mr. Vigors for the purpose of raising money to pay off all the incumbrances—I saw Stanley on that subject, but not Miss Constable—I did not succeed in raising the loan—I should say this was not one of the deeds upon which it was to be raised—it was supposed Miss Constable was in a situation to give a mortgage on the freehold estates, in concurrence with Stanley—it must have been on that deed, if Stanley had any thing to do with it—it was not carried into execution, and we were not successful in raising the money—there was another attempt made, I see, on the 22nd of March—that must have been after I got this letter, authorising me to fill up the blanks.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1841 I was clerk to Messrs. Suteliffe and Birch.

                  </hi>, M. D. I reside in Bridgehouse-place, Southwark. I was acquainted with the late Mr. Richard Constable—I attended him professionally up to the time of his death—he died the last day of 1840—at that time he lived in West-square, Southwark—I also knew Joseph Stanley—on the eve of Mr. Constable's death Stanley came to my house to fetch me to see Mr. Constable; in consequence of what he said, I accompanied him back to Mr. Constable's house—we got to Mr. Con<lb></lb>stable's house a few moments after the clock struck seven—the clock was striking seven as we entered West-square—when I got into the house Mr. Constable was just dead—I had seen him on the previous day and on that morning alive, I should think between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon—I cannot exactly state the time—he was then dying—he was decidedly not capable of retaining a pen in his hand—he was not sensible.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What made you apply to the prisoner for Mr. Constable's picture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I understood from Mr. Birch that he had come into possession of the property—he promised to send me the picture—he did not do so—I have</p>

               <p>and walking to and fro in the street—I had been there some time watching my property—I was there perhaps six or seven hours, or more, to see that no<lb></lb>thing was taken away—Mr. Clifford advised me to remain there, and if I saw any one taking property away to detain it—it was in consequence of what he said that I walked to and fro to see what was going on—I went out, bearing cries of "Murder"—I had been sitting quietly in the parlour—the cries of "Murder" came from Sarah Blackwell, Miss Blackwell's niece—she said it was her—when I went over I found a number of persons in the house—Phœbe Black well was sent to prison—I have been indicted for a forcible entry—I went to Union-hall, and I dare say I was held to bail—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the deed</hi>)—I think this signature, "Richard Constable," is not at all like my father's, not the least—it does not bear the least resemblance—I saw it at Union-hall—I had not my glasses on then—two deeds were put into my hand at the same moment, and I could not tell one from the other—I put on my glasses at Union-hall, but I had a very transient glance of the deed there—I have since seen it, and I then said I could not tell one from the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When have you since seen it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Union-hall—I do not know who showed it to me—I saw it at Union-hall before the Magistrate—I can<lb></lb>not recollect who showed it to me—the room was full of gentlemen—some<lb></lb>body showed it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then first of all you doubted, then you put on your spectacles, and still doubted, and you have since seen it, and you do not doubt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is not at all like my father's signature, nor is this signature at all like mine—it is of course an attempt, but it is not mine—they are both attempts—I am con<lb></lb>vinced it is an attempt, because it is a forged deed—it may bear a resemblance to my signature, but it is not mine—I have seen the deed, and examined it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a deed of confirmation</hi>)—this is my signature—I have seen this before—I executed this at Mr. Boys', in Ely-place—I signed it—I said at Union-hall that I did not recollect signing it—I could not till one from the other—I have always recollected signing a deed at Mr. Boys' office—I was always perfectly conscious that I bad done so—I signed it on the 14th of Dec., 1841—the prisoner had taken me to Mr. Boys', but he had not at that time a retainer from me as my solicitor—in the March following he wrote me a letter, to require that I would give him a few lines, appointing him my solicitor, a written retainer—at the time this deed was executed, the prisoner, Mr. Boys, (Mr. Martin, his clerk, I think,) and Mr. Austin, his partner, were present—Mr. Austin was, I am sure, and I think Mr. Martin was—I went to their office for the purpose of executing that deed—I cannot say that I knew the nature of the deed before I was called upon to execute it—I did not execute it without some hesitation—I asked Mr. Boys to explain it to me—it was not read to me, and he said it was necessary that it should be read, and he read a part of it, which included the name of Phœbe Blackwell—I remarked to him that I had never beard of Phœbe Blackwell before, and it was a very extraordi<lb></lb>nary thing to give a benefit to a person I had never seen or heard of—he said she was Mr. Blackwell's sister, and was so mixed up with her uncle's affairs, that it would make great confusion to separate them—(this was before I was charged with violently breaking into the house and taking the furniture)—I inquired of Mr. Boys if he knew this person, I having never seen her—he said he did not know much of her, or he did not know her; that he under<lb></lb>stood she was a lame person, and resided in Derbyshire—I had asked to have the contents of the deed explained, and they were explained so far—I did not know what I was signing.</p>

               <p>prisoner came to me, on my return from Ireland, about the 19th of Nov., 1841, and after speaking of his uncle's death, he inquired what I was going to do respecting the freehold at Lewisham—I said, "I really hardly know what to do with it"—he said, did I know any gentleman who would relieve the free-hold from its difficulties; there was a mortgage of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on it, and the interest—I said no, I did not know any gentleman that was so inclined—he then inquired if he paid off the mortgage, would I give him an interest in it?—I said it was a very pretty place, and I would give any gentleman an inter<lb></lb>est in it, who had the means of enjoying it—he inquired what I could live upon as an income—I said my views were humble, and a small income would support me—he said, could I live on 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year?—I said "Yes, I could"—he said if he were disposed to relieve it from its difficulties, would I give him an interest in it?—he said that he could do so—I inquired what his means were—he said he had 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. his own property; that he had four shops of business, the one he resided in, one at Croydon, one in Crawford-street, and one at Chatham, and that in the course of a few months he should have a very respectable wholesale warehouse in Wood-street; that his brother would lend him 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had so much interest in the City, that he could pro<lb></lb>cure 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at two hours' notice at any time—I said if he could do that, I could certainly see no objection to give him an interest in it—(at this time I had not seen the deed in question)—he inquired what the incumbrances were—I told him there was the bill of costs due to Mr. Parker; there was 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to the mortgagee, with the interest accruing thereon; there were thir<lb></lb>teen guineas owing to the Bridge-house estate, for ground-rent for a field; that the house I had insured as long as I could for 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was now falling in—he said that all those things he would immediately set smooth, that it was a very pretty place, and that in a fortnight or three weeks' time I should see it in as good condition as I had ever seen it before—(there are twelve acres of land to it)—I lent him a pencil, and he calculated what the sums would amount to, and said it would be no inconvenience to him, he could get it done very easily, and left me—I forgot to say that he likewise mentioned that Ely-place, Holbora, belonged to his family, and that they had a very great interest in one side of Earl-street, Blackfriars, if it did not wholly belong to them—no one was present at this conversation—(it occurred in the house of Mrs. Gibbs, No. 4, Kent-place, Pimlico, opposite the end of Lower Belgrave-street—Mrs. Gibbs is a very old friend of mine, and was thirteen years house-keeper to the late Sir William Stirling—on my return from Ireland I wrote to the prisoner, and he wrote to say he would call on me, which he did)—when he had calculated what the amount would be, he said he would see Mr. Boys, of Ely-place, on the subject—I attended at Mr. Boys's, I believe, a day or two afterwards, but the next evening I went to the prisoner in Southampton-street, as I wanted to talk to him about the furniture—he had come so late, that the evening was too far gone to enter on the subject, and I went to him next evening to talk about the furniture, and general property—there were papers of great value to me—when I got there he was not at home—a Mr. Newhall came in soon after I arrived, and after waiting some time, and com<lb></lb>plaining that the prisoner never kept his appointments, he left the bouse for a very short time—the prisoner returned home in the meantime, but I did not talk about the papers and other matters of consequence—Mr. Newhall came in again, and complained that Mr. Birch had behaved excessively ill, and said that he was no lawyer, and did not know what he was about—that seemed to be conversation between themselves—they seemed to have been to Mr. Birch on some occasion, and were dissatisfied with him—he said Mr. Birch was a fool; that he had prepared a deed of reversion for the Thompson family</p>

               <p>to sign, which is a numerous branch; that he had shown no consideration, and therefore the deed was invalid, and was of no use—I did not say one word to the prisoner about the furniture, or other matters upon which I went to see him—I was there perhaps an hour, or more—I went late, because I would not interrupt his business, his evenings I considered more at leisure—I waited for some time—Mr. Newhall said that Mr. Birch had erred in his judgment; that he understood what my very liberal proposal had been to Mr. Blackwell, and in the formation of another deed, great care must be taken not to com<lb></lb>mit such an error—I left the house without mentioning the subject on which I went—Mr. Newhall broke in quite on another subject, said Mr. Stanley had robbed him, and that he had been often deceived by him, and I had no oppor<lb></lb>tunity of saying any thing about the furniture—he said Mr. Stanley had made false representations to him, and if the prisoner did not turn out an honest man he should suffer very considerably, for he had put 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods into bis hands—I do not think I went to Mr. Boys the next day—I went there a few days after the prisoner's visit to me at Pimlico—I did not mention any thing about the furniture and other important matters at Mr. Boys's—I did not doubt the prisoner's honesty at the moment, until I had fully executed the deed, and then they shuffled altogether about the furniture, and would not give any part of it up—previous to going to Mr. Boys, the prisoner had given me his promise that the furniture, and other things that belonged to me should be given up; that it was in the possession of his mother, who lived in Camberwell, but was at that time in Derbyshire, and he apologised for not being able to go with me at that time—that was between the 6th of Sept., when I arrived in London, and that day month, when I was in Ireland again—the prisoner wrote to me in Ireland, and his address was Southampton-street—I was very anxious to know what he had done with the property generally, and when I came to England I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from the Euston station, and went through London to Southampton-street, though I was very much fatigued—I saw the prisoner standing in his shop—I did not know till then that he was a draper—the moment he recognised me, having seen me at Mr. Birch's, he apologised for not being able to ask me into his sitting-room, as there were some gentlemen there on particular business—I inquired after his uncle, whose death had taken place in the interval, and which was the cause of my coming to London—he said he had died in his house; that he had had every care taken of him; that he was a very distressed man, that if he had not done so, he must either have died in the street, or have been taken to the workhouse—this conversation was in the prisoner's shop, in Southampton-street—I do not know whether we were quite alone—there might have been some of his men in the shop—I dare say there were—two women passed while I sat there, who I have since discovered to be his wife, and Phoebe Blackwell—they were not there—they passed through into the inner room, and shut the door after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now when you were at Mr. Boys' office, do you mean to say thai this deed, to which you then affixed your signature, was not distinctly explained to you in all its parts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not—I do not know the points of it at all—I know nothing that it contains more than this, that Phoebe Blackwell's name was contained in it, and I objected to her name, not knowing her—I afterwards agreed that her name should remain, as I had a great deal of confi<lb></lb>dence in the prisoner, and Mr. Boys said, "It will make a great deal of con<lb></lb>fusion if we strike her out, and it will not affect your interests at all"—I said, "I know nothing of this man except being Mr. Stanley's nephew, and he has the appearance of an honest man," but I said, "Does it not seem very odd, Mr. Boys, to give an interest to a person I never saw?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that all you knew with respect to the deed, that it gives an interest</p>

               <p>in something to Miss Phoebe Blackwell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner in the mean time had brought the draft to me, two or three evenings after I had been to Mr. Boys—it was all done within a few days—the prisoner called on me twice at Pimlico—he brought me the draft, and said he had brought it for my perusal—I said, "Mr. Blackwell, I cannot understand it, it is a great roll of paper, I shall not understand one-half of it, and if you comply with your promises to me, that is all I require," and he took it away with him again—it was soon after I arrived in England that he brought the draft to me, and soon after his first visit to me at Pimlico—no one was present when he brought the draft to me—he begged that no one might be present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he beg that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the evening that he first proposed it—I proposed that I should name his offer to some of ray friends—he said, "No, don't do that, you will be vacillating about it, you won't find any one else that will make you a better offer, and don't mention it to any one"—I did not open or look at the draft at all—I did not make inquiries respecting the furniture when he brought the draft—I paid a great many visits to South<lb></lb>ampton-street after that—it was before he brought the draft that I went there and saw Mr. Newhall there—that was between his first and second visit to me at Pimlico—I did not ask him about the furniture when be brought the draft, because he came so late in the evening and hurried away again—I do not know how long he was there—he scarcely sat down—when I saw the roll of paper I said, "This is all <hi rend="italic">leather</hi> and <hi rend="italic">prunella</hi> to me, I shall not understand it; and if you make good your promises to me that is all I shall require"—I had told Mr. Boys the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went respecting the deed, you said be need not explain it, it was all leather and prunella to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you signed it, making that observation, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not ready to sign at that time—Mr. Boys appointed me to go there one day, and there was a mistake in the stamp, and then he appointed for me to come on the next evening—I went next evening—the prisoner came and fetched me from Pimlico in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I then signed the deed—that was on the 14th of Dec.—it was then that the observation was made about Phoebe Blackwell's name being in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any portion of it read then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that I thought it was of no use to read it, I did not care about it; if Mr. Blackwell fulfilled his en<lb></lb>gagements, as I had no doubt he would, I did not want to hear any thing about it—Mr. Boys said he never allowed any lady or gentleman to sign any thing in his office without reading it, and in that case he read a part of it—I believe that was what Mr. Boys said—he read the part attaching to Phoebe Blackwell and her brother—I said to Mr. Boys, "Stop, sir, if you please, I don't want such a name as Phoebe Blackwell, I know nothing about her," and he then made the remark about her being so mixed up with her uncle's affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any copy of this deed delivered to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did the deed say with respect to the prisoner and Phoebe Blackwell? I cannot recollect what it was he read—I recollect Phoebe Blackwell's name was introduced, and I objected to it—it was a small portion of it that was read—after reading it he said, "Are you satisfied?"—I said, "I do not know that I have any reason to be dissatisfied; I dare say I shall find this young man very honourable, and that is all I shall require"—Mr. Boys said, "It won't affect your interests at all" and he then invited me round to his desk to sign it—I was going to sign it, he called Mr. Martin, his clerk, I think, and he said, "Stop, Miss Constable, before you sign it I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300227"></xptr>
               <p>will call my partner, Mr. Austen, in to witness it"—he did so, and it was signed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you believe that it would not affect your interests at all when you signed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Except, so far that it would relieve me from all the difficulties I was labouring under—I was frightened to move—I considered, by affixing my signature, that I was conveying the freehold estate to the prisoner for a consideration, for my living—I was under an impression that it would be a great benefit to me—the prisoner had firmly impressed on my mind that it would not affect my interests, and not to mention it to Mr. Boys—if the pri<lb></lb>soner had performed his promise honestly he would have had a great deal to pay—he is a very young man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have spoken in high terms of Stanley; at that time had you any reason to alter your opinion of Stanley's honour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first doubt I had thrown up on Stanley's honour was by Mr. Newhall, who very much astonished me in depreciating him in every way—up to that time I had not the least doubt of Stanley—I had a very high opinion of him, and so had my father—he died with that impression—Stanley had been very much trusted by my father and myself, we placed the greatest confidence in him—he was con<lb></lb>stantly with us during the time we resided at Lewisham—it was a lone place, he resided in the house—my father was eighty-seven years of age—we had known Stanley ever since the year 1810—he was then a rich merchant, in King's Arms-yard, Coleman-street, in the wool trade—when he afterwards came to us, he represented that he had been some years in America—he was trusted and confided in by my father and myself from the moment of his putting his foot into our house, from the year 1837, and then he represented that he had just arrived in England—he resided in our house at Lewisham—we went from town to Lewisham—my father died in West-square—Stanley did not reside in that house—we had been there from the period of leaving our house in the June preceding—the house, Mount Pleasant, at Lewisham, was let furnished to a Mr. Freeman, a solicitor, of Coleman-street—I never saw Newhall till I saw him at the prisoner's house—I saw him after that—I have seen him about three times in the course of my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that paper, (<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> X) whose handwriting is that? only look at the signature, if you please? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen what the subject-matter is; I think it is my signature—(<hi rend="italic">looking at an account</hi>)—this is neither my writing or my signature—I see what it is, I have heard of it before—I have not seen what the contents are—Mr. Newhall told a gentleman in the gallery of this Court, the other day, that I had signed an agreement for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen this paper before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, how do you know that this has anything to do with Mr. New<lb></lb>hall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, there is his name attached to it—I do not know what it alludes to—Mr. Newhall said there was an acknowledgment for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see Mr. Newhall on the subject of any sum of money owing to Mr. Stanley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw Newhall bnt once at the prisoner's—I have seen him in his own counting-house, in the presence of Mr. Petch—whatever transaction took place with the prisoner relating to Mount Pleasant was in his own house—there was a transaction with Mr. Newhall and the pri<lb></lb>soner relating to Mount Pleasant—no mention was made of any claim of Stanley's of money due to him from my father or myself, or to the prisoner—an account was drawn out by Mr. Newhall regarding the deed Mr. Boys was going to prepare—he said, as Mr. Birch had fallen into so great an error in preparing a deed of reversion, it must be carefully guarded against, and he consulted with the prisoner what sum should be entered to make the next</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300228"></xptr>
               <p>deed I was about to execute legal—it was stated that there had been no con<lb></lb>sideration shown in the former deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it stated also that the sums had not been filled up in the former deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know no deed but the one the Thompsons had executed—I know nothing about sums in a former deed—I never saw the Thompsons' deed of reversion, but they told me it was without consideration, therefore it was of no use—it was not stated that the sums had not been filled up in a former deed, I will swear that—the account was drawn out to insert a certain sum to make the deed that I was about to convey to the prisoner valid—the prisoner proposed that it should be 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newhall said no, he thought two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be much better—I know of no account—there was no memorandum, or any paper written, in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not just now say there was an account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the ac<lb></lb>count that you have; that is the one I heard Mr. Newhall had spoken of the other day, when he said he had an account for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I was at the prisoner's, the prisoner, Newhall, and myself were present, and alone—I saw Newhall writing, but not on such an account as that; it was a small piece of paper, which he took out of his pocket, the back of a letter, or something he was making memorandums, and certain sums were named—the prisoner said it should be 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that would be sufficient—they first talked of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newhall thought it would be too much, and then the prisoner said it should be 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newhall said he thought two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each would do much better—that was to make the deed I was going to give to the prisoner valid—Newhall said that a deed without a consideration was of no use—what memo<lb></lb>randum there was he made himself with his pencil, and Mrs. Blackwell ob<lb></lb>jected to it—she put her head just inside the room; she was not in the room, but she called the prisoner out of the room—I heard her say something to him, and he said, "Oh, no, you may trust him with anything," and she went down stairs again—I did not write at all, I will swear that—the memorandum was made with a pencil, which Newball took out of bis own pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About how long were you arranging all this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The arrangement, whatever it was, was not more than an hour altogether; I dare say it was an hour—Mr. Newhall, in the prisoner's presence, went into the history of the prisoner's uncle, and the prisoner sat quite dumb—he came to me next evening, and I said I thought Mr. Newhall's conduct with respect to his uncle was very extraordinary indeed—he said he thought so too; he never was so astonished at anything in his life; and be then again repeated that his uncle had no funds, and he would have died in the workhouse if it had not been for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at this paper, you may read it carefully? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is not one word of truth in it—the sums of money that appear there as paid, were paid out of a sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which we had sold our house at Kennington, in which my father had resided for fifty-two years, and I can give you the number of every note that was paid—it was in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is this paper then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a paper stating that Mr. Stanley has paid all these sums, every shilling of which was put into his pocket, and independent of that he makes a charge here for a sow and eight pigs, Which I paid myself to the man, and he never saw the man—it is entirely a fictitious account—we gave him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the carpets—"acceptances for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." we gave him—the stoves he bought of a Mr. Bell, in the new street that turns out by the Bank, I forget the name—he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—the house painting was 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which we paid every shilling—we paid Collett 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ourselves—"balance of a bill of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," we owed no such balance—"a bill of costs, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," which we paid ourselves—he had the money—"Ssmith's bill,</p>

"Why," I said, "they are totally unencumbered, Mr. Black well?"—he said, "Well, so they are, but would you have any objection to my including them, and then I can act as your agent? I will collect the rents for you, and you will never have any trouble," and they were included—the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be founded on that part of the property which was under mortgage, independent of the Huntingdon and Caermarthen property—it was when I went to sign the deed, that I asked a</p>

               <p>and Miss Constable, on the subject of the property—it was stated either by Miss Constable or the prisoner, I cannot swear which, that the property at Lewisham had been disposed of to the amount of 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or guineas, to as<lb></lb>certain the real value, and that the prisoner was in a position to pay my account—whichever stated that, the other heard it—I believe, as far as I can possibly state, Miss Constable was appealed to by the prisoner—Miss Constable stated to me that there was a certain deed conveying the property from Mr. Constable to Stanley; that she was perfectly aware that Mr. Stanley or her<lb></lb>self, I will not be positive which, had given instructions to Mr. Birch to fill up a deed—I had been endeavouring to ascertain the value of the property, that I might take security from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>was in the trouble I have spoken of, eight or nine months ago—I might have been sued four or five times, and I was sued about three or four months ago, for a small account of about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I do not suppose ever came into the warehouse at all—I believe those are the only times I have been sued—I cannot swear to once or twice—I could very safely swear that I have not been sued twenty times—I will not positively swear to it—I took a lease of the place at Camberwell—that lease is now disposed of to a gentleman—I do not know where it is—I suppose it is in his possession—I delivered it to a Mr. Greenfield, a draper, liv<lb></lb>ing at Blackheath, I think, or Greenwich—he had it immediately after the prisoner gave up the premises to the trustees to whom he assigned his pro<lb></lb>perty—I never had any other house in which the prisoner carried on busi<lb></lb>ness—I had a house in Crawford-street—I cannot state what number it was—the prisoner had those premises for about two or three months—he carried on business there—I was obliged to pay his rent—I had those premises in my own controul about three or four months—I did not take them—I be<lb></lb>came answerable for the rent to a person named Simpson—the prisoner did not take them—Mr. George Oxborough took them—he is a draper—he failed—I do not know What has become of Simpson—I know nothing of the house at Chatham—I did not know that the prisoner had a house there until he made an assignment to his creditors—I have been to the prisoner's house at Croydon—it was in the principal street—I never had anything to do with that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the habit of being referred to, for the prisoner's character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the general way of business—I should say perhaps for a dozen or fifteen accounts—I think not more—I will not swear it—I cannot say whether they were all for Camberwell—I did not give references for Chatham or Croydon—I believe I have been applied to, I have no doubt—I have not given references for Camberwell, Croydon, Chatham, and Crawford-street—neither did I know that he had a business at Croydon or Chatham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, did you not say just now that you had been to his house at Croydon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, but immediately I found he had a house at Croydon I closed his account—I did not close my own account till a long time after that—it might be a few months after—I will swear it was two months—I can<lb></lb>not positively swear to the time—I never carried on a retail shop—I was concerned in a retail shop—I had a nephew, for whom I took the house at Camberwell, in which the prisoner afterwards carried on business—my nephew did not fail—I disposed of the stock to the prisoner and his uncle—I and my partner did—M'Gooch was my partner—he retired from business with a fortune—I had been in partnership with him from about eight to ten months—he was a man of property—our agreement was to bring 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the concern—I brought in no capital at that time—my capital was then employed in a business with Mr. Hill, who I had formerly been in partnership with, but I did not know that I had no capital at that time—I entered into partnership with Mr. M'Gooch, about March, 1841, I think—Mr. Hill was a wholesale Manchester warehouseman, and carried on busi<lb></lb>ness at No. 29, Wood-street—he is now carrying on business in St. Martin's-lane—he has disposed of the business in Wood-street—I cannot say how—he has not been my partner for these two years—we separated because the concern did not answer—we did not fail—I do not know what you may term failing—I paid my debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Hill tell you he would have nothing more to do with you, and insist on leaving you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think Mr. Hill made such a re<lb></lb>mark—I cannot say that he said so—I am not aware that he ever made use</p>

               <p>of any such language—I will not swear it—in the heat of passion, what may have taken place, I know not—he did not tell me that from my connexion with the prisoner and Stanley be would have nothing more to do with me—it was regarding private affairs between him and me, respecting my bringing more money into the establishment, and Mr. Hill likewise doing so—my father-in-law objected to advancing more money as long as I was in partner<lb></lb>ship with Mr. Hill—I had brought 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the concern—that was lost—I did not lend that to Stanley—I did not know Stanley at that time, and knew nothing about his affairs whatever—I knew he was the prisoner's uncle—he was dressed as a respectable tradesman, I should say, when I saw him at the counting-house in Wood-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray what are you now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not doing anything now, and have not done anything for about four months—I have been a shopman—I have not been in a retail shop—I have not been a shopman for the last four years—I joined Mr. Hill in Sept., 1839, and I have not been a shopman since, and never in the employ of any person—I left off being a shopman on join<lb></lb>ing Mr. Hill—I am now living at No. 13, Wood-street—the house is let to a Mr. Leith—it belongs to a Mr. Melville, a patent thread-manufacturer in Wood-street—I do not lodge there—I have the upper part of the house—the warehouses are let to Mr. Leith—I am a tenant until March—I am not there to take care of the house—I paid 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—I have now let the house to Mr. Leith, from the 25th of Dec. last, but he occupied it six weeks or two months previously, on condition that I remained in the house until I met with a private residence—Mr. Leith paid no rent until the 25th of Dec.—I carried on business there as a Manchester warehouseman—I never assigned my stock to my father-in-law—I did not cart it away in the night—I dis<lb></lb>posed of my stock to Messrs. Sewell and Cross—I sold the whole of it at certain prices, with a discount off—I did not-dispose of the whole by the lump, but by stating certain quantities of goods at cost price, which I dis<lb></lb>posed of to them, with a discount off—I had had some of those goods for nearly eighteen months, I should say—the whole of the stock amounted to I should say 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—perhaps 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth I might not have had more than a month—I will swear that I had not more than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth a month before—I did not sell any of the stock to any one besides Sewell and Cross—I sold none in what is called the <hi rend="italic">slaughter-house</hi>—I never sold my stock in that way—I swear that positively, not to anybody—I did not dispose of my stock the last time I compounded with my creditors—I had the manage<lb></lb>ment of that stock—my father-in-law did not have it—I swear that—I went on with my regular trading, my father-in-law being security—I disposed of it in the general way of business, to various houses round London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, were you not in partnership with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my knowledge—I have asked my solicitor, and he distinctly tells me that the agreement then entered into, never was of any effect, and is not binding—I intended to go into partnership with him—I do not know whether it was before or after this debt which I got the deeds to cover—the agreement between the prisoner and myself, as regards the partnership, was this: I had been speaking to my father-in-law that I wanted money; Mr. M'Gooch did not bring the money which he agreed to do, into the establish<lb></lb>ment, therefore, Mr. M'Gooch withdrew from it—the prisoner proposed to me that he would bring in 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the establishment, and join me, providing I would produce the same—I agreed with the prisoner, on this condition, that if I paid Mr. M'Gooch out of the establishment, he would not enter into any agreement with him, unless he would have it binding to forfeit 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he did not fulfil the engagement—I do not say that I have ever had 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300236"></xptr>
               <p>in my life—I have had money at my banker's—they have not been my cre<lb></lb>ditors for a single shilling—they have trusted me and discounted for me to the amount of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were five bills taken as security for the stock, which my bankers discounted for me, which had the joint names of Stanley and Blackwell to them—Stanley became security to my solicitor, jointly with the prisoner, for the stock which I handed over to him, belong<lb></lb>ing to my nephew—the prisoner and I entered into an agreement for the 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece, I think on the 1st of Nov., 1841—the prisoner was to produce 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear that I took these deeds as security after that—I will swear that I did not get these deeds for the purpose of afterwards handing them to my father-in-law—I did not owe my father-in-law any money at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you the deeds in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Me and my solicitor together, I believe, for about a fortnight or three weeks—then I went on to my banker's, Sir John Lubbock, and told them that I wanted a pro<lb></lb>missory note discounted—they immediately discounted me a promissory note for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I left the deeds, as a collateral security, with Sir John Lubbock—in about a month I paid the note back, for which they allowed me the interest off—I got that money in my trade—I was then carrying business at No. 13, Wood-street, as a wholesale dealer, not with Mr. Hill—it was twelve months, or more, after the dissolution with him—I have been a great many times to the house at Camberwell to inquire for the prisoner, always wanting to get money—he owed me a very large account at that time—I have seen the prisoner and his wife there on several occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the occasion as to which you have been giving evidence, did you, the prisoner, and Miss Constable, go up stairs together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went up stairs to Miss Constable and the prisoner—they were there—I never saw Miss Constable, to my knowledge, till I met her at the prisoner's—I am not cer<lb></lb>tain whether that was the first time, or whether it was the night before—I saw her twice at the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you on that occasion state to Miss Constable that you were glad you had found the means of <hi rend="italic">trimming</hi> Birch, who was no lawyer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I made use of such words as "<hi rend="italic">trimming</hi> Birch," or any thing of the kind—I think I could safely swear I did not—I said that I had not confidence in Mr. Birch—I did not make use of the word <hi rend="italic">"trimming"</hi>—I said it was my opinion that Mr. Birch was not a clever solicitor—I had no reason but my opinion for so stating—I have frequently heard gentlemen speak of one solicitor and another, and as my solicitor I certainly should not have confi<lb></lb>dence in Mr. Birch; that was my only reason, and from his conduct towards the prisoner, in not giving him information about the deeds and things in his possession—I have no other reason that I know of—I did not say that Mr. Birch had made a mess of a deed which he had had prepared for the Thompson family—I will swear that—I never mentioned the Thompson family, neither did I know any thing of any transaction with the Thompson family—I believe at the second interview I had with Miss Constable, when I copied the receipts which were produced to me, I said that my solicitor would not take these deeds as security.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What deeds do you mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean the deed that is in blank, and Miss Constable said—(I cannot say whether she said she had written, or Mr. Stanley, but that) instructions had been given by them to fill up the blanks—Mr. Reynolds was my attorney then—he knew from Hale, Boys, and Austen, that the deed was in blank—I authorised him to get me security, or otherwise to enter the warrant of attorney, which I had on the property in Crawford-street, and Southampton-street—it was not upon that blank deed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300237"></xptr>
               <p>that I advanced the money to the prisoner, hut on a confirmation deed, exe<lb></lb>cuted by Miss Constable, Poebe Blackwell, and the prisoner, at Hale, Boys, and Austen's, which was handed over to my solicitor—I do not know that I said that Mr. Birch had made a mess of a deed, by not putting any consider<lb></lb>ation in to it—I believe I can firmly swear, to the best of my belief, that I did not—I certainly should not like to go further than that—I did not, to my knowledge, say that I was glad Miss Constable bad fallen into the prisoner's hands, as he would be sure to improve the estates for her—I will swear I did not make use of those words—I might have stated in the course of conversa<lb></lb>tion, that I was very glad Miss Constable and the prisoner had arranged their affairs—I knew nothing of their private matters—I did not at that time know that the prisoner was a pauper, and not worth a shilling—he had acceptances of mine out at that time, over due, and unpaid, in the way of trading, I should suppose to the amount of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it was not above 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were five bills of 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and three of those were re<lb></lb>turned to my bankers dishonoured—in the way of trading, save and except those bills which were returned to me, which I had the security of the warrant of attorney for, I believe the amount was not more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear there was not 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdue, and unpaid at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it was not exceeding 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot swear that, without you will allow me to see my ledger—there was Coster's account then not wholly paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, or the prisoner, say that you thought 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be a good sum to put in the deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not positive—I cannot say whether I did or not—I do not remember proposing 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner saying, "No, put in 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I only stated to the prisoner in passing, that I thought if all they said was as available as they represented it to be, as Miss Constable and the prisoner both stated, independent of the property which was at Hunting<lb></lb>don, and in Wales, that I thought when I was making out these copies, 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a sufficient sum for passing over the estate from one gentleman to another, and Miss Constable replied that they could prove still further receipts if I wished to copy them, but it being then near twelve o'clock at night, I felt uneasy at my wife waiting my return—I might have proposed to have 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put into the deed, but I cannot swear it—the prisoner might have said that he thought 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be better—I did not on that say that I thought two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each would be better than 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear that positively—I never suggested two sums of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any thing to that effect—I never proposed the division of the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into two sums—I never pro<lb></lb>posed that the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be divided—I will swear that to the best of my knowledge—I believe I did not—if I must swear one way or other I should distinctly say no—I can go no further—I am a man of property now—I do not see that I am bound to say to what amount, my creditors may be here<lb></lb>after influenced by it—I have been insolvent—I have never been through the Insolvent Court—I have not been insolvent twice—my father-in-law became security, and I paid my creditors off myself—I asked them to give me time, after which I paid them interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Repeat the conversation that passed with Miss Constable, you, and the prisoner, at the house at Camberwell, respecting the value of the property at Lewisham? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Miss Constable gave me a statement then that the house had been disposed of, and was bought in again for, I believe, (as far as my me<lb></lb>mory serves me, to the best of my knowledge,) 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she then stated, to further prove the value of the house, that it had been let furnished at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, the house and grounds—I then inquired respecting how it came into possession of Mr. Stanley, and I was then informed that there was a rever<lb></lb>sionary</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300238"></xptr>
               <p>deed of sixteen nephews and nieces, who bad an interest in this estate, which was the cause of its being disposed of, to ascertain the real value—that reversionary deed is now jointly with those in the hands of the bankers—to the best of my recollection I have stated all the conversation, or the greatest part of it—I do not at this moment recollect every word—the conversation was very similar at the second interview, with the exception of copying these receipts—the receipts were not produced by me to Miss Constable—I cannot say whether they were produced to her by the prisoner—he brought the re<lb></lb>ceipts and the different things down from Miss Constable into the room, and left them in the room for me to copy, and I did copy out the receipts, and that is a true copy of them—I afterwards went up stairs to Miss Constable, and asked her if that was a true copy—the receipts were not produced by me in her presence—I cannot say whether I saw them produced by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then have you told the truth when you said that the prisoner brought down the receipts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the lower room—the prisoner stepped down from the sitting-room, where he was in conversation with Miss Constable, and brought them—he produced the receipts to me in the kitchen, where I copied them—there were various receipts—I should say ten or fifteen or more than that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take that account in your hand, and be cautious how you answer; it contains a list of items in your own handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I see some writing at the bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What part of that writing will you on your oath swear you saw Miss Constable write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I will not swear to any thing else—I wrote the paper through—after I had written it I gave it, in the presence of the prisoner and Miss Constable—I cannot say to whom I gave it—I might have laid it on the table—they were both in the room—I do not know whether I handed it to the prisoner or Miss Constable, but I saw Miss Constable write this "Elizabeth Hollis Constable," in the room—I saw her write that—I put the paper down, or gave it to the prisoner or Miss Constable, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after did you see her name to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say from twenty minutes to half an hour—I am not quite certain whether I was in the room all the while—I was in the room with Miss Constable I should say after this paper was signed—I was in the room until she signed it—I saw her write those words—I will not swear who wrote what is above it—I do not remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why you never left the room until she signed it; on your solemn oath, did not the same person that wrote this name write that which is over it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear—I do not remember—I do not know why the prisoner did not put his name to it as a witness as well as me—I did not ask him—I was not acquainted with these things—I put my name because I was asked by the prisoner to do so—I am not certain whether Mrs. Blackwell or Miss Blackwell were there, or who was there—I know Miss Constable and the prisoner were present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But as you were a person to be benefited by the deed, why did not you ask them to witness it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know I was to be benefited by the deed when that paper was signed—it was a transaction between the prisoner and Miss Constable—I cannot say what it was signed for—I was waiting there to get my account, for goods supplied to the prisoner in his trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the same person who wrote as you say, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable," write those several lines which are above it, beginning, "I have carefully compared?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear that the same person wrote the other, not having noticed it—had I been aware that I was to come</p>

               <p>as a witness I should have noticed it—I noticed her signature—I heard this read over in the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it ready signed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of that—when I came in, I saw Miss Constable take a pen, and write, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I can swear positively that I saw Miss Constable take a pen from the ink-stand, and write, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I was called in to witness it—I am not aware that I ever left the room from the time I was called in to wit<lb></lb>ness it, till Miss Constable had signed it—I was not in the room when I copied this deed—I did not leave the room from the time I was called up from copying this deed in the kitchen, I mean this copy of the receipts—when I was called up stairs to witness that, I never left the room till Miss Constable bad signed it—I never saw Miss Constable write but once—I never saw Miss Blackwell write, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at that name, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable," the word "Hollis" particularly, and tell me whether you cannot see a tracing of pencil, or something of that sort, upon which that signature is written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I was called to witness this, Miss Constable, I believe, as far as my me<lb></lb>mory now serves me, might be in the act of writing this name, and on her doing so, I immediately said, "I will not be witness to this unless I see you take the pen and write "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—part of this might have been written by her, but I would not witness it unless I saw her take a pen from the inkstand and write it over again, not again, I did not wish to say—as far as my memory serves me, she might have written part, but I dis<lb></lb>tinctly swear I saw her take a pen and write "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I have come here to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the word "Hollis," do not you see the tracing of a pen or pencil in that word, upon which it has been written over again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cer<lb></lb>tainly do see some little signing, or something or other—I do not know what it is, but I distinctly swear I saw Miss Constable take a pen and sign her name—I see something, as if it might have been slurred over, or something of that sort—I do not see any thing slurred over in the word "Elizabeth"—there is a little soil, a little grease, or something of that sort on it—I do not know whether to call it tracing, or what—there appears to be a little soiling on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you see there is a distinct mark of something hard upon which the word "Hollis" has been again written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is something—I cannot dis<lb></lb>tinctly state what it is, or any thing of the kind—to the best of my belief, I told Miss Constable that I would not witness the signature unless I saw her write all the words "Elizabeth Hollis Constable"—I will swear I said I would not be a witness till I saw her write her name with a pen—I do not know</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean, on your oath, to swear that when you put your name to that paper, the signature, "Elizabeth Hollis Constable," was on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Elizabeth Hollis Constable's name, signed, "Elizabeth Hollis Con<lb></lb>stable," was on that paper when I put my name as a witness—the words be<lb></lb>ginning, "I have carefully compared," were certainly on that paper when I put my name to it—I believe that I read them over—I will swear when she signed it they were there—I believe I can swear positively they were there that day—to the best of my belief, I will swear that those words were on the paper when I put my name to it—I recollect the words distinctly being an<lb></lb>nounced to Miss Constable that night, upon which she stated, that if I re<lb></lb>quired it, she could produce further receipts from her father's cash-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you want further receipts for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To fill up the deed—this was after the deed had been taken out of Mr. Birch's hands, and was in blank, but which Miss Constable stated ought to be filled up, for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd she thought was the sum which her father was indebted to Joseph Stanley—I am not certain whether Mrs. Blackwell was present when this was read over—I will not swear that she did not read it over—I will not swear that she did not write this in my presence—she might have written it, but I did not notice it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that Mrs. Blackwell did not write the whole of that "Eli<lb></lb>zabeth Hollis Constable," and all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If she did I did not see it—I believe that part of the name, when I was called to witness it, either "Elizabeth," or something, was written—I then distinctly said, "I will not put my name to that till I see Miss Constable take a pen, and write 'Elizabeth Hollis Con<lb></lb>stable."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did this deed, the genuineness of which is now questioned, first come into your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the confirmation deed had been exe<lb></lb>cuted, I think, about January or February, 1842, as near as I can remember—my solicitor placed it in my possession—I rather think it was sent down by the clerk to me, at No. 13, Wood-street—I believe that was the way—it was left at the warehouse for me—the first time I ever saw the deed was in the handing it over by Sutcliffe and Birch's clerk to a clerk of Hale, Boys, and Austen—I believe the prisoner was present then—I got possession of it from two to three months after that—the prisoner wished to borrow some money to pay off Sutcliffe and Birch—I said, "I will not advance you more money without you will give me security of some kind."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Never mind that, but tell us what the arrangement was by which you got that deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That Miss Phoebe Blackwell and the prisoner should allow me to hold the deeds, as a collateral security for money which I had advanced to pay off the lien—both Phoebe Blackwell and the prisoner said that—the prisoner said that he would allow me to hold the deeds belonging to his estate, as a collateral security for the money I had advanced—I entered up a warrant of attorney on the premises in Crawford-street—the agreement was, that I was to pay Sutcliffe and Birch's bill, and to hold this deed as a collateral security for my debt—I paid Sutcliffe and Birch's bill, I think, to the best of my recollection on the 1st or 2nd of Dec., 1841, late that evening—the deeds were handed to Hale, Boys and Austen's clerk, by their clerk—I had possession of these deeds, to the best of my recollection, in Feb., 1842—they were banded to me by my solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you intermediately any communication with the prisoner before you got the deeds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the morning after he had passed them into Messrs. Birch's hands, I asked him to hand me those deeds, as a collateral</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300241"></xptr>
               <p>security—he made a little demur in handing them over to me—he did not hand them over to me—I never saw him write to the effect that they should be handed over to me, but he did solemnly promise that I should have and hold them, as a collateral security—this was in Dec., and I got them, to the best of my knowledge, about Feb.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOYS</hi>. I am one of the firm of Hale, Boys, and Austen, solici<lb></lb>tors, in Ely-place. In the autumn of 1841, we were employed by Mr. and Miss Blackwell, as their solicitors—we were to get some papers out of the possession of Sutcliffe and Birch—we afterwards got those papers out of their hands—their bill was paid before the papers were delivered—I saw Miss Constable after that—she subsequently executed this deed in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the confirmation deed</hi>)—I am not the attesting witness to it, Mr. Martin is the attesting witness—I see Miss Constable's signature—I saw her three times on the subject pre<lb></lb>viously—the prisoner was with her on those occasions—at the time I first saw her on the subject of preparing this deed, I had seen the other deed, where there are blanks—that deed was adverted to on the first occasion—I am not sure it was produced, but either the deed or a copy was there—the title was the sub<lb></lb>ject of discussion, and this blank deed, and the effect of it, was one point under consideration—I have an original memorandum of my own—this was on the 10th of Dec., 1841—the opinion of a conveyancer had been taken previous to that, and here is the case—when I saw Miss Constable, the question that we were considering with Mr. Black well and Miss Constable was the perfecting the title of this estate, in consequence of the deed in blank having been obtained from Sutcliffe and Birch—the case, which had been laid before the convey<lb></lb>ancer, was before me, and under discussion and consideration, and I have here the minutes which I made, when the prisoner and Miss Constable were present—this was on the first occasion—the prisoner brought the case that I had before taken the opinion of counsel on—I had given it to him, if I recollect right, the day before—I explained to Miss Constable the effect of the title—I cannot state the exact words I said—I called her attention to it—two other deeds had been prepared by Sutcliffe and Birch—they were settlements, apparently on her part, of this property, and the effect of these I explained to her as well as this, and she expressed regret that the title was in that state by means of the blank deed—she fully understood that a deed was necessary—I explained to her the parties who were interested under the trust, sup<lb></lb>posing the blanks for the sums had been filled in—Stanley's name was men<lb></lb>tioned to her, as being a party interested—I mentioned it to her—the first part of the minute that I made here is the amount of the debts due, which were to be the consideration for the deed to be prepared—I explained to her that there were certain blanks in the deed, for debts to be entered to certain parties, and I explained to her the effect of the trusts, and that Stanley was the trustee—Stanley was then dead, but was represented by the prisoner, who claimed the interest which he had under his will—we were not her solicitors, but the Blackwells'—that was the first time I had seen her, but she was so satisfied with Blackwell, that she instructed us afterwards, at a subsequent interview, to prepare this confirmation deed—we were engaged for both parties, and had the drafts for counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that account, did you ever see that whilst the deed was pre<lb></lb>paring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From a pencil memorandum at the back, and from recollection, this was in the office at the time the deed was prepared—I cannot say that this account was produced at either of the three interviews with Miss Con<lb></lb>stable and the prisoner—I am not sure that it was—there is a pencil memo<lb></lb>randum of mine, "Received, Dec, 4th, 1841"—that shows it must have been in receipt by me on Dec. 4th—this is my own writing—I think I received</p>

               <p>it from the prisoner—I cannot say whether it was produced in the presence of Miss Constable—the figures were acted upon as the basis of the draft, for inserting the sum in this conveyance—at the first interview, I adverted to the deed in blank—I have a minute that advances were made to Mr. Constable—I cannot say who said it—both assented to it—I made a minute of what passed on the first interview—in Miss Constable's presence, it was stated, that Stanley's executors had a claim of 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I took down, in the presence of Mr. Blackwell and Miss Constable 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as due to Stanley's executors—Miss Constable did not deny that that was the fact, she assented to it—I made this memorandum at the time, of what took place at that interview—I took the whole of these minutes from both of them—the exact sum which it was agreed should be inserted as the sum due from the prisoner's estate, was afterwards fixed on and afterwards inserted, according to that account, when the deed was drawn out—but in her presence 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was what was agreed to—I also understood from her or Blackwell (she assented to it) that advances were made to Mr. Constable, and also to her, after his death, before the deed in blank was executed, and after also, by Stanley—the prisoner and Miss Constable were both present at this time—Miss Constable did not deny it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that it was both before and after the deed in blank was executed, advances were made to Mr. Constable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, to Mr. Constable, and to Miss Constable after his death—that the claim of Stanley's executors consisted of advances made both in Mr. Constable's life-time and after his death—I was so told at the time—the last item in this account is Oct. 30, 1838—that was supposed to be after Mr. Constable's death in 1840.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the second interview, had this deed of the 14th of Dec. 1841, been prepared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—at the first interview Miss Constable expressed a wish to convey the surplus of this property to Mr. Blackwell alone, and it stood over for me to see Miss Blackwell, which I did—they were both interested under the will of Mr. Stanley, as executors and devisees—I saw Miss Blackwell in the mean time; and, at the second interview, re<lb></lb>ference was made to her being a party to the deed—I have got the memoran<lb></lb>dum of what took place at the second interview, with Miss Constable and the prisoner—we further discussed the matter, and I took instructions to prepare the deed—according to Mr. Kemp's, my conveyancer's opinion, in the best way—allusion was made to the sum which ought to have been inserted in the deed in blank, because the interests of some of the parties whose names were in the deed in blank, without sums, had to be attended to in the new deed—1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the sum mentioned to be inserted in the deed as the sum due to Stanley's executors—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the draft</hi>)—that was to be taken as the sum due to his executors, and was to include the sum which ought to have been in the blank deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could that possibly be, when Stanley did not die till six months after Mr. Constable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As I was instructed, there was a sum due to Stanley—I was instructed that there was a debt, part paid in Mr. Consta<lb></lb>ble's life-time, to him, and part to Miss Constable, after his death—it was only part of the sum that ought to have been in the blank deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, having received these instructions with regard to the preparation of this deed, did Miss Constable and the prisoner attend at the time it was executed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did—that was not on the third occasion—I saw them once before—I saw them on the 13th the third time—the first interview was on the 10th of Dec., the second on the 11th, the third on the 13th, and on the 14th I saw them again—on the 13th I explained again to them the nature of the intended deed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the provisions of the deed? Do they follow the blank deed, and only alter as to the sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It purports to be a convey<lb></lb>ance by Miss Constable to the prisoner and Miss Black well, in consideration of 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., composed of a mortgage debt of 2350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the debt due to Stanley's executors, 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the amount paid to Sutcliffe and Birch, and 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the amount of our debt and interest, altogether making 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no provision of any annuity or any surplus for her—she ex<lb></lb>pressed her readiness to give the prisoner up any surplus there was, and there is a covenant by the prisoner and his sister to indemnify her for mortgage debts, taking them to themselves—there is mention of the estate in Wales—it is a very small estate indeed—Miss Constable and the prisoner both said it was a very small cottage—there is also some property in Huntingdon that is not valuable, worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe, not more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She attended, on the fourth occasion, for the purpose of executing this deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I believe she then executed it, though I am not the attesting witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before she executed the deed, did you explain it to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I explained it to her fully—I did not read it in full, but I explained it to her, and she understood it—the consideration was supposed to be exactly 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this deed; and when I came to add up these executed deeds, it came to more; therefore it became necessary to have the stamp altered, and she went into the calculation with me—I checked it with her, and the prisoner—I made her quite understand, that the prisoner was not to be her trustee—that she was to have no expectation—that she was to discharge her father's supposed debts and have nothing—she never gave me to understand that there were any debts of her father's beyond this mortgage debt, and those debts mentioned here—all the property was to go in liquidation of those debts—she was to be free of the debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And also free of any inheritance,—to be abroad in the world without a shilling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but she always stated the property to me, and the prisoner too, as worth very little more than the mortgage debt—I did not take any pains to sift into the reality of any debt to the Stanleys—I did not know whe<lb></lb>ther he was a man capable of lending 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I heard nothing of him—I have got a minute the first time I saw Miss Constable and the prisoner, that he (Stanley) was a friend of Mr. Constable, and acted for him—I only knew what they told me, that Mr. Stanley was a friend of Mr. Constable, and that he was an elderly gentleman—I understood that—I knew nothing except what Miss Constable and the prisoner told me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think, for the protection of a lady, ignorant of law affairs, that it was your duty to satisfy yourself that this consideration existed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, in the fullest way possible—I explained every thing to her, and I think Miss Constable knew very well what she was about, from the four or five interviews I had with her, and if she misled me I cannot help it—I acted for her afterwards in several things.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that you knew nothing of the circumstances of Stanley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in that extended sense—I heard of Stanley when I first came to Ely-place, and I had seen him up to 1836 and 1837, but since then I had lost sight of him altogether—I never was acquainted with him—I have seen him at Ely-place—I believe my predecessors acted for the prisoner's father and brother, in a heavy Chancery suit, and during the progress of those matters, Stanley came to the office on the part of the prisoner's father, who was a client of the house—I never in my life called at Stanley's lodging, that I recollect—I never heard of such a name as Mrs. Jenkinson, or of such a place as Swinton-street,</p>

               <p>Gray's-inn-road—I never was there that I recollect—I never called there on Stanley, that I recollect—I will swear I never did—I never recollect calling on Stanley in my life—I never called and paid him 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for him, nor ever paid his rent for him—I never called on Stanley, or paid him anything—I never knew Stanley—I never paid 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or any other sum for his rent, at any house in Swinton-street, Gray's-inn-road—you take me so by surprise—these are questions which I had no idea of ever being asked, because I never called on Stanley, or knew anything at all of his fate—when I saw him last at Ely-place in 1836 or 1837, I did not know his circumstances, but I should say he was not a rich man—I did not know that he was in destitution and poverty—I did not expect from his appearance that he was rich—I can form an opinion of any body as to their apparent wealth and station in life—I am quite prepared to swear that I have never been to any lodging of Stanley's, or to any house where he lodged—I am quite at a loss to recollect what you can allude to—I think you must be under some mistake—I am quite prepared to swear it, and I do swear it to the best of my recollection—I never knew where Stanley was lodging, to my recollection, because I never heard of him except in some way connected with the Blackwells, the prisoner's father and brother—Stanley never came to my office in Ely-place, and sold me cigars or tea—I have never seen him there with cigars and tea to my recollection—he may have had some parcels with him, but I do not know that he was there with tea—if he came, he came on the business of the prisoner's father and brother, connected with the Chancery suits—I have looked to see whether I have any memorandum of his coming to our office, and that enables me to answer you the more clearly as to the years 1836 and 1837—I saw him in 1836 I think, or 1837, about some dispute he had with a Mr. Parker, and I learnt from him then that he was in the tea trade—he did not on that oc<lb></lb>casion produce cigars for sale—he never did such a thing, nor tea either—he told me himself, in Ely-place, that he was in the tea trade; he did not tell me where he was carrying it on, and I did not ask him—it was not my business—I never knew that he was in the habit of hawking tea about the streets—I never heard of it—the prisoner introduced Miss Constable to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that she was coming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not sure whether the prisoner did not say he would take the case to her, and show her the opinion—I did not know for certain that she was coming—there was no appointment that I can recollect—I think when I gave him the opinion, it was to show to her—I do not know that he told me he would bring her to me—I will not swear he did not—it is very probable that he would bring her—I expected that he would—I have said as much, but there was no appointment made—I have been in partnership since 1834 or 1835—I never had such a deed as this put into my hands before—there were other deeds with it, and I never saw such a complicated title before; and so thought my senior partner, Mr. Hale, with whom I consulted—it was not left to myself alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the kindness to tell me whether, when you saw that deed in blank as you found it, you entertained no suspicion of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought it a curious deed, but not further than that—it is an extraordinary state for a deed to be in—I do not know that I entertained any suspicion of it, beyond what I have stated—I will swear I did not beyond what I have stated—from the appearance, I necessarily looked on it as an imperfect document, and a very curious document altogether—I did not look on it as a suspicious document, not with a view of supposing that, for instance, it had been forged or obtained improperly, or any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>

               <p>out what they were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We got the deed from Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it had been brought by the prisoner, the attesting witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what I should have done in that case—it would depend on all the circumstances of the case, because affidavits had been made about these deeds by Mr. Birch as alluded to in his bill of costs—I took a retainer from Miss Constable—I did not require her to antedate that retainer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath did you not send her a retainer, and require her to antedate it, or antedate it yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that 1 recollect—I do not recollect doing it—I have no recollection of requiring her to antedate a re<lb></lb>tainer for three or four months—to the best of my recollection I did not—I sent it by the post, if I recollect right—I will swear I did not require her to antedate it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the retainer</hi>)—this is dated, Dec. 20th—I will swear that that was not signed in March, 1842—this was sent by the post at the time of the date—here is the envelope, and here is my memorandum at the back, of the same date—I will swear that this was not signed by Miss Constable in March—I will swear it came to me at this time, and that I had it in my possession ever since Dec. the 20th I think—I do not know that I sent it to her—I believe it to be written by Miss Constable—it came by post—I will swear that—I believe this envelope belongs to this letter—I will swear it—to the best of my recollection Miss Constable took a form of a retainer, and she said she would write it, and she sent it by the post—she took the form from me—I think she was going out of the country, or going away—it was necessary to prove her father's will, and I suggested she should leave an authority for us to act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why could she not write it at your office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was her own request to do it—I swear from recollection that that was the transaction—I could refer to bills of course, but this is a retainer that came by post at this time upon which we acted, and proved the will—I did not say she copied the retainer—I gave her a form which she took away—it was her wish to do it—I do not know why.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray do you know Miss Phoebe Blackwell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I had never seen her to the best of my recollection, before about the autumn when we were acting for her and her brother as Stanley's executors—I never re<lb></lb>presented her to Miss Constable to be lame, and living in Derbyshire—I will swear that most positively, nor any thing to that effect—I never described her to Miss Constable in my life, because Miss Constable was there with her some<lb></lb>times, very often at Ely-place—I will swear that on my introducing the deed to be signed by Miss Constable, she did not say, "Mr. Boys, stop here, what has Miss Black well's name to do with me? I do not know her"—as I stated before, Miss Constable in the first instance wished to convey the sur<lb></lb>plus of this property to the prisoner alone—she wished not to have the pro<lb></lb>perty conveyed to Miss Black well—she at first objected to Miss Black well's name being in the deed—I did not tell her that she was so mixed up with Stanley that it could not be prepared in, any other way—I told her that she was mixed up in this way, that they were joint executor and executrix under the will—that they were jointly interested under the will, and that it would be improper to make a conveyance to the prisoner alone—the instructions to counsel to prepare the draft goes on that principle, and I always kept her interest, and the prisoner's in view, for that very reason.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would the assistance of counsel which had for its object the pre<lb></lb>paration of that deed, interfere with the question, whether you should act for a party giving, and a party taking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because counsel were instructed to prepare a deed for all parties, which is very frequently the case in the pro<lb></lb>fession.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say to Miss Constable, "You appear to be a stranger, have you no friend but this Blackwell; had you not better consult somebody on your own behalf?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I did not not say those very words, I did to the effect—I can go no further than my memorandum and my recollection—I asked her if she wished us to act for her, and she said, "Yes"—I am not sure whether I asked her if she wished anybody else to act for her—I cannot say—we did act for her afterwards—I made myself a trustee in the deed—I did not receive any money on its execution—I obtained money on it after<lb></lb>wards, the costs of it—that was not 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the costs relating to the deed itself were about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I forget the amount—there were some other costs—that money was paid on the completion of the security, from the prisoner to Newhall—I do not know who paid it—my clerk settled it—what hand actually paid the money, I do not know—the agreement was a security from the prisoner and his sister to Newhall, and on our handing over the deeds, we were paid our bill of costs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By whose direction did you hand over the deeds to Newhall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As the solicitors of the prisoner and his sister—I have no written direc<lb></lb>tions—it was a general direction when we were instructed to settle the agree<lb></lb>ment—there was an agreement to deposit, to which Mr. and Miss Blackwell were parties, and Newhall—I have not got it—I placed this deed in New<lb></lb>hall's hands when the agreement to deposit was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As between Blackwell and Newhall, you were not concerned for both those, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we were concerned for Blackwell and his sister—the agreement was the authority for handing over this deed to Newhall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, had you not verbal instructions from the prisoner to hand over the deeds to Newhall, and among them this deed in blank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not from the prisoner alone, but from the prisoner and his sister, on the terms mentioned in that memorandum, which are very particular as to Miss Blackwell, because her interest is different, but still kept in view—Mr. New<lb></lb>hall's solicitor prepared an agreement to deposit, as an equitable security on this property—we were instructed by the prisoner and his sister to deliver over the deeds to Newhall with the agreement, and not without it—we were not justified or authorised in parting with these deeds except with the agree<lb></lb>ment, when the matter was closed—we were then justified in parting with them, by our instructions as solicitors to the prisoner and his sister—we had directions not to dispose of the deeds without the agreement—we were di<lb></lb>rected to deposit the agreement and deeds also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that recital of the deed in blank, and you will see that it there states the deed was executed on the 30th of Dec., although it is not dated, it says "whereas, by an indenture of release bearing no date, but executed on or about the 30th of Dec.," by what instructions did you insert that recital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In consequence of a statement in the case—I see it is stated in the case that it was executed on the 31st of Dec.—then I have got a note, "We have, since</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300247"></xptr>
               <p>this case was drawn, been informed that the deed was executed on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 30th"—I do not recollect who told me so—I might have got this information from Mr. Hale, or the prisoner might have told me—this note is my own handwriting—I think I made it the day when the prisoner brought back this case, and when he and Miss Constable were together—I cannot say which of the two gave me the information that induced me to make the note—it was when they were present together, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you suppose it, or that you really have a recollection that the prisoner and Miss Constable were together when you made that memorandum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—I can throw back my mind to the fact, from the circumstance of the case being brought, and our going through the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When do you say you made that note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on the 11th—the first day that the prisoner and Miss Constable were with me—that was after the case had come back from counsel—it is very fre<lb></lb>quently the custom to make notes when we find the fact is not correctly stated—I positively swear it was not there before the case was laid before counsel—I made it because it was an altered state of facts, because it was so very near the time of Mr. Constable's death—that was the subject talked of when Miss Constable was with me for the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was talked of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The deed having been executed so shortly before Mr. Constable's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you were not told to make that al<lb></lb>teration by the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I will not swear it, because they were both together—I cannot carry my recollection so nice as that—I recollect that it was spoken of as a deed, executed very shortly before Mr. Constable's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what way was that noticed; as a strange thing, out of the ordinary course, or what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only in ascertaining the date, there is no date to the deed, and I had to describe the deed in some way or other in the draft, and it was the only way of arriving at it—I only took it from what I was told by the parties—the date of this new deed is the 14th of Dec., 1841—this retainer was given a week after, as she was going away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the probate taken out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not for some time; I forget when—there was a sum of money at Somerset House, which she obtained under that probate, and which we got for her—that was not contained in the deed—the will was not proved for some time, because there were proceedings going on in the Court of Chancery, and she did not want to be made a party to them—she came back after some time, saying she wanted this money from Somerset House; the probate was then taken out; we received the money, and paid it to her—about April she came again with a Mr. Petch, and she complained against the Blackwells, and talked about proceeding against them—she asked me to take proceedings against them, not at first, but afterwards; I refused; I told her we were not concerned for either party in dispute; I told her it was a civil remedy—I might have told her that her remedy was an action for <hi rend="italic">trover</hi>—she complained that they had taken away all her goods and furniture—I think I did not hear that this was a forged deed until about that time, about the summer, when Mr. Petch and other parties came with her to our office—I never learnt it from my partner, Mr. Hale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not learn from Mr. Hale that Dr. Lever had been with him, called his attention to it, and warned him against it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not that it was forged; I have some recollection of something being said about the deed being executed very shortly before Mr. Constable's death, that something</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300248"></xptr>
               <p>was not right about it; but as to hearing about its being forged I did not hear that till quite lately—I did not hear it till this new deed was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Surely you did, for you have just said that you made a memorandum on the draft, because you had been informed that it was on the morning of the 30th it was executed, the day before Mr. Constable died? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but they are asking me whether I heard it was a for<lb></lb>gery before then—Mr. Hale had not said anything to me about its being irregular—he had not said anything about it before the new deed was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This is a very important fact; nobody could mistake whether when they were about to get a woman to execute a fresh deed, they had notice that the former was a forged one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not at the time this was drawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to pledge your oath to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, positively—I did not know by information from Mr. Hale that there was anything wrong about the deed till after the deed of confirmation was exe<lb></lb>cuted—I did not know at the time I took the conveyance to the prisoner and his sister, that, with the exception of this property, they were paupers; I did not inquire—I did not know how they got their living—they were not able to pay me, except through Newhall, who advanced the money for the purpose—I do not think we had required to be paid for what we had done before that time; I will not swear we had not, without referring to my memoran<lb></lb>dum—I did not at that time know that they were in such very needy cir<lb></lb>cumstances; I knew the prisoner himself was in difficulties—I knew that he had been obliged to quit the house at Camberwell, that there were proceed<lb></lb>ings at law against him, and that there were overdue and unpaid bills against him; I knew that, at the time of the execution of the deed, but previously I had known nothing whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, under these circumstances, knowing him to be in difficulties and necessities, and this woman to be unprotected, and acting for both, think that he was a fit man to have so important a trust as that reposed in him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If their statements were right, and their figures, she was giving him very little; there was very little surplus made out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was she to give him anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was the mortgage; in fact, the property was worth very little; in fact, she knew so much about it that she wished to get rid of it; there was the possibility of her being made a party to a Chancery suit; there was a mortgage of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and a legal debt of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, on this very property, and a Chancery suit going on at the time, and Mr. Kirk had been endeavouring to find her out to cite her, and make her a party to the suit, which she was desirous of avoiding; therefore we considered that the prisoner was taking but very little under this deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go through this case with Miss Constable and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I read it through, and on the information I received as to the morning of the 30th, I wrote this on the margin—Miss Constable did not deny the accuracy of any of the statements in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you acquainted with the handwriting of Mrs. Blackwell?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think I have ever seen her write, or the prisoner—this case, and the opinion, were read over to Miss Constable.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN</hi>. I am the attesting witness to this deed; I saw Miss Constable execute it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOYS</hi>. Was this deed with the blanks in it, with the signa<lb></lb>tures and the attestation, ever drawn to Miss Constable's attention? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware that it was—there were two other deeds in her favour, exe<lb></lb>cuted, I think, in Feb.—her attention was called generally to deeds—I never called her attention to the fact, that as this was a deed executed by her father on the day before, or the very day of his death, whether she recollected the transaction, or who were present—I never anticipated any inquiry of this kind—I cannot say exactly which told me, but I collected from them that it was the 30th—in the case of a will I should ask whether it was executed on the very day of the man's death—the only question about this deed was the date of it—it was in blank—it had no date; and of course that was the subject of conversation, and the effect of that deed with the two others—I do not re<lb></lb>collect that I asked whether the prisoner had ever seen either of the subscrib<lb></lb>ing parties at the time—before this second deed was executed I had reason to believe that the prisoner had seen Miss Constable and her father before the beginning of the year 1841—it did not occur to me that I was making at deed in favour of the prisoner, who was the attesting witness of the other deed, in favour of Stanley, because he was interested under Stanley's will.</p>

               <p>for some pictures, which I paid to a man at Kennington, named Boswell, and took his receipt for it—"Cash advanced to Richard Constable, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he did not want any such cash—he had enough of his own, and Stanley was not in a condition to lend it him, if he had wanted it—"Labourer's wages, from June 26th, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was paid by Mr. Freeman, of Cole<lb></lb>man-street—it was deducted from the rent, therefore my father could not owe it him; and the gardener likewise; Mr. Freeman told me himself that he had paid the gardener, and deducted it from the rent that was due to us, consequently it was not paid by Stanley—"for hay-making, during the years 1838, 1839, and 1840, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he sold a stack of hay that belonged to as for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he never accounted—he sold the grass, on the land for fourteen guineas, and supposing that the hay-stack was where I left it, I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay it last season, therefore he had no claim to make for hay-making—"Mr. Clark, for churning utensils, ten guineas"—that was a man in Fleet-street—I paid him, and have oil receipt for it—he did not know Stanley, and I believe never saw him in his life—"Paid Sutoliffe and Birch, on Constable's account, 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he borrowed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Birch, and I think Mr. Birch said he returned it to him—there is not one farthing that is owing to Stanley—I do not know in whose handwriting this account is—no part of this paper was ever read out to me at the prisoner's house at Camber-well—I never saw it till I came into Court to-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Boys has said that your attention was called to the amount due, namely, 1,109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. therein stated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beg Mr. Boys's pardon—I never had my attention called to any such thing—this case was never shown or read to me by Mr. Boys—I never had any case shown to me there—he never called my attention to his having taken counsel's opinion respecting the new deed—I dare say I should not have understood it if he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner ever state in your presence and that of Mr. Boys, that the deed which is now called forged, was executed on the 30th of Dec.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I can truly swear, that I never heard the prisoner mention my father's name in any way in his life—I never gave Mr. Boys to understand that the first deed was executed on the 30th of Dec.—I could not have told him so, nor should I have suffered such a statement to have passed unnoticed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This confirmation deed which you executed, conveys to the executor and executrix of Stanley, all the property, to pay the supposed creditors of your father, and states that his estate is indebted 1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd to Stanley's executors; was that explained to you by Mr. Boys? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had no explanation of the kind—I never entered into it—it was never suggested to me, or ever sus<lb></lb>pected—it was given to the prisoner under a very different impression—I agreed to make it over to him under a very different impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the expectation held out to you to make over the pro<lb></lb>perty to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he would give me a deed of annuity of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, that he would clear the estate of the incumbrances bearing on it of 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, and Mr. Parker's bill of costs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you not, when executing the deed, to say, "I see nothing about this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year that I am to have?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not read tie deed my<lb></lb>self, nor did I hear it read, except a small part, which took a very short time, and on hearing Miss Black well's name I objected to it—I omitted to state when I was in the witness-box before, that on my calling at the prisoner's, at the time Mr. Newhall was there, the prisoner took an opportunity of telling me that Mr. Newhall was a man of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and was the gentleman who was to advance the money from the City, to clear the incumbrances, and he was rather doubtful of my communicating with Mr. Newhall—Mr. Newhall left the house with me, and the prisoner requested that if he inquired where I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300252"></xptr>
               <p>lived, to tell him that I lived at Brompton, but he did not make such an in<lb></lb>quiry—while I was there Mrs. Black well just put her head into the room, and called her husband into the passage, and I heard her request him not to allow Mr. Newhall to make out the sums to be entered in the deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he was preparing some deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He took a little side of a note or something of that kind from his pocket, and a pencil, and the prisoner and he had a conversation as to the amount that ought to be entered in the deed to make it valid—this account was not produced to me—it was a small piece of paper much less than this—this was not produced to me as the result of any memorandum made—Newhall was taking some step to suggest a sum to be put in the deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you understand, any sum at all was to be put in the deed for, unless your father's estate was indebted to Stanley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I under<lb></lb>stood that the deed of reversion, that had been prepared for the Thompson family by Mr. Birch was not available, because it showed no money for consi<lb></lb>deration, and Mr. Newhall said that that was an evil that must be guarded against in preparing the one that was to be given to the prisoner—I was told it was necessary to introduce a consideration—I did not understand that the introduction of that consideration pledged me to pay a debt—no debt was ex<lb></lb>plained to me, or such a thing suggested—I thought it was a merely nominal thing, that it was for the sake of validity, and I was the more, confirmed in that by asking a friend, what would be the fate of a deed that showed no money consideration, and he said it would be valueless—I was not aware that the sum to be inserted in the deed was to go into the pocket of Stanley's executors—I heard no more about it, and I did not know it was inserted, or that any thing more was said on the subject—the estate was in a most ruinous condition, in consequence of the prisoner not having earned ont the views he proposed, and no money I am sure had been raised on it, except by selling hay and grass, and what would raise a little ready money, or perhaps the fur<lb></lb>niture—his proposal was that it should not be sold—I did not understand the operation of the deed which I was called upon to execute—I did not know that I was making an absolute conveyance of all my property to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why were you to have 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year by way of annuity, if it was of no benefit to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was then at his own option to do as he pleased—he could sell it if he pleased, but he did not bold out that view to me—he said he had the means of turning it into the same comfortable residence it had been, for himself—he was to have it if he had given me the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and fulfilled his other engagements—I did not dispute that at all—if he had paid me my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and discharged the estate from its incumbrances, I meant him to have the property, and I did not consider he would be very greatly advantaged—he has never paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of any thing—he has suffered every thing to go to ruin and destruction—I imagined that the debt of 1109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was only a consideration to give validity to the deed—I did not understand that it meant to appropriate that as a supposed debt to Stanley—I never had that pointed out to me.</p>

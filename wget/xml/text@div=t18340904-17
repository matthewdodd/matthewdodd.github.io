               <p>Prisoner. Q. I was to tell him I was to take the mare to Smithfield, and offer it for sale, and if you were wanted, I was to come to the Ram Inn, and let you know? A. No; it is no such thing - I did not commission you to sell it - you brought it from the yard, but then you gave it to me before you got to the market; you brought it by my direction from Turk's Head-yard - when I left him in charge, I told him not to move from the spot till I returned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had it on the Friday before, and could not get the price for it. Witness. I never commissioned him to sell it - he held it on Friday night, while I went into a public-house to get something to drink - I did not tell the magistrate if he had brought me the money, I should have been satisfied - I never told him he might sell it for me.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in China-court, Lambeth-walk. I saw the prisoner in Smithfield on Friday, about half an hour before shutting-up time - I bought a bent-legged old hackney-coach mare of him in Smithfield - I asked him the price - he asked 45s. for it at first - I bid him 35s. - I then came round again, and bid him 2s. 6d. more - at last, I bought it for 2l., all but 1s. - I sold it to Mr. Hadden, the horse-slaughterer, for 2l. 2s. before I had it two minutes - it was about fifteen hands and an inch high - the prisoner told me that he came from Red Lion-yard, Warner-street - but he did not tell me any name - that is where the prosecutor lives - he told me he dared not take under 2l. for it.</p>

            . I am a licensed horse-slaughterer - I bought a mare of Mills, on the 20th of June, for 40s. - I took it home - it was a bay mare, fifteen hands high, with a star white nose, and two white legs behind, and a switch tail.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HURRELL re-examined. That answers the description of my mare, in every respect - it was not good for much but to kill.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure you had not employed him to sell the animal, if he could meet with a purchaser at 2l.? A. No; I had not authorized him at all - I never told him what I would take for it - he might have heard, but not from me - I should have taken that sum for it - he never sold a horse for me, nor ever assisted me in making a sale.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner had put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had employed him to sell the horse, which having done, he went to a public-house with the purchaser, and got intoxicated; that he lost the money, and was afraid to return; and that the prosecutor had employed him the week before to sell it for 50s.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HURRELL re-examined. I should have asked 50s. for it the week before, but nobody asked the price - I had not told the prisoner so, but he might have heard it from other horsekeepers in the yard - I brought it back myself the week before - the prisoner had not charge of it then, except for about ten minutes, while I went into a public-house - he had not led it to market the week before - I took it myself, and met him in Smithfield - I engaged him to look after it, while I went to get something to drink - I asked 40s. for it at the time in question.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mills heard the prosecutor say he would have been satisfied if I had brought him the 40s. Prosecutor. I never said so, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MILLS re-examined. I heard the prosecutor say he would have taken 40s. for it, if the prisoner had brought it - I bought it in Smithfield, nearly two hours after the prisoner had sold it.</p>
